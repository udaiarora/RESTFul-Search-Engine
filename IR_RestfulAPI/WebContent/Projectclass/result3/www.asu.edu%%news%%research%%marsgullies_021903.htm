      <h2>ASU Mars discovery links melting snow to gullies</h2>
      <p><img src="research_images/marsgullies1.jpg" width="300" height="243" align="right">Images 
        from the visible light camera on NASA's Mars Odyssey spacecraft, combined 
        with images from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor, suggest melting snow is 
        the likely cause of the numerous eroded gullies first documented on Mars 
        in 2000 by Global Surveyor.</p>
      <p>The now-famous martian gullies were created by trickling water from melting 
        snow packs, not underground springs or pressurized flows, as had been 
        previously suggested, argues Dr. Philip Christensen, the principal investigator 
        for Odyssey's camera system and a professor from Arizona State University 
        in Tempe. He proposes gullies are carved by water melting and flowing 
        beneath snow packs, where it is sheltered from rapid evaporation in the 
        planet's thin atmosphere. His paper is in the electronic February 19 issue 
        of Nature.</p>
      <p>Looking at an image of an impact crater in the southern mid-latitudes 
        of Mars, Christensen noted eroded gullies on the crater's cold, pole-facing 
        northern wall and immediately next to them a section of what he calls 
        &quot;pasted-on terrain.&quot; Such unique terrain represents a smooth 
        deposit of material that Mars researchers have concluded is &quot;volatile&quot; 
        (composed of materials that evaporate in the thin Mars atmosphere), because 
        it characteristically occurs only in the coldest, most sheltered areas. 
        The most likely composition of this slowly evaporating material is snow. 
        Christensen suspected a special relationship between the gullies and the 
        snow.</p>
      <p><img src="research_images/marsgullies3.jpg" width="207" height="300" align="left">&quot;The 
        Odyssey image shows a crater on the pole-facing side has this 'pasted-on' 
        terrain, and as you come around to the west there are all these gullies,&quot; 
        said Christensen. &quot;I saw it and said 'Ah-ha!' It looks for all the 
        world like these gullies are being exposed as this terrain is being removed 
        through melting and evaporation.&quot;</p>
      <p>Eroded gullies on martian crater walls and cliff sides were first observed 
        in images taken by Mars Global Surveyor in 2000. There have been other 
        scientific theories offered to explain gully formation on Mars, including 
        seeps of ground water, pressurized flows of ground water (or carbon dioxide), 
        and mudflows caused by collapsing permafrost deposits, but no explanation 
        to date has been universally accepted. The scientific community has remained 
        puzzled, yet has been eagerly pursuing various possibilities. </p>
      <p>&quot;The gullies are very young,&quot; Christensen said. &quot;That's 
        always bothered me, because how is it that Mars has groundwater close 
        enough to the surface to form these gullies, and yet the water has stuck 
        around for billions of years? Second, you have craters with rims that 
        are raised, and the gullies go almost to the crest of the rim. If it's 
        a leaking subsurface aquifer, there's not much subsurface up there. And, 
        finally, why do they occur preferentially on the cold face of the slope 
        at mid-latitudes? If it's melting groundwater causing the flow, that's 
        the coldest place, and the least likely place for that to happen.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>Christensen points out that finding water erosion under melting snow 
        deposits answers many of these problems, &quot;Snow on Mars is most likely 
        to accumulate on the pole-facing slopes, the coldest areas. It accumulates 
        and drapes the landscape in these areas during one climate period, and 
        then it melts during a warmer one. Melting begins first in the most exposed 
        area right at the crest of the ridge. This explains why gullies start 
        so high up.&quot; Once he started to think about snow, Christensen began 
        finding a large number of other images showing a similar relationship 
        between &quot;pasted on&quot; snow deposits and gullies in the high resolution 
        images taken by the camera on Global Surveyor. Yet it was the unique mid-range 
        resolution of the visible light camera in Mars Odyssey's thermal emission 
        imaging system that was critical for the insight, because of its wide 
        field of view. </p>
      <p><img src="research_images/marsgulllies2.jpg" width="206" height="300" align="right">&quot;It 
        was almost like finding a Rosetta Stone. The basic idea comes out of having 
        a regional view, which Odyssey's camera system gives. It's a kind of you-can't-see-the 
        forest-for-the-trees problem. An Odyssey image made it all suddenly click, 
        because the resolution was high enough to identify these features and 
        yet low enough to show their relationship to each other in the landscape,&quot; 
        he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Christensen's new hypothesis was made possible by NASA's tandem 
        of science orbiters currently laying the groundwork for locating the most 
        interesting areas for future surface exploration by roving laboratories, 
        such as the Mars Exploration Rovers, scheduled for launch in May and June 
        of this year,&quot; said Dr. Jim Garvin, NASA's lead scientist for Mars 
        Exploration in Washington, D.C. </p>
