      <h2>Rowe's IT expertise a plus for computing institute </h2>
      <p>Looking to further the ability to connect researchers with computing resources and build interdisciplinary research connections, ASU's Institute for Computing and Information Sciences and Engineering (InCISE) has added Jeremy Rowe of ASU Information Technology to serve as its associate director. </p>
      <p>InCISE was established in 2003, and serves as ASU's primary institute for interdisciplinary computer science and information technology research. Rowe, director of IT Research, Strategic Planning, and Policy, will work directly with InCISE Director Sethuraman "Panch" Panchanathan, chairman of the Computer Science and Engineering Department in the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering. </p>
      <p>"Jeremy Rowe brings the expertise of infrastructure from an IT point of view, as well as engagement with interdisciplinary research," says Panchanathan. "I am delighted to have him as a part of InCISE and confident in his abilities and expertise." </p>
      <p>"Jeremy Rowe combines broad information science and technology expertise with an unusual ability to clearly explain the technical aspects of computing," says Jonathan Fink, vice president for Research and Economic Affairs. "He has been helping Panch and others set InCISE's interdisciplinary agenda from its outset. Appointing him as InCISE associate director assures that the new institute will evolve into a very successful entity." </p>
      <p>Built upon a core of the Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing, Information Assurance, Intelligent Information Integration, the Partnership for Research in Spatial Modeling (PRISM) and the ASU Software Factory, InCISE fosters interdisciplinary collaborations, entrepreneurship and industry partnerships. Affiliated research groups include the Center for Research in Arts, Media and Engineering (AME), Center for Advancing Business through Information Technology (CABIT), and the Consortium for Embedded and Internetworking Technologies (CEINT). </p>
      <p>"We are expanding the horizons of the basic pillars of computing," says Panchanathan. "We are drawing together all of the computing domains and providing an opportunity for collaboration and new creative thinking." </p>
      <p>Housed in ASU's Brickyard complex, InCISE reports to the Vice President for Research and Economic Affairs. </p>
      <p>"InCISE is our attempt to greatly leverage early investments of Proposition 301 funds into various information science and technology applications," says Fink. "It pulls together several of our most creative research groups and centers into the fertile environment of the Brickyard. We have high expectations that these research groups will be able to flourish like never before thanks to their proximity to each other and access to a large pool of computer science and engineering students." </p>
      <p>Rowe, a researcher within PRISM, will help Panchanathan further a partnership between InCISE and IT. The goal is to help connect researchers with campus computing resources, making sure the needed resources are available to researchers in any area and that the resources are being utilized. </p>
      <p>"InCISE has a much different profile than other institutes of this nature nationally," Rowe says. "We are pulling together long-established research groups, and working to build informatics connections with discipline researchers. The impact we are going to have will be unique, and will be extremely important to the university." </p>
      <p>As director of IT Research, Strategic Planning and Policy since 1994, Rowe is in charge of developing special projects for the Vice Provost for Information Technologies such as strategic planning related to instructional technologies. </p>
      <p>Previously, Rowe worked with University Libraries and Media Systems from 1982 - 94, including serving as head of media development from 1988 - 94. He holds an Ed.D. in educational policy and administration with an emphasis on higher education, M.A. in educational technology/audiovisual education, and a B.S. in psychology, all from ASU. </p>
      <p>Campbell, with Media Relations &amp; Public Information, can be reached at (480) 965-7209 or (garycamp@asu.edu). </p>
