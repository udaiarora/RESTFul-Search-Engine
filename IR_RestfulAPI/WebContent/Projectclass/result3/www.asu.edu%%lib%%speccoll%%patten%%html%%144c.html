The legend of the mandrake plant was
 still very prevalent in the 15th century.  The mandrake
 plant was regarded by the ancients as both magical and
 medicinal.  Some writers suggested that it could be fatal
 to the gatherer unless it was harvested according to a
 prescribed ritual.  The roots of the mandrake were supposed
 to be shaped like a fully formed, miniature human body which
 would emit a tiny scream when uprooted.  Although many writers
 expressed doubts about this legend, artists frequently gave
 a stylized human form to illustrations of this plant.
  Disreputable herbalists took advantage of the expectations
 of a gullible public and sold appropriately crafted root
 plants as "mandrakes."  In the mid-15th century William
 Turner fought against such superstitions in science,
 denouncing the myth of the mandrake root, specimens of which
 "come to be sold in England in boxes, with heir and such
 forme as a man hath, are nothyng elles but folish feined
 trifles, and not natural.  For they are so trymmed of crafty
 theves to mocke the poore people with all, and to rob them
 both of theyr wit and theyr money."  The legend lingered for
 Gerard to decry again in the 16th century.
