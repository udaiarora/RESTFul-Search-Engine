             <h3><a name="Setup"></a>Setting Up the BlackBerry Device</h3>
             <p><strong>Getting Started: </strong>Please use this checklist to make sure you have all the devices and services to enable your BlackBerry device. If you have already set up your BlackBerry device and you want to change how it works, please refer to our Configuring BlackBerry Desktop Manager section. If you are experiencing problems with the device or the software, please check our Troubleshooting section.</p>
             <p><strong>Checklist:</strong> Obtain a BlackBerry from a 3rd party reseller. You must have a wireless service plan for the device. You need an Exchange account in the ASU Active Directory Domain. To redirect email to your BlackBerry using the BlackBerry Enterprise Server, you need to purchase a Client Access License from the Customer Assistance Center. See <a href="../blackberry.htm#Proc">procedures for getting a device</a> for more detail.</p>
             <p><strong>Register your BlackBerry Device:</strong> (<strong style="color: red;">NOTE: This must be done prior to choosing 'Enterprise Activation'</strong>.) If you have not done so, on your BlackBerry device, go to Options icon from the Home Screen (wrench icon) -&gt; Host Routing Table &gt; Click the trackwheel and choose &quot;Register Now&quot;. A few seconds after you send the request for registration, you will get a message saying your BlackBerry has been registered provided you are in the wireless coverage area. <strong>Verizon</strong> devices require you call *228 and the follow the instructions given. (This is even if you did not opt for cellular service for your device.) </p>
             <p><strong>Enterprise Activation:</strong> After the device has been registered on the provider's network, you can enable your device to synchronize with your ASU Exchange account. Upon purchasing a client access license and being added to the BlackBerry Enterprise Server, you will receive an email message from &quot;BlackBerry Service&quot; that reads:</p>
             <blockquote>
               <strong><em>[Your Name],</em></strong><br/>
               <em><strong>To activate your wireless handheld device please go to Options/Enterprise Activation, type in your eMail address and the following password:</strong></em> <em><strong>XXX000xxx</strong></em>
             </blockquote>
             <p>The password is case sensitive and must be entered exactly as sent. Your email address is your official ASU smtp address used by the exchange servers. If you have problems with Enterprise Activation, please send a note to email-q@asu.edu so an administrator can reset your activation password.</p>
             <h3><a name="IDM"></a>Installing BlackBerry Desktop Manager</h3>
             <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
               <ul>
                 <li>You need to be part of the Local Administrators group on your desktop or laptop to install and run the Blackberry Desktop Manager software. If you do not have administrative privileges on the computer you will be using to sync your blackberry, please contact your network administrator.</li>
                 <li>Have Microsoft Outlook (Not Outlook Express) installed and know your Profile name (this is important when your desktop being used for multiple profiles).</li>
                 <li>Configure Microsoft Outlook to check your Exchange account before using BlackBerry Desktop Manager. If you do not have this set up yet, you may need to contact your network administrator.</li>
               </ul>
             <p><strong>Installation:</strong> Insert the BlackBerry Desktop Manager CD that was provided when you purchased your BlackBerry. If the software setup does not open automatically, please go to My Computer, find your CD-ROM drive, and find the file &quot;setup.exe.&quot; Double-click this file. During the process of the install, it will uninstall any previous versions of BlackBerry Desktop Manager that you have installed previously. During the installation, select the following options: </p>
             <ul>
               <li>Microsoft Exchange (typically used with Microsoft Outlook client).</li>
               <li>Redirect email using the BlackBerry Enterprise Server.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>After installing your software, make sure you connect your cradle to your computer, and dock your BlackBerry device to the cradle. Start your BlackBerry Desktop Manager. It should automatically detect your device when you first start the software. If your software has problems finding your device, please refer to our Troubleshooting section.</p>
             <h3><a name="DM"></a>Configuring BlackBerry Desktop Manger</h3>
             <p><strong>Encryption Key Configuration:</strong> Open up BlackBerry Desktop Manager. Double click on Redirector Settings, and select the &quot;Security&quot; tab. Select &quot;Generate keys automatically&quot;, and click on the Generate button. Follow the instructions on the screen to generate the keys. Wait until the Status changes to &quot;Generated&quot;. Then click &quot;OK&quot;.</p>
             <p><strong>Configuring filters on BlackBerry:</strong> If you have not already done so, open up BlackBerry Desktop Manager, then double click on Redirector Settings, and select the &quot;Filters&quot; tab. Here you can add various filters so that you can filter specific messages to your blackberry. If you want all the messages to get to your blackberry, uncheck all the filters that do not say &quot;Forward&quot;, then select: when none of the rules apply, &quot;forward the messages to the handheld.&quot; The most common configuration is to leave &quot;To &amp; BCC Default&quot; and &quot;CC Default&quot; checked on. </p>
             <p><strong>Syncing your calendar, contacts, tasks, and memo's to your BlackBerry:</strong> Put your BlackBerry on the cradle. Open up BlackBerry Desktop Manager. Double click on Intellisync. Click on the &quot;Configure PIM&quot; button. Here you can choose which features of Exchange syncs with your BlackBerry. If you do not get this screen and get an error message saying the path does not exist, please refer to our Troubleshooting section.</p>
             <p>After checking on a check box, it will ask you to choose a translator. Choose MS Outlook 97/98/2000/XP/2003 for Address Book, Memopad, and Tasks (<strong>if</strong> you are enabling these Outlook features on your BlackBerry handheld). </p>
             <p>To enable wireless calendaring, when choosing the translator for the calendar, choose MS Outlook Wireless Sync (aka BlackBerry Wireless Sync). You <em>can</em> alternatively select MS Outlook 97/98/2000/XP/2003 for the calendar's translator if you want to disable over-the-air (OTA) calendar option, but sync your calendar through the cradle.</p>
             <p>After you've OK'd out of the &quot;Choose Translator&quot; and &quot;Handheld XXXXXXXX Configuration&quot;, in the Intellisync window, with the device attached to the cradle, click on &quot;Synchronize Now&quot; to begin the synchronization of any of the features you chose to synchronize. </p>
             <p>You're done! If everything is set up properly, your BlackBerry should now be able to send and receive messages. Try sending a test message to yourself. You should be able to receive the message within a minute.</p>
             <h3><a name="Work"></a>How does it work?</h3>
             <p><img src="img/bes_exchange_architecture.gif" width="500" height="222"></p>
             <p>Your device is connected through various wireless networks: RIM devices obtain their wireless connection through the Mobitex network while Vendor specific devices generally run through the GPRS, CDMA, and iDEN networks. This connection then passes through ASU's network directly into the Blackberry Enterprise Server (called the BES). Our BES has a direct constant connection to our Exchange servers where your device then accesses your personal mailbox, calendar, tasks and memo's. </p>
