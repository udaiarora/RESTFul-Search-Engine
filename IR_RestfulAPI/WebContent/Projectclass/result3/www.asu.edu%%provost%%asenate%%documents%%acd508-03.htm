Promotions occur in this sequence: assistant, associate, and senior or full.
(?Senior? may be used in science and technology areas, while ?full,? usually

professionals, whether on probationary, continuing, or year-to-year

<p>Only those on probationary status are eligible to apply for continuing
appointment. At the university level, there is no specified correlation between
the awarding of promotion and the awarding of continuing appointment. Promotion
and continuing appointment can be applied for either in the same or different
years unless unit criteria dictate that they must be applied for concurrently. </p>

<p>The purpose of continuing appointment is to reward excellence and to provide
academic professionals with job security and annual reappointment until
retirement, resignation, release for budgetary reasons, release for reasons of
educational policy change, or dismissal for cause. Attainment of continuing
appointment can occur only through specific notification from the president and
may not result from inaction or inadvertence. It can be granted only to

Recommendations from grievances are forwarded to the president of the
university, who makes the final decision on the grievance. </p>

<p>In some cases, depending on related prior experience and education, the
hiring official, upon consultation with the executive vice president and
provost of the university and appropriate personnel in the hiring unit, may
waive the probationary period and grant continuing appointment at the time of
hire. When this is done, the chair of the unit and the supervising dean will
provide written documentation to the vice provost that they have consulted with
appropriate peer-review committees. </p>

<p>All academic professionals appointed to this initial rank must meet the
minimum criteria for appointment as defined at the unit level (?unit? refers to
the supervising department or, in some cases, the supervising college or
center). Under ordinary circumstances, an academic professional would be
expected to have earned an advanced degree or to have acquired a high level of
the particular skill needed for the position. As assistant academic
professionals gain experience, they are expected to improve their job
performance and demonstrate growth and involvement in professional areas as
well as in university service. </p>

burden of proof to show that they have reached the level of accomplishment
specified in their unit?s documents describing criteria for promotion.
Individuals who feel they have reached that level of accomplishment prior to
their sixth year may apply early.</p>

<p><b>Associate</b><span style='font-weight:normal'> </span></p>

<p>Academic professionals appointed to or promoted to this rank must exceed the
criteria for initial appointment to the rank of assistant academic
professional. They must have attained considerable expertise in the areas of
competence required by their jobs and should be able to function autonomously.
Associate academic professionals must demonstrate excellence in their job
performance and must continue to demonstrate professional growth and
involvement in university and community service. </p>

<p>The system is designed to accommodate successful careers at the associate
level, and a person at the associate level need never apply for promotion to
the full or senior level. </p>

<p><b>Full or Senior</b><span style='font-weight:normal'> </span></p>

<p>Academic professionals appointed to or promoted to this rank must exceed the
criteria for associate academic professionals and must have substantial
professional experience and education, including advanced training and,
typically, an appropriate terminal degree or other evidence of superior skills
as outlined in the unit?s criteria. Academic professionals at this level must
demonstrate a high level of competence and should be considered experts in
their chosen fields. Both the professional development and the service
activities of academic professionals must involve sharing knowledge and
experience with others by providing substantial guidance and leadership in areas
of professional or academic interest. </p>

<p>Although there is no set time line for promotion from associate to full or
senior rank, it would be unusual for an individual to accumulate the expected
record of accomplishment without working for several years at the associate
level. </p>

<p>In addition to a designation of rank, academic professionals have job titles
that are used to describe individual assignments. These job titles are selected
at the unit level from a list provided by the Office of the Executive Vice
President and Provost of the University. The designations of ?assistant,?
?associate,? ?senior? or ?full? (usually not stated) are used as modifiers in
front of job titles. Academic professionals may also have administrative
appointments, but these titles are supplementary to basic academic professional
job titles. </p>

Continuing Appointment</b></span> </p>

<p><b>Establishing Written Criteria and Procedures for Review</b><span
style='font-weight:normal'> </span></p>

<p>Decisions on retention, continuing appointment, and promotion shall be based
on written criteria and procedures developed within each college, the
University Libraries, and each branch campus employing academic professionals. Unit
criteria must require recommendations from peer-review committees at the
college level, and optionally at the department level, if there are more than
five academic professionals employed by a department. Unit administrators have
the responsibility of working closely with their academic professionals when
written criteria and procedures are developed. The procedures must be accepted
by a two-thirds majority of the academic professionals in a unit and must also
be approved by the dean and the executive vice president and provost of the
university at each campus. </p>

<p><b>Evaluating Progress and Performance</b><span style='font-weight:normal'> </span></p>

<p>Successful progress toward promotion and toward continuing appointment (for <a
href="../../../../acd002.html#ProbationaryAppointments">probationary</a> <a
href="../../../../acd002.html#employees">employees</a>) is demonstrated by the
progressive mastery of the skills, knowledge, and understanding necessary to
discharge one?s responsibilities at the highest possible level. The award of
promotion and/or continuing appointment requires excellent performance along
with the promise of continued excellence. Performance will be evaluated during
the probationary period through annual evaluations (see <a
href="../../../../acd506-08.html">ACD 506?08</a>, ?Annual and Probationary
Evaluations for Academic Professionals?) and in the second and fourth years,
through more extensive pre-continuing-appointment reviews conducted under the
direction of the executive vice president and provost of the university and
including additional levels of peer and administrative evaluation. </p>

<p><b>Job Performance, Professional Development and Contribution, and Service
as Criteria for Review</b><span style='font-weight:normal'> </span></p>

<p>Specific categories to be considered and included in college documents
outlining the criteria for retention, continuing appointment, and promotion are
job performance, professional development and contribution, and service. </p>

<p>Due to the variety of academic professional duties and responsibilities,
both the unit document and individual goals and objectives determine the scope
and appropriate category for specific activities. For example, a given academic
professional may have teaching and research as a primary role; these activities
would then fall within the category of job performance. For others, such
activities may be supplementary to other tasks and would therefore fall within
the category of professional development and contribution. </p>

<p>Unit procedures should define the expectations of the unit and illustrate
how the academic professional can successfully earn the award of promotion
and/or continuing appointment. Unit procedures should also clarify how the
results of academic professionals? second- and fourth-year pre-continuation
reviews will be incorporated in promotion and/or continuing appointment
decisions. </p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'><b>Continuing Appointment and Review Committees</b></span>
</p>

<p>To ensure peer review, as mandated by the Board of Regents, each college
employing one or more academic professionals must establish a peer-review
committee. Departments or centers with more than five academic professional
employees should also establish a peer-review committee at that level. </p>

<p>Because of the differences in the roles that academic professionals fill and
the differences in the numbers of academic professionals in various colleges,
each college may determine the makeup of its peer-review committee, which may
include faculty and staff members as well as academic professionals. Colleges
with very few academic professionals may combine their efforts and form a
multi-college peer-review committee. Neither peer-review committee members nor
administrators can act as evaluators for the same individual at more than one level
in the process. </p>

<p>Academic professional peer-review committees will act on applications for
continuing appointment and/or promotion, as well as on the probationary reviews
conducted in the second and fourth years, and on sabbatical applications from academic
professionals. The makeup and working procedures of these standing committees
should be described as part of the department and college procedures. </p>

<p>The executive vice president and provost of the university will appoint a
University Committee on Academic Professional Promotion and Continuing
Appointment to offer advice regarding the granting of continuing appointment
and/or promotion. This committee will be a standing committee composed of one
representative with continuing appointment selected from the academic
professionals employed within each college, the University Libraries, and each
branch campus. The committee will be chaired by the assistant vice president
for academic personnel and will be selected and will serve in a fashion
comparable to that of the University Promotion and Tenure Committee. </p>

<p>Review committees at all levels will examine promotion and/or continuation
applications for compliance with review procedures and for content.
Recommendations will be made by evaluating the academic professional?s
accomplishments using the unit?s criteria, the job description, and the
supporting documents provided by the candidate, the outside evaluators, <a
href="../../../../acd002.html#supervisingadministrator">supervising
administrators</a>, and other committees. </p>

</span><![endif]>denied continuing appointment.</p>

<p>An individual denied continuing appointment in the sixth year will receive a
terminal contract for the seventh year. With an early application (prior to the
sixth year of employment), a denial of continuing appointment will not
necessarily result in a terminal contract, although a recommendation for a
terminal contract can be made at any time during the probationary period, based
on cumulative evidence from performance reviews (see <a

Evaluations for Academic Professionals?). </p>

<p>The denial of continuing appointment or retention should not be construed as
the result of the candidate?s failure or poor performance. Considerations such
as the need for a different area of specialization or for a new emphasis, or
the need to shift a position or resources to another program, may dictate that
the individual not be retained. Anyone receiving a negative decision on
continuing appointment or retention is entitled, upon request to the executive
vice president and provost of the university, to a written statement of the
reasons for the denial. </p>

</p>

<p>Continuing appointment and promotion processes follow the ?Schedule of
Personnel Actions? distributed annually by the Office of the Executive Vice
President and Provost of the University. The same materials will be required
for academic professionals and faculty, with the exception that the letters of
reference for academic professionals may come from within ASU, whereas all
letters for faculty (other than those in the internal chain of review) must
come from outside ASU. In order to give the reviewer an opportunity to develop
a quality response, all reviewers shall be given at least 30 <a
href="../../../../acd002.html#day">days</a> to respond. See <a
href="../../../../acd506-07.html">ACD 506-07</a>, ?Evaluation for Tenure and
Promotion,? for information on how letters of reference are to be solicited.
Only deans, department chairs, and center directors are authorized to represent
the institution in requesting such letters. </p>

<p>Review for continuing appointment and/or promotion involves multiple levels
of evaluation. This broad base provides a mechanism for ensuring quality
control and provides checks and balances for perceived biases at one or more
levels. The academic professional?s request for continuing appointment and/or
promotion moves through these levels unless, after consultation with the unit
director or dean, the academic professional requests that the application be
withdrawn. </p>

<p>The order of review of a continuing appointment and/or promotion application
is as follows. The application moves: </p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>from
     the academic professional and his or her supervisor (in consultation with
     the primary evaluator, if different) to a unit personnel review committee
     (this step may be skipped in units with fewer than five academic

</span><![endif]>from the University Academic Professional Promotion and
Continuing Appointment Committee to the provost of each campus.</p>

<p>The academic professional and the supervisor (in consultation with the
primary evaluator, if different) have the responsibility for ensuring that the
materials compiled for review are prepared in compliance with unit and
university policies and that the materials are complete. Each review committee
and each administrator adds an evaluative statement to the materials and
forwards them to the next level according to the yearly ?Schedule of Personnel
Actions,? distributed each summer by the vice provost. </p>

<p>Committee deliberations are confidential. The only people authorized to
discuss results are department chairs, center directors, and deans. If an
academic professional withdraws a request for promotion and/or continuing
appointment, the nonconfidential portions of the request package shall be
returned to the academic professional. Confidential materials will be placed in
the personnel file of the academic professional in the supervising dean?s
office. In these instances, nothing will be forwarded to the Office of the
Executive Vice President and Provost of the University, except in the final
year of a probationary appointment, when the request package must go forward
unless the candidate submits a resignation. </p>
