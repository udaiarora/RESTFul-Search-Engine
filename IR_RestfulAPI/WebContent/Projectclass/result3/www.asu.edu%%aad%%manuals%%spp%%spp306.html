Deans and directors are responsible for establishing work schedules that meet the service and work needs of their respective areas.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>University Business Hours</B></FONT><P>University business hours are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except for university holidays.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Standard Work Week</B></FONT><P>The standard work week for  <A HREF="spp002.html#nonexempt">nonexempt employees</A> is 40 hours and begins at 12:01 a.m. Monday and ends at 12:00 midnight Sunday.<P><B><A NAME="Alternative Work Schedules">Alternative Work Schedules</A></B><P> <A HREF="spp002.html#supervisor">Supervisors</A> may require that nonexempt employees work alternative work schedules to provide necessary support services to the university community, to expedite a unit&#146;s work flow, or to accommodate an individual employee&#146;s needs. Guidelines on alternative work schedules and time reporting for nonexempt employees are found in the <A HREF="hradvisor.html">HR Advisor</A>.<P>To make discretionary decisions requiring employees to work alternative work schedules, the supervisor must:<BR><P><OL><LI>obtain approval from the appropriate dean, director, or designee<P>and</LI><P><LI>ensure that the department is appropriately staffed during university business hours.</LI></OL><P><DL><DD><B>Examples</B></DD><P><DD>Examples of alternative and flexible work schedules include, but are not limited to:<BR><P><OL><LI>flexible work schedules (flextime) to accommodate employees when possible</LI><P><LI>working on weekends</LI><P><LI>working during second or third shifts during specific hours determined within the unit<P>and</LI><P><LI>working shifts with shortened lunch periods.</LI></OL></DD></DL><P><B>Changing an Employee&#146;s Work Schedule</B><P>A supervisor may change an employee&#146;s work schedule for periods of 30 days or more with a minimum of two weeks&#146; notice. A temporary change in work schedule of less than 30 days may be made with 24 hours&#146; notice. In an emergency, a supervisor may require that an employee change his or her work schedule without notice.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Alternate Work Arrangements</B></FONT><P>Supervisors may allow flexibility in work arrangements to support an individual employee&#146;s desire to maintain a balance between job and family. Alternate work arrangements are not intended to result in a need for additional employees or overtime.<P>The supervisor will follow the same discretionary decision steps as applied in the &#147;<A HREF="#Alternative Work Schedules">Alternative Work Schedules</A>&#148; when a request is received from an employee.<P><DL><DD><B>Examples</B></DD><P><DD>Examples of alternate work arrangements include, but are not limited to:<BR><P><OL><LI>job sharing&#151;two individuals negotiate an arrangement in which they continue to meet the duties and responsibilities of the position that would otherwise be met by one person</LI><P><LI>flexplace&#151;an employee enters into a mutual agreement with the supervisor where the greater majority of hours worked are on-site with some component(s) of the job done at home<P>and</LI><P><LI>telecommuting&#151;an employee maintains the duties and responsibilities of his/her position from the home environment with help from communication technology.</LI></OL><P>Examples of alternate work arrangements may also include but are not limited to:<BR><P><OL><LI>continuing part-time</LI><P><LI>seasonal</LI><P><LI>partial retirement<P>and</LI><P><LI>Flexible Employment Program (see <A HREF="spp214.html"> SPP 214</A>, &#147;Flexible Employment Program&#148;).</LI></OL></DD></DL><P>Alternate work arrangements shall not adversely affect the services that are provided to students, other departments, or the public. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring that the employee&#146;s job performance is not negatively affected.<P>Although departments are encouraged to make reasonable efforts to meet the employee&#146;s needs, an alternate work arrangement is a privilege. It is granted only when the change will not interfere with the efficient operation of the university and the employee&#146;s performance will not deteriorate. A department may discontinue, temporarily suspend, or alter the arrangement when the work needs change or if services are impaired. It is the university&#146;s exclusive decision to provide alternate work arrangements. This decision is not subject to the grievance procedure.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Meal Breaks</B></FONT><P>Employees are entitled to an unpaid meal break of at least 30 minutes each work day. Nonexempt employees must be completely relieved of work duties during the meal period for a meal break to be noncompensable.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Rest Periods</B></FONT><P>A nonexempt classified employee may take a paid rest period not to exceed 15 minutes for each four-hour work period.<P>Employees may not, unless specifically authorized by the supervisor, use rest periods to:<BR><P><OL><LI>cover late arrivals or early departures from the work station</LI><P><LI>extend the lunch period<P>or</LI><P><LI>accumulate leave time from one day to the next.</LI></OL><P>&#160;<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><HR><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">SPP</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | SPP&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="spp001.html">contact</A> | Human&#160;Resources&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="hr.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
