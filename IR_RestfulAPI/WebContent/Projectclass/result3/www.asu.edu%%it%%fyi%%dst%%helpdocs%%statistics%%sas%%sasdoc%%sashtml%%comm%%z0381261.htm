<P>Until the configuration is properly specified,
it can be difficult to establish communications within an SNA network, especially
for a host subarea peripheral node. To simplify troubleshooting, SAS/CONNECT
uses a convention for error handling that passes information to you to help
you debug your configuration.  This information includes operation codes,
return codes, and sense data, which is framed within the context of the function
the software is trying to perform. SAS/CONNECT does not attempt to interpret
this information.  Use this information to work with network systems and SAS
support personnel at your site to resolve the problem.
<P>Each message has the following format:  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = <I>program-name</I> 
opcode = <I>operation-code</I>
 prc = <I>primary-rc</I> src = <I>secondary-rc</I></PRE>
<P>where
<DL>
<DT>opcode</DT>
<DD>is the failing verb operation code.<P></DD>

<DT>prc</DT>
<DD>is the primary return code.<P></DD>

<DT>src</DT>
<DD>is the secondary return code. When an allocation error occurs
(


<CODE><B>prc=0003</B></CODE>), the 


<CODE><B>src</B></CODE> field contains the necessary SNA sense data.<P></DD>

<P>For more information about these fields, see
<A href="z2config.htm#zppcrefs">References</A>.
<P>
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most failures are caused by configuration or network setup
errors, or they occur because the application that you are attempting to communicate

has failed because the application does not have an active control session
with VTAM (the host APPL/ACB is not OPEN).  Ask your systems administrator
why the partner LU (the value for the REMOTE= option) is not active.

may be invalid or one or both of the fields may have been omitted and the
remote partner requires them. Find out if your system is case sensitive; if
so, use the appropriate case and enclose both the userid and password in quotation
marks.

that the transaction program name specified by the FMH-5 Attach command was

FMH-5 Attach command was not recognized by the receiver. This may occur if
the SASRMT transaction program is not
properly defined at the remote system, or there was a failure in the initialization
of the environment within which the transaction program was to run. It might
also occur because you failed to supply an uppercase userid when you tried
to perform a SAS/CONNECT signon to
a CMS host.  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure:

<P>An ALLOCATE request (


<CODE><B>opcode = 0100</B></CODE>) has failed with an ALLOCATION_ERROR
(


<CODE><B>prc = 0003</B></CODE>). The 


<CODE><B>src</B></CODE> in this case has been overridden by sense data 


<CODE><B>08970015</B></CODE>, which indicates that a session initiation request has been received
for an independent LU that has not been defined to the destination VTAM. If <B>appc.luname</B> is not specified, SAS/CONNECT uses CP_ALIAS by default.
To avoid this problem, use the APPC_LUNAME environment variable to specify
a local LU alias that is also defined to the destination VTAM.  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASRMT 
opcode = 0100   prc = 0003  src = 00821002.</PRE>
<P>An ALLOCATE request (

(


<CODE><B>prc = 0003</B></CODE>). The src in this case has been overridden by sense data 


<CODE><B>00821002</B></CODE>, which indicates that the mode name that was specified to present
session parameters to the remote LU is not defined to the remote LU. The OS/2
to remote-host-connection communications mode defaults to SASAPPC. To circumvent
the problem, use the APPC_LU62MODE environment variable to specify a correctly
defined mode name that is known to both the local and remote LUs.  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure:
 transaction program = SASRMT 
opcode = 0100   prc = 0003  src = 08970015.

environment variable to specify the local LU alias.  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASVQEL 
opcode = 0D00   prc = 0003  src = 084C0000 
ERROR: Remote SIGNON cancelled.</PRE>
<P>This error occurs when SIGNON is attempted between two OS/2 hosts. 
To circumvent the problem, verify that the SASRMT and SASTP62 transaction
programs have been configured on the remote host.



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure:

opcode = 1A00   prc = 0001  src = 00000406</PRE>
<P>A CONVERT request (

failed with a PARAMETER_CHECK (


<CODE><B>prc=0001</B></CODE>) because a conversion error occurred (


<CODE><B>src=00000406</B></CODE>).  This failure typically occurs when an invalid character is present
in a user-supplied string, such as APPC_USER or APPC_SECURE.  Verify that
the values that you have specified contain only uppercase letters A through
Z, lowercase letters a through z, numerics 0 through 9, and special characters
$, #, and @.
<P>If you cannot resolve a problem from the explanations given here and
by using the cited resources, call SAS Technical Support for assistance. 
You will probably be asked to generate traces that document the problem, so
be sure that you or your site support personnel are familiar with the tracing
services available through OS/2 Extended Services and VTAM.

<P>Until the configuration is properly specified, it can be difficult to
establish communications within the SNA network, especially for a host subarea
peripheral node. SAS/SHARE passes error
handling information to you to help you debug your configuration. This information
includes operation codes, return codes, and sense data that relate to the
function that the software is performing. Although SAS/SHARE does not interpret
the information, you can use the information to work with network systems
and SAS support personnel at your site to resolve any problems.
<P>The following error messages are produced by the OS/2 APPC access method.
Error reports for the APPC access method include the failing verb operation

 The (internal) transaction program SASVQEL (encapsulated in SASTP62), which
