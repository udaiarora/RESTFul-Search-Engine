<p><b>1. Call to Order.</b>

<p>The meeting was called to order by Senate President William Davey at

3:14 p.m.

<p><b>2. Approval of Previous Minutes. (May 4, 1998 and May 11, 1998).</b>

<p>Senate President Davey: Our first order of business is to review two

sets of minutes, which were distributed to you by mail. There are some

extra copies available at the front desk, but it is going to be our policy

for future meetings to distribute everything in the packets to all of the

senators by mail, and you will be asked to bring them to the Senate meetings.

The first set of minutes is from the regular Senate meeting of May 4, 1998.

Motion to approve. Seconded. Hearing no further discussion, the minutes

are accepted by voice vote.&nbsp;

<p>The second set of minutes are the minutes of May 11, which was a special

meeting that dealt with a collaborative Master of Engineering degree. Motion

to approve. Seconded. Hearing no further discussion, the minutes are accepted

by voice vote.&nbsp;

<p><b>3. Announcements and Communications.</b>

<p><b>3.A. Senate President/President-Elect's Report (William Davey/David

Burstein).</b>

<p>Senate President Davey: I have several announcements and then we will

move on to President Coor and Provost Glick. As senate president, I was

able to attend many of the opening ceremonies for the new semester. We

have a group of new students, which are the best in Arizona State University

history in terms of their grade point averages. We had a group of parents

attend a reception at the Buttes, over 600 of them in all. They expressed

their appreciation for what the university has done. It was a very exciting

kind of meeting because the parents as well as the new students were all

really excited about the beginning of the semester. We also attended convocation

at Gammage Auditorium for new students. While I would not say that it was

jam packed, it was pretty well filled. This event will get better and better

each year. The final meeting that I was able to attend was the Alumni Association

Board meeting and that meeting was very interesting, because they were

putting together and finalizing a strategic plan for the next five years.

I think that we are going to see some really interesting and dynamic changes

coming out of the Alumni Association. The Alumni Association arranges the

legislative coffees, which I think have had a significant impact on our

ability to have a much more positive relationship with the legislature.&nbsp;

<p>We have two things happening on campus tomorrow that should be of interest

to everyone, and we hope that if you are a free at those times, you will

attend. The Arizona Board of Regents is sponsoring a legislative round

table. These two sessions will be held at the ASU Visitors Information

Center at the corner of Apache and Rural. They will take place from 1-2:30

p.m. and from 3-4:30 p.m. A significant number of legislators and candidates

who are running for office have agreed to attend these workshops. I have

received a confirmation from the Board of Regents that these events will

be well attended by the legislators. You are invited to attend these events

and tell the legislators and candidates how you feel about the job they

are doing, and in terms of educational issues.&nbsp;

<p>As an update on the ABOR meetings that took place at the UofA two weeks

ago, several issues pertinent to ASU were approved. The first was the approval

of the renaming of the University Activity center to the Wells Fargo Arena

at Arizona State University. The board also presented the plan for what

it is going to do for the next academic year. There is some good news and

some bad news about that the agenda. The good news is that the Board has

agreed to focus on some significant planning issues to take the three universities

into the next ten years. This agenda is an ambitious one. I think that

is part of the bad news because it is not clear that the board will get

to all of this in one year. Nevertheless they began a discussion on what

they call their focus areas, which include economics and demographics;

partnerships; globalization, which is basically the development of the

research agenda for the university; governance; the relationship with K-12;

the transformation of the university system and student centered learning.

It is a very ambitious agenda, and I think that the Board has agreed at

least in principle to discuss demographics and economics at their next

meeting, which will take place in two weeks at NAU. They also amended the

alcohol policy for Sun Devil Stadium for the Cardinal?s games.&nbsp;

<p>The Arizona Faculties Council, which is the umbrella organization of

the faculty governance structures at the three universities and at ASU

West, will be dealing with the following items in the next few weeks: Finishing

up a discussion of the faculty workload that will be presented to the Board

in November. We worked on this for the last year, focusing the Board's

attention on what the faculty really did within the university with that

workload. Past President Darwyn Linder played a key and pivotal role in

putting the complexity of that work load before the Board, and the Board's

acceptance of the fact that we not only just talk but we do a number of

good things. To that end, if any of you are interested, Libby Ervin, Vice

Provost for Academic Personnel at the UofA, on our behalf summarized the

Arizona Faculties Council Faculty Workload Report. I have some copies of

that report that senators may pick up after the meeting. If we run out

of copies and you want one, call Darby at the Senate Office, 965-9245.&nbsp;

<p>The second issue that the Arizona Faculties Council is working on, along

with the three general counsels at the three universities is to implement

the three president's agreement on whistleblower policies. As you may be

aware, there was legislation introduced into the legislature to take whistleblower

personnel policies out of the universities' hands and put them into the

state Department of Administration. There has been an agreement made by

the three presidents, which will keep the whistleblower policy personnel

issues within the universities. What we are doing right now is helping

to implement that presidential agreement.&nbsp;

<p>The third thing we are doing is working to establish an interactive

web site to help the Board with research and discussion of its focus areas.

As soon as we get this up and running, the middle of this month, we will

give everybody the address of this interactive site.&nbsp;

<p>The last thing that I want to bring up in my report is an inquiry from

a local television station on Internet cheating. Please, if any of you

are familiar with the form and scope of this problem, I would appreciate

your providing me with some information. We have asked the Student Faculty

Policy committee to work on that. Another item that Student Faculty Policy

Committee has considered before is the sale of class notes and that item

is back with us. The Class Quotes Company was sold to a young man who visited

with me recently for about that last week. The issue is that faculty do

own the intellectual property over their notes. If a student is taking

your class, a student will be taking notes. What we ask Class Quotes to

do is get the faculty member's agreement to take notes in the class. If

the faculty member does not agree, then they have assured us that their

employees will not take notes in that class. This will be a much better

situation than we have had in the past with Class Quotes.&nbsp;

<p>The final thing is that the legislature over the summer passed a bill

called "Parental Choice for Reading Success." The final version of this

bill, which was somewhat different from the bills we looked at in the course

of the last year, actually tells the universities what they need to teach

in some of their education classes. There have been meetings by the Dean

of the College of Education, David Berliner, and members of the legislature,

as well as the faculty leaders at UofA with members of the legislature.

At best, we can determine that these meetings did not have very positive

outcomes in that is the sentiment of the legislature that we are not doing

enough, and that we need to implement a certain kind of phonics teaching

in our education classes some of us view this as a significant attack on

our academic freedom. We will be looking at this issue more carefully,

after I determine exactly what happened in these legislative meetings.

I will also talk to our legislative analysts on campus to see what we can

do as a senate. Are there any questions?<b></b>

<p><b>3.B University President's Report (Lattie Coor).</b>

<p>Thank you Bill and members of the Senate. I have the privilege of speaking

to you on Wednesday morning, so I will not wear out my welcome and will

save some remarks for that occasion. Dr. Glick will speak to you today

about some strategic planning issues, and I will be talking about our major

themes of the year at the breakfast.&nbsp;

<p>I want to salute the opening of this year. A lot has happened over the

summer since our last meeting of the Senate on May 11. Please feel free

to ask questions or make comments today. I want to underscore the power,

the strength, the meaning, of the spirited opening of the term, which Bill

has just remarked on. It was a wonderful experience for the parents and

the students. The work that so many of you and your colleagues and the

related support offices do to make the opening of the term vibrant and

eventful, at what has got to be the worst possible moment in human captivity,

deserves notice. We somehow had the genius 25 years ago cranking the semester

back a bit; we must not have been looking at the thermometer; because it

means bringing parents and students here on 15 August! However, there is

a spirit that is palpable, and it has been growing for the last few years.

There is a real sense that size should not stand in the way of there being

a substantial heart to this university. Therefore, I thank all of you and

your colleagues who have made that possible. You may know that following

that large convocation at Gammage Auditorium, in a pied piper fashion,

the deans and chairs and directors lead their students and parents off,

to college moments. Following the college convocation, they lead them to

department areas; it was a happy moment, similarly, I recall to the greeting

of new faculty, with a tip of the hat to those who made that a vital moment.

I know that you all have many things to do, and I wish you could have been

there to see this as well.&nbsp;

<p>Bill told you of the endeavors that he and others from the Senate have

undertaken on our collective behalf at the Regents meetings. What he did

not tell you, with characteristic modesty, is that he is the representative

of the Arizona Faculties Council that sits at the Regents' table, which

means that he and the three presidents are the only ones that have to sit

there for all two days of the Regents' meetings. That is a function that

rotates among the universities and the campuses, and Bill has already shown

that he will do well in this role. At the next Regents meeting in Flagstaff,

they will actually be perfecting the budget requests that will be will

be considered by the governor's budgeting staff in late December. Are there

any questions from the Senate on any of my announcements? Hearing none,

I will see you all on Wednesday morning.&nbsp;

<p><b>3.C University Provost's Report (Milton Glick).</b>

<p>I have a new motto, one I put above my bed: Sleep Faster! I want to

join in welcoming all of you. We have a big task before us, to define what

a baccalaureate degree is. I believe that we are entering a period which

is unprecedented in education, in that we are going to see new organizations

in the business of providing education, any time, any place, anywhere.

Compared with what is to come, those of you who have challenged the University

of Phoenix will now think it looks good. There will be 4-5 hour sessions

earning three credits, among other things introduced. Two billion dollars

in capital has been already been raised to make this happen. We will be

barraged by a variety of enterprises. Some will be of very high quality,

some not very good quality. I think we can have expectation of students

walking into our door and saying, "I have 120 credits; give me a baccalaureate."

An alternative to that scenario might be, "I have 47 competencies, which

I have been tested on; give me a baccalaureate degree." We are not in a

position to say anything to the contrary, unless we have clarity over what

the role of our baccalaureate really is. Our degree is more than a certain

number of hours or competencies. It includes a socialization process, which

changes a person that has come to our university. We first need to know

how to tell that story in a way that is credible and meaningful, especially

for when the legislature asks us why will not we serve these people. It

is a hard job, and our conversation on this will be an important one that

we really have to engage in this year. In some ways, the conversation is

more important than the outcome. We have not been challenged on this issue

in a long time. How do we find ways to accept appropriately these multiply

delivered courses and proficiencies, and recognize them as a part of our

program, and yet differentiate baccalaureate degrees from other degrees?

We need to incorporate these items, but recognize what is unique that distinguishes

a baccalaureate degree from Arizona State University. We need to look at

what makes up a baccalaureate degree from all the campuses, but also what

makes ours different from other programs, at the same time maintaining

an openness to community college transfers. We need to streamline our curriculum

in very real ways; we need to make it less a series of hurdles that we

string together, and more a constructive experience, which efficiently

gets students through the program. We are an attractive university and

this population area will continue to grow.&nbsp;

<br>The Open University has just chartered itself in Maryland and they

already have a joint agreement established with Cal State University, Florida

State, and other programs. The Open University, as many of you know better

than I, is a very credible enterprise that has really opened the door to

quality higher education in Great Britain. Phoenix is seen as an enterprise

zone to support the Great Britain school. The President, as a part of the

University for the Next Century will have speakers come to address this

type of new educational delivery. In November, Sir John Daniel, Vice Provost

of the Open University, will join us in November. He is very articulate

and is an advocate and believer, in the Open University who is knowledgeable

and critical as well. We hope you will join us as we discuss what roles

we need to play in this New World of higher education.&nbsp;

<p>I spent June preparing for a series of meetings to talk about each of

our three campuses, how we differentiate ourselves and yet become parts

of a whole system of education. That fits very well with a report that

I received written by the Strategic Planning Committee, which was chaired

by Frank Hoppensteadt. The highlights of much of that plan will be discussed

in Dr. Coor's remarks on Wednesday morning at the Faculty Breakfast. I

will just whet your appetite. I think that the strategic plan really fits

very well into the view of what ASU Main should become in the future, and

how it interacts with ASU West, East, and Extended Education. I urge you

to read the strategic plan on the Provost web site and give us your comments.

Some of the highlights from that report include that we must continue the

progress we have made in improving undergraduate education. That is the

price of admission to all the other things we want to do. Retention rates

after twenty years have risen from 69 to 75%. The graduation rate is up

three points. It was flat for many years. We need also to continue to shape

the profile of our freshmen class. That freshman class has risen in numbers

from 2,900 to 5,000 this year. We must continue to build our campus experience.

Secondly, we must improve our graduate stipends and provide better career

development options for a variety of programs. Third, if we are not to

fall out of the universe of research universities, we must in the next

five years double our funding for research. We are very fragile as a Research

I university. We will select faculty who can help us deliver this large-scale

research initiative. I think it is essential that we market what we are

and why we are in a positive way, at the same time beefing up our undergraduate

education. We have to find a way to tell the story of why research and

creative activity is critical to the health of the Valley, the state and

the nation, in addition to the strengthening of undergraduate education.

There are some exciting tasks we face in the coming year. Dr. Coor will

put these things in context in his remarks at the breakfast on Wednesday.

I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.

<p>A senator asked about the new sick leave policy.

<p>Dr. Glick: It has been implemented. The legislature this past year retroactively

changed the law so that it allows fractional pay out for all state employees

for accrued sick leave of up to $30,000 dollars at retirement. At ASU,

the Academic Senate recommended two decades ago, and the University adopted

a policy in which academic year faculty did not accrue sick leave. With

the new state policy, ASU faculty would be disadvantaged with respect to

faculty at UofA and NAU, and all other state employees. In order to insure

equitable treatment for ASU faculty, we will begin reporting and accruing

sick leave for faculty as of July 1, 1998. In order to provide retroactive

equality, legislative leadership has agreed that we can retroactively reflect

prior sick leave. To do this, we have determined the average net sick leave

accrued annually by faculty at UofA and NAU and we will credit this average

accrual for the time faculty have been here, with modifications for any

unusual extended illnesses for individual faculty. I know you asked a simple

question and got a very complex answer; the answer is, yes.&nbsp;

<p>Senator Linder: What has been happening with the CMR, funds since we

are getting close to October 1?

<p>Milton Glick: That is a very good question. First, the State this year

has given us our salary adjustment in two pieces. One piece is what we

call CSA, Classifications Salary Adjustment, to deal with major market

inequities, and that is effective October 1. The second is a merit pool

effective January 1. Only a subset of faculty and staff will be eligible

for the October 1 increase. Our hope is to look at the whole salary pool

as a package. Because JLBC, the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, only

approved our plan for CSA last Thursday, it is clear to me that we will

not get all the adjustments made by October 1. What we have agreed is that

those of you that get CSA adjustments, those will be effective October

1 but they will actually will not appear until the November 15 pay check,

and then they will be retroactive to October 1. It will be done, but it

will be six weeks late. This is a complex process that we only received

approval for it last week. This week we went through with the deans and

your faculty leaders the complete picture. Now we must distribute the pools.

In next week's issue of <i>ASU Insight,</i> we will lay out those same

guidelines. However, the real answer is that it will be retroactive to

October 1.&nbsp;

<p>3.D ASASU President's Report (Paul Frost).

<p>I am a humanities major in my senior year, and I transferred here from

Show Low, Arizona. I am very pleased to be able to serve as the ASASU president

this year. We have some excellent things on our agenda. I want to introduce

my chief of staff, Robert Strick, who is here with me today. I am sure

you will see him around. Like President Coor, I will be speaking on Wednesday

morning, so my announcements today will be very brief. One of our premier

objectives that I continue working on is teacher evaluations, which were

approved (last year): Dr. Burstein worked on this during the past year,

and now Dr. Crawford will work with us this year. We will be making a presentation

on the process of teacher evaluation to the Senate in the near future.

Another thing that we are excited about is the "Insuring Tomorrow" conference.

President Bush came and spoke last year, and we hope to make that a great

presentation again this year. We are forming a good relationship with the

<i>State

Press;</i> a pizza party get together is planned with them next week. That

is what my report is today, and I will answer any questions that you may

have.&nbsp;

<p>Senate President Davey: Paul gave a good presentation at the convocation.

It was an inspiring commentary about the relationship that he had with

his father.&nbsp;

<p><b>3.E ASUW Senate President's Report (In<font face="WP MultinationalA Roman">e</font>s

Chisholm).</b>

<p>I appreciate this opportunity to share a little bit about what we are

doing this year at ASU West. We had our assembly and convocation last week.

We are looking at issues of technology this year and technology access

for students. However, a much more complex issue has evolved; it is also

an issue for faculty promotion and tenure, it is an issue for resources

allocation, and it is an issue for budgeting. We are planning to look at

promotion and tenure policies, the overarching university policies at West

and then try to align them with the strategic plan, which we approved last

year. Finally, we are planning to look at the role of faculty in student

recruitment and retention. This is a big issue coming up at ASU West. Although

our student body continues to grow very slowly, we do want to reach our

full capability by the year 2010, which is projected to be approximately

10,000 students. With that goal in mind, we feel that it is time for the

faculty to start thinking about what is their role is in relation to student

recruitment and retention. That is essentially the direction we are going.

I am looking forward to having Dr. Davey attend our next Senate meeting

at West.

<p><b>4. Open Forum.</b>

<p>A senator: I would like to bring up the business over the last year

and a half regarding the parking problems that I am facing and particularly

the people that I serve are also facing. It may seem terribly petty but

it is incredibly aggravating to come to work in the morning, and not to

know if the gate will open for you, -- whether you will be actually able

to get into the lot or have a bunch of people on top of you trying to push

you into the lot. I would hope that there is an end to this problem in

the near future, and that we can safely put the card in and the gate will

open. It is becoming a typical frustration for many people that I represent.

<p>Senate President Davey: I do not know about the form and scope of that

problem, but I will talk to Mernoy Harrison and see if I can get an answer

to you on that.

<p>A senator: There are a number of areas where we are working on collaborative

degrees with NAU and UofA. One of the problems is that class schedules

at the institutions do not fit together very well. When I approached the

Registrar's Office, the answer I received was that it is impossible to

schedule courses that take into account the class schedules at the other

universities.&nbsp;

<p>Dr. Glick: I don't know why our times schedules are so different; there

may be different reasons, but we will look at more creative ways to look

at class scheduling. We went from a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to a

Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Tuesday and Thursday schedule at some point.

Now, we may have to look at Friday, Saturday, weekend possibilities.&nbsp;

<p>A senator: several of my colleagues are unhappy with the changes to

our health care. The open enrollment period ends September 4. We lost options,

and in some cases our selection of physicians.&nbsp;

<p>Senate President Davey: The Thomas Davis facility has closed and this

has caused a great deal of concern within that health care delivery system.

Those are state contracts, and I would suggest you send over to us your

substantive concerns. We will forward those to proper agencies that can

interface them with the people who can affect them. There is an oversight

committee on health care and insurance on campus. We will forward that

information to them and let them put it into the proper pipeline. The Senate

can only express its concern over those issues. If we had a successful

resolution, we would not have the power to influence those contract decisions

directly, although that other committee sits as the new contract is being

made up. They have direct and specific impact. I would be more than willing

to take that information and pass that along. Are there any other issues

for open forum?

<p>A senator: The discussion of grade changes should include the topic

of grade inflation. I was asked to inquire about the status of plus or

minus grade options also.&nbsp;

<p>Senate President Davey: That is a very good question. Actually that

proposal did in fact pass through the Senate and we have had sufficient

time to research it.&nbsp;

<p>Dr. Glick: We did not implement that plan because at one time it was

on hold until the new Student Information System was implemented, along

with other changes. Now we have been working on the year 2000 problem and

have had to put <u>all</u> changes on hold. Your President-elect, David

Burstein, has urged us to work this year to define the parameters of the

new Student Information System.&nbsp;

<p>President-elect Burstein: Please look at the Senate minutes of May 4.

On page 10, I specifically read into the minutes this issue. I will be

working with Bill Lewis, the VP for Information Technology, and others

on promoting these changes. At the next meeting of the Senate, we will

have a report on the development of that work.&nbsp;

<p>Senate President Davey: Thanks to all of you that have participated

in bringing substantive items up under this open forum.&nbsp;

<p><b>5. Unfinished Business.&nbsp;</b>

<p>Senate President Davey: There were no items of unfinished business because

President Linder left us with an empty plate.

<p><b>6. New Business.</b>

<p><b>6.A Executive Committee (William Davey).</b>

<p>Please note the calendar of meetings that was distributed to you today.&nbsp;

<p><b>6.B Committee on Committees (Tim Karcher).</b>

<p>The Committee on Committees has issued the 1998-99 Academic Preference

Survey and everyone should have received that by now. I would just like

to ask my fellow senators to speak to the members of their units and have

them fill out the surveys and get them back to the Senate Office. Thank

you.

<p>Senate President Davey: We have received a couple of hundred of these

forms back so far. If you need a copy, contact the Senate Office (Darby

Shaw 965-9245). I really appreciate the faculty and academic professionals

who have volunteered to serve on committees. Practically everyone has come

back with three or four options and this will help the Committee on Committees

get their work done.&nbsp;

<p><b>6.C Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee (Linda Johnson).</b>

<p>We have one information item on the agenda. The Curriculum and Academic

Programs Committee recommended approval of the following item: Establishment

of a new concentration in the College of Fine Arts under the Master of

Music, Music Education, Jazz Studies. We also have a second information

item which some of you may be aware of, a high tech MBA program to be offered

by Arizona State University Main in collaboration with the Tsinghua University

in Beijing, China. That proposal is coming to CAPC. Dean Penley will attend

the CAPC meeting this Wednesday, September 2, 3:30-5:00 pm, in Administration

A202. We will be looking at that proposal before it goes to the Board of

Regents.&nbsp;

<p><b>6.D Personnel Committee (Kevin Carroll).</b>

<p>You have already been told about the whistleblower law, and we will

be working on that and reviewing the revised sick leave policy. The only

other thing that we have on our agenda at this point is looking over how

non-tenure track faculty, instructors and faculty associates with multiple

year contracts.&nbsp;

<p><b>6.E. Student-Faculty Policy Committee (John Crawford).</b>

<p>The committee has not yet met but we have several things to accomplish.

We will be considering the ASASU Teacher Evaluation Program. We did some

pilot work on that last year. We are going to try to get a formal presentation

on the results of that trial, and then continue on seeking your guidance.

We will also look, from a policy standpoint, at whether or not we are going

to try to implement a 12 point grading program, as mentioned by Senator

McGowan. We want to look at computer privacy issues. New technologies make

it very easy for people to find out where the faculty spend computer time

on the web. Along those lines, there are some very serious concerns of

what kinds of security issues and rights of privacy issues are going to

exist within the academic environment. Some of the students wish to discontinue

the student social security number as part of the Student Identification

System. You heard today about another issue that will come forth from the

greater society, cheating on the net. As I understand that issue, it is

possible for any student to get a copy of the teacher's edition of any

textbook published. There go the banks of test questions. Those are some

of the issues we want to explore. If there are serious concerns then we

will decide what are we going to do to respond over the next five years.&nbsp;

<p><b>6.F University Services and Facilities Committee (To Be Elected).&nbsp;</b>

<p>Senate President Davey: Since virtually all new people populate that

committee this year, we are planning a first meeting right now. I believe

it is next week. We will elect a chair. I have met with Mernoy Harrison

and he has already given the committee several service issues to deal with.

<p>This is our first meeting of the Senate. I do want to say at this first

meeting that David and I look forward to working with you on a variety

of activities. Please understand that while sometimes I can be a very quiet

person, I will work tenaciously on your behalf. I do welcome these kinds

of cooperative ventures; we intend to work closely with the other senate

presidents from ASU West and ASU East on issues that effect our campuses.

Over the last five years, we have had several prominent attacks on different

issues, tenure for example, faculty workload, and other issues. We do have

a very strong faculty leadership but we also have a strong administration

that supports our efforts and us. We try to be supportive of their efforts

as well. We have worked together on policy that will take us into the 21st

century in a very positive way. It is a very exciting time on this campus

and I appreciate working with you.&nbsp;

<p><b>7. Adjournment.</b>

<p>We have completed our agenda for today so I will entertain a motion

to adjourn. So moved. Seconded. We are adjourned at 4:42 pm.

<br>&nbsp;

<p>Recorded and Edited by Darby Shaw,

<br>Administrative Associate

<br>Final Editing by Dawn Bates,

<br>Secretary of the Senate</td>
