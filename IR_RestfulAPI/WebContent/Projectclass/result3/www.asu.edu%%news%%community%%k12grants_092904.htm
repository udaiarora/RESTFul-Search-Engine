      <h2><B>ASU Gets $33 Million to Support Efforts with K-12 Community</B> </h2>
      <p>Arizona State University has been awarded six federal grants totaling more than $33 million, all of which will have a direct impact on K-12 education in Arizona. </p>
      <p>These research investments by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Education will flow directly into the community to enrich area schools with teacher training and other support activities while ASU faculty conduct research that will lead to permanently improving education nation-wide. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;This federal funding is critical to our education mission and our commitment to improve quality of life in Arizona,&rdquo; noted ASU President Michael Crow. &ldquo;Research projects like these show how investments in entrepreneurial faculty can lead to major benefits for the community.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The grants also exemplify a deep spirit of cooperation in Arizona&rsquo;s education community, as they involve active partnerships and intense collaboration between ASU and other state other educational institutions. </p>
      <p>The new grants are: </p>
      <UL>
        <p><B>$12.5 million from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for &ldquo;Project Pathways: Opening Routes to Math and Science Success for All Students,&rdquo;</B> a pilot education research program that is aimed at deepening math and science teaching skills by delivering tuition-free advanced teacher training in math and science directly to high schools.&nbsp; 350 high school teachers from four high school districts around the Valley will be involved in the first phase, and ultimately the program will improve math and science learning for more than 50,000 students. Awarded to Marilyn Carlson, CRESMET.</p>
        <p><B>$4.4 million from NSF&rsquo;s Teacher Professional Continuum program</B>, which aims to bolster the recruitment, preparation and retention of effective teachers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. It has an initial two-year award of $1.7 million and a pending $2.7 million based on progress and NSF funding levels. The program also involves four school districts where ASU researchers will deliver a new graduate course tuition free on teaching pre-calculus-level mathematics. Awarded to Marilyn Carlson, CRESMET.</p>
        <p><B>$10 million from the U.S. Department of Education<FONT color=#000000> to create a model quality university-school Professional Development School</FONT></B><FONT color=#000000> that will&nbsp; recruit, prepare, place, and retain high quality new teachers in high-poverty urban and remote rural school districts. The program is designed to create high quality teachers and increased student achievement in these challenging environments.&nbsp; Awarded to the</FONT> College of Teacher Education and Leadership at West Campus.</p>
        <p><B>$2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s Early Reading First program,</B> which will develop a program to encourage early acquisition of reading skills by preschool children. The program, in partnership with the Tempe Elementary School District, two elementary schools and several preschool providers, is a pilot program in implementing an effective early reading program and in training teachers through on-site college coursework and professional mentoring. More than 150 children will be served by the pilot, which will result in a proven program that can be duplicated in other schools locally and nationwide. Awarded to Shelley Gray, Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences.</p>
        <p><B>$2.5 million from the National Institutes of Health for research to find factors predicting early education success.</B>&nbsp; This is the first large-scale, long-term study aimed at defining how social factors can effect the education of preschool and early elementary children, and the results could have a huge impact on early childhood education. Awarded to Carol Martin, Department of Family and Human Development.</p>
        <p><B> $1. 4 million from the National Science Foundation for &ldquo;Research on Learning and Education&rdquo;</B> A three-year project in which researchers will closely follow 160 students from Grade 6 through Grade 8 to help researchers better understand what is involved in children successfully learning math. The research aims to uncover the mechanisms by which middle-grade adolescents develop new math skills and knowledge, and develop models for successful math teaching. The project has the potential to effect important practical reforms in the preparation and classroom practice of middle school mathematics teachers. Awarded to Jim Middleton, CRESMET, and Associate Dean, College of Education.</p>
      </UL>
      <p>Through the new grants, the researchers have attracted a significant package of federal money to the state that will have direct impact on local schools in areas that have been identified as critical - science and math education, teacher preparation, teacher shortages in low income and rural schools, and early reading and school preparation.</p>
      <p>While directly supporting these immediate educational needs, the projects will also have significant long-term effects. The research components of the grants mean that the funds are likely to have an impact that reaches significantly into the future and beyond the state. Many of the grants involve developing &ldquo;model&rdquo; programs that are proven to be effective and created so that they can someday also be adopted by other school districts and other institutions.</p>
      <p>Please see attached releases for details on the grants. </p>
