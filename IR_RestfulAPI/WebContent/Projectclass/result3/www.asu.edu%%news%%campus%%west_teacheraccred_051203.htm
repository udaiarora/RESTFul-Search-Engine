      <h2>ASU West expands accelerated teacher certification program</h2>
      <p>        Five additional Valley school districts plan to collaborate with the
          ASU West College of Education during the 2003 - 04 school year to offer
          an accelerated program for people with a bachelor's degree in a field
      other than education who wish to pursue teaching careers.</p>
      <p>ASU West implemented
            its accelerated postbaccalaureate teaching certificate program with
            the Peoria Unified School District (PUSD) as a pilot program
          at the start of the current school year. More than 20 students have
        spent significant amounts of time in one of four PUSD elementary schools
        since
          early August, while also taking the university-level education courses
          needed for teacher certification. The students will continue working
          in the Peoria schools through the conclusion of the school year in
        late May.</p>
      <p>New districts planning to participate during 2003 - 04 include the
          Glendale Union High School District and the Alhambra, Cartwright, Litchfield
          and
          Washington Elementary School Districts. The Litchfield District's involvement
          is part of a partnership among DMB Corp., ASU West, and the school
        district to develop a range of educational opportunities in DMB's new
        Verrado
        residential community located in the West Valley.</p>
      <p>"The ASU West students
          have the opportunity to develop real relationships with teachers and
          pupils in the schools in which they are placed, and
          to experience everything from parent-teacher conferences to standardized
          testing schedules," says Betty Porter, PUSD administrator for curriculum
          and instruction. "It also gives the school district the chance to get
        a first-hand look at potential prospective teachers."</p>
      <p>"I would recommend
          this program to anyone," says ASU West student Tyson Boothe. "The classroom
          experience it has given me has prepared me extremely
        well for a career as an educator."</p>
      <p>As many as 25 students are expected
          to enroll in the program in PUSD and each of the additional districts
          during the upcoming school year.
          ASU West offers this accelerated program in addition to its on-campus
          postbaccalaureate teacher certification programs in elementary and
        secondary education, which may be completed in approximately 18 months
        on a fulltime
        basis, or over a longer period on a part-time basis.</p>
      <p>"Students need to make a major commitment of time and energy to participate
        in the accelerated program," says Michael Awender, dean of the ASU West
        College of Education. "Students willing to make that commitment experience
        a high-quality program that immerses them in the public school setting
      for a full school year."</p>
      <p>Registration for the program at the six participating
          districts is open until July 1. For information, call the ASU West
        College of Education
        at (602) 543-6354.</p>
