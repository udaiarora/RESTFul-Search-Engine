      <h2>Nahavandi receives top award from Parents Association; ASASU names two for high honor </h2>
      <p>Afsaneh Nahavandi, ASU professor in the School of Management at the West campus, received one of the highest honors at the university this week, being named the 2004 Professor of the Year by the ASU Parents Association. She was nominated by students and several of her peers. </p>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/04profofyear_041604.jpg" width="288" height="201" align="right">Nahavandi will receive a $10,000 cash award and $10,000 over the next academic year for a student assistant. Her name was announced at a Celebration of Teaching and Learning Excellence April 13. The Parents Association Professorship is a lifetime title. </p>
      <p>Nahavandi's passion for teaching, a genuine interest in her students as people and a deep knowledge of her subject matter make her an extremely effective teacher, according to her nominators. Students give her consistently high evaluations and say she is one of their most memorable professors. </p>
      <p>"Professor Nahavandi has had a great impact on my educational and professional life," says a student who nominated her. "She has a zest for her subject matter, and I have seen her students become infected with enthusiasm. She has the perfect balance of professionalism and concern for students. </p>
      <p>"She is extremely organized and well-prepared, and she makes the information more interesting by using occurrences from real life experiences to apply to management theories. She personalizes every lecture by referring to students in the class by name, no easy task in a class of 90 students. Professor Nahavandi encourages creativity but is always available to assist you. She has a way of making you feel that you are her only student." </p>
      <p>Because of her concern for students, Nahavandi single-handedly created a peer mentor program in the School of Management three years ago, recruiting and training high performing students to guide others in the classroom, during orientations, in major fairs and through social events. Based on the success of the program, she created a similar program for freshmen throughout campus. While contributing to the success of others, the mentors themselves describe the activity as one of their best college experiences. </p>
      <p>Nahavandi joined the ASU faculty in 1988 and has won the Achievement in Teaching Award at the West campus twice. She teaches a wide variety of courses from freshman management courses to senior leadership electives. Currently she is interim director of the Division of Collaborative Programs. </p>
      <p>Three finalists for the Professor of the Year award received $1,000 awards: Ines Chisholm of the College of Teacher Education and Leadership at the West campus; Barry Leshowitz of psychology and Rose Weitz of women's studies and sociology. </p>
      <p>Also nominated for the award were Arna Bontemps, African American Studies; Alan Deserpa, economics; Betsy Fahlman, art; Stephen Happel, economics; Carol Johnston, nutrition; Kevin McHugh, geography; Amy Ostrom, marketing; Robert Strom, psychology; and James Vicich, mathematics. </p>
      <p>Also given top honors this week are two rising stars from the junior faculty who were named 2004 Centennial Professors by the Associated Students of ASU. Students chose Janetta McCoy of the School of Design and Matthew Whitaker of the Department of History to receive $10,000 each for teaching excellence and outstanding commitment outside the classroom. </p>
      <p>McCoy came to ASU in 1999 to teach interior design, and is known for actively engaging her students with lively discussions, innovative learning environments and speakers from the professional community. Each year she challenges each student to design and build a chair to be auctioned off to benefit the Family Advocacy Center of Phoenix. </p>
      <p>Whitaker joined the faculty two years ago and has since become a popular speaker statewide, sharing his interests in African American history; the African Diaspora; critical race theory and the struggle for racial, economic and gender equality in the American West. Both Centennial Professors will use half of their awards to benefit students. </p>
