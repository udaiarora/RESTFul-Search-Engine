              <p class="storyhead">Energy-efficient home shows off Stardust Center&rsquo;s major strengths </p>
              <p>A new home on the Navajo Nation is giving homeowners Mary and Kee Augustine the latest in energy-saving technologies &ndash; all wrapped in a design that reflects their Native American culture and traditions.</p>
              <p> The new home in Nageezi , N.M. &ndash; which is replacing their previous home that had fallen into disrepair &ndash; represents a new start for the Augustines. But on a larger scale, it offers a new model for providing efficient, affordable housing.</p>
              <p> It is the first full-construction project completed by the Stardust Center for Affordable Homes and the Family at ASU. The center, which opened at ASU in January, is dedicated to increasing the quality and quantity of affordable housing through research and innovative design efforts.</p>
              <p> The project was initiated by ASU architecture student Christopher Billey, a native of the Navajo Nation. He wanted to give back to his people and had previously completed small housing repairs in the area. Billey contacted center organizers last fall in hopes of developing a larger project.</p>
              <p> After extensive research, the center decided to partner with the Navajo Housing Authority to build a home. The Augustines, Navajo Nation elders, were on a waiting list for housing assistance and had been turned down for help.</p>
              <p> &ldquo;Letting us do this project was an act of faith by the Augustines, because it was so difficult for them to see their house torn down, even if it was in such bad shape,&rdquo; says Daniel Glenn, associate director for design services for the ASU Stardust Center. &ldquo;We hope to use this home as the model to change the way housing is produced on the reservation. The intent is to create smart, affordable housing that protects the traditional culture at the same time it responds to the regional climate.&rdquo;</p>
              <p> The two-bedroom design incorporates Din&eacute; culture throughout, including a central courtyard designed to reflect the traditional Hooghan; a traditional shade arbor &ndash; Chahash&rsquo;oh &ndash; that protects the south wall from the sun; and an east facing entry that welcomes the morning sun. The design honors the four elements of fire, water, earth and air through a central fireplace, a roof designed to collect rainwater, the use of local materials and a natural ventilation system.</p>
              <p> The home includes 12-inch-thick block walls made of aerated flyash concrete block called Navajo FlexCrete; passive solar design for heating and cooling; and supplemental radiant floor heating. FlexCrete is a lighter version of traditional block that will help heat and cool the house without air conditioning or central heat, despite the property sitting at above 7,000 feet. Overall, the home will use 80 percent less energy than a conventional home.</p>
              <p> The FlexCrete was used in part for its energy saving and environmentally friendly qualities, but also because it is a product of the Navajo Nation. The flyash used for the blocks is a waste byproduct from power plants in Page, Ariz. </p>
              <p> Windows and doors for the project were recycled from houses in Phoenix provided by Stardust Building Supplies, and logs used for beams in the home came from trees that had been thinned from Navajo forest land. The kitchen cabinets were donated by Cabinets Southwest, an NHA company employing local Navajo crafts people.</p>
              <p> Glenn, an expert in traditional Native American architecture, led the design process as part of a self-study class he taught in the spring. Students Billey, Adrian Holiday &ndash; also from the Navajo Nation &ndash; and Alisa Lertrique developed the design.</p>
              <p> &ldquo;It was extremely helpful to have Navajo Nation natives as part of the design team,&rdquo; Glenn says. &ldquo;They had actually lived in Hooghans growing up and understood what we needed to include. The family was also very helpful because they knew what they really wanted out of the project.&rdquo;</p>
              <p> Once designed, Glenn says primary construction of the home took about six weeks. Glenn and Ernesto Fonseca, a native of Mexico, led the construction process. Fonseca provided energy analysis for the project as a graduate student in Energy Performance and Climate Responsive Design.</p>
              <p> Other team members included Matthew Green, Jason Croxton and Tanya Yellowhair of the ASU College of Design, and Peter Crispell from the ASU Del Webb School of Construction. Yellowhair and Croxton also are members of the Navajo Nation.</p>
              <p> Glenn says ASU&rsquo;s involvement with the project will not end now that the home has been turned over to the Augustines. The Stardust Center will monitor the home throughout the next year to determine the full energy savings. That information will be incorporated into future projects, possibly including larger scale developments with the Navajo Nation.</p>
              <p> Glenn says the Stardust Center, led by nationally renowned affordable housing architect Michael Pyatok, also is working on a variety of housing development designs in metropolitan Phoenix. The projects vary in scale and will include at least one project every year that the center will design and build, like the home in Nageezi.</p>
              <p> &ldquo;We are actively working on multiple design projects,&rdquo; Glenn says. &ldquo;This home is a model of affordable housing techniques that we will utilize and adapt throughout the year. The ultimate goal is developing better quality affordable housing for use everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
