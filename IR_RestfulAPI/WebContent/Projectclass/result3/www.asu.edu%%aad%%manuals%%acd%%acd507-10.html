<p>
The university reserves the right to conduct expedited review for continuing appointment and/or promotion in extraordinary circumstances when such action will serve the best interests of the university. The decision on awarding  continuing appointment and/or promotion will follow an expedited continuing appointment and/or promotion review process. 

<p>
An expedited review is an exception to the regular continuing appointment and promotion processes described in <a href="acd507-06.html">ACD 507&#150;06</a>, &#147;Review for Continuing Appointment&#148; and <a href="acd507-07.html">ACD 507&#150;07</a>, &#147;Review for Promotion&#148; and will be approved only in  extraordinary circumstances, which could include, but are not limited to:

<p>
<ol>
<li>the decision of the university to respond to an offer of other employment to a current academic professional whom the university desires to retain</li>

<p>
<li>the receipt of an extraordinary award or honor by an academic professional that is likely to generate offers of employment or brings distinction to the individual and the institution

<p>
and</li>

<p>
<li>other circumstances that the dean and the provost determine warrant expedited continuing appointment.</li></ol>

<p>
The university has no obligation to consider or approve an expedited review at the request of the academic professional or for any other circumstances, including the circumstances listed above.

<p>
<b>Length of the Review</b>

<p>
Every effort will be made to conclude an expedited review within 14  calendar days following the initiation of the review or as soon as possible thereafter.

<p>

<center><font size=+2><b>Procedure</b></font></center>
<img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2">


<p>
<b>Initiation of Expedited Review </b>

<p>
The dean will submit a request to both the campus provost and the executive vice president and provost of the university for an expedited review.  The request will provide the reason(s) that support the review and an explanation why the continuing appointment and/or promotion review should not proceed under the regular process required by ACD 507-06 and 507-07.  

<p>
The dean will attach to the request the following:

<p>
<ol>
<li>the most current curriculum vitae of the academic professional</li>

<p>
<li> a copy of the offer letter from another employer, if applicable and available</li>

<p>
<li>identification of an honor or award that would support expedited review

<p>
or</li>

<p>
<li>any other information that would establish the extraordinary circumstances to support an expedited review.</li></ol>

<p>
The provosts will make every effort to respond to the request within 48 hours after receipt of the request.  

<p>
The dean will notify the unit head and the academic professional on receipt of the decision.

<p>
<b>Review Letters </b>

<p>
If the provosts approve the request for an expedited review, the unit head will provide a list of five names and the academic professional will provide a list of five names, for a total of ten names of internal and/or external reviewers who are qualified to evaluate the academic professional&#146;s position effectiveness, professional contributions, and institutional, professional, and community service. The list of names should include complete contact information of each suggested reviewer.  

<p>
The unit head and the dean will rank-order six reviewers from the list of the ten  suggested reviewers. The unit head will contact the top three ranked reviewers as soon as possible to determine whether they can provide written reviews to the unit head within ten calendar days following the request. The review letters may be submitted electronically or by facsimile. 

<p>
If a reviewer cannot provide a review within ten days, the unit head will contact the fourth-ranked reviewer from the combined list, and this process will continue until three reviewers agree to provide a review within the timeline. 

<p>
The unit head will send the curriculum vitae, the unit guidelines, and examples of the academic professional&#146;s position effectiveness, professional contributions, and institutional, professional, and community service by electronic mail, facsimile, expedited mail service, or other means as soon as possible after the reviewer agrees to provide a review letter. 

<p>
<b>Internal Review </b>

<p>
Simultaneously with selecting reviewers, the unit head will request the available representatives of the unit&#146;s promotion and continuing appointment review committee to provide an expedited review of the candidate&#146;s position effectiveness, professional contributions, and institutional, professional, and community service.

<p>
The dean will request the available representatives of the college promotion and continuing appointment review or advisory committee to provide an expedited review of the candidate&#146;s qualifications.


<p>
The academic professional will submit to the unit head a two- to three-page personal statement discussing his or her qualifications for continuing appointment and/or promotion. The dean and the unit head will provide as much information on the candidate&#146;s qualifications to the respective peer review committees as is available. The unit head and the dean will also prepare their own reviews simultaneously or as soon as possible after receipt of the peer reviews from the unit and the college committees. 

<p>
The unit head will provide copies of the review letters to the dean as they are received.  The unit head and the dean will provide a secure location to review the letters so that committee members may access the letters as the committee conducts the review. 

<p>
The continuing appointment portfolio with the unit level reviews and external review levels (&#147;materials&#148;) will be submitted to the dean as expeditiously as possible. The college level reviews will be added to the materials and forwarded to the university level.  If the candidate is employed at the Polytechnic, West, or Downtown Phoenix campuses, the campus provost will prepare a recommendation and forward the materials to the university committee via the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University. 

<p>
The available representatives of the appropriate committee at the university level will conduct the university level review and provide a recommendation and the materials to the executive vice president and provost of the university. The executive vice president and provost of the university will review the entire package and forward a recommendation with the materials  to the president for decision.

<p>
<b>Decision</b>

<p>
The president of the university will make the decision to award or deny expedited continuing appointment and appropriate rank and will notify the university provost, campus provost  and dean orally as soon as possible after decision is made. The dean will notify the unit head and the academic professional candidate as soon as possible thereafter.  The president will provide a written notice of the decision within ten days to the same university administrators and the unit head and academic professional. 

<p>
<b>Denial </b>

<p>
If the president denies the award of expedited continuing appointment and promotion, the academic professional will receive a regular contract for the following year.
