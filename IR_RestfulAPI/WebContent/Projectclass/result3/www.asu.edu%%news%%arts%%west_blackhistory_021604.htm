      <h2>ASU West celebrates Black History Month </h2>
      <p>Two accomplished African-American women will be in the spotlight as ASU West's Black History Month Committee presents its annual series of events throughout February. Filmmaker and author Carroll Parrott Blue will speak at 7 p.m., Feb. 19, in the La Sala ballroom, while educator and civil rights activist Jean Fairfax will receive the committee's Pioneer Award during a Feb. 26 celebration. </p>
      <p>Blue's keynote address, "The Dawn at My Back: Growing a 21st Century Story," is part of the Black History Month Committee's Africana Lecture Series in collaboration with the Ethnic Studies Fourth Annual Lecture Series. A reception will be held at 5 p.m. Call (602) 543-4502 to R.S.V.P., or register online at (www.west.asu.edu/bhm/keynoteregform.htm). </p>
      <p>Blue is a documentary filmmaker, photographer, writer and professor at San Diego State University. In her book, "The Dawn at My Back: Memoir of a Black Texas Upbringing," she reveals some extraordinary accounts of racism, sexism and classism while growing up in Texas. </p>
      <p>Eloquently addressing these issues before and during the Civil Rights Movement, she shares her own and her mother's lives as African-American women growing up in the segregated south. </p>
      <p>Blue's award-winning films include "Varnette's World: A Study of a Young Artist," "Conversations with Roy DeCarava," "Nigerian Arts - Kindred Spirits," and "Mystery of the Senses: Vision." </p>
      <p>Fairfax of Phoenix will be honored for a lifetime of public service during "An Evening of Nia," a celebration featuring culture, food and music at 6 p.m., Feb. 26, in the La Sala ballroom. This event is sponsored in part by the Ethnic Studies program, College of Arts and Sciences, and Office of the Provost and Academic Affairs. </p>
      <p>Fairfax has worked for racial and gender justice on many fronts, including the American Friends Service Committee, where she directed the Southern Civil Rights Program, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund as director of Community Service Programs. </p>
      <p>She has been an active board member and committee member of numerous nonprofit and religious organizations, including the World Council of Churches, National Public Radio, and Harvard Divinity School. </p>
      <p>Fairfax and her sister, Betty Fairfax, generated a great deal of attention in 1987 when they adopted the eighth grade class at Phoenix's Mary McLeod Bethune School and promised scholarships to all 92 students at the inner-city school who finished high school and went to college. Fairfax also was instrumental in forming state coalitions of African-Americans interested in the further desegregration of public higher education institutions. </p>
      <p>Fairfax has been active in philanthropy for the past 35 years, serving as a trustee of numerous foundations. For the past decade she has worked as a consultant on issues of black philanthropy. </p>
      <p>There is no admission charge for ASU West's Black History Month events. (There is a charge for visitor parking on campus.) </p>
