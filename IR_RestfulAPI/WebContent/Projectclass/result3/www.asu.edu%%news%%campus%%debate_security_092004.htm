      <h2>Security officials prepare for presidential debate</a></h2>
      <p> The scheduled presidential debate between President George W. Bush and Sen. John Kerry, D.-Mass, at Gammage Auditorium is still almost a month away, but security officials already have been meeting for many months to prepare for the Oct. 13 event.</p>
      <p> &ldquo;The security preparations for this event are part of a unified effort between campus, city, state and federal authorities,&rdquo; says Commander John Sutton of the ASU Police Department.</p>
      <p> Sutton and DPS Chief John Pickens say they constantly are evaluating a wide range of security measures as the debate date approaches.</p>
      <p> &ldquo;As things develop, we&rsquo;ll let you know,&rdquo; Pickens says.</p>
      <p> That&rsquo;s not to say things won&rsquo;t be different on campus on the day of the debate, Sutton says. There will be some disruption to campus life in the area around Gammage, which can&rsquo;t be helped with an event of this magnitude. In addition, security teams will be monitoring the area and adjusting their coverage as necessary.</p>
      <p> The list of anticipated alterations to normal campus life includes:</p>
      <p> &bull; Two perimeter fences will be erected around Gammage as part of the ongoing security preparations. The interior perimeter fence will include the sidewalks outside of Gammage; the outer perimeter fence will include the park area near Gammage, but not the Music Department and the Farmer Building . The southern entrance to Farmer will be blocked off by the perimeter fence.</p>
      <p> &bull; There will be no more classes held in Gammage after Oct. 8, until after the debate.</p>
      <p> &bull; Parking displacements will affect those in Lot 3, which surrounds Gammage, and Structure 1, which is located just south of the W. P. Carey School of Business.</p>
      <p> In addition, there will be a staging area for DPS equipment in Lot 40, which means less spaces available for parking, and Lot 59 on the north side of campus will have more people in it than usual because of an expected audience to watch a debate simulcast at Wells Fargo Arena.</p>
      <p> &bull; Driving routes also will be restricted for the debate. Forest Avenue and Gammage Parkway definitely will be closed because of the security perimeter, and additional road closures will go into effect when the motorcades for Bush and Kerry make their way to the ASU campus. Because of security concerns, the planned motorcade routes are not being announced in advance. </p>
      <p> &bull; Residents of Center Complex will have access in and out only through the east entrance. There are no plans to post officers in the residence halls, although Residential Life officials will be asked to let only residents into the buildings.</p>
      <p> In addition to all these alterations, there also will be a &ldquo;speaker&rsquo;s corner&rdquo; set up in the athletic field north of the SRC.</p>
      <p> Academic Senate President Barbara Kerr, a professor in psychology in education, says she has heard the concerns of faculty members who have classes in the buildings closest to Gammage on the day of the debate. </p>
      <p> But Kerr, who met with Pickens and Sutton to review the security preparations for the debate, also pointed to the importance of the event. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;This is a historic event that we are proud to be a part of,&rdquo; Kerr says. &ldquo;A public university is not only about education, but also about preparation for citizenship.&rdquo;</p>
      <p> As Oct. 13 draws nearer, Sutton and Pickens are busy preparing for ASU&rsquo;s big day in the national spotlight.</p>
      <p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be alert for suspicious behavior, just like we are on any normal day,&rdquo; Sutton says. &ldquo;Obviously, the closer to Gammage people are, the more police will be on alert.&rdquo;</p>
      <p> Both also point out that all the security plans being drawn up are still subject to approval by the Secret Service.</p>
