<h1 class="storyhead">ASU researchers and architects to build 'green' home for family in need</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p><em><strong> Uniquely-designed home will serve as active research facility, prototype for development </strong></em></p>
<p>Researchers and architects at ASU believe it is possible to build an affordable, sustainable home that also conserves energy and is sensitive to cultural traditions. To that end, they will tackle this challenge during the 2006 Affordable + Sustainable Design/Build Project created by the ASU Stardust Center for Affordable Homes and the Family.</p>
<p><img src="images/20060315stardust_students.jpg" width="210" height="177" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">This year&rsquo;s project takes place in Guadalupe, a small town near the Tempe campus that faces stagnant development and poverty. To help transform Guadalupe&rsquo;s economic position and enhance its rundown neighborhoods, the center offered to design and build an affordable and sustainable home that can serve as a prototype for development, says Daniel Glenn, design director for the center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guadalupe is one of the poorest communities in the state with the most need, and it has an active, vibrant Yaqui and Mexican-American culture that offers unique possibilities for the home&rsquo;s design,&rdquo; Glenn says.</p>
<p><strong>Culturally responsive design </strong></p>
<p>The prototype in Guadalupe is being designed and built to accommodate the family&rsquo;s cultural traditions and lifestyle. The homeowners, Olivia and Aurelio Bejarano, volunteered to participate in this research opportunity so they could build a new, affordable home in place of their existing residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project is helping us build a dream home, but in an affordable way,&rdquo; says Olivia Bejarano. &ldquo;We love the design of our new home and look forward to living in it as a family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The floor plan includes a spare bedroom and bathroom adjacent to the home, but separated from the main living quarters, to accommodate the Bejaranos&rsquo; 24-year-old son. At the front of the home, the plans call for a multipurpose room that can be used as a guest room or an office.</p>
<p>Olivia Bejarano sells ice cream and candy to local children out of her home &ndash; a business her mother started years ago in the existing home &ndash; and this room will help her continue the family tradition.</p>
<p>With the home&rsquo;s innovative, L-shaped design, the main living areas face a private courtyard that can serve as a large outdoor room for family gatherings, a frequent affair at the Bejarano household.</p>
<p>The Bejaranos face everyday challenges that also needed to be addressed in the home&rsquo;s design. Aurelio Bejarano recently suffered a stroke, and the home will be tailored for his needs. The master bedroom includes a fully accessible bathroom and all doorways, and hallways are designed to accommodate a wheelchair in case it is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Green building techniques and materials</strong></p>
<p>In addition to being aesthetically appealing and culturally responsive, the home will conserve energy. The ASU Stardust Center design team considered several methods for achieving efficiency, from using renewable materials to incorporating innovative energy methods. This home will achieve energy efficiency from the layout of the home, as well as its materials and alternative systems. Before building the home, the design team first tested all materials to determine its energy performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Computer simulations of a similar home with conventional systems have demonstrated a 54 percent savings in annual energy costs,&rdquo; Glenn says. &ldquo;However, the Bejaranos will most likely save about 80 percent in energy costs because their home will have new and alternative systems that take advantage of the natural climate for heating and cooling.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="images/20060315rendering.jpg" width="290" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Recognizing that Arizona&rsquo;s sunny climate can serve as a resource, the ASU Stardust Center design team decided to incorporate solar power as the home&rsquo;s energy source. Photovoltaic panels will be placed on the roof to supply all of the home&rsquo;s electrical power.</p>
<p>To help combat the extreme summer temperatures, the team created a home layout that uses traditional Mexican design techniques to create natural cooling and ventilation. The L-shaped layout of the home allows the trapping of cool air within the center courtyard, and a ventilating system then captures the cool air and distributes it throughout the home. </p>
<p>A continuous shade trellis will be built alongside the longer portion of the home to protect the windows from heat gain in the summer. It also will allow sunlight, combined with a gas fireplace ducted with a hydronic heat system, to help warm the home in the winter.</p>
<p>In addition to using design techniques for energy efficiency, the ASU Stardust Center is working with innovative materials produced in Arizona. During last year&rsquo;s design/build project, researchers discovered a new energy-saving product that can be used for exterior walls. Created by the Navajo Housing Authority, Navajo FlexCrete is an aerated fly-ash concrete block ideal for Arizona&rsquo;s desert climate as it provides mass and insulation at a more affordable price. </p>
<p>The roof of the home will consist of structural insulated panels, created by Sticks and Structures, to provide an insulation R-value of 40. At this level, the home will have a highly insulated roof that eliminates the need for an attic.</p>
<p>This home will not need an attic, because it will be built with an alternative air conditioning system created by Alter-Air. This revolutionary new system uses a third of the energy required for traditional units by cooling the home with water instead of compressed Freon. Plus, instead of conventional ducts, the unit has an exposed duct system made out of fabric to cool or heat the home evenly.</p>
<p>The home&rsquo;s flat roof will be protected from sun and rain by a product called Mirrorseal, a non-toxic, waterproof material. With its pure white color, Mirrorseal reflects the sun&rsquo;s rays and greatly reduces the roof&rsquo;s heat absorption.</p>
<p>The interior walls will be constructed with Durra Wall Panels for a more affordable alternative to conventional framed walls. The panels, which are made of a compressed, recycled wheat straw, are narrower than traditional walls to save space, and they produce better sound insulation. This new product, which has the same look and feel of traditional wall panels, eliminates the wall framing process and saves resources.</p>
<p>The ASU Stardust Center will monitor the home&rsquo;s energy performance as part of its research in developing homes that are affordable and sustainable, and that use green-building techniques and materials. </p>
<p><strong>Community effort</strong></p>
<p>Since this home will serve as a model for development in Guadalupe, the town&rsquo;s citizens have been involved with the design process. In February, several Guadalupe citizens, along with the Bejaranos and ASU Stardust Center architects, attended an interactive workshop to determine the home&rsquo;s layout. Citizens formed three groups, and each group assembled a desired floor plan using &ldquo;kit-of-parts&rdquo; models. After reviewing the three different models, the Bejaranos and community members combined favorable aspects of each to create the final design.</p>
<p><img src="images/20060315stardust_volunteer.jpg" width="240" height="204" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">&ldquo;It was important for us to receive input from our neighbors and family members,&rdquo; says Olivia Bejarano. &ldquo;With their help, we were able to design our own home to meet our family&rsquo;s needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Town participation will continue during construction of the new home, as the Guadalupe chapter of national organization YouthBuild USA will construct the home with the Stardust Center&rsquo;s assistance. YouthBuild is a nonprofit organization that assists young people ages 16 &ndash; 24 in working toward their GED or high school diploma while learning job skills through building affordable homes for low-income people in their communities. Additionally, more than 50 ASU students from the College of Design and Del E. Webb School of Construction are volunteering their time to help build the Bejaranos&rsquo; new home. ASU Stardust Center staff will oversee the project and educate the volunteers in alternative construction techniques. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This project has gained the attention of the national YouthBuild office, and they are planning to make a case study out of the project as part of their effort to promote green homes,&rdquo; says Gail Acosta, director of the Guadalupe YouthBuild chapter.</p>
