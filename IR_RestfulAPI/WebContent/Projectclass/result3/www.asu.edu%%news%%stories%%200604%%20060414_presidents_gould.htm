        <p><strong>Regents' and President's Professors </strong></p>
        <p>This year ASU is honoring the first class of ASU President's Professors. This new prestigious award, is designed to reward enthusiasm and innovation in teaching, the ability to inspire original and creative work by students, mastery of subject matter and scholarly contributions.</p>
        <p> Inaugural awardees are <a href="../200603/20060309_cerveny.htm">Randall Cerveny</a>, professor of geography; Alice Christie, associate professor of technology and education; Ian Gould, professor of chemistry and biochemistry; and the late Paul Rothstein, associate professor of industrial design.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/feature/includes/spring05/readmore/presprof.html">ASU selects inaugural President's Professors</a></p>
        <p>Six ASU faculty members have been awarded Regents Professor appointments for 2006. Regents&rsquo; Professors are marked by excellence in teaching, exceptional achievements in research or other creative activities, and national and international distinction in their fields. Named by the Arizona Board of Regents, they serve as advisers to the university president and take on a broader role as consultants and teachers throughout the university.</p>
        <p> The members of this year's Regents' Professor class are: <a href="../200602/20060209_regents_candelaria.htm">Cordelia Candelaria</a>, Chicana and Chicano Studies; <a href="../200603/20060323_regents_chavez.htm">Carlos Castillo-Chavez</a>, Mathematics and Statistics Department; <a href="../200602/20060202_regents_montgomery.htm">Douglas Montgomery</a>, Industrial Engineering Department; <a href="20060407_regents_poste.htm">George Poste</a>, Biodesign Institute and School of Life Sciences; <a href="../200602/20060216_regents_prescott.htm">Edward Prescott</a>, Economics Department, <a href="../200603/20060331__regents_windhorst.htm">Rogier Windhorst</a>, Physics and Astronomy Department. </p>

<p>Organic photochemist Ian Gould has distinguished himself in industry and academia. While at Eastman Kodak, Gould attained an international reputation for his research into the interaction of light and matter. His studies helped uncover the basic chemical principles underlying photography and photosynthetic solar energy harvesting. </p>
<p>"During the last two or three years I was at Eastman Kodak, I spent a lot of time collaborating with graduate students at the University of Rochester," Gould says. </p>
<p>The curiosity and energy of the students was inspiring, to the point that Gould reasoned, after almost 20 years of research, that it might be a good idea to try something new "before getting too old." </p>
<p>With his photochemistry background, an academic position at ASU was a natural fit. In 1998, at the age of 41, Gould joined the faculty in the chemistry and biochemistry department in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. </p>
<p>"I was one of the oldest assistant professors in the United States," he says. "I was quite worried because I hadn't worked with undergraduates before." </p>
<p>He had shared his ambition and his concerns with his brother - an educator who teaches teachers how to teach. According to Gould, his brother laughed, yet agreed to help him and recommended several books to read on learning theories and teaching theories. Gould spent several days in the library in his native United Kingdom tackling the reading assignments. Afterward, Gould tried to incorporate all the theories he read about into the undergraduate organic chemistry classes he taught. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, with 350 students in the class, and only two or three of them majors, Gould says there were moments in his first semesters when he honestly didn't know why he was teaching organic chemistry to students who didn't really need to know all of the detailed material included in the standard course. </p>
<p>"After a couple of years, I knew for a fact that, two weeks after finals, students would forget all the facts that were taught," he says. "I eventually learned that the purpose (of teaching) is not to transfer facts, but to help students learn how to learn." </p>
<p>Organic chemistry is a famously difficult course, Gould says. </p>
<p>"No student finds it easy," he says. "The problems in organic chemistry are tough to solve." </p>
<p>Gould's goal was to introduce students to different ways of learning to solve the problems. </p>
<p>"I try to emphasize to my students that the most important part of my courses is not the material but learning how to learn," he says. </p>
<p>"Dr. Gould clearly has a natural gift for lecturing, but his talents go much beyond this aspect of teaching," says Robert Blankenship, chair of the chemistry and biochemistry department. "He truly cares that the students learn and (he) is willing to put in enormous amounts of time with them, both in larger groups and one-on-one. He has an amazing ability to synthesize disparate information and present it in a clear and uncluttered way, while not sacrificing rigor." </p>
<p>Gould's exceptional commitment to his students has resulted in a number of awards for his teaching skills. In 2001, he was named a Cottrell Scholar, a national award given to the best teacher-scholars early in their careers. In 2002, he received the college's Distinguished Teaching Award. Then, in 2004, he gained the attention of ASU President Michael Crow, who identified Gould as one of the university's "rising stars." That year, he also earned tenure and jumped from being an assistant professor to full professor, bypassing the associate rank - a significant achievement for someone just completing his sixth year on the faculty. </p>
<p>Last year, Gould became one of only four ASU faculty members selected to carry the title President's Professor, a distinction created to reward enthusiasm and innovation in teaching, given to professors who have made outstanding contributions to undergraduate education. </p>
<p>The transition from industry to academia was not natural for Gould, who spent 12 years at Kodak "going to work every day with the same group of researchers, eating lunch with the same group, at the same table." </p>
<p>"I did research for 20 years. This interaction-people thing with undergraduate students was very new to me," he says. "All of a sudden, I had a whole menagerie of life wandering into my office. However, I've been surprised to find that teaching and research are more similar than different." </p>
<p>Gould started an annual undergraduate research symposium at ASU in the department of chemistry and biochemistry, giving young researchers an opportunity to orally present their work. </p>
<p>Together with his wife, Deena, who is an elementary teacher in Mesa, Gould also established a K-12 program that mobilizes ASU chemistry students and local teachers to help schoolchildren be aware of college opportunities, exemplifying Crow's direction for ASU to be more engaged in the community. </p>
<p>"We bring ASU students into the classroom several times a semester," he says. "We answer questions about why to go to college, and we do science demonstrations." </p>
<p>Additionally, the ASU students just hang out with the younger students, serving as role models, and the sixth-graders take a field trip to campus. </p>
<p>With his wife, Gould has prepared worksheets for the students that integrate the Arizona science standards for the fifth and sixth grades. </p>
<p>"She's convinced this is the best thing she's tried to motivate her students," Gould says. "By the time the young students graduate, they will have interacted with ASU students several times. It's a way to get going to college on their radar screens." </p>
