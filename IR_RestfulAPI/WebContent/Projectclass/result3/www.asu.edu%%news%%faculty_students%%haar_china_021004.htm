      <h2>Professor travels to China to combat domestic violence, give presentations </h2>
      <p>While living for a year in China as a U.S. Fulbright Scholar, Robin Haarr experienced life in a society in which women are traditionally considered second-class citizens, witnessed several instances of violence against women on the streets, and heard stories of wife abuse from her Chinese friends. Haarr, an associate professor of criminal justice and criminology at ASU West, was motivated to apply her expertise regarding violence against women to address the treatment of women in China. </p>
      <p>Haarr's most recent trip to China, in December 2003, took her to Beijing and three cities in northwestern provinces of the country. She delivered eight presentations about wife abuse to academic researchers, government and criminal justice officials, victim advocates and students. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing also coordinated Haarr's participation in a Web chat, focusing on family violence, hosted by the Beijing Youth Daily. </p>
      <p>"We weren't sure how the subject of wife abuse would be received in these northwest provinces - we traveled to some rather remote areas," says Haarr, who was accompanied by Darrell Jenks, director of the U.S. Embassy's American Center for Educational Exchanges. "At first I kept my presentations focused on causes of wife abuse and developing community responses to domestic violence, but as the trip went along I began talking about the feminist movement in the United States and feminist theories of wife abuse, which the audiences were extremely interested in discussing." </p>
      <p>Efforts to combat violence against women in China are complicated by the fact that the beating of one's wife is often considered a natural and acceptable part of the marital relationship, along with the fact that sizeable portions of the population are hesitant to "as they say, air their dirty laundry in public," Haarr says. Her research interests focus on violence against women, particularly in East Asia and Central Asian Muslim societies, as well as on women working in police organizations. </p>
      <p>"I'm committed to doing all I can to facilitate education, research and capacity-building as it relates to violence against women in Asian societies," Haarr says. </p>
      <p>Haarr served as a U.S. Fulbright Scholar in China during the 2001 - 2002 academic year. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing invited her to return in January 2003 to make three presentations in Beijing about women's rights and wife abuse. The success of that trip prompted the December trip to Beijing and three provinces - Ningxia, Gansu, and Qinghai. </p>
      <p>Haarr's work in China led to an invitation from the government of Tajikistan to work on domestic violence issues in that former Soviet Republic. She spent three weeks there during the summer of 2003 under the auspices of the U.S. Agency for International Development. </p>
      <p>Her work in Tajikistan included conducting workshops in two cities. Some of the workshop participants have since formed an officially registered consortium committed to working with Haarr to advance women's rights and develop a coordinated community response to violence against women. </p>
      <p>To facilitate her continued work, Haarr is in her second semester of Russian language classes at ASU Main. Also, the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi, Vietnam has invited her to speak about wife abuse this summer in Hanoi. </p>
      <p>"As a woman living in a society that provides me with a great deal of gender equality and freedom, I feel an obligation and commitment to work with non-governmental organizations and other international organizations to advance women's rights and reduce violence against women in societies in which women lack rights and are often relegated to the status of a second-class citizen," Haarr says. "Women's human rights issues and problems of violence against women cross borders, and we need to engage in research, education, and capacity-building to address them." </p>
      <p>At ASU West, Haarr teaches classes including "Women, Crime and Justice" and the graduate course "Domestic Violence," which she developed for ASU West's Master of Arts in Criminal Justice degree program. She serves as a graduate adviser to several students in that program. Haarr received her Ph.D. in criminal justice from Michigan State University. </p>
