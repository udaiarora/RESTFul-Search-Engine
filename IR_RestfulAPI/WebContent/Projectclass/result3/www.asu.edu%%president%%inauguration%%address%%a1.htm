The breakthroughs         in the natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities, and fields         of technology that are the result of university research are too many         to consider. The impact of university research, and university partnership         with business and industry on the American economy is profound. The American         research university has contributed enormously to the wealth and productivity         of the nation. </P>      <P> Our cultural landscape, too, has in many ways been defined by the discovery         and scholarship that takes place in our research universities. Through         their graduate programs our research universities have been largely responsible         for educating successive generations of our nation&#8217;s leaders in         government, business, and industry, our educators, scientists, engineers,         artists, and health care professionals. </P>      <P> But the American research university must not be static&#8212;it must         be dynamic. In response to the demands and opportunities of a changing         world, the American research university must evolve. In recent decades         various possible models have been proposed for what many have termed &#8220;the         new American university.&#8221; While each of these models offers insight         and ideas, none go far enough to embrace the changes ahead. When I speak         of the new American university, I do not refer to any usage except my         own, and my vision for Arizona State University.</P>      <P> The new American university would cultivate excellence in teaching,         research, and public service, providing the best possible education to         the broadest possible spectrum of society. The new American university         would embrace the educational needs of the entire population&#8212;not         only a select group, and not only the verbally or mathematically gifted.         The success of the new American university will be measured not by who         the university <em>excludes</em>, but rather by who the university <em>includes</em>,         and from this inclusion will come its contributions to the advancement         of society.</P>      <P> I believe that Arizona State University is uniquely poised to become         such an institution. Not only can Arizona State University surpass its         existing excellence in teaching, research, and public service, I believe         it can break the mold of the current model for the American research university,         and serve as a bellwether in its reconceptualization. <br>        The economic and cultural vitality of the State of Arizona is inextricably         linked with the vitality of its universities. The transformation of Arizona         State University will transform the State of Arizona, enriching it economically         and culturally. But let us not limit our vision because the development         of a new American university here in Arizona will have impact beyond the         borders of our state. </P>      </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td align="left" valign="bottom"><a href="introduction.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br>      </strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="b1.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="b1.htm"><img src="images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
