      <h2>ASU researchers develop technique to aid coronary bypasses</h2>
      <p>        Severe spasm of blood vessels contributes to the failure of coronary
          bypass surgeries and to strokes following the rupture of an aneurysm
          in the brain. A complex signaling pathway controls relaxation in smooth
      muscle cells, but ASU researchers have created a way to bypass it.</p>
      <p>The
            research team, led by Colleen Brophy, ASU bioengineering professor,
          has found that the imitator of HSP20 causes which causes relaxation
        in the same way as the natural protein. This research, published in the
          online version of "The FASEB Journal," is a major step in the development
        of a drug that promotes blood vessel relaxation.</p>
      <p>The signaling pathway
          that causes relaxation in smooth muscle cells involves many different
          proteins, but the last step is the addition of a phosphate
          group, or phosphorylation, of the protein HSP20, which actually effects
          relaxation. Other groups have developed molecules, such as the active
          ingredient in Viagra, that affect earlier steps in this pathway. But
        if a problem occurs in later steps, these compounds are ineffective.</p>
      <p>"You've
          got all those signaling pathways, but, boom, you can bypass them by
        putting in a mimetic of the protein that's the effector molecule,"
          said Brophy, director of the Center for Protein and Peptide Pharmaceuticals
        in the Arizona Biodesign Institute.</p>
      <p>The HSP20 mimetic developed at ASU
          consists of a 13 amino acid stretch of the protein attached to a protein
          transduction domain, a peptide that
          allows the mimetic to enter cells. The HSP20 portion of the mimetic
        includes a phosphate group attached to the same amino acid as in the
        active version
        of natural HSP20.</p>
      <p>Brophy, who is also chief of vascular surgery at the
          Carl T. Hayden Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and her colleagues
        measured the contraction of
          thin rings of smooth muscle from the coronary arteries of pigs with
        a force transducer. They pre-contracted the muscles by adding the hormone
          serotonin, then added either their HSP20 mimetic, a scrambled version
          of the HSP20 mimetic, or papaverine, a compound known to relax muscles
        by acting earlier in the signal pathway.</p>
      <p>The HSP20 mimetic caused the
          rings of muscle to relax in a dose-dependent fashion, as did papaverine.
          The scrambled mimetic did not cause any change.</p>
      <p>Furthermore,
          in collaboration with Intrinsic Bioprobes, Inc., the researchers used
          a mass spectrometer to look at the natural HSP20 proteins in the
          rings. They found both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated HSP20
        in papaverine-treated muscle, but only non-phosphorylated HSP20 in mimetic-treated
        muscle. Thus, the mimetic induces relaxation by its own action.</p>
      <p>Brophy
          and colleagues also attached a fluorescent protein to their mimetic
        so that they could see the location of the mimetic in the rings of muscle
          and individual muscle cells. They found that it was evenly distributed,
        with a transduction efficiency of about 90 percent.</p>
      <p>This research is part
          of an overarching goal to create protein-based pharmaceuticals to treat
          a variety of diseases. The next step is to take
          a HSP20 mimetic into stage one clinical trials so that its efficacy
        and safety in humans can be tested. </p>
      <p>"I'm interested in approaching science
          from a bedside to bench and back to bedside approach," said Brophy,
        who is also a vascular surgeon. "We
          hope to be very applied in terms of looking at clinically relevant
        problems for which there's an unmet need, then developing experimental
        approaches
          to solving these problems, and then, based on experimental discoveries,
        engineer molecules that can be used to treat human disease."</p>
      <p>Along with
          Brophy, the research team includes ASU's Alyssa Panitch, assistant
        professor of bioengineering; Lokesh Joshi, assistant research professor
          of plant biology; Jeffrey Thresher, kinesiology research specialist;
          Charles Flynn, bioengineering assistant research scientist; and Padmini
        Komalavilas, adjunct professor of bioengineering.</p>
