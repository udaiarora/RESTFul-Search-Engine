			<h3><a name="whatIsASURITE" id="whatIsASURITE"></a>What is an ASURITE Account?</h3>
			<p>Your ASURITE Account is your primary login for ASU computing services. Please see our <a href="asurite.htm">ASURITE</a> description page for further details. </p>
			
<p> <a href="#top"> Back to Top </a> </p>
<br />
				
			<h3><a name="asuriteEmail" id="ASURITEemail"></a>Does creating an ASURITE Account give me an e-mail account?</h3>
			<p>Creating or activating an ASURITE Account does not automatically provide you with an e-mail account. You will be given the option of creating an email address (usually your firstname.lastname@asu.edu). Depending on your status with the university, you will have the option of either forwarding incoming messages to a non-<acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> mailbox or creating a mailbox on ASU's e-mail servers. The option of creating a mailbox on ASU's e-mail servers is available to all faculty, staff, and students who are currently taking classes or have been admitted for a future semester. Changes to e-mail forwarding may be made in the <acronym title="Electronic Post Office">EPO</acronym> Update section of <acronym title="Electronic Messaging Menu Application">EMMA</acronym>, which you can get to from the <a href="http://my.asu.edu">myASU</a> webpage. </p>
			
<p> <a href="#top"> Back to Top </a> </p>
<br />
				
			<h3><a name="howToActivate" id="howToActivate"></a>How do I create/activate an ASURITE Account?</h3>
			<p>ASURITE Accounts may be activated online at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/asurite/">http://www.asu.edu/asurite/</a>. If you are activating the account from an off-campus location or non-ASU <acronym title="Internet Protocol">IP</acronym> address, you will need an Activation Code. The Admissions offices send activation codes to new applicants within two weeks of applying. The timeframe may be longer for international students, since the letters are sent by regular air mail. The <acronym title="University Technology Office">UTO</acronym> Help Desk may be able to provide you with an activation code if you call 480-965-6500. </p>

			<h3><a name="whatIsASURITE" id="whatIsUserID"></a>What is my ASURITE UserID?</h3>
			<p>Your ASURITE UserID is an auto-generated username based on your actual name. It is 5-8 characters in length. The typical format is the first letter of your first name plus as many characters of your last name (surname) as can fit. Your UserID may vary from that format if someone else already has that UserID. If you know your password but have forgotten your ASURITE UserID, you may retrieve it by logging into the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/asurite/">ASURITE Account Management</a> webpage. Use your 9-digit ASU ID number on the first screen. </p>
			
<p> <a href="#top"> Back to Top </a> </p>
<br />
				
			<h3><a name="cancelASURITE" id="cancelASURITE"></a>How do I edit or cancel my ASURITE Account?</h3>
			<p>You may add services to your ASURITE Account by logging into the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/asurite/">ASURITE Account Management</a> webpage and subscribing to the desired services. A list of available services may be found on our <a href="services.htm">ASURITE Services</a> webpage. The IT Help Desk staff may be able to create a new UserID for you if the one you have is offensive in some way, or if a clerical error caused a misspelling of your name. New UserID creation is rare and should only be considered when absolutely necessary (as opposed to simply desired). It can be a difficult and time-consuming process for the IT Help Desk staff as well as for the user. The IT Help Desk staff can disable account services you no longer need or want (ie, an e-mailbox on our servers), but we typically do not completely disable an ASURITE Account unless the owner of that account is deceased. </p>

<br />
				
			<h3><a name="verificationEmail" id="verificationEmail"></a>I signed up for an ASURITE Account but never received a verification e-mail. Where is it?</h3>
			<p>We do not send e-mail notification for account activation. You may print the summary page at the end of the activation process if you would like to keep a reminder of your account information. Please do not write your password on that page (or anywhere else)! </p>
			
<p> <a href="#top"> Back to Top </a> </p>
<br />
				
			<h3><a name="accountDelay" id="accountDelay"></a>Once I activate my ASURITE UserID, are there any delays before I'll be able to use ASU computing resources?</h3>
			<p>Yes.  Some of the service subscriptions may not be fully functional immediately after they've been activated.  Examples include (but are not limited to) both the student and employee email services (up to half an hour) and the PPP dialup service (up to 4 hours).  In addition to those possible delays, you may experience delays in being able to access some ASU webpages.  The <a href="http://my.asu.edu" target="_blank">myASU</a> webpage may not recognize your name or your classes until approximately 8 a.m. the morning after you activate your account.  If your ASURITE UserID was just created the same day you activated it (a very rare situation), you will not be able to access <a href="http://www.asu.edu/interactive/" target="_blank">ASU Interactive</a> until approximately 7 a.m. Arizona-time the next morning (Noon on Sundays).</p>

			<h3><a name="activationCookies" id="activationCookies"></a>I cannot get past the &quot;Activate ASURITE Account&quot; page, or I'm seeing a message to enable my cookies. What should I do?</h3>
			<p>The ASURITE Account activation webpage requires that your web browser (Internet Explorer, Netscape, Firefox, Safari, etc.) have &quot;cookies&quot; enabled. If you are not sure how to activate cookies, please see the Help menu of your web browser for more information. Contact the IT Help Desk at 480-965-6500 if you continue to experience problems with the activation process. </p>

			<h3><a name="whereChangePassword" id="whereChangePassword"></a>Where can I change my ASURITE password?</h3>
			<p>Please see the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/changepassword">ASURITE Password Changer</a> webpage for details. For information about resetting additional passwords, see our <a href="password.htm">Password Reset</a> webpage.</p>
			
<p> <a href="#top"> Back to Top </a> </p>
<br />
				
			<h3><a name="loginAfterPasswordChange" id="loginAfterPasswordChange"></a>Will I have to login to everything again after changing my password?</h3>
			<p>No. ASU employs a &quot;single sign-on&quot; system for ASURITE logins. Once you've logged into one webpage on that system, you will automatically be logged into any other webpages that are part of the single sign-on group. This includes myASU and ASU Interactive. If you close your web browser, or switch to a different web browser, you will have to login again. </p>
			
<p> <a href="#top"> Back to Top </a> </p>
<br />
				
			<h3><a name="asuriteSystems" id="asuriteSystems"></a>Which systems use my ASURITE UserID and password?</h3>
			<p>The ASURITE UserID and password are used for logging into IT computing sites and classrooms, the unix servers (general.asu.edu, stats.asu.edu, research.asu.edu, etc), <a href="http://my.asu.edu" target="_blank">myASU</a>, <a href="http://www.asu.edu/interactive/" target="_blank"><acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> Interactive</a>, <a href="http://www.asu.edu/asurite" target="_blank"><acronym title="Arizona State University Rational Information Technology Environment">ASURITE</acronym> Account Management</a>, <a href="http://www.asu.edu/affiliateweb/">Affiliate Web</a>, <a href="http://webwork.asu.edu" target="_blank">WeBWorK</a>, making a <acronym title="Point to Point Protocol">PPP</acronym> dial-up connection to ASU, or logging in at the Checkpoint <acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym>&#47;SecuRemote window. Additional uses for the ASURITE login are added all the time, so this list is by no means complete. Look for an icon of a key with the words &quot;Login ASURITE&quot; as an indication that you should use your ASURITE UserID and password. </p>
			
<p> <a href="#top"> Back to Top </a> </p>
<br />
				
			<h3><a name="synchPasswords" id="synchPasswords"></a>Why does synchonizing my passwords help prevent login problems?</h3>
			<p>There are several password systems that are all associated with the ASURITE UserID. Synchronizing those passwords so they are all set to the same value will help eliminate confusion during the login process. That way, you won't need to be conscious of which password is used by each individual system you might be logging into. If you are experiencing problems logging into something, synchronizing your passwords at the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/changepassword">ASURITE Password Changer</a> website is a good way to at least eliminate the password as the source of the problem, if not correct the problem outright.</p>

<p> <a href="#top"> Back to Top </a> </p>
<br />
				
			<h3><a name="passwordStrengthMeter" id="passwordStrengthMeter"></a>What does the password strength meter mean on the password reset page?</h3>
			<p>The password strength meter is an indication of how secure your password is. It is possible to meet ASU's password requirements while still not having a very secure password. In order to set a password, you must meet our minimum requirements of 8 characters containing at least one character from 3 of the 4 possible character types (lowercase letter, uppercase letter, number, special character). The most secure passwords are 14 characters in length and contain at least one character from each of the four character types. The password strength meter does not check to make sure your password is not a simple word plus a 1 or !, which would still be pretty unsecure. It is up to you to make sure your password is something that would be difficult for other people to guess or for a password cracking program to figure out. </p>
			
<p> <a href="#top"> Back to Top </a> </p>
<br />
				
			<h3><a name="whatIsPassword" id="whatIsPassword"></a>I recently applied online and want to check my admission status. What is my password?</h3>
			<p>The UserID and password you created for the online application process are only valid for that application. Once your application has been entered into the admissions system and an ASURITE UserID has been generated for you, the Admissions Office will send you your ASU ID number, ASURITE UserID, and an activation code that will allow you to activate your ASURITE UserID. This information will usually arrive a week or two after you apply, though it can take longer for international students. If you cannot wait for the UserID and activation code to arrive, please call 480-965-6500 to get your ASURITE UserID and activation code.  Your identity will be verified before we provide the activation code.  If you need to contact Admissions directly, they may be reached at 480-965-7788 (Undergraduate) or 480-965-6113 (Graduate). </p>
			
<p> <a href="#top"> Back to Top </a> </p>
<br />
				
			<h3><a name="securityQuestionsSetup" id="securityQuestionsSetup"></a>How do I setup or change my security questions?</h3>
			<p>Security questions are usually setup as part of the account activation process. However, if you chose not to setup security questions at that time, or you activated your UserID before we had security questions, you may setup or change those questions at the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/asurite/">ASURITE Activation and Service Management</a> website by clicking on &quot;Identity Verification&quot;. You need to choose three questions from drop-down menus, and enter answers for each. Then you will make up a question and answer of your own. Please be careful to choose questions that have only one possible answer, or to enter an answer that you are certain you will remember years later. </p>
			
<p> <a href="#top"> Back to Top </a> </p>
<br />
				
			<h3><a name="failedSecurityAnswers" id="failedSecurityAnswers"></a>I clicked on &quot;I Forgot my UserID/password&quot; and entered my security answers, but I still can't login. What went wrong?</h3>
			<p>Usually, this is an indication that you did not enter one or more of your answers correctly. Remember that the answers must be entered exactly the way you originally created them. Capitalization is not a factor, but things like spaces, punctuation, or plurality are. As an example, let's say you went to Coleman High School in Michigan. They are the Coleman Comets. You choose the question &quot;What was your high school mascot?&quot; and enter &quot;Comet&quot; as the answer. If you later try to reset your password online and enter &quot;Comets&quot; or &quot;Comet!&quot; as your answer to that question, it will fail. Please try answering the questions again, using any slight variations you can think of that might have been your original answer.  Three failed attempts will result in a half-hour period during which you may not attempt to reset your password online. </p></td>
