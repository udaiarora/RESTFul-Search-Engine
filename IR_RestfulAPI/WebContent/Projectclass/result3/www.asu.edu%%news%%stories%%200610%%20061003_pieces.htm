Putting the pieces in place </h1><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> <p>Over the last few years, ASU has made major strides putting the pieces in place to realize the goal of becoming a New American University . A key part of that development has been the formation of new schools that foster teaching and research across traditional boundaries. These new schools are leveraging the university's intellectual capital and making the university stronger as a whole. Here is a brief look at schools that have been approved by the Arizona Board of Regents and launched at ASU. </p><p><strong> </strong></p><table border="0" cellpadding="2">  <tr valign="top">    <td><p><img src="school_photos/community_resources.jpg" width="170" height="170"><br>    </p></td>    <td><p><strong>School </strong><strong> of Community </strong><strong> Resources &amp; Development<br>        </strong><strong>Established: </strong> 2006<br>        <strong>Director: </strong> Randy J.

The school, including the former Department of Recreation Management and Tourism, provides nationally recognized interdisciplinary research expertise and innovative academic programs in nonprofit leadership and management, parks and recreation management, tourism development and management. The highly regarded Center for Nonprofit Leadership and Management is a critical component of the school. </p></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td><img src="school_photos/informatics.jpg" width="170" height="170"></td>    <td><p><strong>School of Computing and Informatics<br>        </strong><strong>Established: </strong>2006<br>        <strong>Director: </strong> Sethuraman &ldquo;Panch&rdquo; Panchanathan<br>        <strong>College: </strong>Fulton School of Engineering</p>        <p>The <a href="http://sci.asu.edu/">School of Computing and Informatics</a> (SCI) is charting a bold course advancing the frontiers of computing and informatics &ndash; areas that will have a tremendous impact on almost every aspect of society. SCI incorporates the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and the new Department of Biomedical Informatics in collaboration with the University of Arizona College of Medicine &ndash; Phoenix . In addition, the school will develop new transdisciplinary computing and informatics research, and academic programs (such as cognitive informatics, sustainability informatics, ecoinformatics, geoinformatics, social informatics, business informatics and policy informatics) through collaboration with entities inside and outside ASU. <strong></strong></p></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td><img src="images/criminology.jpg" width="170" height="170"></td>    <td><p><strong>School of Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice<br>        </strong><strong>Established: </strong> 2006<br>        <strong>Director: </strong> Scott Decker<br>        <strong>College: </strong>College of Human Services</p>        <p>At ASU, criminology and criminal justice is a broad discipline, encompassing the scientific study of crime, criminals, the lawmaking process, the criminal justice system and the treatment of offenders.

Important research themes include monitoring the physical, chemical and biological processes that define evolution of the Earth system &ndash; and, ultimately, its habitability. Beyond Earth, research targets range from the early evolution of the universe to the development and natural history of planets and planetary systems. </p></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td><img src="school_photos/teacher_prep.jpg" width="170" height="170"></td>    <td><p><strong>School of Educational Innovation and Teacher Preparation<br>        </strong><strong>Established: </strong> 2006<br>        <strong>Director: </strong> Bette Bergeron<br>        <strong>College: </strong>East College</p>        <p>The           <a href="http://www.poly.asu.edu/ecollege/education/">School of Educational Innovation and Teacher Preparation</a> at ASU's Polytechnic campus in Mesa takes a decidedly hands-on approach to teacher education.
