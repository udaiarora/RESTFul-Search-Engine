SAS Companion for the OS/390 Environment, Version 8
</H1><P>
To learn about OS/390-specific aspects of the SAS System, this is your     best resource. The usage section shows you how to perform common tasks
such as allocating and accessing files, customizing your SAS session, and  redirecting the SAS log and SAS procedure output. The reference portion
describes SAS language features that are OS/390-specific or that have      OS/390-specific aspects, such as system options, statements, and
procedures. An applications section provides information about optimizing  performance, using the SAS interfaces ISPF and REXX, and other topics of
particular interest to SAS programmers and system administrators. This     documentation is intended for users who are familiar with the SAS System,
but who have not necessarily used the SAS System under OS/390.
