Inquiry access will allow authorized employees to view university-wide data in the personnel inquiry, benefits inquiry, payroll history, personnel history, control tables, and position control screens.<P><B>Update Access</B><P>Update access will be restricted to Personnel Action Form (PAF) and Personnel Data Form (PDF) information for authorized home <A HREF="spp002.html#department">departments.</A> Departments whose employees work for multiple ASU departments can be granted update access with the approval of the employee&#146;s home department.<P>For audit purposes, all turn-around PAFs will be printed with the HRMS ID of the employee that processed the transaction.<P>Employees cannot update their own HRMS records. Human Resources is available to assist departments in processing PAF and PDF changes when an employee must update his or her own record.<P><B>Termination or Transfer of Employees with HRMS Access</B><P>If an employee with HRMS access <A HREF="spp002.html#termination">terminates</A> or <A HREF="spp002.html#transfer">transfers</A> to another department, their HRMS access will be stopped until a new Computer Accounts Access Form is submitted.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Security</B></FONT><P>User IDs identify the person authorized to use a particular system or application, and passwords are keys that unlock access to those applications and systems.  Maintaining a secure computer environment relies on individual users safeguarding and keeping private their access information, including changing their passwords on a regular basis.  If an individual obtains the password to a user&#146;s account, the user may be open to loss of data or unauthorized use of the account.<P><B>Choosing and Safeguarding Passwords</B><P>Passwords that have some connection to the user (e.g., names, addresses, telephone numbers, and initials) are the easiest to break.  This type of information is public knowledge and should not be used to formulate a password.  Common words should not be used for passwords since hackers have programs that automatically search through dictionaries trying each entry as a password.  A good password is impossible to break, easy to remember, and long enough so that trying random combinations of letters will not uncover it.<P>Once the user has chosen a password, it is important to protect it. Do not write the password on paper kept near the workstation.  Users should treat computer accounts and passwords as valuable commodities.<P><B>Changing Passwords</B><P>Passwords should be changed regularly.  The longer a password is in use, the riskier it becomes to use.  If there is any reason to believe that the user&#146;s password is no longer secret or if the user notices someone watching his or her fingers while logging on to the system, change the password at once.<P><B>Using CICS and HRMS Passwords</B><P>Using the HRMS requires a minimum of two user IDs, each with a separate password.  The Customer Information Control System (CICS) is used to access the mainframe database environment in which HRMS operates.  Additionally, anyone connected to HRMS via Ethernet or telephone also needs an AccessCard, which provides another layer of security.  Both CICS and HRMS passwords must be changed every 90 days.<P><B>Composing a Password</B><P>Both CICS and HRMS passwords must be between six and eight characters in length and made up of alphanumeric characters (A through Z and 0 through 9).  Blank spaces and dashes are not accepted.<P><B>Password</B><P>For users who have forgotten their CICS password or have difficulty with the AccessCard, contact Computer Accounts.  For users who have forgotten their HRMS password or have difficulty logging on to HRMS, contact the HRMS Helpline.<P><B>Guidelines for Maintaining HRMS Security</B><P>To assist in maintaining HRMS security, follow the guidelines below:<P><OL><LI>Change passwords after receiving a new user ID.</LI><P><LI>Memorize the new password.</LI><P><LI>Choose a password that is a combination of letters and digits.</LI><P><LI>Never share the password with others.</LI><P><LI>Do not write the password on a paper or Post-it note and attach it to the computer or leave the written password on the desk, in a desk drawer, or on a calendar or desk pad.</LI><P><LI>Log off HRMS before leaving the workstation.</LI><P><LI>Change passwords on a regular basis, e.g., every 90 days or sooner, especially when there is an attempt to access the account or if someone may have learned of the password.</LI><P><LI>Complete the appropriate forms and forward them to Computer Accounts or the HRMS Helpline whenever an HRMS user in the unit is no longer employed or using HRMS, changes department or college, or changes other demographic data (such as change in name), or whenever there is a change of HRMS users.</LI></OL><P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Training</B></FONT><P>Formal HRMS instruction classes are offered to teach ASU employees how to view, understand, and enter data into HRMS: &#147;HRMS Online Inquiry,&#148; in which the user learns how to sign on and do basic navigation in HRMS, and &#147;HRMS Employee Changes,&#148; in which the user learns how to make personnel and payroll changes to employee information.<P>At the department&#146;s option, temporary sign-on capability will be made available for a new employee for up to four weeks with approval of a unit administrator. The ID will expire after four weeks unless the required training is completed. The employee must have authorization and a trained person to oversee his or her work.<P>HRMS training will be made available for completion within a four-week period, based on demand. When demand is not sufficient to conduct a class, HR will assist departments by providing one-to-one training, which allows users to receive permanent sign-on capability.<P>&#160;<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><HR><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">SPP</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | SPP&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="spp001.html">contact</A> | Human&#160;Resources&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="hr.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
