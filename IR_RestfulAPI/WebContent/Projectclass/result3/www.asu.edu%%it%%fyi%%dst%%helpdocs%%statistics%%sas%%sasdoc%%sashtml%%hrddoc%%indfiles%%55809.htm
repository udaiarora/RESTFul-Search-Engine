Researchers and students of applied statistics and the social and          behavioral sciences will find this book indispensable for understanding
both general linear model theory and application.  The model is            discussed using a general framework, enabling students to appreciate
fully the generality of the model.  The authors present and explain in     detail actual SAS code for analyzing general linear model applications.
Additional topics include the following:  ANOVA and MANOVA models with     and without restrictions, the GMANOVA model, the mixed MANOVA-GMANOVA
model, the sum-of-profiles model, the SUR model, the CGMANOVA model,       HLM, mixed models, and the analysis of repeated measures with missing
data.
