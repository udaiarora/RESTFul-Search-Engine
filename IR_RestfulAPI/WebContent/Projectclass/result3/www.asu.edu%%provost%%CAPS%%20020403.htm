      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>April 3, 2002</b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>CAPS Spotlight Speaker:</b> 
        Barbara Mawhiney, Director of Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Office</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Topic:</b> Rationality of 
        the Job Classification System for Academic Professionals</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Present:</b> 27 people</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        The federal government requires ASU to categorize jobs into EEO categories. 
        The Board of Regents uses 5 categories:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Administrative</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Service Professional</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Academic Professional</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Faculty</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Classified Staff</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Academic Professional category 
        was created out of recognition that there are people in positions that 
        require protection (i.e., academic freedom) similar to faculty.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over time, ranks and position 
        names have been codified. In the late 1980's/early 1990's the AP ranks 
        were codified and put into policy under the leadership of Alleen Nilsen. 
        In the mid-90's, the administrative and service professional categories 
        were added.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Academic Associate title 
        was created for APs to have a job title comparable to Faculty Associate. 
        Academic Associates, like Faculty Associates are a single rank title and 
        were never meant to be &quot;on track&quot;. Originally, the Faculty Associate 
        title was for people who were teaching; the Faculty Research Associate 
        title was for people who were doing research for faculty; and the Academic 
        Associates were engaged in a variety of activities that were neither strictly 
        teaching nor research. In recent years many academic advisors were moved 
        to the AP category so that now, at least 50% of Academic Associates are 
        advisors. Academic Associates who are advisors must have a minimum of 
        a master's degree.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About 70% of APs are currently 
        not on track (i.e., not eligible for continuing appointment); roughly 
        37% of these positions are funded from grants. Most APs that are on track 
        are either in the libraries or in science/engineering subject areas.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are 3 categories within 
        the AP classification:</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not on Track: these are 
          year to year contracts that require 90 days notice of non-renewal; termination 
          can be for &quot;no-cause&quot; including performance issues, lack of 
          funding, reorganization, etc. </font>
          <P> 
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On track: these are the 
          contracts whereby individuals are given six years to achieve continuing 
          appointment. </font>
          <p> 
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 3. Continuing Status: this 
          is the AP equivalent of tenure for faculty. Continuing status is the 
          expectation of continually receiving a yearly contract. Continuing status 
          also guarantees academic freedom. APs with continuing status may be 
          terminated for &quot;cause&quot; or for budget constraints. </font>
      </ol>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        <b>Question:</b> Why don't all three Arizona universities use the same 
        classifications and titles in the same way?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> ASU titles are also ASU specific. UA derives their own 
        titles; they have the medical school and agriculture extension agents, 
        etc. that contribute to UA having 2000 more APs than ASU.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question:</b> Many academic 
        advisors now teach, do research, etc. Will the difference between what 
        was originally intended for Academic Associates and what exists today 
        ever be reviewed?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> Originally, academic advisors were made Academic Associates 
        so it would be easier to recruit and to pay them more than the classified 
        staff category. &quot;It isn't working; recruiting and retention have 
        not improved.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question</b>: If someone 
        is unhappy with their classified title what should they do?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> For individuals, go to your supervisor and ask for career 
        progression outside classification or ask for re-class to AP (this last 
        request must eventually have the Provost's concurrence). For a group, 
        you need to take the request to your college's Dean.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question: </b>Are APs entitled 
        to sabbatical?<br>
        <b>Answer: </b>Yes, this is covered under ACD-705. Academic Professionals 
        who have achieved continuing status and completed six years of full-time 
        service at ASU as probationary or continuing status academic professionals.<br>
        http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question:</b> Is there a 
        university policy that APs are automatically members of the college assembly?<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> No, there is no policy; colleges and departments vary.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The EEO office tracks gender/race 
        statistics for the progress of APs through ranks. Ms.<br>
        Mawhiney's office will take complaints for any aspect of discrimination 
        EXCEPT denial of promotion/continuing status (although you can consult 
        with them.) Denial of promotion/continuing status complaints should go 
        to the Academic Professional Grievance Committee.</font><br>
