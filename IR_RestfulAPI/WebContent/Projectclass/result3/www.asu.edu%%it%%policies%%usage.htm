			<h2>Data Usage Policy</h2>

            <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
	    
            <p>The university will manage its data in a way that 
            provides for confident, open access for the entire 
            university community as support for the performance 
            of their assigned duties. This policy is intended 
            to ensure that the data assets of the university 
            are not misused or abused. Open access to data represents 
            a statement of confidence on the part of the university 
            that its personnel will use the data for the purposes 
            intended and not for personal gain or for other 
            inappropriate behavior.</p>
	    

            <p><strong>Source</strong></p>
	    
            <p>Data Administration Subcommittee of the Administrative 
            Computing Advisory Committee.</p>
	    

            <p><strong>Applicability</strong></p>
	    
            <p>Adherence to this policy is mandatory for all university 
            personnel.</p>
	    

            <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
	    
            <p>University data are institutional assets and are 
            held by the university to support its fundamental 
            instructional, research, and public service missions. 
            Innovative management is largely dependent on data 
            that are freely available and that correctly represent 
            the information intended. This policy is intended 
            to assure that data are used ethically and with 
            due consideration for individual privacy.</p>
	    

            <p><strong>Keywords</strong> </p>
	    
            <p>University data [administrative data/information] 
            data trustee, data integrity, data model, data dictionary 
            (repository, encyclopedia) data element, data value, 
            domain, directory information.</p>
	    

            <p><strong>Policy</strong></p>
	    
            <p>Use of data falls into the categories of update, 
            read-only, and external dissemination. The cognizant 
            data trustee shall grant authority to update data 
            only to personnel whose job duties specify responsibility 
            for data update. This restriction is not to be interpreted 
            as a mandate to limit update authority to members 
            of any specific group or office but should be tempered 
            with the university's desire to provide excellent 
            service to our customers and constituents.</p>
	    

            <p>Read authority is covered in the Arizona State University Data Access Policy.</p>
	    

            <p>External dissemination of individually identifiable data 
            (whether in summary or specific form) is permitted 
            for official reporting and for &quot;nonofficial&quot; 
            reports when they use only those data elements designated 
            in the data dictionary as Directory Information. 
            Even for these elements, release should be guided 
            by the absolute requirement to respect individual 
            privacy and to protect the integrity of the data. 
            The release of all other data must be approved by 
            the data trustee(s) for the element(s) involved.</p>
	    

            <p>Special care must be taken in the creation of &quot;downloaded&quot; 
            files so that both the values and their meanings 
            as defined in the Data Dictionary are not altered.</p>
            
             
            <p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
            <blockquote> 
             
            <p><em>University 
            Data</em> - the collection of data elements that 
            is relevant to the operations, plans, or management 
            of more than one ASU unit or are reported on or 
            used in &sup3;official&sup2; administrative university 
            reports.</p>
            
	    <p><em>Data Trustee </em>- the individual identified by the 
            office responsible for the collection and/or maintenance 
            of the specified data element(s). The University 
            Data Administrator is the Trustee for all data 
            elements not specifically assigned to another 
            trustee.</p>
            
	    <p><em>Data Integrity</em> - the qualities of validity and 
            reliability conjoined with the accuracy of values.</p>
            
	    <p><em>Data Dictionary</em> - a reference tool (in paper or 
            electronic form) which provides a list of all 
            the data elements and their alias names. A data 
            dictionary usually contains a working definition 
            of each element, the values that are allowed, 
            locational information, and additional metadata 
            deemed important for an organization to maintain 
            regarding its data assets.</p>
            
	    <p><em>External Dissemination</em> - the distribution (in any form, 
            including &sup3;downloads&sup2;) of data to persons 
            or to files that would not otherwise be granted 
            such access. This is intended to apply to individual-specific 
            information and not summary information, especially 
            as contained in government compliance reporting.</p>
	    
	    <p><em>Directory Information </em>- data elements identified by the 
            university as being releasable on an individual-specific 
            basis externally unless specifically requested not 
            to do so through the provisions contained within 
            FERPA. Directory elements are so designated with 
            the Data Dictionary and are not limited to student 
            and staff information but may also include financial 
            and research data.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><strong>Consequence 
            of Noncompliance </strong></p>
            <p>Failure to comply with this policy or any actions 
            deemed &quot;inappropriate conduct&quot; as defined 
            in the following policies and procedures manuals: 
            Academic Affairs Policies and Procedures Manual, 
            number ACD 204-01, page 3, Faculty Code of Ethics, 
            Staff Conduct and Work Rules, and the Student Affairs 
            Policies and Procedures Manual, number 104-01, page 
            5, Student Code of Conduct, and number 105-01, page 
            1, Release of Student Information, may result in 
            denial of access.</p>

            by ITAC Executive Committee on 1/15/93<br />
