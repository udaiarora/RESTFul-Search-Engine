It will be a school focused on educating all of its students         from the perspective of each having a high level of technical literacy,         each being facile in the use of technology in their chosen field, and,         finally, all being embedded in a technology-active directly-engaged campus         learning environment. </p>      <p> At the Polytechnic at ASU East we will educate writers, teachers, engineers,         technologists, business professionals, scientists, and a range of other         specialists in how to think and solve problems from the perspective of         experience-based learning and applications-based problem solving.
