<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:windowtext">Speaker:</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:windowtext"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Dr. Marjorie Zatz, Vice Provost for Academic Personnel</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:windowtext">Topic:</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:windowtext">
Implementation of revised ACD 507 policies for Academic Professional personnel actions and development of personnel policies for postdoctoral scholars<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:windowtext">Present:</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:windowtext">
Approximately 40 people<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p><font size="3">The forum provided an opportunity for Academic Professionals to hear about the plans for implementing the 
revised policies for Academic Professional personnel actions and for developing separate personnel policies for postdoctoral 
scholars.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Dr. Zatz reported that the revised ACD 507 section was approved by the Academic Senate at its November 14, 2005, 
meeting. The revision will now go to the University President for final approval. &nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Dr. Zatz briefly presented the highlights of the changes with particular attention to the addition of 
multi-year rolling contracts.  She followed with a discussion of implementation issues and answered questions from the 
audience.  Issues covered were:</p>
<ul>

<li>The Provost's office would like to see all the documents submitted for annual evaluations of positions with rolling 
contracts, not just the evaluation summary, at least for a few years to ensure that the contract renewal process is working 
properly.</li><br><br>

<li> Units creating an Academic Professional position for the first time will have to put criteria in place for evaluating 
performance.  Since the Provost's office must approve new positions, it can serve as a control point to ensure unit 
criteria exist.</li><br><br>

<li> Positions that are on year-to-year or multi-year contracts, both fixed and rolling, can go from one type of contract 
to another at contract renewal time to best meet the needs of the unit.</li><br><br>

<li> Academic Professional Continuing Appointment and Promotion Review Committee issues will be addressed after the Faculty 
Promotion and Tenure procedures are finalized in case there are certain procedures that the implementation for Academic 
Professionals would need to parallel.  One of the issues that will then need to be addressed are who will be eligible to 
serve on the committee.</li><br><br>

</ul>
</font>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Zatz then presented ideas currently in development for creating a separate category for Postdoctoral 
Scholars. These positions have never fit in well with the Academic Professional category so their special needs are not being 
met. Some things under consideration are providing full benefits to postdoctoral students, including family health coverage, 
and making it possible for all postdoctoral students to enroll in courses if desired regardless of the type of postdoctoral 
position they are in. Postdoctoral students in the audience indicated a need for better and more consistent avenues of 
communication with the administration and the designation of a single individual or office to which they can address their 
concerns and questions. &nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The session concluded with a question on how the revision of the Faculty Promotion and Tenure policy currently 
in development will affect the review process for Academic Professionals.  Dr. Zatz assured everyone that there would be little 
effect on the process for Academic Professionals and that whatever small changes may be necessary could be easily handled. &nbsp;<o:p>
