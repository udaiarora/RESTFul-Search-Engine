Purpose</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
East College offers a variety of liberal and professional programs. Baccalaureate programs are offered in applied biological sciences, applied psychology, business administration, education, exercise and wellness, human health studies, interdisciplinary studies, multimedia writing and technical communication, and nutrition. Minors, certificates, and graduate programs are available in some areas. </p>
<p>
Each semester, East College offers a selection of popular upper-division ASU General Studies and general interest courses. While designed primarily to support East campus students, these courses are open to all ASU students who might find the times and location convenient. East College typically offers courses in anthropology, art, communication, economics, English, history, mathematics, music, philosophy, political science, psychology, religious studies, sociology, and women&#8217;s studies. Students should refer to the current <i>
Schedule of Classes</i>
 for specific courses offered at East campus each semester. All credit earned at East campus automatically transfers to Tempe campus or West campus. </p>
<p>
Students who begin their college careers at East campus benefit from the small, residential campus environment. If they are uncertain about a major they can declare exploratory/undeclared status. Students are able to complete General Studies requirements and search for an ASU major that serves their personal and career objectives while enrolled as exploratory/undeclared majors. East College provides advising to exploratory/undeclared majors.</p>
<p>
East College also offers statistics courses (APM) to meet requirements for a range of majors and support courses for the Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degree. The applied science core (ASC) courses are upper division and designed to build upon the mathematics and science base acquired in the Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Partnership in Baccalaureate Education.</b> 
The Partnership in Baccalaureate Education, an agreement between Chandler-Gilbert Community College and East campus, is coordinated through East College. Through this partnership, East campus students take first-year composition courses and courses that meet lower-division ASU General Studies requirements. They are listed in 
<a href="general-studies.html#a88218">General Studies</a>. These courses, combined with introductory courses within the major, are available in an innovative and integrated first-year curriculum designed to foster academic success. Students can also take major prerequisite courses, introductory language courses, and other lower-division courses of general interest through the partnership. These courses automatically transfer to ASU each semester. </p></div>

<h2>
<a id="a67247"></a>Interdisciplinary Studies&#8212;BIS</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (BIS) program is intended for the student who has academic interests that might not be satisfied with existing majors. Building on academic concentrations and an interdisciplinary core, students in the BIS program take an active role in creating their educational plans and defining their career goals. The BIS program emphasizes written communication, versatility, and critical thinking, skills desired in the 21st-century workplace. Self-assessment and appraisal of opportunities to support academic and career goals are key elements in the core courses. The concentrations are generally based on approved academic minors, certificate programs, or special coherent clusters of course work. The student should be able to integrate these into a meaningful program.</p>
<p>
The combination of areas of concentration gives students flexibility in creating unique programs to accomplish individual academic goals. Students who declare the BIS as their major in East College at East campus take their core courses and at least one concentration through East campus. The second concentration may be taken at the Tempe campus or East campus. The BIS core courses are offered by East College. Concentrations at East campus are offered by East College, the College of Technology and Applied Sciences, and the Morrison School of Agribusiness and Resource Management. Students interested in the BIS program should arrange an appointment with an East College advisor at 480/727-1333 before declaring the BIS major.</p></div>
<h3>
Basic Requirements</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The BIS major requires 120 semester hours. The major is composed of a 12 hour core and a minimum of 36 hours in two or three concentration areas (18 hours or more each). Throughout the core sequence, the student assembles a portfolio, including self-assessment of progress toward career goals and an evaluation of key educational and personal activities that may apply. The core courses must be taken in sequence. These courses may not be transferred from other institutions. BIS 401 may be taken as a corequisite or prerequisite for BIS 402. All core courses must be completed with a grade of &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00) or higher.</p></div>
