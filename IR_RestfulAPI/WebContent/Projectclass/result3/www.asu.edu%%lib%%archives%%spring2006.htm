    <td width="60%"><p>The San Francisco Peaks in Northern Arizona, location
        of the film, are held sacred by 13 American Indian Tribes. These nations
        have revered &#8220;the peaks&#8221; as the home of their deities, a
        place to gather special herbs, a place of emergence, and for tribes like
        the Navajo and Hopi, this mountain is deeply rooted in essence of their
        ways of life.</p>
      <p> In spite of strong tribal opposition, the San Francisco Peaks have
        endured a history of development. The Snowbowl Effect explores the controversy
        surrounding the recently proposed ski resort expansion and snow making
        with wastewater. Concerned citizens discuss the issues: sacred lands
        protection; public health concerns associated with groundbreaking studies
        on wastewater; economic misconceptions; threats to the environment; global
    warming; and a small community caught in the conflict.</p></td>

<p><strong><a name="AMERICAN">American Indian Policy Center at ASU</a></strong></p>
<p> One year ago, more than 25 American Indian faculty, staff, and local community
  leaders gathered at Gila River Community to discuss plans for creating an American
  Indian Policy Center at Arizona State University. It was the culmination of
  discussions begun in the spring of 1997.</p>
<p> The group strategized on everything from the purpose and proposed activities
  of the Policy Center to avoiding duplication of services already established
  at peer institutions.</p>
The initiative has the support of ASU President, Dr. Michael Crow, and will
    incorporate trans-disciplinary involvement from all three campuses and will
    reflect the needs described by tribal communities in Arizona and eventually
    nationwide. Proposed Activities are:
    <ol>
  <li> 
  Serve as a clearinghouse for American Indian initiatives involving ASU</li>
  <li>
  
    Community-based-work&#8211;policy development, Education, Cultural Preservation</li>
  <li>
  
    Research tribes&#8217; needs and design programs to respond to those needs </li>
  <li>
  
    Provide answers to the tribes</li>
  <li>
  
    Focus on intergovernmental relationships and policy makers
	
    
  </li>
</ol>
<p>At a Special Session of the CLAS Senate held Friday, November 4, 2005, the
    Senate unanimously approved the American Indian Policy and Leadership Center
    proposal, which will go to the Arizona Board of Regents in February. The
    Center is currently recruiting and interviewing for a director and a coordinator.
    The College of Law, Indian Legal Program, will temporarily house the offices.<br>
  <br>
&#8220;The Center will have important implications for the quality of life, culture,
  economic development, jurisdictional considerations, and other significant areas
  of concern to tribes,&#8221; according to Dr. Eddie F. Brown, Director of American
  Indian Studies. (From: American Indian Studies Newsletter, Fall 2005, Volume
  6, Issue 1).<br>
  <br>
  <strong><a name="TALLBEAR">TallBear Joins Indian Studies Faculty</a></strong><br>
  <br>
  Kim TallBear (Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate), will be introducing the study of <br>
  American Indian justice issues (AIS 180) from an inter disciplinary perspective
    during the spring semester. Primary topics include sovereignty, law, and
    culture.<br>
  <br>
  The University of California, Santa Cruz awarded her PhD in History of Consciousness
    in December 2005. In addition, TallBear holds a Master&#8217;s degree from
    the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at M.I.T., and B.A. in Community
    Planning from the University of <br>
  Massachusetts, Boston. Her dissertation is entitled, &#8220;Native American
    DNA: Narratives of Origin and Race.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
  Dr. TallBear has previously worked for a number of federal agencies, national
    tribal organizations, and has consulted on tribal environmental program initiatives.

  The School of Information Resources and Information Science at the University
    of Arizona hopes to strengthen ties to the library community in Arizona and
    help their professional colleagues with their special projects by offering
    internships to its students. <br>
    <br>
  In particular, the program is to provide students with the academic challenge
    of field-based projects or problem in which they can utilize the knowledge
    and skills acquired during their SIRLS program of study. Internships are
    to be project-or problem-based and emphasize the use of both practical and
    theoretical
    knowledge and skills.
