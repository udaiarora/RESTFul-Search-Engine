      <h2>ABOR appoints Sideman as executive director </h2>
      <p align="left">Joel Sideman has been appointed as the new executive director for the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR). Sideman is replacing Linda Blessing, who is retiring after five years as the board's executive director. </p>
      <p align="left">As deputy executive director and legal counsel to the board, Sideman currently serves as the chief legal adviser to the ABOR and the executive director. In this role, he provides legal advice and guidance to the Regents to ensure compliance with ABOR policy and statutory requirements. </p>
      <p align="left">"The Regents are absolutely committed to their Changing Directions initiative, and will continue on the path of enabling each university to carve out its differentiated mission while ensuring overall accountability and accessibility for students and taxpayers," he says. "At the end of the day, it is the commitment of the individual members of our university communities - faculty, staff and students - that will allow us to achieve these objectives." </p>
      <p align="left">Sideman has been with the board's central office staff for more than 15 years. He was appointed board counsel in 1991, and has served as deputy executive director and legal counsel since 1995. </p>
      <p align="left">As the board's executive director Sideman, who will officially begin in July, will oversee the operation of the central office and work closely and cooperatively with the three university presidents as a member of the Council of Presidents. </p>
      <p align="left">"Linda has been both a friend and a mentor, and we will miss her a lot," he says. "Dr. Blessing's success as a leader and manager is based on a pretty simple approach - she sets high standards for herself and others, and supports a work environment in which people are encouraged to do their best." </p>
      <p align="left">Blessing has worked with the board on two separate occasions during her 30-year career in state and local government. She first served as deputy executive director in the early 1990s for about two years; and then as the board's executive director for the past five years. In between these two jobs Blessing was director of the Arizona Department of Economic Security. </p>
      <p align="left">She says Sideman "is extremely well prepared to take on the responsibilities of executive director, having all the skills and the fine character necessary to excel in the position," she says. "Joel needs little advice from me, but I'll offer one suggestion anyway: remember to keep exercising your wonderful sense of humor." </p>
