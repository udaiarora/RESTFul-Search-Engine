      <h2 align="left">ASU, Banner Health join forces to improve hospital operations</h2>
      <p align="left">Valley hospitals are coping daily with providing the highest quality care to patients, but with a booming population and annual influx of winter visitors, they find themselves faced with the growing problem of maintaining that quality with a limited number of hospital beds. </p>
      <p align="left"><img src="../faculty_students/facstudents_images/Banner-Health.jpg" width="288" height="216" align="right">Now, one of the Valley's largest providers of hospital services, Banner Health, has teamed up with Jeffery Cochran, professor of industrial engineering in the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, to understand how Banner hospitals can improve daily operations while maintaining excellence in patient care. </p>
      <p align="left">"Nurses and doctors are primarily interested in the quality of care," says Cochran. "In the hospital, they have thousands of patients who show up on their own schedule to the emergency room, to the admissions, to the surgery area, and they all overlap taking their own routes through the hospital, placing a burden on the resources. The question is, 'are the resources in the right place at the right time,'" says Cochran. </p>
      <p align="left">"One of the challenges that has become increasingly significant for our Phoenix hospitals is having the capacity to meet demand," says Twila Burdick, system director of organizational performance for the Banner Health System. "How do our patients flow through our system? Are there some operational opportunities in terms of improving the flow of patients and therefore, our capacity? These seemed to be perfect kinds of questions to ask someone like Dr. Cochran. We are breaking some new ground here." </p>
      <p align="left">Cochran's area of specialty within industrial engineering is in operations research, or the study of how large- scale systems work. In the past, he has looked at operations issues in industries such as energy, transportation and manufacturing. </p>
      <p align="left">"My primary interest is in the discovery of common things that happen which includes their mathematical descriptions in large scale systems and parts of the system," says Cochran. "I'm particularly interested in things that have a probabilistic component, where we can't describe exactly what's going to happen." </p>
      <p align="left">Cochran works with Banner Health's management engineers to better understand where patient flow bottlenecks occur within a hospital, and in doing so, try to improve patient service and care. </p>
      <p align="left">In one approach, Cochran, along with master's degree student Aseem Bharti, are working on a modeling system that gives a snapshot of a busy hospital. Using Banner Desert Medical Center in Mesa as a starting point, they are looking at the effects of moving the same number of beds in different areas of the hospital - a situation which closely models the current behavior of a hospital. When a unit is full, the hospital staff will often find a patient in a bed in a different unit. </p>
      <p align="left">At the other end of the patient flow spectrum is the discharge time, which creates another problem of peak demand for doctors, lab personnel and the discharge staff. </p>
      <p align="left">"Basically, you arrive at the hospital around the clock, but everyone is discharged during the day. Nobody's discharged at 2 a.m. any more than being discharged at 2 a.m. in a hotel," says Cochran. </p>
      <p align="left">Cochran hopes to finish his efforts this year and recommend to the hospital different strategies to improve their operations. </p>
