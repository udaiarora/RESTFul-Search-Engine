      <h2><strong>Corbin leaves ASU, enters Hall of Fame </strong></h2>
      <p>As Chuck Corbin winds down his 45-year career as a teacher and researcher, he finds himself being recognized with such tennis greats as the late Arthur Ashe and Billie Jean King, as well as Tony DiCicco, head coach of the 1999 Women's World Cup Champion Soccer Team. </p>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/Corbin4.jpg" width="216" height="333" align="right">Corbin, professor of exercise and wellness and internationally recognized exercise and wellness expert, was inducted into the National Association for Sport and Physical Education's (NASPE) Hall of Fame at a banquet April 2 in New Orleans, La. He also was recognized by the Governor's Council on Health, Physical Fitness and Sports on April 13 at the Phoenix Suns-Los Angeles Clippers game. </p>
      <p>The NASPE Hall of Fame honors outstanding individuals who have achieved new levels of excellence in sport and physical activity and inspired others by their example of what quality, physical activity and sport programs can do to make a better world. </p>
      <p>For many years Corbin served as a member of the Arizona Governor's Council on Heath, Physical Fitness and Sports. He received the recognition award for his contributions to the preparation of professionals in the area of physical activity promotion and physical education teaching. </p>
      <p>Corbin has touched many lives with his efforts. He has overseen 20 doctoral, more than 50 masters and hundreds of undergraduate students; and through his more than 70 books and 160 refereed publications, he has been instrumental in changing the way fitness, wellness and healthy lifestyle classes are taught at the college level throughout the world. </p>
      <p>His college text, "Concepts of Physical Fitness," is now in its 12th edition. His Fitness for Life program has helped change the way programs of secondary school physical education are conducted. </p>
      <p>"Being inducted into the Hall of Fame means that your peers appreciate what you have accomplished over the years," says Corbin. "It is particularly satisfying to be inducted in the same year as former pro football player Nick Buoniconti, who has contributed so much to helping people with spinal cord injuries and Lucinda Adams, Olympic gold medal winner in the sprint relays. She was a great athlete when she was young, but since has done much to promote health and physical activity among our youth." </p>
      <p>Over the years, the field has changed to become more scientific, according to Corbin, which he believes helps prove what he knew all along - that physical activity is vital to good health. "I knew it was important to be active when I first started in the field 45 years ago, but now we have the scientific evidence to back it up," says Corbin. </p>
      <p>Even though he plans to retire, effective June 30, from ASU, Corbin will continue to be very much involved in his field. </p>
      <p>"I will work on my college texts with my son Will, who is a professor at Yale University, and Greg Welk, former doctoral student now a professor at Iowa State University," says Corbin. "Also, I will continue to be involved in the high school Fitness for Life program, do seminars and workshops in schools and universities, and chair the Science Board that advises the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports regarding the President's Challenge activity program." </p>
      <p>He and his wife Cathie hope to travel and to see more of their kids and grandkids. And some of his coworkers won't be completely out of the picture. </p>
      <p>"I plan to continue to play basketball with my colleagues at ASU in the Faculty-Staff Basketball Association and maybe even learn to play golf," he says. </p>
      <p>The exercise and wellness field has encouraged Corbin to be active in his own life and influence others to be active. Corbin admits that it's exciting to be on the front line of prevention of health problems as opposed to treating diseases after they develop. </p>
      <p>"Joining others such as Dot Richardson, Arthur Ashe and Billy Jean King in the Hall of Fame is quite an honor," adds Corbin. "I was not a great athlete, but accomplished things in different ways." </p>
      <p>NASPE is the largest of the six national associations of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance (AAHPERD). Information about NASPE can be found at (www.naspeinfo.org). </p>
