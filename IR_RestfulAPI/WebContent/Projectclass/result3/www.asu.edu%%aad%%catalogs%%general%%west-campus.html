The West campus focuses on developing a learning community that addresses the needs of a dynamic metropolitan environment. The campus does this by offering learner-centered academic programs that enhance learning through teaching, service, and enrichment opportunities; promoting discovery and innovation; pursuing new knowledge; introducing insights and creative ideas through instruction; encouraging direct involvement in new fields of inquiry; investigating important community-based issues; and integrating with the community through service. The vision of the West campus is to enhance the intellectual, social, cultural, and economic qualities of its urban environment through research and creative activity and to provide access to a quality liberal arts education for undergraduates, professional programs grounded in the liberal arts, and an array of graduate programs.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1751529"></a>The West campus commitment to integrated learning extends to Las Casas, an apartment-style, living-learning &#8211; based housing facility. Las Casas features faculty and academic advisors who live in the residence, faculty mentors, courses taught on site at the community center, and student affinity groups focusing on topics such as global awareness, leadership, and the arts.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1751530"></a>Faculty and staff are dedicated to serving the evolving needs of high school graduates, working adults, and returning and continuing students. Expanding campus facilities and programs, along with a diverse student body, faculty, and staff, contribute to a culturally rich academic and social campus environment.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1751531"></a>The West campus offers many on-campus services and facilities, all fully accessible for those with disabilities. These include a multimedia resource library, state-of-the-art computer classrooms and labs, housing facilities, tutoring services, a disability resource center, bookstore, cafeteria, credit union, fitness center, recreational facilities, <a name="marker-1751532"></a>child care, and post office, plus many student activities, clubs, and organizations. Classes are offered days, evenings, and weekends and via television and the Internet.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1751533"></a>The West campus occupies approximately 300 square acres between 43rd and 51st Avenues on West Thunderbird Road in Phoenix, easily accessed from Interstate 17 and Loop 101. Its architecture and courtyards are modeled on those of the University of Oxford in England, enhanced by a beautifully landscaped natural environment featuring widely acclaimed public art. </p><p class="FM-B-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1751535"></a><a name="13387"></a>History</p><p class="Body-4-above"><a name="pgfId-1751536"></a>The year 2004 marked the 20th anniversary of the West campus. Governor Bruce Babbitt signed legislation officially establishing the campus on April 18, 1984. Two years later members of several western Maricopa County communities, legislators, and the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) joined in the ground-breaking ceremony for the West campus, which culminated more than 10 years of intensive effort by numerous citizens&#8217; groups working to establish educational facilities in western Maricopa County. This grass-roots effort began in 1972 with the formation of the West Side Citizens&#8217; Committee for Higher Education. Citizens and legislators in western Maricopa County worked with officials at ASU and the ABOR to demonstrate the need for higher education facilities beyond those offered by the community colleges. </p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1751537"></a>In 1982, the legislature provided an exchange of 171.66 acres of general revenue lands for &#8220;approximately 300 acres of state trust land located in Maricopa County.&#8221; These 300 acres constitute the permanent site of the West campus. The first permanent building, Fletcher Library, opened in March of 1988, and the first classroom building, Sands Classroom Building, opened in 1989 for spring semester classes. Shortly thereafter, the legislature authorized a lease purchase agreement to fund construction of additional buildings. The first phase, consisting of seven buildings and 600,000 gross square feet, opened in the spring of 1991.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1751538"></a>The West campus received its initial accreditation from North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in August 1992. In fall 2001, ASU at the West campus became a four-year university campus with the addition of freshman and sophomore classes. Student housing facilities opened in August 2003.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1751539"></a>For more than two decades, the campus has demonstrated responsiveness to the community, providing an ethos of resolving social issues, creating an involved citizenry, and ultimately creating a better quality of life for all. The West campus vision is to build on its successful past in ways that enhance the intellectual, social, cultural and economic qualities of a diverse, urban environment, through research and quality programs. This commitment to the community is punctuated by the economic vitality that the West campus contributes. </p><p class="FM-B-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1751542"></a><a name="39888"></a><a name="marker-1751541"></a>Accreditation</p><p class="Body-4-above"><a name="pgfId-1751543"></a>ASU at the West campus is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association.

A student with a cumulative GPA of 3.40 to 3.59 graduates cum laude, 3.60 to 3.79 graduates magna cum laude, or 3.80 to 4.00 graduates summa cum laude. The cumulative GPA for these designations is based solely on ASU resident course work. For example, ASU correspondence course grades are not calculated in the honors GPA. All designations of graduation with academic recognition are indicated on the diploma and the ASU transcript. Graduation with academic recognition applies only to undergraduate degrees. </p><p class="FM-C-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1751998"></a>Minors</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1751999"></a>A minor is an approved, coherent concentration of academic study in a single discipline, involving substantially fewer hours of credit than the corresponding major. </p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1752000"></a>Students in most majors may pursue one or more minors and, upon successful completion of the prescribed course work, have that accomplishment officially recognized on the ASU transcript at graduation if (1) the academic unit/department of the minor officially certifies, through established verification procedures, that all requirements for the minor have been met, and (2) the academic unit (and, in certain academic units, the department) of the student&#8217;s major allows the official recognition of the minor. A student wishing to pursue a specific minor should consult an academic advisor in the unit offering that minor to ensure that an appropriate set of courses is taken.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1752001"></a>A minor consists of a minimum of 18 hours of course work. For any minor offered at the West campus, a minimum of nine upper-division hours in the minor must be taken in residence at the West campus. All upper-division courses in the minor must be completed with a minimum grade of &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00). Counting courses in the major and the minor is allowed; however, certain major and minor combinations may be deemed inappropriate by the academic unit or department of the major or minor. Inappropriate combinations include (but would not be limited to) ones in which an excessive number of courses in the minor are simultaneously being used to fulfill requirements of the student&#8217;s major (e.g., major in Integrative Studies with a concentration in sociology and a minor in Sociology). Some West campus departments may have more specific or stringent requirements for minors.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1752002"></a>For a list of the minors available at the West campus, refer to the <a href="west-campus.html#38998" class="XRef">West Campus Minors</a> table</em>.</p><p class="FM-C-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1752006"></a>Certificates</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1752007"></a>Students may pursue some certificate programs along with a major and other certificate programs independently.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1752008"></a>For certificate programs offered at the West campus, at least 50 percent of the semester hours required to earn a certificate must be West campus resident credit.

These requirements include but are not limited to requirements on the amount of transfer credit, undergraduate admissions decisions, graduation requirements, resident credit requirements, and general studies requirements. To petition for a variance of such university requirements, students should discuss the matter with an academic advisor and complete a petition form. The petition is reviewed by the relevant unit-level administrator and committee before being forwarded to the Office of the Associate Vice Provost for Academic Programs and Graduate Studies.</p><p class="FM-C-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1752019"></a>Grade Appeals</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1752020"></a>The professional responsibility for assigning grades is vested in the instructor of the course, and requires the careful application of professional judgment. However, the following grievance process allows deans to change a particular grade if evidence presented in the process warrants such a change. </p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1752021"></a>It is university policy that students filing grievances and those who provide support for the student are protected from retaliation. Students who feel that they are victims of retaliation should immediately contact the dean of the academic unit in which the course is offered. </p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1752022"></a>The grade appeal process follows the steps described below. &#8220;Day&#8221; is defined as a normal business day, not including Saturday, Sunday, or any officially recognized university employee holiday or campus closure. </p><p class="List-Num-1-lead">&nbsp;<a name="pgfId-1752023"></a>1. A student wishing to appeal a grade must first meet with the instructor who assigned the grade to try to resolve the dispute. The instructor must review the matter in good faith, explain how the original grading decision was made, and decide whether to change the grade in response to the student&#8217;s appeal. The instructor must respond to the student&#8217;s request for a meeting in writing, via phone, or by e-mail within 10 days. If the grade dispute is not or cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of the student via this meeting, within 10 days after receiving the instructor&#8217;s response the student may appeal to the program chair/director. (If the program chair/director is also the instructor and/or responsible for the disputed grade, the student may appeal directly to the campus Academic Grade Appeals Committee.)</p><p class="List-Num-2">&nbsp;<a name="pgfId-1752024"></a>2. Within 10 days after receiving the appeal, the program chair/director confers with the student and the instructor to try to work out a mutually acceptable resolution to the dispute. If the grading dispute is not resolved to the satisfaction of the student, within 10 days after receiving the program chair/director&#8217;s response the student may appeal to the Academic Grade Appeals Committee. Appeals must be made in writing, with a separate document submitted for each grade being contested. Each appeal must provide the name of instructor, course section, semester taken, grade received, and attempts made to resolve the situation.</p><p class="List-Num-2">&nbsp;<a name="pgfId-1752025"></a>3. Both the student and the instructor are invited to appear before the committee within 20 days after the committee receives the appeal. The committee shall operate under written procedures that satisfy due process requirements. The committee considers all of the evidence bearing on the dispute and then decides by majority vote whether the grade should be changed. The committee then sends its recommendation to the dean of the academic unit where the course was offered.</p><p class="List-Num-2">&nbsp;<a name="pgfId-1752026"></a>4. Within 15 days of receiving the committee&#8217;s recommendation, the dean makes the final decision in the case after full consideration of the recommendation and a review of pertinent materials. If the dean determines that a grade change is warranted, the grade change may be made either by the instructor or by the dean. The dean notifies the student, instructor, program chair/director, and the Academic Grade Appeals Committee of the final outcome of the case.</p><p class="Body-4-above"><a name="pgfId-1752027"></a>For summer session or fall semester grade appeals, the student must contact the course instructor within 60 days after the last day of instruction of the session or semester. To appeal a spring semester grade, the student must contact the instructor within 60 days after the first day of instruction of the following fall semester.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1752028"></a>For more information, regarding the campus Academic Grade Appeals Committee, call 602/543-4567, or visit the Academic Programs and Graduate Studies Office, FAB S301.</p><p class="FM-B-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1752030"></a><a name="marker-1752029"></a>School of Extended Education</p><p class="Body-4-above"><a name="pgfId-1752031"></a>The university-wide School of Extended Education provides an interactive link between ASU and the diverse communities it serves.
