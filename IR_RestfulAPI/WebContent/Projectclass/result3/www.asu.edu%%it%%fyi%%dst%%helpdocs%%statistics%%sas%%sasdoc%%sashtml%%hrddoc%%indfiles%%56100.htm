Here's your macro guide from %Macro to %Mend! Learn and understand the     basic composition and operation of the SAS macro facility and the SAS
macro language. Carpenter packs this book with examples that illustrate    how to write SAS macros, convert SAS code to macros, define macro
variables and pass macro parameters, plus much more to help you            understand how to use macro statements within SAS macros. This complete
guide includes the following topics: macros that interface with the        DATA step, how to write dynamic code, utility macros that control your
operating environment, SAS System AUTOCALL macros, macro references and    Screen Control Language (SCL), and how to write and use macros
efficiently. Carpenter's book is a must-have for both new and              experienced SAS macro users. Knowledge of base SAS is expected, along
with a desire to learn more!
