      <p align="center">May 19, 2004</p>
      <h2 align="left">Student stories of perseverance, success </h2>
      <p align="left">Among the more than 5,600 students receiving their degrees May 13 was an 18-year-old getting a bachelor's in bioengineering and a 76-year-old earning her master's in fine arts. The extremely smart 18-year-old is <strong>Alex Letham </strong> of Higley, Ariz., who is getting ready to go on a two-year mission for his church before he enters medical school. </p>
      <p align="left">And the 76-year-old - actually she points out she'll be 77 on May 29 - is <strong>Frances New, </strong> whose degree in creative writing will be a springboard for a new career as a poet. New came to America from China in 1947. She then married, raised children and was an ASU librarian for many years before retiring eight years ago. </p>
      <p align="left">"I don't feel my age," says New. "I feel sharper than ever. I don't think I could have written poetry any earlier, because I had too many distractions. Now I'm ready for a new chapter in my life." </p>
      <p align="left">Following are stories of others who had their own distractions and obstacles during their educational experience at ASU, but were determined to finish. </p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Jessie Sandoval </strong> is a young woman who has exhibited such strong leadership skills and academic accomplishment during her years at ASU that it's hard to believe the significant obstacles she has overcome. A political science major, Sandoval was an ASU Capitol Scholar in Washington, D.C. last summer, conducting research on multiple Middle Eastern countries for a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. She has counseled youth with disabilities for two years and has published papers on helping these children reach their goals. She herself has cerebral palsy and is visually impaired, using her service dog Querrie to help her navigate the ASU campus. Sandoval will begin a summer internship with the U.S. State Department in Washington and enter law school at the University of San Francisco in the fall. </p>
      <p align="left">As a little girl <strong>Vicki Voss' </strong> dream was to grow up and become a wife and mother. Then her dream was to ensure that her three children earned something no one in her family had ever achieved - a college degree. Between 1994 - 97 Voss' two daughters and son all graduated from ASU. Now it was time to dream about her own education. She understands that education offers new beginnings regardless of age and socioeconomic status. But new beginnings don't come easy and she needed a little help. It didn't take long for the Voss children to do what mom had done for them. So daughters Fran and Sara and son, Dan, prepared to put mom through college. With the support of her family, Voss left her job as a supervisor in the Maricopa County Treasurer's office to devote herself full-time to her studies and soon, her chosen profession of teaching. </p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Pamela Sekayumptewa </strong> is the first in her family to receive a college degree. As a female native American aspiring to achieve the American ideal of a university education, she often struggled to find a role model but her family constantly gave her the encouragement and support she needed just when she needed it. Now, at 33, Sekayumptewa is ready to pursue a career in juvenile probation. </p>
      <p align="left">Like many women starting a family, she chose to make her children a priority. Now her daughter, Sasha, a 15-year old sophomore at Ironwood High School, has become her mom's number one fan and inspiration. </p>
      <p align="left">"Without her help, I wouldn't be at this point in my life. Since I work full-time at a Phoenix law firm, Sasha insisted that I take the evening classes I needed while she stayed at home to watch her 8-year old brother." </p>
      <p align="left">What keeps this working mom going? "My mother gave me a small plaque with the words 'Don't Quit.'" I looked at that every morning before I started my busy day." </p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Matthew Rhea </strong> has an impressive list of scholarship and research accomplishments under his belt. </p>
      <p align="left">For starters, he's received 14 multi-disciplinary research grants; completed 17 interdisciplinary research studies; and published all of his research in leading research journals and at national and international conferences, including an invited lecture at the International Olympic Committee's World Congress on Sport Sciences in Athens, Greece last year. </p>
      <p align="left">And he did all this mostly in the last two years of his five-year ASU career as a graduate student. </p>
      <p align="left">He also found the time to organize The Fire Fighter Health and Fitness Research Institute, where he serves as director of research and institutional development. The organization is dedicated to improving the health and well-being of the fire sciences community. </p>
      <p align="left">Rhea, a 30-year-old father of four boys, graduated this week with a Ph.D. in exercise and wellness education. He has accepted an exercise and wellness faculty position at Southern Utah University. </p>
