Programs offered by the Department of Applied Biological Sciences integrate applied research in the biological sciences with education and service to the community. Faculty strive to be at the forefront of their chosen academic disciplines; they combine classroom teaching, student advising, research, and practical problem solving. The aim is to provide the best possible education to the next generation of biological practitioners and scientists through mentors who themselves understand the science, the means by which it advances, and the manner in which it can be brought to bear on practical problems. The educational goal is to offer students rigorous and practical programs in applications of the biological sciences that feature current technologies as well as an understanding of the policy context in which biologists work. Consistent with a polytechnic vision, programs involve extensive student interaction with the faculty through experience based learning activities such as laboratories, field trips, internships, and faculty guided research and service learning projects. Faculty are committed to the advancement of knowledge in their chosen fields of study and work closely with graduate students in the Master of Science degree program. Graduate students gain practical experience in the practice of research leading to a solid foundation for scholarly research. The Department of Applied Biological Sciences is also committed to providing service to the community outside the university. Because of the variety of career options available in this field, one general and four focused concentrations are offered:</p></div>

Applied Biological Sciences Concentration</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
This concentration provides maximum flexibility for students seeking careers in the biological sciences. The Applied Biological Sciences core provides a foundation in the biological sciences; required courses in chemistry and physics complete the general science requirements. Students intending to pursue research careers in biology and postgraduate studies may find this concentration appropriate. In addition, the concentration is designed for students planning to enter professional programs in the health care professions such as medicine, medical technology, epidemiology, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, physical therapy, podiatry, public health, and physician&#8217;s assistant programs. Students planning to enter professional programs need to include two semester sequences in physics and organic chemistry in their programs of study. BCH 361 Principles of Biochemistry is also suggested.</p></div>

The applied biological sciences/secondary education concentration qualifies students for the State of Arizona Certification in Secondary Biology Education. Students interested in pursuing this concentration need to complete the science content courses related to biology and the courses specific to the secondary education curriculum. The program concludes with full-time student teaching in a secondary science classroom. Students interested in pursuing the concentration need to be admitted into the Teacher Education unit before taking the secondary methods courses (approximately during the junior year). See

<h3>
Ecological Restoration Concentration</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The discipline of ecological restoration provides a scientific basis for the reconstruction of damaged and degraded ecosystems. It focuses on management practices designed to improve the ecological structure and function of these ecosystems. These practices may involve all ecosystem components, including soils, water, vegetation, and wildlife. The actual restoration process includes identifying the causes of degradation, devising goals and methods for the restoration effort, developing management strategies for the restored sites, and monitoring and assessing restoration success. Restoration activities may include reintroducing plants or animals, removal of invasive species, rebuilding soils, and returning natural processes such as fire and flooding to ecosystems that historically experienced these disturbance regimes. The goals of restoration are to restore ecological integrity and to meet societal needs for sustainable and functional ecosystems. Successful restoration projects require stakeholder involvement and demand consideration of the economic and social context in which restoration is carried out. The policies guiding such processes are also taken into account.</p>

<h3>
Urban Horticulture Concentration</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Urban horticulture emphasizes the relationship of plants and people in city environments. Set in a unique southwestern desert location, East campus&#8217;s program strives to teach urban horticulture students how to practice principles and develop skills that help create aesthetically pleasing urban environments. This approach is coupled with an appreciation of environmental conservation and stewardship. To achieve this goal, the program specializes in teaching students about the unique aspects of desert horticulture. Through course offerings, students can gain expertise in a diverse array of topics such as landscape plant identification culture and use; creation of public and private gardens in arid climates; management practices of landscape planting and irrigation design; installation and maintenance; xeriscape and water conservation; integrated pest management; installation and management of golf, sports, and recreational turf grass; plant propagation and greenhouse/nursery management. Graduates are qualified to identify and grow ornamental landscape trees, shrubs, ground covers, grasses, flowering potted plants, and bedding plants. They also design, install, and maintain outdoor and indoor landscape environments that enhance urban aesthetics.</p></div>

Wildlife Habitat Management Concentration</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The wildlife habitat management concentration focuses on the ecological relationship between wildlife and its habitats. The goal of wildlife habitat management is to create conditions that ensure sustainable wildlife populations. Achieving this goal requires expertise in both wildlife biology and habitat management. The wildlife habitat management concentration is distinguished by its strong emphasis on habitat management. While students are expected to master the material found in traditional wildlife biology curricula, they are also expected to develop strong expertise in habitat management. This background in habitat management requires proficiency in the botanical sciences, including plant ecology, and provides a synergistic link with the ecological restoration concentration. The applied nature of the concentration is emphasized by the requirement for mastery of the analytic technologies, ranging from quantitative ecology and ecological modeling, to the use of geographic information systems, and a comprehensive understanding of the economic and policy contexts in which wildlife habitat management occurs.</p></div>

BIS Concentration</b>
<a id="a76731"></a></h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
A concentration in applied biological sciences is available under the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (BIS) degree, a program intended for the student who has academic interests that might not be satisfied with existing majors. Building on two academic concentrations (or one double concentration) and interdisciplinary core, students in the BIS program take active roles creating their educational plans and defining their career goals. For more information, see <a href="university-college.html#a42331">
School of Interdisciplinary Studies,&#8221; page 124
</a>.</p></div>
<h2>
Minor</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
