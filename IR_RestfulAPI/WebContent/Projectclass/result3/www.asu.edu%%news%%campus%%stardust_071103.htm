      <h2>University creates research center with $2.5 million grant</h2>
      <p>        ASU and the Stardust Foundation are joining forces to help create greater
          stability for neighborhoods and families throughout Arizona, ASU President
          Michael Crow has announced. With a $2.5 million start-up grant from
          Stardust, ASU is creating the Stardust Center for Affordable Homes
      and the Family, pending approval from the Arizona Board of Regents.</p>
      <p>The
            center is an example of how ASU is focusing on community outreach
        and becoming embedded in the community in ways that will make a difference
        in quality of life and the economy.</p>
      <p>Crow said the center will fill a void
          by focusing on affordable homes and family success as a single issue.
          He said there are numerous programs
          that focus on either affordable homes or family success, but few, if
        any, are looking at both issues together.</p>
      <p>"We know that families can't
          succeed, and our economy won't thrive, without affordable, permanent
          homes for working families," said Crow. "But, we
          also know that a home isn't the only answer. Families need a whole
        host of critical life management skills and support services to succeed
        and
          we need to know, based on sound research, exactly what those skills
        and services are and how best to link them to the home."</p>
      <p>Arizona's shortage
          of affordable homes for working families has created a situation in
        which the living condition of more than one in 10 families
        is substandard.</p>
      <p>Jerry Bisgrove, founder of the Stardust Foundation, wants
          to tackle the problem by tapping into the intellectual capacity of
        ASU to apply scientific
          research and technological advances toward solutions. Bisgrove is known
          for his generosity, and his penchant for giving a "hand up, not a hand
        out."</p>
      <p>"The collaboration we are forming with ASU to create this center
          provides a unique tool to help raise the awareness of the issues affecting
          family
          stability, and a mechanism to develop innovative solutions that can
        be replicated throughout the state and help improve the quality of life
          and our economy," Bisgrove said. "We are very excited about this partnership
          and look forward to the measurable impact it will have on an ongoing
        basis."</p>
      <p>The center will be a trans-disciplinary effort involving faculty
          and resources from across ASU to research the problem and design innovative
          programs, services and technologies to help families and neighborhoods
        succeed.</p>
      <p>The project will involve collaboration between ASU scholars and
        researchers from the colleges of architecture, education, engineering,
        liberal arts &amp; sciences,
        business and public programs, and will result in invaluable research
        for developing models and techniques for achieving sustainable neighborhoods
      that can be used in Arizona and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The Stardust Center for Affordable
          Homes and the Family aims to help stabilize neighborhoods and, in turn,
          improve the quality of life and
        the economy in Arizona, Crow said.</p>
      <p>"Home ownership leads to a stable environment
          that supports cognitive and emotional development in a child," said
        Crow. "This is one way the
          university can be deeply and intimately connected to the needs of its
          community, with ripple effects that will benefit all of us for generations
        to come."</p>
      <p>Families with better living conditions have children who tend
          to do better in school and are less likely to be involved with crime,
          researchers
          have found. Safe, permanent affordable homes can break the cycle of
        poverty by giving families the stability they need to access critical
        family
        services such as health care, education and life skills training.</p>
      <p>The
          goal, over the next few years, is to have established a reputation
        for expertise and to take ideas to the market, in both a policy and a
          literal sense. These will include the economics of building affordable
          homes, the technological and architectural challenges, the effect of
          affordable homes on family and community stability and the best ways
        to create supportive family services.</p>
      <p>"The interaction between the Stardust
          Foundation and ASU will provide the center with unique qualities,"
        said Crow. "It will have the capabilities
          of the foundation for quality investments and community partnerships,
          as well as the capabilities of ASU for intellectual involvement, research
        and application."</p>
