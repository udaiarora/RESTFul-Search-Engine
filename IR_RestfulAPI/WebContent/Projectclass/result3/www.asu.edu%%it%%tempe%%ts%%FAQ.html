			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<h3 id="VM">Voice Mail</h3>
			
			<h4>I forgot my password. Now what?</h4>
			<p>You may send an <a href="mailto:Tele-Q@asu.edu">e-mail</a> to us requesting that we reset 
				your password temporarily.   Include your name and the extension of the voice mail box in 
				question.  There is no charge for this service.</p>
				
			<h4>I&#8217;ve taken over someone&#8217;s old mail box and I don&#8217;t know their password.</h4>
			<p>You may send an <a href="mailto:Tele-Q@asu.edu">e-mail</a> to us requesting that we reset your 
				password temporarily.   Include your name and the extension of the voice mail box in question.  
				There is no charge for this service.</p>
				
			<h4>I&#8217;ve taken over someone&#8217;s old mail box.  How do I change the name to mine?</h4>
			<p>The name actually needs to change in two places:  in our database and on the inital 
				recording in the mailbox.  In order to change the name in our database, simply send an 
				<a href="mailto:Tele-Q@asu.edu">e-mail</a> to us with your name and extension number.  
				To change the recorded name in the mailbox, choose option 5 from the voice mail main menu 
				(this is an unspoken option), and follow the prompts.</p>
				
			<h4>How many messages can my voice mail box hold?</h4>
			<p>The mailbox capacity is actually measured in minutes rather than number of messages.   
			The standard mailbox size is 20 minutes, which means it can hold up to 20 minutes worth of 
			messages.  Each message can be a maximum of 2 minutes in length (standard mailbox).</p>
			
			<h4>How long will voice mail keep a message?</h4>
			<p>The standard mailbox will retain messages for 10 days.  After that time, messages will be 
				automatically deleted by the system without notification.  Optionally, mailboxes with 
				30-day retention times are available for $10 per month.</p>
			
			<h4>Once I&#8217;ve deleted a message in voice mail, is there any way of getting it back?</h4>
			<p>The &#8220;undelete&#8221; feature must be used during the session in which you deleted the 
				message, and only the last message deleted can be retrieved.  For example, if you 
				inadvertently press *3 after listening to a message, you may immediately press **8 to 
				undelete it.  However, the ability to undelete is lost once you have listened to another 
				message or exited the voice mail system.  You cannot log back in to voice mail and 
				retrieve a message you previously deleted, and Telephone Services has no way of 
				&#8220;restoring&#8221; messages.</p>
				
			<h4>Can I forward a message from my <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> 
			voice mailbox to my Qwest voice messaging box (or other voice messaging service) at home?</h4>
			<p>No.</p>
			
			<h3>Long Distance Calls</h3>
			
			<h4>Can Telephone Services place long distance calls for customers?</h4>
			
			<p>Switchboard Services cannot make long distance calls on behalf of a department or 
				employee.</p>
			
			<h3>Billing</h3>
			
			<h4>What is a &#8217;recurring&#8217; charge and what is a &#8217;non-recurring&#8217; charge?</h4>
			<p>Non-recurring charges refer to one-time charges, usually associated with installation and 
				programming.  Recurring charges are monthly charges for various products and features.</p>
			
			<h3 id="pager">Pagers</h3>	
			
			<h4>My pager is broken.  How do I get it fixed?</h4>
			<p>Simply bring your pager to the Telephone Services office, located on the first floor of Old 
			Main, and we will replace it.</p>
			
			<h4>Who can lease a pager from Telephone Services? Staff? Students?</h4>
			<p>Pagers are available to <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym>  employees 
				only.  The monthly charges are billed to the requesting department, so it is up to the 
				discretion of each department as to whether or not they will issue a pager to a student 
				worker.</p>
			
			<h4>How do I order a pager?</h4>
			<p>Submit a <a href="https://ts.inre.asu.edu/">Telephone Services Request 
			(<acronym title="Telephone Services Request">TSR</acronym>)</a>
				to Telephone Services, mail code 0502.  Be sure to include the Area/Org to be charged for 
				the pager and an authorized signature on the form.</p>
				
			<h3>Telephone Services Requests (<acronym title="Telephone Services Request">TSR</acronym>)</h3>
			
			<h4>What is a <acronym title="Telephone Services Request">TSR</acronym> and how can I submit one to 
			Telephone Services?</h4>
			<p>The Telephone Services Request form is used for processing all Telephone 
				Services work orders. Go to the <a href="https://ts.inre.asu.edu/">online Telephone Services Request form</a>
				to submit your request.</p>
				
			<h4>What is the normal turnaround time on a <acronym title="Telephone Services Request">TSR</acronym>?</h4>
			<p>Generally, requests for adds, moves, and changes on campus can be completed within five to 
				ten working days.  Note, however, there is typically a rush of requests beginning in 
				mid-July and lasting through October, during which time service intervals may be extended 
				up to 20 working days. Please plan for this seasonal peak in work and submit your requests 
				early.</p>
