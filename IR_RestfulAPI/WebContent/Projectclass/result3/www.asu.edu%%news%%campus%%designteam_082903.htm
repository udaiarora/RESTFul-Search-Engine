      <h2>Design Team helps chart course for ASUís evolution</h2>
      <p>        Rapid growth is a known factor for ASUís future. What isnít known is
          how the university will evolve to accommodate that growth, which is
          expected to result in 90,000 students enrolled by the end of the next
        decade.</p>
      <p>The entire university, including faculty, staff, students and
            administrators, has an opportunity to participate in the planning
        and design of the universityís
          evolution.</p>
      <p>To get the process rolling, ASU Executive Vice President
          and Provost Milton Glick appointed a University Design Team to sketch
          out some
            suggestions and recommendations for the future of ASU. A starting
        point for the team
            was coming to terms with the fact that the Main Campus in Tempe is
            almost at capacity, meaning much of the expected growth will have
        to be absorbed
            by the East and West campuses. </p>
      <p>In its initial report, the University
          Design Team envisions ASU as a single research university with multiple
          campuses sharing the ASU identity.
          But each campus will also have its own character and spires of excellence.</p>
      <p>This
          is not an easy task when they must take into consideration factors
        like enrollment impacts, program constituencies served, program interdependencies
          for faculty and students, financial resources, organizational alternatives,
          space, research and accreditation issues.</p>
      <p>Members of the team were asked
          to remove their unit hats and develop a set of possibilities for a
        five-to 10-year road map for ASU that would
          enhance the campus identities; accommodate the anticipated growth in
          student demand by building attractive programs on the East, West and
          Downtown campuses; and maximize opportunities to enhance the quality
          and performance of all university programs.</p>
      <p>The first phase of the project
        for the team was to determine the character and identity of each of ASUís
        campus locations (Main, East, West &amp; Downtown).
        The team also looked at how to establish differentiation among the four
        locations as well as examining distinctive missions, thrusts and clusters
        of programs. The team also examined whether or not each location has
        the ASU brand.</p>
      <p>In its preliminary report, the team determined there should
          be some commonalities among each campus location. The report recommends
          that each campus:</p>
      <p>&#8226;
          Offer degree programs at the baccalaureate, masterís and doctoral levels;<br>
        &#8226; Conduct programs of research and creative activities;<br>
        &#8226; Provide continuing and extended education;<br>
        &#8226; Offer programs leading to professional degrees at the baccalaureate
          and post-baccalaureate levels;<br>
        &#8226; Seek racial and ethnic diversification of the student body and the
          faculty and staff;<br>
        &#8226; Support activities designed to promote economic, social and cultural
          development of Arizona;<br>
        &#8226; Commit to student success in all aspects of their academic and personal
          development;<br>
        &#8226; Serve the needs of women, minority, disadvantaged, disabled and non-traditional
          students; and <br>
        &#8226; Encourage faculty and staff to be engaged with the greater metropolitan
          region.<br>
      Glick says no decisions have been made based on the design team report.</p>
      <p>&#8220;The
          University Design Team has done an excellent job preparing this preliminary
          report and providing us with a starting point for the numerous
          discussions that will ensue,&#8221; he says. &#8220;As we move forward with
          this process, itís important that our focus be on what is best for the future
          of the university and how we can realize our vision of becoming a New
          American University that is high quality, open and accessible and research
        intensive.&#8221;</p>
      <p>The major focus of the teamsí report was to identify programs
          that are needed at each campus to support or define the identities
        of each location.
          The question became, should existing programs be relocated or should
        new programs be started that help build the image of a particular campus?</p>
      <p>&#8220;Weíre
          really in need of input from the university community,&#8221; says
          Glick. &#8220;The new design for the university will affect everyone and this
          is one
          of the opportunities for everyone to have a say on possible changes.
          We know that the wisdom of the entire community will help shape the
        future
          of ASU in a positive fashion. So, itís very important for people to
        look at the report and share their thoughts.&#8221;</p>
      <p>The entire report will be available
          beginning Sept. 2, at (<a href="http://www.asu.edu/provost/designteam/report/outline.html">www.asu.edu/provost/designteam/report/outline.html</a>).
