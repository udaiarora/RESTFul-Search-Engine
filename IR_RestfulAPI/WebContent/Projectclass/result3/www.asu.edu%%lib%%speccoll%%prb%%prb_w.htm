George Borrow; Dante Gabriel Rossetti; Alfred, lord Tennyson; Christina
Georgina Rossetti; Dr. Gordon Hake; John Leicester Warren, lord de Tabley;
William Morris; Francis Hindes Groome. According to the Introduction to
this work, Theodore Watts-Dunton always intended to publish his &quot;recollections
of his friends that he had from time to time contributed to The Athen&aelig;um.
Had his range of interests been less wide he might have found the time
in which to further this and many other literary projects he had formed.&quot;
While there is no essay on Swinburne, information is given in the Introduction
concerning the long friendship between Watts-Dunton and Swinburne. &quot;Swinburne
and Watts-Dunton had first met in 1872. In 1879 they went to live together
at ?The Pined,' and from that date were never parted until Swinburne's
death thirty years' later. In no literary friendship has the bond been
closer&quot; (12). PRB-151</P>

Printed in Great Britain. The author's article on Poetry in the 9th edition
of the <I>Encyclopaedia Britannica</I> and the introduction to v. 3 of
Patrick's edition of Chamber's <I>Cyclopedia of English Literature</I>
(the Renasence of wonder in English poetry) with selections from his criticisms
in the Athenaeum. Published according to his plan, but without his revision.
cf. Introd., signed: Thomas Hake. This work contains Watts-Dunton's two
most famous essays with revisions and inserts made by him near the end
of his life. The editor differentiates between the original essays and
the added material by printing the original with wider spaces between the
lines and the additional materials &quot;solid&quot; without extra wide
spaces, thus leaving the reader with the option of reading only the original
essays or the revised versions. The author discusses the pre-Raphaelite
poets in his essays. PRB-122</P>

<P>William Morris Gallery and Brangwyn Gift, Walthamstow, England. <I>Catalogue
of the Morris Collection</I>. 2nd rev. ed. London: William Morris Gallery,
1969. The foreward to this catalogue begins by stating that &quot;William
Morris's revolt against the evil results of the Industrial Revolution took
many forms, from the revival of handcrafts to pioneer work for Socialism.
His achievements as a designer, craftsman, writer and social philosopher
had a deep and wide influence, not only during his lifetime but silnce,
and today he is acknowledged as one of the most important figures in the
history of the decorative arts.&quot; The catalogue describes the collections
at the William Morris Gallery which may be divided into three groups: the
&quot;Brangwyn Gift of pictures and sculpture, mainly by nineteenth-century
artists, including the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood,&quot; &quot;the Mackmurdo
Bequest consisting principally of furniture, textiles and designs made
by the Century Guild,&quot; and the Morris Collection, &quot;fully representing
the work of Morris and his circle.&quot; The catalogue is arranged as follows:
Group A: Cartoons and original designs; Group B: Wallpapers; Group C: Ceramics
and stained glass; Groups F and N: Textiles; Group G: Furniture; Group
H: Personal relics; Group J: Manuscripts; and Group K: Books and book design.
The catalogue also contains a select list of books, biographical notes,
and an index of wallpaper and textile patterns. PRB-109</P>

<P>Wood, Esther. <I>Dante Rossetti and the Pre-Raphaelite Movemen</I>t.
London: Low, Marston and C, 1894. According to the author, this work is
designed to &quot;present the main features&quot; of the Pre-Raphaelite
movement &quot;in their relation to the larger intellectual tendencies
of the age, and to the moral principles which have determined the growth
of taste and feeling in the nineteenth century. To this end I have avoided
as far as possible the proper domain of the art critic, and endeavoured
to deal with the Pre-Raphaelite movement more as an ethical than an &aelig;sthetic
revolution.&quot; PRB-96</P>
