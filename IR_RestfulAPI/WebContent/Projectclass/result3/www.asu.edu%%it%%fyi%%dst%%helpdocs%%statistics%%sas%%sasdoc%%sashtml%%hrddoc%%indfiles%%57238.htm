SAS Procedures Guide, Version 8
</H1><P>
The complete reference for all base SAS procedures, this title also has    numerous examples of how to use procedures to analyze, manage, and
present your data. An overview of each procedure is provided, giving you   a clear idea of what the procedure does and, if relevant, of the kind of
output that it produces.  The examples section in each chapter provides    code and explanations, making it easy to understand. Syntax is augmented
with tables showing you what statements and options can do. Both           experienced SAS users and inexperienced SAS users who are
computer-literate will find this handy reference invaluable.
