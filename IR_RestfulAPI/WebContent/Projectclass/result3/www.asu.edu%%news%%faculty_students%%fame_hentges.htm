      <h2>2003 W. P. Carey School of Business Hall of Fame: Mary Hentges of PayPal
        honored at ASU homecoming</h2>
      <p>        The 2003 inductee into the W. P. Carey School of Business Hall of Fame
          is 1981 accountancy graduate Mary Hentges, vice president and CFO of
        eBay's online global payments platform, PayPal. </p>
      <p>Hentges will speak
            at the Hall of Fame Luncheon, Friday, Oct. 31 at the University Club
            on the Arizona State University main campus. Tickets
          are $25; reservations are being taken online at asu.edu/homecoming.
        Media seating at no charge is available by contacting Liz Farquhar at
        liz.farquhar@asu.edu.</p>
      <p>Hentges
          joined eBay in February 2003 where she heads up the PayPal finance
        team and manages all finance functions including financial strategy,
          planning and analysis, accounting, compliance, treasury and internal
          audit, as well as the integration of PayPal's systems into eBay. </p>
      <p>PayPal
          services enable any business or consumer with email to send and receive
          online payments securely, conveniently and cost-effectively.
          PayPal serves as a critical link between buyer and seller.</p>
      <p>"The eBay
          and PayPal platforms enable people of all ethnicities and abilities
        to be
          in an equal position where they can run a small business online,"
          said Hentges. "I feel like we are enabling our community of users to
          do great things." </p>
      <p>Hentges' desire to help others is also reflected by
          the ties she keeps with the W. P. Carey School of Business. After graduation
          Hentges immediately
          began giving back.<br>
        <br>
        "I felt very blessed to have gone to ASU," said Hentges who was the
          first in her family to complete college. While Hentges was at ASU,
          her mother
          decided to enroll and complete her degree. Several of her siblings
          followed. </p>
      <p>"When I was able, I started giving back to the school so that it would
          be there for others," said Hentges. She has been an active supporter
          of the Accountancy
    Circle, a group formed to advise and develop the School of Business at W.
        P. Carey.<br>
    "It is impossible to deliver a quality program relying solely on tuition
    and state support," said James Boatsman, professor and director of the School
    of
    Accountancy. "Assistance from dedicated alumni like Mary is crucial."</p>
      <p><font size="1">W. P. CAREY SCHOOL OF BUSINESS</font></p>
      <p><font size="1">The W. P. Carey School of Business provides quality undergraduate,
          masters and doctoral programs that draw upon a dynamic learning environment
          to

        faculty enrich the curriculum with their latest research findings, and
        deliver this knowledge in a technology-rich environment. Ranked 21st
        in the nation by U.S. News &amp; World Report, the undergraduate program
        features Business Honors comprised of some of the best students in the
        country. The MBA, ranked 17th in the nation among public programs, combines
        business fundamentals with marketplace issues and trends, giving graduates
        the knowledge and experience to excel in a global economy. W. P. Carey

        and each other through an active alumni community and executive education
        opportunities. <br>
