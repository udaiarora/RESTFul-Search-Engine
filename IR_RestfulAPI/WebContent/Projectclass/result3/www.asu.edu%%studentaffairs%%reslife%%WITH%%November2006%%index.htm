    The new hall decorating contest takes place the week before

Each week the winning hall receives $5,000 to be used for hall <img src="images/hallDeco2006.jpg" alt="HAV" width="120" height="90" align="left">improvements. The first three contest winners have been Cholla hall (September 30), Sonora hall (October 21) and Hassayampa Academic Village (November 9).

<p class="style19"><strong>Renters Insurance</strong></p>
<p align="left" class="style19">Renters, including students living on campus, should seriously consider renters insurance, especially if you have a computer, bike, television, stereo and other electronics and valuables in your room. Renters insurance can provide peace of mind and protection against tragedies such as fires, theft, and floods caused by plumbing. In many cases students can be covered by their family&rsquo;s homeowner&rsquo;s policy. Now is a great time to call your insurance agent and find out what the rates are for students living on campus. According to a recent article on youngmoney.com, prices are affordable and can vary from $15 to $30 per month depending on location, square footage and possessions.</p>
