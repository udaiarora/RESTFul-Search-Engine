	from campus-wide departmental units who have come together to share technical expertise. WNUG acts as an advisory 
	body to the University Network Connected Equipment Liaisons (UNCEL) regarding Windows-based networks<br>
        <b><br>
        Mission Statement</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The mission of WNUG is to facilitate and promote the exchange of expertise relating to the 
	deployment of Windows networking solutions to the ASU community.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Membership</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Membership in WNUG is open to all ASU employees who spend a significant portion of their daily 
	activities administrating and advising others about Windows and Windows-based networks and whose job functions also 
	include computing consulting. All employee members are voting members on issues relative to the purpose and mission 
	of the group.  Student workers can become member of WNUG by being sponsored by the college/department in which they
