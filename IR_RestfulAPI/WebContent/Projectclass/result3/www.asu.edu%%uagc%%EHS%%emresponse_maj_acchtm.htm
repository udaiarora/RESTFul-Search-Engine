               <p>  When a private or commercial aircraft is involved in an accident, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is the agency of jurisdiction. Subsequently, no one will be permitted within a five hundred foot radius of the aircraft. Smoke from a burning aircraft is very toxic and should be avoided. If an aircraft incident occurs on the campus, evacuation procedures will begin in the surrounding area. SEE &ldquo;<strong>EVACUATION</strong>&rdquo; SECTION OF THIS GUIDE FOR MORE INFORMATION.</p>

               <p><strong> IF YOU WITNESS AN AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT: </strong></p>

               <ul>

                 <li> Call 9-1-1 . Notify the operator of the accident location, the number of casualties and if any campus structures are affected. </li>

                 <li> If the crash scene is close to your building, notify your supervisor and evacuate if smoke from the crash scene moves in your direction. </li>

                 <li><strong> DO NOT</strong> approach a downed aircraft. The responding Fire Department has equipment and personnel that are trained for such incidents. <br>

                 </li>

        </ul>

               <p align="left"><strong> MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT</strong><strong> </strong></p>

               <p><strong> IF YOU WITNESS A MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT INVOLVING INJURIES: </strong></p>

               <ul>

                 <li> Call 9-1-1 immediately and remain on the scene until released by paramedics and police. </li>

                 <li> Advise the operator of the number of injured and their injuries. </li>

                 <li> Look for hazards that could affect you or responding emergency personnel (fuel, chemicals, etc.) and report them to the 9-1-1 operator. </li>

                 <li><strong> DO NOT</strong> attempt to move the injured unless it is more dangerous to leave them where they are, i.e.: car fire. </li>

                 <li> Attempt to keep the victims calm and reassure them that assistance is on the way. </li>

                 <li> Notify emergency personnel of the number of injured and their locations. </li>
