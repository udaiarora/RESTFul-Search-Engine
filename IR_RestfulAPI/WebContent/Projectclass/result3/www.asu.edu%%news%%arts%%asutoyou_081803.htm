      <h2>Free discussion series explores the arts and society</h2>
      <p>Bring a friend and enjoy a lively evening of coffee and
        conversation when Arizona State University launches its fall ASU to You:
        Coffee, Conversation &amp; the Arts series at Tempe Public Library on
        Sept. 16.</p>
      <p>The lecture is the first of a series of three free community classroom
        events this fall, continuing the popular series offered in previous years
        by faculty and staff from ASU's Herberger College of Fine Arts and the
        College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, in conjunction with other organizations
        in the community. This year's partners in presenting the series are the
        City of Tempe and Friends of the Tempe Public Library.</p>
      <p>The series of guided discussions will explore the dynamic dialogue between
        the arts and society and take place from 6:30-8 p.m. on Sept. 16, Oct.
        14 and Nov. 18. Tempe Public Library is located at 3500 S. Rural Road
        and members of the public may call the Herberger College at (480) 965-6536
        for more information about the events.</p>
      <p>Gender and Society in Ancient Cyprus - Sept. 16</p>
      <p>The last three decades have witnessed the introduction of gendered approaches
        to the social sciences in general, and archaeology in particular. Nancy
        Serwint, associate professor of art history at the Herberger College,
        will lead a discussion about gender and society in ancient Cyprus from
        the Neolithic to Roman periods. The introduction of gender as a focal
        point brings vital new approaches to studying the social interactions
        of the island's rich and dynamic past.</p>
      <p>Super Mario, Virtual Professor - Oct. 14</p>
      <p>What if the university lecture as it has been known since before the
        ancient Greeks, were replaced with video game-style learning? Imagine
        the technical thrills of video games, such as car chases, shoot-outs
        and navigating through imaginary kingdoms infused with algebra, research
        science and the arts.</p>
      <p>Studies show that visual learning through computer games enables the
        users to absorb two-to-three times as much information at least twice
        as fast and retain this information longer than in a traditional classroom
        environment with a learned professor.</p>
      <p>But could the indestructible group of virtual characters, led by the
        leaping plumber Super Mario, be replaced by educational programs? Would
        it be possible to teach students twice as much in a semester? And if
        so, what would this do the existing structure of education that goes
        back 2,000 years? Spend an informative and lively evening with Ron Newcomer,
        professor of theatre at the Herberger College, exploring the answers
        to these questions.</p>
      <p>Religion and Conflict: Old Problem, New Initiative - Nov. 18</p>
      <p>The role of religion in public life has become increasingly contentious
        and high profile, at both national and international levels. We are witnessing
        the rise of extreme forms of fundamentalism as well as a more general
        expanding quest for spirituality.</p>
      <p> The proximity of this talk to the Thanksgiving holiday will enable
        a reflection on the historic character of religious conflict. Carolyn
        Forbes, Assistant Director of ASU's Center for the Study of Religion
        and Conflict will moderate this discussion, which will also explore the
        nature and character of religion itself - what it is we define as religion,
        its relationship to political conflict and the paradoxical quality of
        religion as both a source for conflict and a source for unity.</p>
      <p> The discussion will conclude with a look at contemporary conflicts
        between religion and the liberal state, and a discussion of strategies
        for ameliorating religious conflict.</p>
      <p>ASU to You is a joint program of the Herberger College of Fine Arts,
        College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, City of Tempe Cultural Services
        and Friends of the Tempe Public Library.</p>
