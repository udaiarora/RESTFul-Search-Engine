Mac TCP/IP Problems after upgrading to System 7.5.3
</center></h2>
<p>
Several cases have been reported concerning TCP/IP problems after upgrading to
System 7.5.3- the following is a general description of what should happen,
how this bug is cropping up and what to do to repair the situation.
<p> 
The System 7.5 Update 2.0 installs both Open Transport and Classic networking
services in the System folder. (Classic networking meaning the MacTCP and
Network control panel combination and Open Transport networking meaning the
AppleTalk and TCP/IP control panel combination).  A new folder, called  Apple
Extras, should also be present on the local hard disk after the upgrade; this
folder contains a tool called Network Software Selector that is used to toggle
between these two communication mechanisms.  When the Classic networking mode
has been enabled, the MacTCP and Network control panels should be visible
(after reboot) and the Open Transport files should be invisible.  When the
Open Transport networking mode is enabled, the TCP/IP and AppleTalk control
panels should be visible (after reboot) and the Classic networking files
should be invisible.  The installer will attempt to default to whatever
communication mechanism was in use prior to the 7.5.3 installation ... and
this is where a bug appears to have surfaced. There have been several cases
where the Network Software Selector thinks that the system is using Classic
networking yet still hides the MacTCP control panel.  (And each time MacTCP is
dropped into the System folder, it continues to make it invisible too).
AppleTalk services will work fine but IP services will not.  If Open Transport
is enabled with the Network Software Selector, you'll find that the Open
Transport files as well as the MacTCP control panel are visible.  Again
AppleTalk services will work fine but IP services will not.
<p> 
There are two courses of action that can be taken to repair the situation:
<p><ol>
<li> Toggle to Open Transport with the Network Software Selector, reboot, 
trash the MacTCP control panel.  This system will then be solely running Open
Transport.
<li>Toggle to Open Transport with the Network Software Selector, reboot, run
the 7.5.3 installer but this time do a custom install.  Go to the control
panel option and select MacTCP for installation.  When the installation is
complete, go back to the Network Software Selector, toggle to Classic
Networking.  This system will then be using the Classic Networking (MacTCP)
and still have the option to use Open Transport networking.
