      <h2>ASU&rsquo;s Finley uses bike to help fight MS</h2>
      <p>ASU technology support analyst Jon Finley is on a mission for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society &ndash; for the sixth time, no less.</p>
      <p>Finley, who works in the College of Extended Education, has set his sights on being one of 1,200 participants in the &ldquo;Discount Tire MS 150 Best Dam Bike Tour,&rdquo; to take place Nov. 13-14. The ride begins at 7:30 a.m. at Estrella Foothills High School, and cyclists will ride through Estrella Mountain Park and along old U.S. 80 past the Palo Verde Power Plant to Gila Bend for an overnight stay and party.</p>
      <p>The second day of the ride begins with a pancake breakfast, and the journey ends at the same place as it began &ndash; only this time with lunch and the celebration of another completed tour.</p>
      <p> &ldquo;My wife, Ruth, saw an MS flier in a bike shop, and actually got me interested in the ride in 1990, when the ride still went to Parker Dam,&rdquo; Finley says. &ldquo;We were going to do the ride together. At the last moment, Ruth got an offer to go shopping with her mom in California, so she never went on the ride.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>He adds: &ldquo;I did the ride that year because it was for a good cause, and the bike ride was actually a fun event.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Riders that sign up to participate in the event are making a commitment to fulfill the $200 pledge minimum, but Finley hopes to go way over that amount.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Last year I brought in $500 in pledges and donations,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This year my goal is to reach $1,000.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>He adds that riders of all ages are welcome in the event.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The MS rides have had riders from ages 13 to over 70 complete the entire ride,&rdquo; Finley says. &ldquo;Last year, one of the youngest riders also brought in the most pledges.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Three hundred volunteers help put on the event. More information about the bike tour can be found at this Web site: (<a href="http://www.nationalmssociety.org/aza/home">www.nationalmssociety.org/aza/home</a>).</p>
      <p>Finley says the route of the event has changed over the years.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The original route went from Dysart Road and Grand out to Parker Dam, stopping overnight at either Wenden or Salome,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Upon reaching Parker Dam, the riders were then bused back to Phoenix. The ride now starts in western Phoenix, goes out to Gila Bend, then returns to Phoenix.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>So how does he prepare for a 150-mile bike ride?</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Lots of distance,&rdquo; Finley says. &ldquo;I was riding 20 miles, three days a week, with 40 miles on the weekend. I&rsquo;ve changed that to save our environment &ndash; and my gas money &ndash; by commuting to ASU from home on Monday and Wednesday, which is a 40-miles round trip each day, some sprint work on Friday at the Student Recreation Complex (SRC), and a 40- to 60-mile ride on Sunday with a local MS team called Team Spinning Edge.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Finley quickly points out, though, that riders with much less training can participate in the upcoming event.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m putting in 100 to 140 miles a week now toward training, but you could do this ride if you only trained for 10- or 20-mile intervals,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Rest stop areas are 10 to 15 miles apart for the MS ride.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Every year, more than 80,000 riders participate in the more than 100 bicycle tours across the United States and pedal more than 10.5 million miles to benefit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, whose mission is to end the devastating effects of the disease. MS is a chronic, often disabling, disease of the central nervous system, and nearly 400,000 Americans are afflicted by it.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The money we raise goes directly to the MS Society to help find a cure,&rdquo; Finley says.</p>
      <p>The Arizona Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, which began providing services and programs for families in 1951, is a nonprofit agency serving more than 8,000 people with MS in Arizona.</p>
      <p>More than 1,000 volunteers give their expertise and time to the Arizona chapter, serving on the board, leading support groups and conducting fund-raising efforts.</p>
