      <h2>Jordan joins mayor's office to develop Downtown Campus</h2>
      <p>Phoenix Mayor-elect Phil Gordon and ASU President Michael Crow have
        announced an unprecedented partnership that will position ASU senior
        administrator Nancy Jordan as a loaned senior executive in the Mayor's
        office. Jordan's primary responsibility will be to work on a joint project
        to establish a 12,000-student ASU campus in downtown Phoenix.</p>
      <p>Both Mayor-elect
          Gordon and President Crow agreed the loaned executive exchange was
        just the first step in a joint venture that would benefit
          both the state's largest city and largest university.</p>
      <p>"Nancy is a strong,
          community oriented individual," says Mayor-elect Gordon. "Not only
        will she be our go-to person on the ASU Downtown Campus
          project, she brings a wealth of experience and good relationships with
          her to the mayor's office - including a background in education and
        outreach within the Hispanic community." </p>
      <p>"ASU is eager to work with Mayor-elect
          Gordon and the city of Phoenix in true partnership," says Crow. "We
        want to repay and reinvest in the
          community's commitment to ASU by loaning our executive staff to the
        city - an idea whose time has come and one that makes sense for both
        institutions.
          Nancy Jordan, with her many skills and years of experience working
        with the city and at ASU, is the ideal person to serve as liaison between
          Mayor-elect Gordon and the university administration. With her help,
          we're truly breaking new ground in serving this community." </p>
      <p>A Phoenix
          resident, Jordan earned a B.A. degree at the University of California,
          Riverside, and a master's of counseling from ASU. </p>
      <p>At ASU,
          Jordan has been responsible for managing advocacy programs, constituent
          outreach, special events, special programs and community relations
        and outreach. She also served as associate executive director of the
        ASU
        Alumni Association from 1996 to 2000.</p>
      <p>Prior to joining the university
          administration, Jordan was executive director of the Genesis Program,
          Inc., a non-profit educational and service
          agency for youth; dean of school and community relations for Phoenix
          College; and executive assistant to the chancellor of Maricopa Community
        Colleges.</p>
      <p>"Nancy will be a full partner in my administration," says Gordon.
          "Her vast experience in K-12 education, community colleges, and her
        deep roots
          in the Hispanic community will make her role much broader than just
        the ASU Downtown Campus project. But we expect to use her there first."</p>
      <p>The
          mayor-elect's vision of the ASU Downtown Campus is one where students
          can live and learn in an urban environment. It will bring an economic
          boost to many of the grocery, restaurant and retail shops in downtown,
          infill vacant areas with new construction and be a welcome environment
          to the incoming creative class of entrepreneurs, teachers, scientists
        and educators. </p>
      <p>"I am excited to have this opportunity to work with both
          ASU and the city of Phoenix on such an innovative and ground-breaking
          project," says
          Jordan. "It is a great opportunity to combine experience with a truly
        innovative urban project."</p>
      <p>"The mayor-elect's plan to help attract the
          new economy to our central city is visionary and bold," says Crow.
        "We are fortunate to have a partner
          who will work tirelessly in helping this venture succeed as well as
        in finding new and innovative ways to combine our expertise in the future."</p>
      <p>Jordan
          was a teacher and counselor in the Roosevelt School District. She is
          a member of a number of community service organizations including
          the Hispanic Woman's Corporation, Heritage Commission, Arizona Hispanic
          Chamber of Commerce, East Valley Partnership, South Mountain College
        Advisory Board and Hispanic Leadership Institute Advisory Board.</p>
      <p>She is
          a recipient of the Distinguished Citizens Award of the Phoenix Union
          High School District, the Leadership Award - Mayor's Partnership
          Championship Awards, and Innovator of the Year award of Maricopa Community
        Colleges and South Mountain Community College.</p>
      <p>Jordan, whose salary will
          be paid by the university, will be a senior staff member of Gordon's
          administration. Her loaned position is a new
          administrative staff function, symbolic of the partnership between
      Gordon's administration, the city of Phoenix and ASU.</p>
