                    Batch of Staff Workstations Arrives</font></h3>

                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> LIST 

                    has developed a three-year life cycle for all staff and patron 

                    computers in the Libraries. For the first year of this life 

                    cycle implementation, we've ordered over 170 new computers. 

                    The new PCs arrived early this week and have been inventoried, 

                    labeled, and sorted by department for distribution to staff 

                    throughout the Libraries. Since the placement process of staff 

                    workstations involves an interaction with each staff member 

                    to transfer personal work files to the new machines, the process 

                    may take 3 to 4 weeks to complete. In the past weeks, LIST 

                    has met with departmental representatives to explain the process, 

                    answer questions, and adjust the placement schedules to provide 

                    the least amount of disruption to the staff members involved 

                    in this first phase of the replacement cycle. </font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> After nearly two 

                    years of planning work, the new libraries web site is about 

                    to come online. You can see a preview of the home page at 

                    <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/">http://www.asu.edu/lib/</a>. 

                    User testing has just been completed on the new home page 

                    and it&#8217;s time to start moving content! LIST will be 

                    migrating existing top-level and departmental content into 

                    the new site templates over the course of the next three weeks, 

                    and will have the new site ready for preview by library staff 

                    no later than May 23rd. If you have any questions, comments, 

                    or concerns about this process, please contact Heather Knowles.</font></p>

                    University ID Update Project</font></h3>

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Arizona State 

                    University has started a project to convert all affiliates 

                    who are using a Social Security number as their University 

                    ID number to a 993 number. The first phase is to convert benefits-eligible 

                    faculty and staff to their new numbers before June 30, 2005. 

                    Other populations will follow. Employees who are converted 

                    will be advised of the change before it is made. The first 

                    test batch will be converted the week of April 28, 2005. LIST 

                    has made some changes to the way patron records are loaded 

                    so that the targeted records can be overlaid with a minimum 

                    of disruption to the users&#8217; library services. If you 

                    have any questions about this project, please contact Fred 

                    McIlvain.</font></p>
