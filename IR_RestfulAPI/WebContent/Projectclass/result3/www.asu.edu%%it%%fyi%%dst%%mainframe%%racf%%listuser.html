HELP LISTUSER

FUNCTION
          5740-XXH  (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 1987

    The LISTUSER command displays RACF information about one or more
    users and the groups to which they are connected.

    In order to display information about another user you must be the
    owner of the user or have the SPECIAL or AUDITOR attribute, or
    have the group-SPECIAL or group-AUDITOR attribute in the group
    owning the user.  A user with the AUDITOR attribute may display
    auditing information.  You can always display your own RACF
    information.  To display TSO information, you must have the
    SPECIAL attribute, or have at least read authority via field level
    access control.

  ICH30001I UNABLE TO LOCATE (USER, GROUP, CONNECT) ENTRY name

            Explanation:  The indicated entry name could not be found
            on the RACF data base.

            System Action:  If a user entry cannot be located,
            processing continues with the next entry.  If a group or
            connect entry cannot be located, then an inconsistency
            exists on the RACF data base.

            Problem Determination:  The RACF utility programs may be
            needed to determine the inconsistency.  All information
            that is available is listed.

  ICH30002I NOT AUTHORIZED TO LIST (userid, *)

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to list
            the indicated userid or to specify *.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH30003I GROUP group-name USER CONNECTION NOT INDICATED

            Explanation:  The user profile being listed identifies the
            indicated group as a connected group, but the group entry
            does not reference the user.  An inconsistency exists on
            the RACF data base.

            Problem Determination:  The RACF utility programs may be
            needed to determine the inconsistency.  All information
            that is available is listed.

  ICH30010I NOT AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE LISTUSER

            Explanation:  You are not defined to RACF and cannot issue
            the LISTUSER command, or RACF is not active.

            System Action:  RACF terminates  the command.

  ICH30011I NOT AUTHORIZED TO LIST ANY USERS

            Explanation:  You specified LISTUSER *, but you are not
            authorized to list any user.

  ICH30012I NO USER(S) LISTED.  NORACF SPECIFIED AND NO
            OTHER SEGMENTS REQUESTED.

            Explanation:  RACF cannot list users when 'NORACF' is
            specified.  Listing users for other segments has not been
            requested.

  ICH30013I NOT AUTHORIZED TO LIST TSO SEGMENT INFORMATION

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to list
            information in the TSO segment.
