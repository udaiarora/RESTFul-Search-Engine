      <h2>ASU targets retention, graduation rates</h2>
      <p>Student retention and graduation
          rates are two areas ASU is focusing on to measure excellence and achievement. </p>
      <p>At the Arizona Board of Regents
          (ABOR) meeting Nov. 20-21, university presidents gave individual reports
          that focused on the criteria used
          to rank academic programs by various national organizations and publications,
          including U.S. News and World Report.</p>
      <p>ASU President Michael Crow, Executive
          Vice President and Provost Milton Glick and Executive Director of Institutional
          Analysis Joseph Matt presented
          the national contexts related to rankings and used the U.S. News and
          World Report ranking system as a vehicle for discussion of goals for
          excellence and achievement. </p>
      <p>Glick presented ASU's efforts that aim toward
          a "win-win" strategy for students and ASU. These efforts include: continued
          emphasis on student
          retention programs; focus on the development and visibility of academic
          programs; and focus on quality of faculty and reduction of class sizes. </p>
      <p>"We are 'people's' universities," Crow said. "We need greater resources
          to fulfill our mission and move forward to help hardworking kids from
          hardworking families who wish to gain a high quality experience in
        higher education."</p>
      <p>Crow said ASU is focusing its efforts on the reduction of
          class sizes, specifically for gateway courses such as English and mathematics.</p>
      <p>These
          gateway courses are usually required for graduation, have a large amount
          of students enrolled and are difficult for students who may need
          more individualized attention.</p>
      <p>ASU's ongoing partnership with community
          colleges allows students to attend community college, where some courses
          like mathematics, are smaller.
          This provides students an opportunity to successfully complete gateway
          courses before they transfer to ASU.</p>
      <p>Glick is hopeful this ongoing partnership
          and the new ASU-Maricopa Alliance will help students complete their
        college education at ASU and the university
          obtain better national rankings.</p>
      <p>"We hope the new ASU-Maricopa Alliance
          will give us a better opportunity to help those students who are at
        risk of dropping," he said. "This will
          also assist us in tracking students. It's really a matter of taking
        care of your people first."</p>
      <p>Enrollment funding formulas will be discussed
          during a study session at the Jan. 22 - 23 ABOR meeting at ASU.</p>
      <p>Arizona's universities presented
          their fall 2003 Enrollment Report, including headcount (total number
          of part-time and full-time students) and the
          number of full-time equivalent students. Overall, Arizona university
          system headcount enrollments increased 1.4 percent, from 113,869 in
        fall 2002, to 115,464 in fall 2003. ASU Main Campus' total headcount
        for fall
          2003 was 48,901; ASU West, 7,105; and ASU East, 3,551.</p>
      <p>Also at the meeting,
        ASU President Michael Crow presented the ASU Arts and Business District
        Gateway Plan. The proposed gateway is one component
        of the university's Comprehensive Development Plan. The site consists
        of approximately 13 acres of ASU-owned land at the old Tempe Center site
        on the southeast corner of Mill Avenue and University Drive in Tempe.
        The redevelopment of this site will include the new location of the W.
        P. Carey School of Business, the expansion of the Fine Arts Center as
        well as the College of Architecture &amp; Environmental Design Building,
        to create the western gateway to ASU. </p>
      <p>"The Gateway Development will
            enhance the goal of embedding university activity into the life of
          Downtown Tempe,"
            Executive Vice President of
          Administration and Finance Mernoy Harrison said. </p>
      <p>Discussion forums have
          not been planned, but Harrison said there will be ample opportunities
          for community input on the plan.</p>
