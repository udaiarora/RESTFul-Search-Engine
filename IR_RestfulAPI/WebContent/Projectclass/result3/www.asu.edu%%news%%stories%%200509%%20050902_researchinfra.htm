                    <p> An important element of ASU&rsquo;s rise to research prominence is the ability to draw top researchers to the university. </p>
                    <p> In the last several years ASU has made strong additions to the faculty in a wide range of science and engineering fields, such as anthropology, electrical engineering, evolutionary biology, sustainability and vaccinology. </p>
                    <p> Among these significant additions, are researchers who have reached the pinnacle of their profession, earning entry into the prestigious National Academy of Engineering and its counterparts, the National Academy of Sciences and Royal Society of London. These organizations represent the recognized leaders in the science and engineering fields. <a href="20050902_NAEfaculty.htm">Read More </a></p></td>

              <p>The building boom in the heart of ASU&rsquo;s Tempe campus is the most visible example of the changes the university is going through to transform itself into a highly competitive research institution. Building cranes across campus are a testament to the overall goal of adding more than 1 million square feet of new, world-class laboratory space as ASU builds up its research infrastructure.</p>
              <p>Several new buildings will open their doors in the coming months. In Tempe, the Biodesign Institute&rsquo;s second building, Biodesign B, and the Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building I are scheduled to open in early 2006. ISTB II, also at the Tempe campus, had its tenants moving in this month. ISTB III at ASU&rsquo;s Polytechnic campus is expected to open next January, as well.</p>
              <p>But there are other elements that go along with the new buildings and world-class laboratory space, says Jonathan Fink, vice president of research and economic affairs. Those elements include people and grants.</p>
              <p>To that end, ASU has made several significant new hires across a wide range of science and engineering fields, such as anthropology, electrical engineering, evolutionary biology, sustainability and vaccinology.</p>
              <p>With those additions have come major projects and an enhanced ability to compete for new grants, such as the $14 million Gates Foundation grant recently awarded to Roy Curtiss of the Biodesign Institute, and the nearly $44 million Army grant that led to the establishment of the Flexible Display Center and MacroTechnology Works at ASU.</p>
              <p>Building new laboratories, hiring new researchers and securing new grants will, in turn, help raise the stature of ASU firmly into the realm of successful research universities. But all three of these elements need to be addressed to move forward.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Improving our research capacity is one of the hardest things we are trying to accomplish at ASU,&rdquo; says Michael Crow, the university&rsquo;s president. &ldquo;We are fortunate to have the backing of the Arizona Legislature &ndash; which, through the Research Infrastructure Bill of 2003, has provided some $185 million to help us build outstanding new research facilities. Now we are beginning to see some tangible evidence of the value of this investment as ASU becomes a highly desirable place to work and to advance science.&rdquo;</p>
              <p align="center" class="colheads">Building foundation</p>
              <p><img src="../../200509/images/azbiodesignbldg.jpg" width="288" height="210" hspace="7" vspace="7" align="right">Because ASU is trying to catch up to other, more established research universities, it was decided that an accelerated timetable was necessary for the new buildings, new people and new grants.</p>
              <p>Fink says administrators have known that a significant research space shortage existed &ndash; on the order of about 600,000 square feet &ndash; which was hindering recruitment and keeping ASU from winning new research grants.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We were stuck in terms of winning more large grants because the star faculty we had were already overcommitted,&rdquo; Fink says. &ldquo;We were limited in our ability to attract more high-end faculty because we lacked the research space they needed, and we lacked the funds to finance new buildings because we didn&rsquo;t have enough large grants. To break the logjam, we needed to start with one of those three things. But we couldn&rsquo;t recruit without a place for the new people to go.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;President Crow argued that we needed to get top-quality research space right away, and that led to the Biodesign A building (which opened in December 2004). Even though we didn&rsquo;t have a well-defined fund ing stream for it, we cobbled together the resources we had and borrowed against anticipated grant revenue. It was really motivated by this need to jump-start the whole cyclic process.&rdquo; </p>
              <p> Bringing new buildings online rapidly has been a new experience at ASU, says Paul Johnson, associate vice president for research. In two years time, the ISTB I and ISTB II facilities will have moved from conceptualization to opening. In contrast, the process took eight years for the Goldwater science and engineering building. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;One of the big differences is that the funding for these buildings was obtained in one big chunk, coming from the research infrastructure bill,&rdquo; Johnson says. &ldquo;We never had anything like that before.&rdquo; </p>
              <p> With funds in hand, ASU began to change the way it looked when it comes to research. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;The Biodesign building communicates high-quality, world-class research,&rdquo; Fink says. &ldquo;You walk in there and feel strongly that this is a place where important things happen. It impresses people right away.&rdquo; </p>
              <p> With the opening of the three ISTB facilities and Biodesign B, the university will effectively add about 450,000 square feet of new space. (The Arizona Biomedical Collaborative, another Infrastructure Bill building, to be built in downtown Phoenix in collaboration with the University of Arizona, will become better defined in the next 12 months.) The impact of the space in itself is huge, but it also will open up newly vacated space in existing facilities as faculty move into their new labs, Johnson says. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;The new buildings are the front wave of the reallocations of space,&rdquo; he says, adding that the domino effect of new space is &ldquo;allowing other areas to consolidate in existing buildings.&rdquo; </p>
              <p> In this regard, with ASU pushing so hard and fast for new space, it may be falling victim to its own success. Part of the motivation of new buildings is to get researchers out of low-quality space, like those in the old engineering wings, so that land eventually can be devoted to possible new buildings like ISTB IV or ISTB V. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;The problem we are facing is that we are so successful in new recruiting that, right now, the new faculty are coming in faster than the buildings are coming online,&rdquo; Fink says. &ldquo;So we are looking at retrofitting some of the space we thought we were going to demolish after people moved into ISTB II.&rdquo;</p>
              <p align="center" class="colheads"><strong> Buzz factor </strong></p>
              <p> ASU also is revamping the manner in which it recruits new faculty researchers. That process used to be focused on pursuing only one significant hire at a time. Now the university scouts out several potential targets at once. </p>
              <p> It was not uncommon for ASU to spend three or four years courting one prominent researcher at a time, and the success rate was very low. ASU talked with Charlie Arntzen for five years before he agreed to come to Tempe from the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research. With several new National Academy of Science and National Academy of Engineering members on board, ASU is able to generate considerable interest from other top researchers. </p>
              <p> Attracting prominent researchers can have a snowball effect. As more come, they attract the attention of their peers. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;Having a large number of successes quickly was one of our major priorities,&rdquo; Fink says. &ldquo;You try to get these people in the door because of the momentum it creates. When others see who is here, they become interested. The buzz factor is very significant.&rdquo; </p>
              <p> These prominent researchers bring with them their teams, their grants and their reputations. All are important factors in raising the level of ASU&rsquo;s sponsored research. But balance is important, too. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;We recognize that becoming a great research university is not just a matter of raising grant dollars and hiring top natural scientists and engineers,&rdquo; Fink says. &ldquo;It also requires achieving excellence and leadership in those areas of scholarship, as well as creative activity that might not offer opportunities for obtaining large grants. The Research and Economic Affairs Office is engaged in strengthening our presence in those fields as well.&rdquo; </p>
              <p align="center" class="colheads"><strong> Double-double </strong></p>
              <p> One overarching goal of the Research Office is to get ASU to the $300 million per year in sponsored research funding as quickly as possible &ndash; a level administrators feel is necessary for ASU to survive as a competitive research-active institution. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;We were able to double funding in five years (1998 &ndash; 2002), going from about $75 million to around $150 million,&rdquo; Fink says. &ldquo;We achieved this 15 percent per year growth with very limited new investments of university resources in strategic hires or new research space. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;Since 2003, we&rsquo;ve been concentrating on expanding infrastructure (new research buildings) and targeted hires. We now expect that we are poised for more rapid growth. We&rsquo;re aiming to move to 20 percent annual growth rate, which would mean a doubling in around four years (to $300 million).&rdquo; </p>
              <p> &ldquo;The last doubling was easier than the next doubling because of the amount of money,&rdquo; Johnson adds. &ldquo;For the first doubling, we had to get $75 million more. The next time, we have to get $150 million more. That is equivalent to hiring 150 new people who are bringing in $1 million each.&rdquo; </p>
              <p> Fink says ASU is working hard to find the right opportunities where the university has an advantage, and to identify the research areas where it can be most successful. Building on its strengths is one strategic approach used by ASU; another is finding areas that are important to the economy of Arizona and the American Southwest. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;The Flexible Display Center grant has the value of not only being cutting-edge research, but also possibly opening up an entirely new industry for Arizona,&rdquo; Fink says. &ldquo;It gives us the opportunity to recruit companies to Arizona that never had a presence here before.&rdquo; </p>
              <p> Achieving the $300 million per year level will mean hard work for everyone. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;We need to hire more Roy Curtisses, help our existing faculty to grow their programs, and find opportunities to nurture areas that have been less research-active in the past,&rdquo; Johnson says. &ldquo;We also need to be more aggressive at looking for new funding sources and new ways for seeking funding for ASU research programs.&rdquo; </p>
              <p> Fink and Johnson are confident the university can achieve these goals, especially if the two of them can persuade people from funding agencies to visit ASU. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;When they do come out and look around they all say the same thing: &lsquo;I had no idea you have so many exciting things going on,&rsquo; &rdquo; Fink says. </p>
