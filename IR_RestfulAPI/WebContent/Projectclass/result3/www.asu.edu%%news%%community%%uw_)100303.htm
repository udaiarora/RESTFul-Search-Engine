      <h2>Volunteer experience sheds light on United Way funding needs</h2>
      <p>        Giving away loads of money to local charities in need sounds like a fun
          gig. But, two ASU employees who have served on United Way allocation
          committees for many years know firsthand the job is full of tough choices.        </p>
      <p>As volunteers for the Valley of the Sun United Way, Margo Rivera-Wilson
          and Wendy Hultsman say deciding the financial fortune of community
        programs is an experience that is both heart-wrenching and worthwhile. </p>
      <p>Rivera-Wilson,
          a program coordinator for Extended Campus Programs, has been volunteering
          for Valley of the Sun United Way for about 15 years
          as an allocation committee panelist. Valley of the Sun United Way has
          several allocation committees, each charged with distributing funds
        to charities in a particular service area - such as "Investing in Youth"
          or "Overcoming Disease and Disabilities."</p>
      <p>"Allocation committee visits
          are a chance for the agency to show us what they have done with their
          United Way dollars and help us to understand
          what they are asking for in the coming year," she says. "These site
        visits are very rewarding and really give the volunteers a snapshot of
        what
          the agency does for the community."</p>
      <p>Hultsman is an associate professor
          for Recreation and Tourism Management at ASU West. Like Rivera-Wilson,
          she has served on allocation panels
          for several years and says volunteering on a committee can seem a bit
          overwhelming at times, but is always time well spent.</p>
      <p>Hultsman says the
          annual process begins in September when she and her fellow committee
          members conduct site visits to all agencies who will
          be submitting proposals to their panel. </p>
      <p>At the site visits, panelists
          listen to presentations from board members, clientele and staff. Agencies
          explain how United Way funding from the
          past year was used to improve the community.</p>
      <p>"The agencies whom we visit
          are truly making a positive impact on the lives of thousands of individuals
          and families in Maricopa County," Hultsman
          says. "Until you actually make these site visits you do not get the
        full breadth of how important, and daunting their roles are." </p>
      <p>In January,
          panel members receive program proposals from each agency and evaluate
          them based on established criteria. </p>
      <p>Early each spring, each
          panel meets to discuss submitted proposals. </p>
      <p>"We
          then determine if there are any questions we would like to ask of the
          agency and if there is a need for them to come in for a short presentation,"
          Hultsman says. "We get a preliminary idea of the level of funding we,
          as a panel, recommend - full, partial or none."</p>
      <p>Then in May, allocation
          committees meet so panelists can go over all of the data, and make
        the final funding recommendations. Hultsman says
          this is always a heart-wrenching job because there is never enough
        money to go around.</p>
      <p>Rivera-Wilson says she hopes her fellow ASU employees will
          support the United Way either by making a monetary donation, by becoming
          a volunteer
          or by doing both.<br>
        "I feel it is very important to give to United Way," Rivera-Wilson
          says. "If you do not have dollars to donate this year for the campaign,
          I would
          look at volunteering for either United Way or one of the agencies that
          receive United Way dollars. This is such a good way to give back to
          your community." </p>
      <p>United Way pledge cards have been distributed to all ASU
          employees and are due Oct. 15. This year employees will also be able
          to conveniently
          make donations online. For more information, contact your department's
          United Way unit representative or visit the Valley of the Sun United
          Way Web site at (www.vsuw.org).</p>
