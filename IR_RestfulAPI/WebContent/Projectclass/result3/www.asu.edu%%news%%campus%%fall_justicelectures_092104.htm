      <h2>Fall lecture series focuses on justice issues</a></h2>
      <p align="left"> State Attorney General Terry Goddard likes what his office is able to do on behalf of all Arizonans. </p>
      <p align="left"> &ldquo;We get to wear the white hats,&rdquo; he says. </p>
      <p align="left"> Goddard was the first speaker this fall for the Seeking Justice in Arizona Lecture Series, put together by the School of Justice and Social Inquiry in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. His speech, titled &ldquo;Consumer Justice in Arizona ,&rdquo; was held Sept. 2 in the Cochise Room (MU 226C) of ASU&rsquo;s Memorial Union. </p>
      <p align="left"> The free lecture series, which is open to everyone, aims to bring attention to broad issues of justice in a familiar context. To that end, the lectures feature leaders in Arizona with diverse backgrounds who are dedicated to making the state a better place to live. The series is in its third year. </p>
      <p align="left"> &ldquo;In my job as attorney general, I try to level the playing field in the way justice is administered to all Arizonans,&rdquo; says Goddard, who has served as the state&rsquo;s attorney general since 2002 and received his law degree from ASU. &ldquo;One reason the office of attorney general is part of the justice equation is that it&rsquo;s quite literally the people&rsquo;s lawyer. My job is to stand up for the people of Arizona when their rights are being trampled.&rdquo; </p>
      <p align="left"> Goddard used his speech to outline some of the consumer justice issues his office works on, including consumer fraud, civil rights complaints and environmental crimes. </p>
      <p align="left"> &ldquo;There were about 75,000 consumer complaints fielded by my office last year,&rdquo; Goddard says. &ldquo;Fifteen thousand of them turned into actual attorney general&rsquo;s office files &ndash; and I think we&rsquo;re just scratching the surface.&rdquo; </p>
      <p align="left"> Out of those 15,000 files, one phone call by his office usually fixes the problem, he says. When the phone calls fail, that&rsquo;s when the lawsuits get under way. </p>
      <p align="left"> &ldquo;When we bring a suit, it&rsquo;s not for you, specifically,&rdquo; Goddard says, referring to the person who first files the complaint. &ldquo;The money that&rsquo;s recovered is actually the state&rsquo;s, not yours.&rdquo; </p>
      <p align="left"> He was quick to add that most of the settlements his office negotiates in the lawsuits include repayment for the individual consumers, too. </p>
      <p align="left"> Goddard&rsquo;s office keeps a &ldquo;Top 10&rdquo; list of scams, and mortgage scams have appeared on the list for the first time now, he said. Other notables on this list include the &ldquo;Spanish Lottery&rdquo; scam and the Nigerian money-laundering scam. More details about these and other scams can be found on the attorney general&rsquo;s Web site, (<a href="http://agaz.gov">http://agaz.gov</a>). </p>
      <p align="left"> Marie Provine, director of ASU&rsquo;s School of Justice and Social Inquiry, voiced her pleasure with what the lecture series is able to accomplish. </p>
      <p align="left"> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not often that a department here at ASU sponsors a series of real interest both to students and to the local community,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The focus on justice addressed by highly placed people in the justice-seeking process brings this together and makes it work.&rdquo; </p>
      <p align="left"> Provine credits retired Court of Appeals of Arizona Judge Rudy Gerber with being the workhorse in bringing the event together. </p>
      <p align="left"> Gerber serves on the faculties of the School of Justice and Social Inquiry and the College of Law at ASU, but he also maintains a law practice. He says the lecture series has three main goals. </p>
      <p align="left"> &ldquo;One is to heighten the awareness of academic and community justice issues,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The second is to recognize community leaders who have made changes for the better, and the third is to give students role models for their careers.&rdquo; </p>
      <p align="left"> Other times, dates, locations and topics for the speakers in the lecture series include: </p>
      <p align="left"> &bull; 4 p.m. , Oct. 7, Pima room (MU 218) &ndash; <em>Arizona Republic</em> columnist Jon Talton, &ldquo;Economic Justice in Arizona: Hard Realities in the Poor Man&rsquo;s Paradise.&rdquo; Talton&rsquo;s columns have been carried in newspapers throughout North America. </p>
      <p align="left"> &bull; 4 p.m. , Nov. 4, Pima room (MU 218) &ndash; Glendale City Court Presiding Judge Elizabeth Finn, &ldquo;The Struggle for Civil Rights in Arizona.&rdquo; Finn was appointed to her post in March 2003. For the previous 23 years she served as a judge for the Phoenix Municipal Court. She also was a two-term president of the ASU Law School Alumni Association. </p>
      <p align="left"> &bull; 4 p.m. , Dec. 2, Pima room (MU 218) &ndash; Jack Pfister, &ldquo;Reflections on Arizona &rsquo;s Merit Selection of Judges.&rdquo; Pfister has strong connections to ASU, having served as president of the ASU Research Park, as vice president of Institutional Advancement and on the Arizona Board of Regents. He recently retired as a professor in ASU&rsquo;s School of Public Affairs. </p>
