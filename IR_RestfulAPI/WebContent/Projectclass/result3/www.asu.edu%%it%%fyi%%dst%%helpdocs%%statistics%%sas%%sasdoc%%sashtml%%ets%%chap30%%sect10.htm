<P>Larger smoothing weights (less damping) permit the more recent data to
have a greater influence on the predictions. Smaller smoothing weights
(more damping) give less weight to recent data.
<P><H3><I>Specifying the Smoothing Weights</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxtf90055">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf90054">&#13;</A>Typically the smoothing weights are chosen to be from zero to one.
(This is intuitive because the weights associated with the past
smoothing state and the value of current observation would normally
sum to one.)
However, each smoothing model (except Winters Method --
Multiplicative Version) has an ARIMA equivalent.
Weights chosen to be within the ARIMA additive-invertible
region will guarantee stable predictions
(refer to Archibald 1990 and Gardner 1985).
The ARIMA equivalent and the additive-invertible region
for each smoothing model are listed in the following sections.
<P><H3><I>Optimizing the Smoothing Weights</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxtf90057">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf90056">&#13;</A>Smoothing weights are determined so as to
minimize the sum of squared one-step-ahead prediction errors.
The optimization is initialized by choosing from a predetermined grid
the initial smoothing weights that result in the
smallest sum of squared one-step-ahead prediction errors.
The optimization process is highly dependent on this initialization.
It is possible that the optimization process will fail due to the
inability to obtain stable initial values for the smoothing weights
(refer to Greene 1993 and Judge et al 1980),
and it is possible for the optimization to result in a local minima.
<P><A NAME="idxtf90059">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf90058">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf90061">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf90060">&#13;</A>The optimization process can result in weights to be chosen
outside both the zero-to-one range and the ARIMA additive-invertible region.
By restricting weight optimization to additive-invertible region,
you can obtain a local minimum with stable predictions.  Likewise,
weight optimization can be restricted to the zero-to-one range or
other ranges.  It is also possible to fix certain weights to a
specific value and optimize the remaining weights.
<P><H4><I>Standard Errors</I></H4>
<P><A NAME="idxtf90063">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf90062">&#13;</A>The standard errors associated with the smoothing weights are calculated
from the Hessian matrix of the sum of squared one-step-ahead prediction errors
with respect to the smoothing weights used in the optimization process.
<P><H4><I>Weights Near Zero or One</I></H4>
Sometimes the optimization process results in weights near zero or one.
<P>For Simple or Double (Brown) Exponential Smoothing, a level weight
near zero implies that simple differencing of the time series may be
appropriate.
<P>For Linear (Holt) Exponential Smoothing, a level weight near zero
implies that the smoothed trend is constant and that an ARIMA model 
with deterministic trend may be a more appropriate model.
<P>For Damped-Trend Linear Exponential Smoothing, a damping weight near
one implies that Linear (Holt) Exponential Smoothing may be a more
appropriate model.
<P>For Winters Method and Seasonal Exponential Smoothing, a seasonal
weight near one implies that a nonseasonal model may be more
appropriate and a seasonal weight near zero implies that deterministic
seasonal factors may be present.
