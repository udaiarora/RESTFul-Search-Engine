        Leader! </b> </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My grandpa used to 
        be a teacher. <br>
        He was a librarian and taught children art..<br>
        He gave children a great start! <br>
        After school he takes care of my brother and me.<br>
        I think you can really see&#133;<br>
        He is nice to do things like these.<br>
        He gets on his knees, goes in breeze,<br>
        Just to make me happy!<br>
        Well grandpa I'm clapping!<br>
        He was a teacher.<br>
        He could be a preacher<br>
        And even adopt a creature.<br>
        My grandpa controls his block watch<br>
        To make sure his neighborhood is a safe and wonderful place<br>
        And everyone has a smile on their face!<br>
        My grandpa is a real leader.<br>
        He could go from setting people free<br>
        To taking care of a skinned knee!<br>
        I love my grandpa when it's just him and me.<br>
        Together we believe that if we try<br>
        We can succeed!</font></p>
