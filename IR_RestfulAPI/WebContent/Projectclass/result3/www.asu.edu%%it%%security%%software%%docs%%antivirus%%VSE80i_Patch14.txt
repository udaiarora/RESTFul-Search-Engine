ABOUT THIS RELEASE


PURPOSE

This release combines previous Patches and updated
binaries into a single Microsoft Patch installer to
address all items listed in "Resolved Issues" and
"Previously Resolved Issues" below.


RESOLVED ISSUES

1.  ISSUE:
    A boot sector virus was not detected when the
    on-access scanner configuration is set to Clean
    infections automatically. When configured to any
    other action, the boot sector virus was found.

    RESOLUTION:
    The on-access scanner executable, MCSHIELD.EXE,
    now detects boot sector viruses when the action
    is configured to Clean.

2.  ISSUE:
    Laptop computers that were not connected to the
    network and configured to use centralized
    alerting, could take upwards of three minutes to
    log in. The centralized alerting server could
    not be contacted over the network.

    RESOLUTION:
    Alerts that are generated by VirusScan
    Enterprise on startup and shutdown, using
    centralized alerting, can now be suppressed.

    Add the dWORD value
    "bSuppressStartupCentralAlerts" and set it to
    the number one, located in the registry at:

       HKLM\SOFTWARE\Network Associates\TVD\Shared Components\Alert Client\VSE

3.  ISSUE:
    The ScriptScan feature loaded into the memory
    space of any process that launched a script
    (VBScript or JScript).

    RESOLUTION:
    Processes can now be excluded from having
    ScriptScan provide protection to that process.
    The process name, without extension, can be
    added to the registry string
    "ExcludedProcesses," located at:

       HKLM\SOFTWARE\Network Associates\TVD\Shared Components\On Access
       Scanner\ScriptScan

    Additional process names can be added, separated
    by a "," comma.

4.  ISSUE:
    Microsoft Outlook may stop responding when
    receiving emails that had attachments with
    double-byte file names, or very long file
    names.

    RESOLUTION:
    The McAfee EmailScan Outlook add-in,
    SCANEMAL.DLL, is updated to resolve this issue.

5.  ISSUE:
    A potential race condition existed when a
    third-party program initialized, possibly
    causing the application to fail. The symptom did
    not occur when the Buffer Overflow feature was
    disabled.

    RESOLUTION:
    The Buffer Overflow process hooking now allows a
    delay time to be specified (in milliseconds)
    that will delay when hooking occurs. This is
    implemented by modifying the Windows Registry.

    If this solution needs to be implemented please
    contact McAfee Technical Support.

6.  ISSUE:
    A Power User could not modify configuration
    settings for the EmailScan feature. Other
    configuration settings could be modified.

    RESOLUTION:
    EmailScan configuration settings can now be
    modified by Power Users.

7.  ISSUE:
    The network drive scanning option of the
    on-Access scanner would sometimes fail to scan
    remote files.

    RESOLUTION:
    The file-system filter driver has been updated
    to resolve this issue.

8.  ISSUE:
    Itanium 64-bit servers would experience a
    bugcheck (blue screen error) if a file-system
    filter driver newer than the version included in
    Patch 11 was installed.

    RESOLUTION:
    The file-system filter driver has been updated
    to resolve this issue.

9.  ISSUE:
    During an update the VirusScan Enterprise
    plug-in could return an erroneous error:

       "CPluginManager::callback_GetPolicyA failed (hr=-1201) to get Wrkstn_General ?
       DisableMASOAS for VIRUSCAN8000"

    The Desktop Firewall "Quarantine Mode" feature
    would keep the system in quarantine mode.

    RESOLUTION:
    The VirusScan Enterprise plug-in no longer
    returns the described error.

10. ISSUE:
    Adding an older VirusScan Enterprise Patch
    update to a repository would cause the older
    update to be retrieved and executed. Both Patch
    updates would report as installed.

    RESOLUTION:
    The Patch update detection script now proceeds
    with the update if a newer Patch is not already
    installed. This applies to all future Patches.

11. ISSUE:
    On 64-bit systems, the Patch validation process
    fails, causing the Patch version to not report
    correctly. In the "About" screen and in ePolicy
    Orchestrator properties the version was reported
    as "None."

    RESOLUTION:
    Patch versions now report the expected patch
    version when the Patch validation process is
    successful.

12. ISSUE:
    After Patch 12 or Patch 13 was installed the
    Browse button for the Quarantine folder did not
    function.

    RESOLUTION:
    The Browse button functionality has been
    corrected.

13. ISSUE:
    Tools that view the debug window captured output
    from the on-demand scan feature, when the scan
    was configured to use less than 100% CPU.

    RESOLUTION:
    On-demand scans no longer output data to the
    debug window.

14. ISSUE:
    The Buffer Overflow user interface did not have
    boundary checking, and could be used to
    terminate the on-access scanner. Further
    explained in the knowledgebase, article
    2558797.

    RESOLUTION:
    The Buffer Overflow user interface now has
    boundary checking. Also, the on-access scanner
    will not crash when invalid data is input by the
    user.

15. ISSUE:
    When Patch 13 was installed to localized
    versions of VirusScan Enterprise, the README.TXT
    file was replaced with the English version.

    RESOLUTION:
    The README.TXT file is not replaced in this
    release.


PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED ISSUES

1.  ISSUE:
    Significant performance loss may be experienced
    by processes that frequently write data to the
    same file, usually an .INI or .LOG file, and
    usually multiple writes per second. The issue
    was only noticed after applying VSE80HF256301.

    RESOLUTION:
    The file system filter driver has been updated
    to resolve the issue.

2.  ISSUE:
    McAfee Installation Designer (MID) creates
    VirusScan Enterprise installation files that
    include a configuration change file
    (VSECFG.CAB). If also managed by McAfee
    AutoUpdate Architect (MAA), where a
    configuration change file is hosted in the
    repository, after a patch update the original
    configuration change file is installed and
    applied. Updating from the MAA repository again
    does not reapply the newer configuration change
    file.

    RESOLUTION:
    After this Patch release is installed, the most
    recent configuration change file (.CAB file) is
    applied.

    NOTE:
    If VSECFG.CAB has been deleted, it is created
    and the settings applied when a Patch is
    installed.

3.  ISSUE:
    Access Protection rules that contain references
    to a drive letter may not work on Dynamic Disk
    volumes.

    RESOLUTION:
    The file-system filter driver has been updated
    to resolve this issue.

4.  ISSUE:
    Installing Patch 12 to systems where Patch 11
    was installed could result in a successful patch
    installation, although the product still shows
    Patch 11 is installed.

    RESOLUTION:
    This release ensures that updating systems with
    Patch 11 will show the newer patch is installed
    after successful installation.

5.  ISSUE:
    Where the ScriptScan module, SCRIPTPROXY.DLL,
    was unregistered, or disabled after Hotfix
    241572 was applied, the patch installation would
    reregister SCRIPTPROXY.DLL.

    RESOLUTION:
    This release does not register the ScriptScan
    module.

6.  ISSUE:
    Patch installations via ePolicy Orchestrator or
    Protection Pilot, where the Patch failed to
    install on the end node, would not make further
    attempts to install. The installation detection
    script would write a registry value confirming
    the Patch was installed before installation had
    completed.

    RESOLUTION:
    The installation detection script used by
    ePolicy Orchestrator and Protection Pilot now
    writes a registry value confirming the Patch is
    installed when the installation is completed.

7.  ISSUE:
    Detection alerts from the Cookie Scan feature
    can be of sufficient number to cause concern.

    RESOLUTION:
    Alerts for cookie detections can now be disabled
    by adding a dword "bCookieAlerts" to the
    registry key HKLM\Software\Network
    Associates\TVD\Shared Components\Alert
    Client\VSE, and setting the value to "0" zero.
    This release does not add the value.

8.  ISSUE:
    Where the Anti-Spyware Module was checked into
    an ePolicy Orchestrator or Protection Pilot
    repository, after a current Patch was installed
    the module would attempt to install repeatedly.

    RESOLUTION:
    This is resolved by HotFix MASE80HF273746
    included with this release. See also "Known
    Issues" number 1.

9.  ISSUE:
    Local tasks would fail to run at the scheduled
    time if created after Patch 12 or later was
    applied. The corresponding task configuration
    file was being modified with incorrect data.

    RESOLUTION:
    This release ensures the task configuration
    files contain correct data.

10. ISSUE:
    A "Cannot find the file specified" error message
    could occur when starting Lotus Notes via a
    shortcut, or when starting Lotus Notes from a
    shell.

    The same error message could occur when
    third-party applications that inject an add-on
    into Lotus Notes attempt to invoke the McAfee
    Lotus Notes scanner extensions and fail to find
    NCDAEMON.EXE.

    RESOLUTION:
    NCDAEMON.EXE now loads successfully.

11. ISSUE:
    A third-party application working with scripts
    can encounter an access violation error if it
    passes a NULL pointer to the Script Scan module
    (SCRIPTPROXY.DLL). The Script Scan module does
    not refer a NULL pointer.

    RESOLUTION:
    The Script Scan module can now refer NULL
    pointers.

12. ISSUE:
    The Japanese version of VirusScan Enterprise,
    when detecting an infected Lotus Notes email,
    takes action upon the note as expected, but
    removes the original message body.

    RESOLUTION:
    The original message body is always preserved.
    When the sending client is not Lotus Notes or is
    a different version of Lotus Notes, the warning
    text and infected attachment may be removed.

13. ISSUE:
    The on-access scanner sometimes scans a process
    in memory when the scanner service is starting.

    RESOLUTION:
    The on-access scanner does not scan processes in
    memory.

14. ISSUE:
    When installed to the debug build of Windows
    2003 Server, VirusScan Enterprise causes a blue
    screen (BSOD) from handling a unicode
    instruction.

    RESOLUTION:
    The issue has been resolved in the updated
    McAfee file system filter driver.

15. ISSUE:
    On Microsoft Windows XP SP2, or Windows XP SP1
    with Security Update 885835, a memory-mapped
    write operation may not complete correctly. The
    Set EndOfFileInformation IRP was being issued
    twice to the file system.

    RESOLUTION:
    The AV filter driver has been updated to
    correctly issue a single Set
    EndOfFileInformation IRP.

16. ISSUE:
    A potentially unwanted program contained in an
    archive file was detected by an on-demand scan,
    even when that program was excluded.

    RESOLUTION:
    The on-demand scan now correctly excludes
    potentially unwanted programs contained in
    archive files, when configured to exclude them.

17. ISSUE:
    Some third-party applications crashed under
    various conditions when the Script Scan feature
    was installed. Note that the feature did not
    have to be enabled. The crash was caused by a
    synchronization issue when Script Scan
    initialized the scan engine.

    RESOLUTION:
    The synchronization issue has been resolved in
    the updated McAfee file-system filter driver.

18. ISSUE:
    When the "Blocking" feature of the on-access
    scanner was configured to "Block if an unwanted
    program is detected," the feature blocked a
    remote user even when the potentially unwanted
    program was excluded from detection.

    RESOLUTION:
    Potentially unwanted programs that are excluded
    from detection are not blocked by the on-access
    scanner "Blocking" feature.

19. ISSUE:
    If the on-access scanner was configured to be
    disabled and a system entered hibernation mode,
    the on-access scanner was enabled once the
    system awakened. Note that the shield icon and
    Service Control Manager showed that the scanner
    service was disabled.

    RESOLUTION:
    If disabled prior to entering hibernation, the
    on-access scanner now remains disabled after
    leaving hibernation mode.

20. ISSUE:
    On some Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4
    systems, the Winlogon process can crash when a
    McAfee update task is launched. This issue
    occurred only after Patch 10 was installed,
    which contained an updated SCRIPTPROXY.DLL.

    RESOLUTION:
    The Script Scan binary, SCRIPTPROXY.DLL, is
    updated to resolve this issue.

21. ISSUE:
    When the McAfee Anti-Spyware module is installed
    and an on-demand scan task is configured to scan
    cookies, the on-demand scan can crash.

    RESOLUTION:
    The shared library, MYTILUS.DLL, has been
    updated to resolve this issue.

22. ISSUE:
    The Reg/Lowzones Trojan was not detected by the
    on-demand scanner when the primary action was
    "Clean files automatically." More information
    about this Trojan can be found in the virus
    library:
    http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_127723.htm

    RESOLUTION:
    The on-demand scanner now takes appropriate
    action against the Trojan.

23. ISSUE:
    An incompatibility existed between some
    monitoring software packages and the Buffer
    Overflow protection feature of VirusScan
    Enterprise. This was due to a conflict in
    hooking mechanisms being used. Software
    identified includes SpectorSoft, and WebRoot
    SpySweeper.

    RESOLUTION:
    The hooking mechanism of the Buffer Overflow
    feature has been modified to be more compatible
    with most third-party applications.

24. ISSUE:
    A C2 blue screen error (BSOD) could occur when
    the Buffer Overflow feature was enabled. This
    was seen as a stop code of 0x000000c2 with the
    following parameters (0x00000047, 0x84b83000,
    0x00004b83, 0x000f1ffb).

    RESOLUTION:
    The Buffer Overflow driver has been updated to
    resolve the issue.

25. ISSUE:
    An error in MCSHIELD.EXE can occur on shutdown.
    The memory address referred to in the error
    message is 0x77f966bc or 0x7c964ed1. This
    occurred from attempts to close handles that
    were no longer valid.

    RESOLUTION:
    The software only closes valid handles on
    shutdown.

26. ISSUE:
    An incompatibility with some third-party
    software was identified that could cause
    LSASS.EXE to perpetually use 100% of CPU
    resources, when Buffer Overflow protection was
    enabled. The Buffer Overflow feature was in a
    loop.

    RESOLUTION:
    The Buffer Overflow feature is updated to
    identify when third-party software creates this
    loop, and no longer causes the loop to be
    perpetual.

27. ISSUE:
    On Microsoft Windows 2003 Server with Service
    Pack 1, the Buffer Overflow feature does not
    function.

    RESOLUTION:
    This release updates the Buffer Overflow feature
    to function properly with the Microsoft service
    pack applied.

28. ISSUE:
    If you entered an exclusion for the Buffer
    Overflow feature, which is case-sensitive, it
    was converted to lowercase, making the exclusion
    invalid.

    RESOLUTION:
    The text entered for the exclusion is preserved
    correctly.

29. ISSUE:
    When the on-access scanner timed out while
    scanning a file, the event was reported to
    ePolicy Orchestrator or Protection Pilot as a
    virus named "_".

    RESOLUTION:
    With this release, the on-access scanner
    time-outs are not reported as a virus.

30. ISSUE:
    The "All Port Blocking Events" query produced an
    error when the ePolicy Orchestrator or
    Protection Pilot database was on a SQL7 or MSDE
    v1 server.

    RESOLUTION:
    The "All Port Blocking Events" query has been
    corrected.

31. ISSUE:
    Events are not processed if the language of the
    account used to access SQL is not English, and
    the current day of the month is greater than
    12.

    RESOLUTION:
    This issue is resolved in the updated Extended
    NAP file.

32. ISSUE:
    ePolicy Orchestrator or Protection Pilot reports
    might contain sentences that overlap, and chart
    labels might be illegible.

    RESOLUTION:
    This issue is resolved in the updated Extended
    NAP file.

33. ISSUE:
    On-demand scan tasks configured to stop after
    running for a specified amount of time might not
    stop at the appointed time. The VirusScan
    Enterprise plug-in did not identify the correct
    task.

    RESOLUTION:
    The VirusScan Enterprise plug-in has been
    updated to stop the correct scan task after the
    specified amount of time.

34. ISSUE:
    In some environments the VirusScan Enterprise
    Patch 10 release encountered an installation
    issue where the Windows Installer service would
    hang (published in the knowledge base as article
    KB40498).

    RESOLUTION:
    The installation of this release temporarily
    disables the Buffer Overflow feature only if it
    is enabled, and enables it again once the
    installation is complete.

35. ISSUE:
    Alert messages sent to McAfee Alert Manager
    sometimes displayed a user name of "System."

    RESOLUTION:
    The correct user name is now sent in the alert
    message.

36. ISSUE:
    An event is captured by the Event log service
    with the ID of 6004. This only occurred after
    installing VirusScan Enterprise 8.0i, and
    occurred when the McAfee TDI filter driver was
    loaded.

    RESOLUTION:
    This is resolved with the updated McAfee TDI
    filter driver.

37. ISSUE:
    A blue screen error (BSOD) could be seen on a
    server operating system, often with a bug check
    code of D1.

    RESOLUTION:
    This is resolved with the updated McAfee TDI
    filter driver.

38. ISSUE:
    PatchLink, a third-party application, will crash
    when the Script Scan module is installed.

    RESOLUTION:
    Updates made to the Script Scan module,
    SCRIPTPROXY.DLL, and a shared scanner module,
    MYTILUS.DLL, resolve the issue.

39. ISSUE:
    A delay may be noticed when a computer system
    shuts down. Shutdown progresses at a normal rate
    if the McTaskManager service is stopped before
    shutdown.

    RESOLUTION:
    VSTSKMGR.EXE, the McTaskManager service, has
    been updated to correct this issue.

40. ISSUE:
    During an engine update, scanner components may
    not unload the scan engine, resulting in failure
    to update the Engine because it is still in
    use.

    RESOLUTION:
    VSTSKMGR.EXE has been updated to ensure
    successful Engine updates.

41. ISSUE:
    A memory leak occurred in non-page pool memory
    when accessing files via the network redirector.
    The TDI driver did not release memory that had
    been allocated for identifying Source IP
    information.

    RESOLUTION:
    Memory is properly released by the TDI driver.

42. ISSUE:
    If the TDI driver received an I/O Request Packet
    (IRP) that did not have enough stack locations
    to be passed down the stack, a new IRP was
    created and the original IRP was left
    uncompleted. This resulted in a small memory
    leak.

    RESOLUTION:
    The original IRP is now completed.

43. ISSUE:
    A driver conflict between the McAfee TDI driver
    and a driver from Aventail VPN Client software
    could result in NetBIOS network connectivity
    being lost.

    RESOLUTION:
    NetBIOS network connectivity functions as
    expected when these applications are installed.

44. ISSUE:
    When a system was under considerable file I/O
    stress, and the path information of a file was
    not examined correctly by the exclusion library,
    an excluded file or a file inside an excluded
    folder could be scanned.

    RESOLUTION:
    The exclusion library has been updated to ensure
    that file path information is examined correctly
    under any stress condition.

45. ISSUE:
    Malformed JPEG files taking advantage of the
    MS04-028 exploit could be rendered by a browser
    -? without first having to cache files locally
    -- to induce an attack on the system. Details of
    the security bulletin can be found at:

       http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms04-028.mspx

    RESOLUTION:
    The processes monitored by the Buffer Overflow
    Protection feature are protected against
    malicious code attempting to execute after
    exploiting the MS04-028 vulnerability.

    IMPORTANT:
    When a buffer overflow has occurred, the
    affected process may become unstable and may
    need to be restarted.

    This Patch release is not a substitute for any
    security patch(es) provided by Microsoft to
    resolve the MS04-028 vulnerability.

46. ISSUE:
    Toolbar icons in some applications, including
    IBM WebSphere Studio, display as black boxes.

    RESOLUTION:
    Toolbar icons now display as expected.

47. ISSUE:
    Web Inspector from Zixcorp would encounter an
    error upon initializing, usually seen at logon.

    RESOLUTION:
    Web Inspector now loads without issue.

48. ISSUE:
    Windows Media Player 10 could stop responding
    after you select the option to listen to a
    "Radio" stream, then select the "Music" tab.

    RESOLUTION:
    Windows Media Player 10 operates correctly
    without interruption when you change from the
    "Radio" tab to "Music" tab, and vice versa.

    NOTE:
    Once the Patch is applied, a reboot may be
    required to resolve this issue.

49. ISSUE:
    List boxes and message boxes in .NET
    applications do not display any content.

    RESOLUTION:
    List boxes and message boxes now display content
    as expected.

50. ISSUE:
    In some Lotus Notes configurations where user
    mail databases were located in varying
    locations, the Lotus Notes Scanner did not find
    a mailbox to scan.

    RESOLUTION:
    User mailboxes are correctly located, and the
    Lotus Notes scanner protects the database.

51. ISSUE:
    The user interface option that allows you to
    password-protect the "On-Access Scanner:
    Detection" page mistakenly protects both the
    On-Access Scan "Detection" and On-Access Scan
    "Set Exclusions" property pages. A user could
    not add exclusions.

    RESOLUTION:
    Choosing to protect the "On-Access Scanner:
    Detection" page from the "User Interface
    Options" now protects only the On-Access Scan
    "Detection" page.

52. ISSUE:
    A delay in responsiveness of the script engine
    would occur when executing scripts
    sequentially.

    RESOLUTION:
    Scripts terminate correctly, allowing the script
    engine to respond to subsequent script
    commands.

53. ISSUE:
    An "Access denied" error appeared in an
    application that used the "delete-on-close" flag
    when working with temporary files. The file
    system filter driver would lose track of the
    "delete-on-close" flag.

    RESOLUTION:
    The updated file system filter driver resolves
    this issue, allowing temporary files to be
    utilized as expected.
54. ISSUE:
    Null entries are seen in the ePolicy
    Orchestrator database under the severity field
    due to the VirusScan Enterprise 8.0i extended
    NAP file.

    RESOLUTION:
    The extended NAP file has been modified to
    correctly handle the severity field.

55. ISSUE:
    When disabled, the ScriptScan feature will
    remain registered and still handles VB Script
    and Jscript operations, even though it is not
    scanning.

    RESOLUTION:
    When the ScriptScan feature is disabled, the
    component is unregistered, and when enabled the
    feature is registered.

56. ISSUE:
    The error "Access Denied" is seen when accessing
    a remote share. This can occur when user profile
    information is redirected by a Microsoft Windows
    group policy object, and the user tries to save
    a file to their "My Documents" folder.

    RESOLUTION:
    The issue has been resolved in the updated
    common scan components.

57. ISSUE:
    In environments using Distributed File System
    shares, a noticeable increase in network traffic
    activity may be experienced.

    RESOLUTION:
    The file system filter driver has been updated
    to resolve the issue.

58. ISSUE:
    During shutdown the VSTSKMGR.EXE process may
    crash with an error similar to "VSTSKMGR.EXE ?
    the exception privileged instruction 0x00000096
    occurred in the application at location
    0x0012e80d."

    RESOLUTION:
    An update to VSTSKMGR.EXE, the McTaskManager
    Service, resolves the issue.

59. ISSUE:
    After applying VirusScan Enterprise 8.0i Patch
    11, when a system resumes from the hibernation
    power saving state, the on-access scanner may be
    paused.

    RESOLUTION:
    The on-access scanner now correctly is enabled
    when the system resumes from hibernation.

60. ISSUE:
    A vulnerability exists in the Common Management
    Agent (CMA) where an unexpected file can be run
    with system privileges. Communication between
    the VirusScan Enterprise plug-in and CMA can be
    utilized as a mechanism to exploit this
    vulnerability.

    RESOLUTION:
    The VirusScan Enterprise plug-in, VSPLUGIN.DLL,
    has been updated to prevent the potential
    exploit.

61. ISSUE:
    When accessing some Japanese named files with a
    long filename, the on-access scanner service,
    MCSHIELD.EXE, could crash or cause the accessing
    application to stop responding.

    RESOLUTION:
    MCSHIELD.EXE has been updated to resolve this
    issue.

62. ISSUE:
    The memory scan feature of an on-demand scan did
    not detect potentially unwanted programs that
    were resident in memory.

    The memory scan feature did not use the
    exclusion list.

    The memory scan feature failed to record when a
    detection was successfully cleaned.

    RESOLUTION:
    The issue has been resolved in the updated
    on-demand scan components.

63. ISSUE:
    After applying VirusScan Enterprise 8.0i Patch
    11 where the Anti-Spyware Enterprise module is
    installed, the Cookie Scan feature detects the
    same cookie twice.

    RESOLUTION:
    The issue has been resolved in the updated
    common scan components.

64. ISSUE:
    In ePolicy Orchestrator, the "Top 10" virus
    report shows a "_" character as the virus name.

    RESOLUTION:
    The issue has been resolved in the updated
    common scan components.

65. ISSUE:
    If the ePolicy Orchestrator Agent is installed,
    the on-access scanner could crash when resuming
    from the hibernation power-saving state.

    RESOLUTION:
    The issue has been resolved in the updated
    on-access scanner.


KNOWN ISSUES

1.  Where the McAfee Anti-Spyware Enterprise (MASE)
    module is added to the ePolicy Orchestrator
    repository and the Deployment Task is configured
    to install the MASE module, after this Patch
    release is installed on client systems, the MASE
    module will attempt to reinstall each time the
    Deployment Task runs.

    This is resolved by HotFix MASE80HF273746
    included with this release. See the section
    "Additional Steps for Anti-Spyware Enterprise
    Module" for installation steps.

2.  When installing locally, you may not be prompted
    to reboot after the installation. However, a
    reboot is necessary to unload the previous
    McAfee TDI filter driver and load the new
    driver.

3.  Installing the Patch and specifying a log file
    path using the Microsoft Installer (MSI) switch
    "/L" does not log to the specified path. A log
    capturing full data is logged to the folder
    "NAILogs" under the Temp folder.

4.  When using McAfee Installation Designer 8.0 to
    create a new installation package that includes
    this release, and you have VirusScan Enterprise
    8.0i and a Microsoft Patch (MSP) installed
    locally (for example, Patch10.msp), the
    resulting package may not install to other
    systems.

    Install McAfee Installation Designer 8.1 or
    later, and create the new installation package
    that includes this release.

5.  When installing this release interactively and
    canceling the installation on a system where a
    previous Patch was installed, after the rollback
    completes the previous Patch no longer reports
    to ePolicy Orchestrator or displays in the
    "About VirusScan Enterprise" window.

6.  If the Lotus Notes client is open when this
    release is installed, the installation completes
    successfully, but a reboot is required to
    replace the McAfee Lotus scanner files. The new
    files are not used until after a reboot.

7.  If this release is removed from the ePolicy
    Orchestrator or Protection Pilot repository and
    a previous release is added, clients that have
    this release will run the previous package but
    will not replace any files. These client systems
    report that both Patch releases are installed.
    This issue is resolved for all future Patch
    releases.

8.  After this release is added to the ePolicy
    Orchestrator or Protection Pilot repository, you
    cannot add HotFix 256862. This is expected
    behavior because Hotfix 256862 is included in
    this release.

__________________________________________________________
INSTALLATION


INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

To use this release, you must have VirusScan
Enterprise 8.0i software installed on the computer
you intend to update with this release.

    NOTE:
    This release does not work with earlier versions
    of VirusScan software.


INSTALLATION STEPS

1.  Extract the Patch files from VSE80P14.ZIP to a
    temporary folder on your hard drive.

2.  Double-click the file SETUP.EXE inside the
    temporary folder created in Step 1.

3.  Follow the instructions of the installation
    wizard.


INSTALLATION STEPS FOR ePOLICY ORCHESTRATOR

1.  On the computer where the ePolicy Orchestrator
    3.x console resides, extract the Patch files and
    folders from VSE80P14.ZIP to a temporary folder
    on your hard drive.

2.  Open the ePolicy Orchestrator 3.x console and
    add the package from the temporary folder
    created in Step 1 to your repository.

    Consult "Checking in Package" in the ePolicy
    Orchestrator 3.0 Product Guide, or "Checking in
    PKGCATALOG.Z product packages to the master
    repository" in the ePolicy Orchestrator 3.5
    Product Guide, for instructions on adding a
    package to the repository. The package type for
    this Patch is "Products or Updates."

    The next time an agent update task runs, the
    VirusScan Enterprise client automatically
    downloads and installs the Patch.

3.  Skip ahead to Step 4 if you have already added
    the McAfee Anti-Spyware module NAP file to your
    repository.

    Add the management NAP file, VSE800.NAP, from
    the temporary folder created in Step 1 to your
    repository.

    NOTE:
    Add the VSE800.NAP from the appropriate
    subfolder, which is determined by whether you
    have the McAfee Anti-Spyware module installed.

    Consult the ePolicy Orchestrator documentation
    for instructions on adding new software you want
    to manage to the repository.

4.  Add the reporting NAP file, VSE800REPORTS.NAP,
    from the temporary folder created in Step 1, to
    your repository by doing the following:

   a.  In the ePolicy Orchestrator console, add the
       VSE800Reports.NAP file using the "Check in
       NAP" wizard.

   b.  If applicable, log off from the Reporting
       console.

   c.  In the ePolicy Orchestrator installation
       directory, delete the following:

       -   REPORTVERSIONS.SQL file from the AVI
           directory. This must be done for all
           systems running the ePolicy Orchestrator
           console.

   d.  Stop the ePolicy Orchestrator Server service
       and ePolicy Orchestrator Event Parser
       service.

   e.  Restart the two services from Step d.

   f.  Log on to the Reporting console using ePolicy
       Orchestrator authentication.

   g.  Log on to the ePolicy Orchestrator console
       and the Reporting Console to view the
       VirusScan 8.0 reports.


ADDITIONAL STEPS FOR ANTI-SPYWARE ENTERPRISE MODULE

    NOTE:
    These steps are not required if you have
    installed Common Management Agent version 3.5.5
    Patch 1 or later.

1.  On the computer where the ePolicy Orchestrator
    3.x console resides, extract the MASE80HF273746
    folder from VSE80P14.ZIP to a temporary folder
    on your hard drive.

2.  Open the ePolicy Orchestrator 3.x console and
    add the package from the temporary folder
    created in Step 1 to your repository.


INSTALLATION STEPS VIA MCAFEE INSTALLATION DESIGNER

McAfee recommends that you use McAfee Installation
Designer version 8.1 or later and follow this
procedure:

1. Extract the files from VSE80P14.ZIP to a
   temporary folder on your hard drive.

2. Start McAfee Installation Designer, select
    "Create a new installation package," and select
    a source and destination folder for your
    installation package; then click "Next."

3. Go to the "Patch Files" section and click "Add."
    Browse to the temporary folder you created in
    Step 1, and select the file PATCH14.MSP.

4. Click "Finish" and "Save" in the McAfee
    Installation Designer to save a new installation
    package to the destination folder you specified
    in Step 2.


VERIFYING INSTALLATION

Always reboot prior to validating that a Patch has
installed successfully.

    NOTE:
    Patch releases since Patch 10 do not display or
    report that the Patch is installed if an error
    occurred during installation, or if a file or
    files did not install correctly.

1.  Open the VirusScan Console and choose "About"
    from the "Help" menu. The "About VirusScan
    Enterprise" window "Patch Versions" displays
    "14."

    After property information has been collected by
    ePolicy Orchestrator and Protection Pilot
    agents, the client systems show that Patch 14 is
    installed as the "Hotfix" version. If the value
    "HotfixVersions" is seen, it is a temporary
    value and will be removed after a full property
    collection from the client.

2.  Confirm that the expected files are installed by
    checking the version number of individual files.
    File versions should match the list in "FILES
    INCLUDED WITH THIS RELEASE," above.
