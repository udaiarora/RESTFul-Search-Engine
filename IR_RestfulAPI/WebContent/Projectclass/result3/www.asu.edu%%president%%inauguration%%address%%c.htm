On the contrary,         universities are complex organisms capable of marked regional variation         and change over time. </p>      <p> In building a new American university here in Arizona, one has to rethink         some of the basic design imperatives on which universities have historically         been based. I wish to foster a different kind of university, one that         is linked to its setting and the needs of our day, one that does not measure         its success based on an historic and in many ways antiquated set of design         elements. I wish to foster a university that is a function of its contemporary         environment, rather than the replication of an entity that was derived         in another setting and in another time.</p>      <p> I do not propose totally abandoning past design elements&#8212;many         have been enormously successful. Rather, I propose various new design         imperatives that reflect the needs of a world that in many ways has changed         beyond recognition since the rise of the medieval universities nearly         a millennium ago, and even the development of land grant universities         150 years ago. I propose these design elements to respond to the explosion         in knowledge production, increased specialization in academic disciplines,         the rise of new disciplines, and the collapse of disciplinary boundaries         that has increasingly taken place during the past half century. </p>      <p> This morning I would like to outline the key design imperatives that         I envision for Arizona State University that will enable us to become         the leading public metropolitan research university in the United States.         In each case I will outline the design imperative, present examples of         what we have already initiated, discuss what we plan to initiate as rapidly         as possible, and outline a broader vision for what we hope to accomplish.       </p></td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td align="left" valign="bottom"><a href="b5.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="c1.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="c1.htm"><img src="images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
