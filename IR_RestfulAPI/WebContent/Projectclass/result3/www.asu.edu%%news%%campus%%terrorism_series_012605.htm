          <h2><strong>Terrorism, national security at forefront of new lecture series</strong></h2>
          <p> In connection with a special course being offered this spring, the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication at Arizona State University is sponsoring a public lecture series on &ldquo;Communication, Terrorism and National Security&rdquo; &nbsp;featuring prominent speakers from ASU and around the country. </p>
          <p> The series focuses on the role of human communication in terrorism and our defenses against it. The speakers comprise a spectrum of experts in counterterrorism, military operations, emergency management, politics, and the social and physical sciences.&nbsp; </p>
          <p> Beginning Jan. 28,&nbsp;lectures will occur <strong>weekly</strong> on <strong>Friday at </strong><strong> 9:30 a.m.</strong><strong> in room 220 of the </strong><strong> Art</strong><strong></strong><strong> Building</strong>. The first three speakers in the series are <strong>Maj. Reid Sawyer</strong> of West Point&rsquo;s Combatting Terrorism Center; ASU Regents Professor and authority on propaganda <strong>David Altheide</strong>; and <strong>Andrew Garfield</strong>, European director of the Terrorism Research Center. </p>
          <p> Sawyer&rsquo;s talk,&nbsp;&ldquo;Defining the Threat,&rdquo; is scheduled for Jan. 28. Maj. Sawyer is the executive director of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point and an assistant professor in the Department of Social Sciences. He is currently an adjunct professor at Columbia University where he teaches a graduate seminar in terrorism studies. </p>
          <p> Sawyer routinely works with a variety of government agencies in addressing the terrorism threat, including the Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, the Fire Department of New York City and the New York City Police Department&rsquo;s Counterterrorism Division. </p>
          <p> Sawyer&rsquo;s research interests include terrorism and counterterrorism policy. He has been a visiting lecturer on the responses to the terrorist threat at the National Defense University and the National War College; the Undersecretary General, Department for Disarmament Affairs at the United Nations; the Canadian Political Science Association; the World Conference of Religion and Peace at the United Nations; Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and Wagner College. </p>
          <p> A career intelligence officer, he has served in a variety of special operations assignments prior to his current position. These assignments involved extensive travel overseas including Africa, Asia, Europe and South America. He also served in a counter-narcotics unit which operated throughout the Caribbean basin.&nbsp; </p>
          <p> Sawyer recently co-edited two books on the challenges facing policymakers from terrorism and other transnational threats, &ldquo;Terrorism and Counterterrorism: Readings and Interpretations, 2ed and Defeating Terrorism.&rdquo; He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the American Political Science Association, the International Studies Association and the Foreign Policy Association.&nbsp; </p>
          <p> Altheide will speak on &ldquo;Terrorism, Propaganda and the Politics of Fear&rdquo; Feb. 4. He is Regents&rsquo; Professor in ASU&rsquo;s School of Justice and Social Inquiry. A sociologist who uses qualitative methods, his work (10 books and over 125 journal articles and chapters) focuses on the role of mass media and information technology for social control. His theoretical and methodological statements on the relevance of the mass media for sociological analysis include &ldquo;An Ecology of Communication:&nbsp; Cultural Formats of Control&rdquo; (Aldine de Gruyter, 1995) and &ldquo;Qualitative Media Analysis&rdquo; (Sage, 1996). His most recent book, &ldquo;Creating Fear: News and the Construction of Crisis&rdquo; (Aldine de Gruyter, 2002), focuses on the news media&rsquo;s constructions of a discourse of fear and the social consequences of this. This book won the 2004 Charles Horton Cooley Award from the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction. His current writing project is on the Politics of Fear. He has also applied qualitative research designs to investigate the nature and process of educational reform, with particular emphasis on school context and culture.&nbsp; </p>
          <p> Garfield will speak Feb. 11. The title of his talk is &ldquo;Losing the War of Ideas: U.S. Strategic Miscommunication.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Garfield serves as the European director for the Terrorism Research Center, Inc. (TRC). In this capacity, Garfield is responsible for TRC outreach and business initiatives within Europe . In addition, he provides direct support to U.S. military and commercial customers wishing to utilize his extensive expertise on terrorism and security issues. </p>
          <p> Garfield is also the deputy director of the International Policy Institute of King's College London with special responsibility for North America. Previously, he served as a British military then senior civilian intelligence officer, finishing his government service as a senior policy advisor in the UK Ministry of Defense.

          <p> Since Sept.11, 2001, Garfield has worked extensively for clients within the U.S. Department of Defense &ndash; for example participating in terrorism workshops for the Office of Net Assessments, U.S. Marine Corps, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the Joint Warfare Analysis Center and Special Operations Command. He also lectures extensively in the UK and United States (including for the 4th Psychological Operations Group) on these topics, and is a regular contributor for CNN, the BBC, Sky Televisions and many US and UK newspapers and periodicals including the Wall Street Journal. </p>
