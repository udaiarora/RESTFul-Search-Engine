<h1 class="storyhead">6 educators illustrate high standards of excellence </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" -->
<p>Claudia Brown and Sudhir Kumar have sustained a record of research support that bears witness to their growth as stellar teacher-scholars. </p>
<p>Brown, who is internationally recognized for her expertise in Chinese painting, is described by the former dean of the Herberger College of Fine Arts, Robert Wills, as ?an exemplar of excellent teaching, superb scholarship, and a model citizen.? </p>
<p>Kumar, a geneticist in the School of Life Sciences, is best known for developing statistical and computational methods in the field of bioinformatics and molecular evolution. He came to ASU as an assistant professor in 1998 and was promoted to associate professor in 2002. </p>
<p>Based on their individual successes, both of them have now been promoted to the university's most senior rank of professor ? and they also have been identified by ASU President Michael Crow as two of the six ?2006 Promotion and Tenure Exemplars? among the university's entire faculty. </p>
<p>?These faculty represent the best of the best ? and, I hope, serve as exemplars regarding the great strides that the ASU faculty are making,? Crow says. </p>
<p>The other four faculty exemplars were granted tenure and promoted from assistant to associate professor. They are: </p>
<p>? Linda J. Luecken, Department of Psychology, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. </p>
<p>? Sarah J. Tracy , Hugh Downs School of Human Communication, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. </p>
<p>? Matthew C. Whitaker, Department of History, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences </p>
<p>? Teresa (Tong) Wu, Department of Industrial Engineering, Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering. </p>
<p>This is the fourth year in which Crow has named faculty exemplars at the conclusion of the annual promotion and tenure review process. </p>
<p>The 2006 faculty exemplars have distinguished themselves through their teaching and mentoring of students and their scholarly and creative endeavors. They represent the broad range of disciplines within the university, including the arts, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and engineering. </p>
<p>The accomplishments of these stellar faculty members ? in the classroom, the laboratory, and wherever else their teaching and research or creative activities take them ? are illustrative of the high standards of excellence ASU is setting for its teacher-scholars. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Claudia Brown </strong></p>
<p>Brown's work has been supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Art and the Arizona Humanities Council, among other sources. As a renowned scholar, curator and catalog author who works in the School of Art , Brown also is a gifted and innovative teacher. </p>
<p>?Dr. Brown is a scholar of Asian art ? not just painting, which might be typical, but of all the arts, including glass, ceramic, fabric, bronze and the like, and she specializes in the art of China ,? Wills says. ?She occupies a special niche in art history because she is not just a scholar, she is also a curator, and she molds those two roles together seamlessly. </p>
<p>?In September of 2005, Dr. Brown taught a graduate course in ?Approaches to Chinese Painting.' She had students in the class invite living Chinese artists to lend works of art to honor Dr. Chu-tsing Li on the occasion of a symposium ? also organized by Dr. Brown ? to recognize his long and illustrious career in Chinese art. Artists were generous and students in the class organized an exhibition, designed the installation, researched the careers of the artists, and wrote the essays that then appeared in a published catalog for the exhibition.? </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Sudhir Kumar </strong></p>
<p>Kumar's work in the School of Life Sciences , College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and Center for Evolutionary Functional Genomics in the Biodesign Institute bridges the life sciences and computer science. </p>
<p>?Dr. Kumar's research program is nothing short of phenomenal,? says Robert Page, director of the School of Life Sciences . ?Since his promotion to associate professor, he has published 17 peer reviewed papers in top journals, ? given 19 invited presentations since 2002 in Russia , India , China , England and the United States , (and) developed three widely used Web-based resources.? </p>
<p>Over the course of his career, Kumar has published more than 50 peer-reviewed articles in leading journals, including <em>Science, Nature </em> and the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, </em> and he is the co-author of ?Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics,? published by Oxford University Press. </p>
<p>Page also notes that the paper outlining Sudhir's Molecular Evolution Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software ?was awarded the 2004 ?Hot Paper in Biology' and resulted in Dr. Kumar being among the top 10 most-cited authors in computer science.? This paper has been cited more than 1,800 times. </p>
<p>Kumar has a sustained record of research support, with two active grants from the National Institutes of Health, and he supports a large number of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars on his grants. Eight graduate students have completed their degrees under his direction since 2002 in diverse disciplines, including life sciences, electrical engineering, and computer sciences. He is mentoring four postdoctoral scholars, and has sponsored nine national and international visiting scholars. </p>
<p>Kumar is committed to mentoring of undergraduates at the interface of biology and computer science, and particularly to increasing the number of students from populations underrepresented in the sciences. He regularly supports students through his research grants and his involvement with ASU's NIH-funded Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences and NSF-funded Biodesigned Bridges to the Doctorate program. </p>
<p>In addition to his teaching and scholarship, Kumar directs the Center for Evolutionary Functional Genomics and serves on the executive board of the Biodesign Institute, and he is the faculty leader for genomics, evolution and bioinformatics in the School of Life Sciences. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Linda Luecken </strong></p>
<p>Luecken studies the effects of stressful early life experiences on physiological processes and physical health over the lifespan. By recognizing that humans exhibit neurobiological responses to stress, and emotional and cognitive capacities that allow us to modulate these responses, Luecken's research offers avenues for intervening long after the adverse experience occurs. </p>
<p>Luecken is a rising star in her field, and her contributions to clinical psychology have been widely recognized. She is a recipient of the prestigious Neal E. Miller New Investigator Award from the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research, and her research is funded by the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health. </p>
<p>?Professor Luecken has amassed a most impressive record in research and scholarship,? says Keith Crnic, chair of the Department of Psychology. ?She is among only a handful of scholars who have managed to integrate (health psychology with clinical and developmental models) in meaningful ways, despite being early in her career. External reviewers consistently noted the uniqueness of her approach and the importance of her contributions to clinical science.? </p>
<p>In addition to her national reputation for scholarly excellence, Luecken also is a highly effective mentor of graduate and undergraduate students. Doctoral students working under her supervision are likely to co-author articles, helping them to establish their own scholarly reputations at the same time that they are honing their research and professional writing skills. Undergraduate students mentored by Luecken have gone on to graduate studies in top programs, and two undergraduate honors students working under her supervision published portions of their theses in prestigious journals. </p>
<p>Luecken also is active in the community, consulting for the Center for the Advancement of Health's Panel of Experts, the Maricopa County Department of Public Health and the Alliance for Innovations in Health Care. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Sarah Tracy </strong></p>
<p>Tracy's scholarship exemplifies the highest qualities of problem-based, use-inspired basic research. As an ethnographic researcher, she conducts extensive fieldwork on the everyday dilemmas and difficulties that employees encounter in their work lives. </p>
<p>Whether a research project involves sitting with 911 emergency call-takers in the middle of the night, shadowing and training with prison correctional officers, or immersing herself for months on end in the total institution of a cruise ship, Tracy's rich, real-time studies of emotion work in organizations help us to better understand workplace communication problems, and to assess methods of mitigating or resolving those problems. </p>
<p>Tracy's work is highly acclaimed by colleagues in her field, as evidenced by her numerous ?top paper? and ?article of the year? awards from professional societies. As part of her research process, she also brings her findings back to the research sites, helping professionals and the public to better manage communication, workplace abuse, emotion labor and burnout. Tracy serves as director for the Project for Wellness and Work-Life in the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication. </p>
<p>Tracy also has received numerous accolades for her teaching. She has taught a range of courses with an average class size of 121 students. Graduate students in her classes have gone on to present 23 competitive conference papers, three of which earned top paper awards. They have published three articles, with another three articles under journal review. Her doctoral students have gone on to find employment in major research universities, and her master's degree students have continued in rigorous doctoral programs at ASU and elsewhere. </p>
<p>?Dr. Tracy is an excellent teacher who brings credit to the very idea that our effectiveness as an institution must be proven in the classroom,? says Bud Goodall, director of the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication. ?No wonder Dr. Tracy has received four teaching awards during her time at ASU. No wonder students clamor for her classes. She is a model educator.? </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Matthew Whitaker </strong></p>
<p>Whitaker is an ASU alumnus, receiving bachelor's degrees in sociology in 1993 and history in 1994, followed by a master's degree in U.S. history in 1997. He then went to Michigan State University, obtaining his doctorate with honors in 2001. </p>
<p>Whitaker returned to ASU in 2001 as an assistant professor in the department of history. He teaches a range of U.S. history courses, including a team-taught ?Learning Community on War, Culture and Memory: The Vietnam Experience,? but he is best known for his expertise in the experiences of African-Americans in the 20th century United States. </p>
<p>He is the author of ?Race Work: The Rise of Civil Rights in the Urban West,? published by the University of Nebraska Press, which is one of the leading presses on western U.S. history. </p>
<p>?Professor Whitaker presents a vigorous record of completed research projects, well-articulated future research agenda, and fine record of publication as an historian early in his career,? says Noel Stowe, chair of the Department of History. ?Likewise, he has a demonstrated record of high-quality teaching and working with students, and a consistent, fine initial record of service that includes both a professional discipline-based component as well as extensive contact with the local community.? </p>
<p>Whitaker regularly brings his scholarship to the community by speaking at libraries, community colleges, art museums, churches, and local and national forums, and by serving on community boards and as historical adviser to schools and city offices. </p>
<p>He is the recipient of numerous awards for his teaching, publications and public scholarship. He received the 2003 Bert M. Fireman Prize from the Western History Association, the 2004 Centennial Professorship Award from the Associated Students of Arizona, the 2004 100 Black Men of Arizona Education Leadership Award, the 2005 Dan Shilling Public Scholar Award from the Arizona Humanities Council and the 2005 Patricia Gurin Scholar-Activist from ASU's Intergroup Relations Center. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Teresa Wu </strong></p>
<p>Wu received her doctorate from the University of Iowa in 2001 and earned tenure and promotion to associate professor after five years at ASU. Her research focuses on collaborative product development, distributed decision making, supply chain modeling and distributed information system development. </p>
<p>Wu is the first member of the industrial engineering faculty to earn a prestigious National Science Foundation CAREER grant, which provides her and her students with $400,000 over five years to support research in the design and implementation of a virtual product development environment. Wu also received a Research Experiences for Undergraduates supplement to her CAREER grant, which will expand the research opportunities for undergraduates in her Virtual Computer Integrated Enterprise lab. </p>
<p>She also is the ASU lead for a U.S. Department of Education grant to fabricate environmentally conscious manufacturing into engineering education, as well as the recipient of industry grants from IBM and Intel. </p>
<p>?All evidence indicates she is an exceptional teacher,? says Gary Hogg, the former chair of the Department of Industrial Engineering. ?I'm pleased that she provides extensive web support, uses active learning approaches and other appropriate technology in her teaching arsenal.? </p>
<p>In addition to the promotion adjustment, the six 2006 faculty exemplars have received an extra salary increase in recognition of their stellar achievements. </p>
<p>The curriculum vitae and personal statements for each of the 2006 faculty exemplars can be found at the Web site (<a href="http://www.asu.edu/provost/promotion-tenure/exemplars/index.html">www.asu.edu/provost/promotion-tenure/exemplars/index.html</a>).</p>
