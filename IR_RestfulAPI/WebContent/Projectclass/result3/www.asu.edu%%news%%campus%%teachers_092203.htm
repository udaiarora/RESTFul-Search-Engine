      <h2>ASU prepares to tackle teacher shortage through university-school partnerships</h2>
      <p>        Arizona would need 6,880 new K-12 teachers annually through 2005 to keep
          up with an increasing student population and retiring educators, according
        to a report published by ASU's Morrison Institute for Public Policy.</p>
      <p>ASU's
            College of Education, through the University-School Partnerships
        Initiative, is tackling the state's teacher shortage. Through its initiative,
          the university plans to train 50 percent more teachers for kindergarten
          through 12th grade, or a total of 1,500 each year, and 100 percent
        more
          than early-childhood education, or a total of 120 annually.</p>
      <p>Vice President
          of University-School Partnerships Eugene Garcia says there's a tough
          road ahead and the university is preparing to meet the challenges.</p>
      <p>"We
          have the commitment from the president for the faculty and related
        services needed to expand these programs," says Garcia, who is also the
          dean of College of Education. "The main challenges include recruiting
          the students to the programs; ensuring that those students are trained
          to meet the needs of the students of Arizona; and placing our graduates
        in the schools in which they are needed."</p>
      <p>The report, "Is There A Teacher
          Shortage? Demand And Supply in Arizona," which can be found online
        at (<a href="http://www.asu.edu/%20copp/morrison/teachershortage.htm">http://www.asu.edu/
            copp/morrison/teachershortage.htm</a>),
            is the first comprehensive analysis of supply and demand for certified
          teachers in Arizona. </p>
      <p>Garcia says recruitment and retention of teachers
          are key objectives in the initiative and are essential for addressing
          the supply and demand
        for teachers.</p>
      <p>As the university's three campuses begin work this year
          to achieve these goals by 2005, a top priority will be to recruit graduates
          with a bachelor's
          degree and help them get a teaching certificate in 10 months. College
          students in non-education majors will be targeted for intensive summer
          programs so they can earn a teaching credential when they obtain their
        bachelor's degree. </p>
      <p>In addition, Garcia says one of the areas ASU is concentrating
          on is making a comprehensive effort to find the support systems that
          educators
        need in order to do their job and do it well. </p>
      <p>"They need on-going mentoring
          - a teacher learns most about teaching while she/he is teaching - therefore
          ongoing support and professional
          development is a must," he says. "Specifically, they need mentors who
          have been successful as teachers and they need to learn new ways of
        teaching - such as using technology to teach."<br>
        Placing teachers where they are most needed is a crucial part of the
          K-12 initiative. Garcia says there are programs that address this objective
        and meet the goals of the initiative.</p>
      <p>"Developing 'grow-your-own' programs
          such as the Urban Teacher Corp and the Navajo Native Teacher Program
          are essential," he says. "We work with
          schools to take residents of their communities and develop them to
        be teachers so they can go right back into those schools."</p>
      <p>Martha Rader with
          the ASU College of Education, applauds the university's efforts and
        also believes more attention should be directed to the teaching
        profession and its importance.</p>
      <p>"We are doing our best to turn out really
          good teachers," says Rader, associate professor of curriculum and instruction.
          "We have an excellent
          program at ASU, and the teachers who come out of our program are very
        well-prepared; however more needs to be done."</p>
      <p>Rader comes from an education
          family. Her grandfather was a superintendent of schools in Mississippi;
          her grandmother was a second grade teacher;
          and her daughter is currently an early childhood and ESL teacher in
        Litchfield Park. Rader says the key to teacher recruitment and retention
        is motivation.</p>
      <p>"We
          can try to recruit more people into teaching, but we really need the
          cream of the crop and the best to go into teaching," Rader says.
          "The best teachers need to be in the earlier grades because that's
        when it's more crucial in student development. If you have motivated
        teachers,
        then students will achieve."</p>
