Second edition, much enlarged.  By Nich. Culpeper.  London:

  Translated from the Latin.  Subsequently further enlarged and
 published under the title: <i>Pharmacopoeia Londinensis</i>, or, <i>The
 London Dispensatory</i>.  Numerous errors in pagination.  The last
 printed page consists of printer's advertisements.  Printed in
 double columns; ornamental head and tail pieces.  References:

<P>
This is Nicholas Culpeper's English translation of the Latin work
 <i>Pharmacopoeia Londinensis</i>, a listing of drugs and how to formulate
 them.  Culpeper's work was not appreciated by the Royal College of
 Physicians, since Culpeper was a well-known herbalist, not a medical
 doctor.
