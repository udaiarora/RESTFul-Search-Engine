        Narducci</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Frank Narducci is 
        the principal of Conley Elementary School. He built a microsociety for 
        us. There is a Bank of America, we have our own accounts and it helps 
        us with our math. There is a Basha's store where we can go in and write 
        a check for an item in the store. There is a Salt River Project where 
        we get to water the gardens and go around the school and check for lights 
        out and doors locked for conservation. There is even a Postal Office where 
        the kids in 2nd grade and lower get to sort the mail and put it in the 
        teacher's box. I was chosen by my teacher to drop the mail in the mail 
        box and pick up our mail. Mr. Narducci says attitude is everything. Also, 
        if you work hard enough you will achieve it. He is really funny and nice 
        but he also has the kids follow the rules. He has a wife named Vicki Narducci 
        and a daughter named Emily. Mr. Narducci is always at every school event, 
        even goes in our dunk tank. He is a really good sport even though 
he is 
        a U of A fan. He wore an ASU Sun Devil Jersey for a whole day at school!! 
        My world is a better world because he is my friend. He is a good 
principal 
        and I like learning from him.</font></p>
