LIST's Newsletter<br>
September, 2002

</center>
<br>
September has been an exceptionally busy time for many of us in the Libraries! 
Some very visible changes have been implemented, including a new look on the 
Libraries? home page and new services here in Hayden with the integration of 
Video Resources, both of which have especially affected public service points. 
Changes continue to be in the works behind the scenes here in LIST as well, with 
the ongoing development of Scholars Portal, and a variety of upgrades to database 
software and the catalog. This month?s issue focuses on recent improvements in III 
with the release of Beta 2002, phase 2.
<p><br>

<h3>New Look for Libraries? Home Page</h3>

The Web Redesign/Integration working group of the Scholars Portal project has come 
up with a new look for the Libraries? home page. This new page incorporates several 
user-friendly features, including more task-oriented labels (such as ?Find Books and 
More? in place of ?Catalog?) and quick links to our most often-used features. 
<p>
The page will continue to change as we integrate the Scholars Portal project into our 
site, and as the working group identifies necessary design and/or feature enhancements. 
This week, a ?News? feature is being added to the page. Departments are welcome to 
submit suggestions for news items to Heather Knowles (see contact information under 
?Feedback? below) for consideration for placement on the home page.
<p><br>

<h3>The Ever Evolving ASU On-Line Catalog</h3>

<b>June 22, 2001</b>  The ASU On-Line Catalog is upgraded with beta release software, 
Release 2001 to allow secure transmission of patron information.  Insecure transmission 
of Patron ID#s (often Social Security numbers) was a top complaint to the Library, as 
well as an Administrative concern.  Testing begins.
<p>
<b>March 13, 2002</b>  The Beta test of Release 2001 SSL software completed.
<p>
April 21, 2002  The ASU On-Line Catalog was upgraded from Release 2001 to Release 2002, 
phase 1 production software.  This upgrade removed the last of the beta software and 
replaced it with production ready software.
<p>
<b>August 2, 2002</b> ASU Library purchases Web Access Management (WAM), the III proxy 
server.  Web Access Management (WAM) will allow ASU affiliated users (Faculty, Staff, 
Students) to access IP restricted sites from off-campus.  Off-campus users will need 
to configure their browsers to use a proxy pac (instructions will be provided when 
this is available).  Once they have configured their browser, if they try to access 
a restricted resource, they will be presented with the same authentication screen they 
see when they access their library information.  Once they have successfully completed 
that step, they will be able to use the resource as if they were on campus, and move to 
other IP restricted resources without additional validation.
<p>
As of Release 2002, phase 1, WAM also allows for a proxy rewrite configuration, which 
does not require the user to configure their browser.
<p>
WAM does not support SSL validation in this version.
<p>
<b>September 9, 2002</b>  The ASU On-Line Catalog is upgraded to beta release 2002, 
phase 2, which will allow secure validation of patron information when using WAM.  
Testing has begun, and the following issues have turned up:
<p>
SSL works correctly for the proxy rewrite configuration, but does not work with the 
regular proxy method.  Not yet resolved.
<p>
Problems with the keyword-indexing program caused the system to stop processing on 
9/18/02, 9/19/02 and 9/21/02.  Resolved 9/21/02
<p>
Records in the WebOPAC are sporadically displaying as blank screens.  This behavior 
began after a software patch was loaded 9/17/02 and was reported to III on that date.  
This problem is still under investigation.
<p>
Limiting a Keyword, Title or Subject search returns a screen that lists the author 
name twice, but no title.  This behavior also began after the 9/17/02 upgrade and was 
reported on that date.  This is still under investigation.
<p>
September 24 or 25, 2002  III will upgrade the beta software.  Any additional problems 
or issues will be reported on the LIST SOS Status 
page: <a href=http://sos.lib.asu.edu/status.html>http://sos.lib.asu.edu/status.html</a>.
<p>
Any additional problems you encounter with the catalog may be reported to the SOS 
desk (call 5-9093, or submit an online problem report at 
<a href=http://sos.lib.asu.edu/form.html>http://sos.lib.asu.edu/form.html</a>). For 
general questions about the catalog upgrades, please contact Fred McIlvain through 
Outlook or by calling 5-9427.
<p><br>

<h3>Coming Soon: Communication Survey</h3>

We are currently developing a survey for Electronic Resource Representatives (ERRs) 
and all interested library staff to help us determine the best ways of communicating 
important technology-related information. Next month?s issue will include a link to 
the survey, which will be presented as an online form. Please help us to serve you 
better by taking a few minutes to complete the survey when it becomes available!  
<p><br>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

Your feedback is always appreciated. Please send questions, comments, or suggestions to 
Heather Knowles through Outlook or by calling 5-2421.
