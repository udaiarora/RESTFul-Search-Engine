      <h2>Alumni Association honors Founder's Day award winners </h2>
      <p>Founders' Day is celebrated annually by ASU to recognize the demonstrated excellence of those who have made ASU what it is today. On April 8, the Alumni Association honored alumni, faculty and staff with the Alumni Achievement Award, Young Alumni Achievement Award, Faculty Achievement Award and Staff Achievement Award. </p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/BoalsRichard.jpg" alt="Richard L. Boals '79" width="144" height="216" align="right">Two Alumni Achievement Awards were given to alumni who have excelled in their profession and served their communities with distinction. This year's recipients are Richard L. Boals '79, the president and CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona and Volker Sonntag '67, the vice chairman of Neurological Surgery at the Barrow Neurological Institute. </p>
      <p>Boals joined Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona in 1971. Prior to his appointment as CEO in April 2003, he served as president and chief operating officer, overseeing all the internal and external operations of the company including finance, sales and marketing, service and technology, and provider relationships. </p>
      <p>Boals is active in the local community, and has been involved with countless professional and community organizations. </p>
      <p>Boals received his bachelor's degree in accounting from ASU in 1979, and has completed executive development courses at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke, the Haas School of Business at California, as well as Harvard and Michigan. He also served four years in the U.S. Air Force. </p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/SonntagVolker.jpg" alt="Volker Sonntag '67" width="144" height="216" align="left">Sonntag has become a legend in the field of spinal neurosurgery, and is a recognized and respected doctor, both nationally and internationally. His post-graduate medical training includes an internship at the Arizona Medical Center and a neurosurgical residency and chief residency at Tufts New England Medical Center Hospital in Boston. After a year in private practice he returned to Phoenix in 1978 and currently is the vice-chairman, division of neurological surgery at Barrow Neurological Institute, chairman of the spine section and director of the neurosurgery residency program. </p>
      <p>He was the recipient of the Meritorious Service Award from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and Congress of Neurological Surgeons Joint Spine Section, an honor that is among the highest of his profession. </p>
      <p>The Young Alumni Achievement Award, given to an alumnus/alumna who has excelled early in his or her profession and served his/her community with distinction, was awarded to Randy Nelson '90 Ph.D., the president and CEO of Intrinsic Bioprobes, Inc. </p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/NelsonRandy.jpg" alt="Randy Nelson '90 Ph.D." width="144" height="216" align="right">Nelson earned his doctorate from ASU in 1990 and is a leader in the field of proteomics in the biotech industry. He worked as a research scientist in Texas and California for four years after graduation, and returned to ASU in 1994 to teach and run a chemistry lab. In 1997 he founded Intrinsic Bioprobes, Inc., a very successful Tempe-based biotech company. </p>
      <p>His professional accomplishments are numerous, including developing innovative proprietary technologies for application in clinical and diagnostic settings for analysis of human proteins. Nelson secured his first patent at age 29, and holds nine patents and has pending applications for 19 more. His numerous grants and awards from the National Institutes of Health and contracts with leaders in the pharmaceutical industry provide significant research and value to Arizona and the Valley. </p>
      <p>The Faculty Achievement Awards were presented to Georganne Scheiner '90 Ph.D., an associate professor in the Women's Studies Program, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS); Mark Lussier, an associate professor with the Department of English, CLAS; and Karen Adams, a professor with the Department of English, CLAS. </p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/ScheinerGeorganne.jpg" alt="Georganne Scheiner '90 Ph.D." width="144" height="216" align="left">Scheiner has taught in the Women's Studies Program for 20 years and earned her Ph.D. in history from ASU in 1990. As a graduate student instructor, and then as a lecturer and a tenure-track professor, she has been an inspiration to students and faculty alike. She transformed the Women's Studies curriculum, pioneering at least 10 new courses, and mentored other faculty and graduate students. </p>
      <p>Scheiner is committed to her job and her students and has a natural ability to easily convey her ideas to a diverse population. She is always willing to take time to talk to students, giving them pieces of necessary information so they may learn through self-discovery and become free thinkers. She is a motivator and a teacher who inspires every student she talks to. She is a teacher's teacher - committed, enthusiastic, demanding, innovative and compelling. </p>
      <p>Lussier came to ASU in 1994 as an assistant professor in the English Department, and was promoted to tenured associate professor in 1998. In his 10 years he has significantly enhanced the well-being of students, faculty and staff and has contributed to building a positive reputation for ASU. </p>
      <p>He brings to all his activities an openness reflected in a remarkable range of service activities. Most striking is the extraordinary number of graduate students who come to him for mentoring, formally as a dissertation and thesis director, and informally as a friend. His service to his profession is evident in the multiple tenure reviews to which he contributes, as well as his work in participating and organizing conferences. </p>
      <p>He works on behalf of students, recruits students, introduces them to scholars and guides them in developing their ideas and their writing. </p>
      <p>Lussier's credits include excellent relations with other professors in his field of romanticism; chairing and moderating panels at conferences, and serving two of the most serious aspects in his field - reviewing fellow scholars for promotion and tenure and reviewing prospective manuscripts for publication. </p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/AdamsKaren.jpg" alt="Karen Adams" width="144" height="216" align="left">Adams joined the ASU faculty in 1984 as an assistant professor in the English Department, and became a full professor in 1999. She is engaged in linguistics research and teaching focused on the pragmatics of language study. Her work as a research linguist and humanitarian has brought more than $700,000 in grants to ASU to fund greater awareness of Southeast Asian languages, one of her three principal areas of study. </p>
      <p>Her achievements include five books, with another forthcoming, 17 chapters and articles and nine reviews. In the field of Southeast Asian Linguistics, she has published substantial research that assists language scholars to understand the role of context in explaining the variation of language systems. </p>
      <p>Adams heads up the publications committee of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society; is a member of ASU's Program for Southeast Asian Studies' Editorial Board, where she solicits, reviews and edits linguistic studies; is a board member of the Association of Asian Studies' Forum on Thailand, Laos and Cambodia; and is an advisory board member of ASU's Language Policy Research Unit. </p>
      <p>Beth Luey, a senior instructional professional with the Department of History in the CLAS, received the Staff Achievement Award. </p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/LueyBeth.jpg" alt="Beth Luey" width="144" height="216" align="right">Luey began working at ASU in January 1980 and founded the Scholarly Publishing Program, a part of the Public History Program. It is now a Regents Certificate Program that encompasses departments across the university. Since its founding, Luey has worked to develop an almost unique program of scholarly publishing preparation, one that has developed an international reputation for attracting both national and international students. Her work includes developing and teaching a set of specialized courses, establishing a broad set of interning publishers across the country and creating an excellent placement record for the students who complete their certificates. The program provides students for internships and graduate certificate holders for staff positions to a variety of ASU offices, and has placed students in highly competitive positions throughout the country. Her own work includes a variety of professional service positions, including president of the Association of Documentary Editing; president of the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing; editing two key journals in her field; and serving on a number of professional association boards. </p>
      <p>Each faculty award winner, as well as the staff award winner, receives a grant of $1,500. </p>
