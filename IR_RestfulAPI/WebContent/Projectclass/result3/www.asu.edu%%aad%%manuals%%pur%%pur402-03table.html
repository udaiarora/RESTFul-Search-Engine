This form is submitted to the director of PBS. If the RFQ is for professional services, the director of PBS will determine the number and qualifications of the evaluation committee members. If the RFQ is for construction services, the evaluation committee will not have more than seven members and must include one person who is an outside licensed contractor and one person who is a registered architect or engineer. These licensed and registered people may be employees of the university or outside consultants. If outside consultants, they will not be compensated for providing this service, but may be reimbursed reasonable expenses. These licensed and registered people may not provide and may not be affiliated with a firm that provides any goods or services relating to the project covered by the RFQ.</li></ol><p>PBS:<p><ol><li>advertises the RFQ in accordance with <a href="pur501-02.html">PUR 501&#150;02</a>, &#147;Advertising for Bids&#148;</li><p><li>mails or otherwise distributes the RFQ to a wide number of professional and/or 	construction services firms, including small and disadvantaged firms</li><p><li>receives and logs responses to the RFQ</li><p><li>rejects  any received after the date and time set for closing the RFQ<p>and</li><p><li>after the RFQ is closed, forwards responses to the evaluation committee.</li></ol><p>The evaluation committee:<p><ol><li>evaluates the statements of qualifications and experience submitted in response to the RFQ</li><p><li>conducts discussions with at least three but not more than five persons or firms as specified in the RFQ regarding the contract and the relative methods of approach for furnishing the required professional or construction services</li><p><li>in order of preference, based on criteria established and published in the RFQ, selects 	a short list of three of the persons or firms the evaluation committee deems to be the 	most qualified to provide the professional or construction services. The selection of the short list and order of preference must be based on demonstrated competence and qualifications only. Fees, price, man-hours, or any other cost information may not be requested or considered in the selection of the short list or order of preference. For an RFQ for construction services only, the short list does not include any person or firm that includes or employs any person or firm that has provided for compensation any services relating to the project covered by the RFQ. If only two responsible and responsive persons or firms respond to the solicitation, the evaluation committee may either proceed with the selection process with those two persons or firms or request that PBS readvertise the RFQ<p>and</li><p><li>submits the short list in order of preference through the assistant vice provost and facilities chief planning officer to the director of PBS.</li></ol><p>The director of PBS or designee:<p><ol><li>issues a notice of intent to award a contract for professional or construction services to one of the persons or firms on the short list prepared by the evaluation committee.
