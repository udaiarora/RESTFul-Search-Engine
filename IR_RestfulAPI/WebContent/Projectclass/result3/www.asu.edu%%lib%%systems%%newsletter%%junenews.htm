LIST's Newsletter<br>
June, 2002

</center>
<br>
Thanks for all the good feedback about last month?s inaugural issue of 
?We?re Listening.? This month, we have more personnel news to report, and we 
offer a preview of a significant project underway in the Digital Library.


<h3>Farewell, John!</h3>

This month, LIST is saying goodbye to our dear longtime colleague, <b>John Barnard</b>. 
John has accepted a professorship at Gordon College in Barnesville, Georgia, and will 
be retiring from ASU this summer after 31 years of service. We will have a sendoff for 
John on June 19th at Hayden in Rm. 133 from 2:00 ? 4:00 p.m. Please join us in wishing 
him well and thanking him for his many years of service to the Libraries and the University.
<p><br>

<h3>New Personnel</h3>

LIST is pleased to announce that a new half-time Technology Support Analyst, <b>Jeremy 
Kurtz</b>, has been selected to serve as a customer service liaison to departments with 
special computing needs. Jeremy recently completed a degree in Computer Science at ASU, 
and has provided computer systems support for the Math department. Jeremy will be located 
in room C2 and can be reached at 5-1902.
<p>
As mentioned in May, we will also be adding three new staff members from Video Resources 
this month. <b>Kirk Manegold</b> (5-6230) and <b>Matt Harp</b> (5-1064) will be housed in C41, along 
with equipment for the off-air taping service they manage. LIST will be evaluating this 
service over the coming year, seeking ways to streamline the process while improving 
service to distance education students. <b>Bill Gertz</b> (5-9093) will be located in C2 at 
the SOS desk. Bill?s mandate is to monitor our customer service by making follow-up 
calls on open tickets and developing and administering a customer service survey. He 
will be working at the desk in C2 from 12-4, M-F, and his presence should ensure that 
the SOS desk is staffed while freeing up other employees to make site repair visits. 
<p>
Please help us welcome all our new staff to the department and the library!

<h3>Digital Library Previews First Volume of Important Series</h3>

The Digital Library (you know, those scanners in C2) is currently digitizing an 
important series of documents, the Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. 
This series, held by Government Documents, is a gold mine of information on innumerable 
Native American tribes from the east coast to the west, spanning nearly a century (1850s 
to 1930s) and detailing the U.S. government?s policies toward the tribes. We have 
completed scanning a first volume, the 1854 Report, and started on a second, the 
1858/59 Report. Eventually the series will include over 80 volumes of several hundred 
pages each, fully searchable online, with images of each page available for viewing. 
You can get a preview of the first part of the 1854 Report at 
<a href=http://info.lib.asu.edu/lib/digilib/GOVDOCS-test/1854(001-108).htm>
