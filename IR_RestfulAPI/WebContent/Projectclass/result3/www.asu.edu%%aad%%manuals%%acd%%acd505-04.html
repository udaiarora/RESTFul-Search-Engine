<img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2">

<p>
ASU will pursue an active recruitment and selection process to assure the availability of qualified <a href="acd002.html#Applicant" target="New">applicants</a> to meet its employment needs and to assure the provision of <a href="acd002.html#equalemployment" target="New">equal employment opportunity</a> through <a href="acd002.html#affirmativeaction" target="New">affirmative action</a>.  To accomplish this, all position vacancies will be announced, posted, advertised, and/or filled as indicated in this policy.  When a position is dependent on continuation of funding from a specific source and may, therefore, terminate when the funding is no longer available, this must be clearly stated on the Announcement of Vacancy (AV) and any advertisements/announcements about the position.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Essential Functions</b></font>

<p>
The <a href="acd002.html#essentialfunction" target="New">essential functions</a> of a position must be determined before advertising that position and must appear on the AV. The essential functions are the core or required duties of a position as opposed to the marginal responsibilities of a position. The following factors should be used in determining essential functions:

<p>
<ol>
<li>the reason the job exists is to perform that function(s)</li>

<p>
<li>the availability of other <a href="acd002.html#employees" target="New">employees</a> among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed</li>

<p>
<li>the nature of the function is highly specialized so that the person is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function</li>

<p>
<li>the hiring official&#146;s judgment as to which functions are essential</li>

<p>
<li>the amount of time spent on the job performing the specific function</li>

<p>
<li>the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function</li>

<p>
<li>the work experience of past incumbents in the job

<p>
and</li>

<p>
<li>the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Advertising/Recruiting Requirements</b></font>

<p>
All vacancies must be advertised except as noted under &#147;<a href="#Exceptions to Advertising/Recruiting Requirements (Waivers)">Exceptions to Advertising/Recruiting Requirements (Waivers)</a>.&#148;  Any exception to this policy must be approved by the director of the Office of Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action (EO/AA) and the vice provost for academic personnel (ASU at Tempe campus and ASU at West campus) or provost (ASU at East campus).

<p>
The appropriate scope of advertising depends upon the position.  Positions opened for national recruitment must provide an application period of not less than 14 <a href="acd002.html#day" target="New">days</a> from the date the last announcement appears.  Regional recruitment must have an application period of not less than 10 days and local recruitment of not less than five days from the last date an announcement appears.  All advertised positions must appear in <i>Insight</i> once.

<p>
All positions must be advertised with a specific application deadline.  Departments may use a rolling deadline (e.g. April 1 or the 1st of the month thereafter until filled) to assist recruiting efforts.

<p>
All full-time <a href="acd002.html#tenure-eligible" target="New">tenure-eligible</a> <a href="acd002.html#facultymember" target="New">faculty</a> and <a href="acd002.html#continuingstatus" target="New">continuing-status</a>-eligible <a href="acd002.html#academicprofessional" target="New">academic professional</a> positions must be advertised nationally.  All non-tenure-eligible faculty or year-to-year academic professional positions may be advertised through national, regional, or local recruitment depending on which type of recruitment assures affirmative efforts to recruit diversity.

<p>
All position announcements and advertisements must include one of the following in the announcement and advertisement:  &#147;ASU is an equal opportunity employer,&#148; or &#147;AA/EOE.&#148;

<p>
<b>Pool Recruitment</b>

<p>
Pool recruitment may be used only for 49 percent FTE faculty associate/faculty research associate positions and 49 percent FTE academic associate positions when the department will hire more than five individuals from the recruitment.  EO/AA must approve the Announcement of Vacancy (AV) and ad copy, however, departments need not submit completed <a href="acd-eoaaforms.html">Applicant List (AL)</a> forms and the <a href="acd-eoaaforms.html">Hiring Process Reports (HPR)</a> to EO/AA for approval. These forms, however, must be completed as noted in <a href="#Step Four">Step Four</a> of the procedures of this policy.  (EO/AA will review this recruitment after hires are made and will contact departments that do not comply with all requirements.  Departments that do not consistently comply with all requirements may be prohibited from using pool recruitment.)

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b><a name="Exceptions to Advertising/Recruiting Requirements (Waivers)">Exceptions to Advertising/Recruiting Requirements (Waivers)</a></b></font>

<p>
Advertising may be waived when the vice provost for academic personnel  (ASU at Tempe campus and ASU at West campus) or provost (ASU at East campus) and the director of EO/AA decide that it is in the university&#146;s best interests to follow a different recruiting procedure. Waivers are usually for temporary positions or to hire individuals who would bring particular distinction to the university and would not usually be someone who could be attracted through regular recruitment.  The hiring official must complete a &#147;<a href="acd-eoaaforms.html">Request for a Waiver</a>&#148; form outlining the reasons for requesting a waiver and include a copy of the <a href="acd002.html#candidate" target="New">candidate&#146;s</a> curriculum vitae or r&#233;sum&#233;.  The Request and vita/r&#233;sum&#233; must be submitted to the director, EO/AA for approval who, upon approval, will forward the material to the vice provost for academic personnel (ASU at Tempe campus and ASU at West campus) for approval.  At ASU at East campus, the waiver must be submitted to the provost first and after approval, the waiver will be sent to the director EO/AA for approval.  After both approvals, the department will be notified.

<p>
<b>Grant and Contract Positions</b><br>

<p>
When a proposed faculty member or academic professional is specifically identified by name in a grant or contract proposal, the person will be hired without advertising the position. The procedures for exceptions to advertising/recruiting must be followed for these <a href="acd002.html#Appointment" target="New">appointments</a>.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Screening, Interviewing, and Selecting Applicants</b></font>

<p>
<b>Search Committees</b>

<p>
The hiring official is responsible for organizing a search committee (see <a href="acd111-01.html">ACD 111&#150;01</a>, &#147;Faculty Voting Rights,&#148; for establishment of search committees).  A search committee consists of at least two people who evaluate the applications to determine who to recommend for interview (or hire when interviews will not be conducted).  The search committee (or selection committee, for GRA/GTAs) shall be used to recruit, evaluate, and interview applicants, and make recommendations to the hiring authority on all positions.  Search committees must include an EO/AA trained unit or college affirmative action representative (AA rep) who is in the same employment category as the position opened for recruitment. Search committees must review the <a href="acd002.html#academicunit" target="New">academic unit&#146;s</a> utilization of women and minorities and its goals and timetables for remedying any <a href="acd002.html#underutilization" target="New">underutilization</a> that may have been identified.

<p>
<b>Nondiscrimination</b>

<p>
Every person involved in screening, interviewing, and selecting applicants must exercise judgment at each step in the process to ensure that no applicant is discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, citizenship, sex, <a href="acd002.html#genderidentity" target="New">gender identity</a>, sexual orientation, age, <a href="acd002.html#disability" target="New">disability</a>, <a href="acd002.html#vietnam-eraveteran" target="New">Vietnam-era veteran status</a>, <a href="acd002.html#othereligibleveteran" target="New">other protected veteran</a> status, newly separated veteran status, or <a href="acd002.html#specialdisabledveteran" target="New">special disabled veteran</a> status.

<p>
The screening of applicants must be based on the qualifications listed in the advertisements. All individuals selected for interview (or hire when interviews are not conducted) must meet the required qualifications advertised. If a specified degree is listed as required, only candidates who are expected to have completed all requirements for that degree before the appointment begins may be considered.

<p>
Only those individuals who have submitted all application materials required, by the application deadline, may be considered for interviews.

<p>
<b>Interviews</b>

<p>
No campus interviews, formal or informal, may be held before the application deadline date and before the pool is approved by the dean (if required) and certified by EO/AA (except for pool recruitment positions and waivers).  Job related reasons must be provided for all applicants not recommended for interview and &#147;does not meet qualifications&#148; is an unacceptable reason; specificity as to which of the required/desired qualifications has not been met must be provided to EO/AA.

<p>
<b>Requirements for Reimbursement of Interviewee Expenses</b>

<p>
At ASU at Tempe campus, the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University provides reimbursement for interview expenses for two campus interviews when the applicant pool is certified by EO/AA.  Special permission is required from the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University for reimbursement for a third campus interview.  At ASU at West campus, the Office of the Provost provides a stipend to each college for each approved search; the stipend is to assist in covering costs of the search including reimbursement for interview expenses.  At ASU at East campus, each college is responsible for reimbursement for campus interviews.

<p>
<b>Selection and Recommendation</b>

<p>
No offers of employment may be made before the hiring recommendation is approved by the hiring authority and is certified by EO/AA.  When a department is offering a position to someone who anticipates degree completion by the appointment date, written notification from a knowledgeable source at the degree-granting institution must be provided with the HPR before EO/AA will certify the hire recommendation.  Only job related reasons may be used in making employment recommendations.

<p>
<b>Employment-Eligibility Verification</b>

<p>
Persons selected for hire must be able to provide verification of employment eligibility by the time employment begins, as required by the <i>Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.</i>

<p>
<b>Reopening a Search</b>

<p>
If a position is not filled within the fiscal year approved for the search, i.e., on the Authorization to Recruit form (AR), it may be reopened for recruitment. When the only change to the original recruitment is a new application deadline, a department must submit a new AR along with a memo indicating a wish to reopen the search to EO/AA. When qualifications are to be changed, the department must submit a new AV, ad copy, and a new AR.

<p>
<b>Rehires</b>

<p>
Non-tenure-eligible faculty and year-to-year academic professionals employed during one academic year may be rehired for the following academic year in the same department and with the same title/rank without reapplying for the position when the initial hire was made through open recruitment.  There must be an annual performance evaluation on file in the department to make this type of reappointment.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Retention of Records</b></font>

<p>
The academic unit&#146;s hiring records must be retained for a period of three years following the selection process. Search or selection committees and academic administrators are required to document the basis for their recommendations. The academic unit must be able to document a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for every action. At a minimum, hiring records will contain the following documentation:

<p>
<ol>
<li>the AR, AV, and ad copy for the position</li>

<p>
<li>the search plan submitted to EO/AA</li>

<p>
<li>the <a href="acd-eoaaforms.html">Applicant List (AL)</a> and the <a href="acd-eoaaforms.html">Hiring Process Report (HPR)</a> form, including the approval signatures of the dean (if required) and the director of EO/AA</li>

<p>
<li>the r&#233;sum&#233;s or curriculum vitae of applicants, together with letters of recommendation (If an applicant or a placement service requests return of a r&#233;sum&#233;, note such a request and the subsequent action in the file to verify receipt and review of the application.)</li>

<p>
<li>all correspondence with applicants, candidates selected for interview, candidates offered employment, and references

<p>
and</li>

<p>
<li>documentation of the search committee findings, including interview notes, committee deliberation notes, and reasons why the committee considered each applicant qualified or unqualified.</li>
</ol>

<p>
When a waiver is used, the department must keep a copy of the waiver, the vita/r&#233;sum&#233; of anyone considered for the position, any interview questions, notes, reference information, and any correspondence related to the hire.

<dd>During the interview process, candidates should meet with the dean (or his or her designee) and the department head (or his or her designee).  Candidates for tenured positions (ASU Main) must also meet with the provost or his or her designee.</dd>

<p>
<dd>The components of the interview process must be the same for all candidates, i.e. requiring a seminar presentation for some and not others is unacceptable.  Candidates must be asked the same basic set of questions and all persons involved in the interview process must ask only job-related questions.</dd>

<p>
<dd>Departments are encouraged to include &#147;free time&#148; during the interview process.  Candidates being interviewed should be consulted before the interview to identify individuals, organizations, and/or services they would like to meet with/learn about when they visit the campus.  Departments may wish to provide a list of organizations and services to the candidates as examples of choices.  Any list provided to candidates must include examples of organizations/programs reflective of ASU&#146;s commitment to diversity.</dd>
