      <h2>SCENE links high school students with ASU scientists</h2>
      <p>        <img src="research_images/scene_091103.jpg" width="216" height="331" align="right">A collaborative science education program is helping Arizona high school
          students get a taste of college-level research and science - with spectacular
      results. </p>
      <p>The Research Experiences for High School Students program,
            offered by the Southwest Center for Education and the Natural Environment
            (SCENE),
          targets students considering a science major in college and gives them
          a firsthand look at the world of scientific research. SCENE, a non-profit
          organization affiliated with ASU's Center for Environmental Studies,
          links students with ASU scientists and research projects for six months
        of each academic year.</p>
      <p>Through the program, students are exposed to the
          scientific process, learn how to collect and analyze data using sophisticated
          scientific
        equipment and are active participants in cutting-edge research projects.</p>
      <p>"The
          program involves students in the whole process of scientific discovery,
          not in just one tiny aspect of it," says SCENE director Kathryn Kyle.
        "It provides the opportunity for high level scientific achievement."</p>
      <p>Now
          in its fifth year, the program culminates with a research poster presentation
          by the students. The students are encouraged to enter their
          research in the Central Arizona Science and Engineering Fair (CARSEF)
          and other science competitions, where they typically excel. Program
        participants have won first, second and third place prizes in numerous
        categories
          at CARSEF, as well as the grand prize for each of the last three years.
          Last year, a student in the program also took first place at both the
          regional and national levels in the Junior Science and Humanities Symposium
        competition. </p>
      <p>Several students have won Regent's Scholarships to ASU,
          and most have won cash and scholarship prizes at one or more science
          competitions.
          In addition, the program itself awards a small scholarship to each
        participant who completes the program successfully.</p>
      <p>In 2000, CARSEF grand prize winners,
          Chrissy Hobson and Nachelle Brown, worked in a bioengineering lab studying
          balance. After working with the
          researchers in the lab, the students saw a need for a portable device
          that could be used to diagnose balance problems and provide balance
        training to correct them. </p>
      <p>In their second year, the two designed and built such
          a platform, using their winnings from CARSEF the previous year to finance
          the project.
          The first platform did not function as expected, so they redesigned
        it with better, more expensive parts, for which they secured grant funding.</p>
      <p>In
          her third year in the program, Hobson tested the successfully redesigned
          platform with senior citizens, comparing balance between test subjects
          who had no balance training and those who had Tai Chi. Brown and Hobson
        now attend ASU, and are considering patenting the portable balance platform.</p>
      <p>"The
          students in this program are incredibly bright," says Kyle. "When they
          describe their research it's mind-boggling - graduate level research
        done by 15-year-olds."</p>
      <p>Kyle says the key to the program is its collaborative
          nature - a partnership among SCENE, many departments at ASU, SRP and
          other program sponsors,
          and Valley high school teachers and students. The program was piloted
          under a grant from the Arizona Community Foundation in 1997. In subsequent
          years, SRP has been the principal sponsor, with additional support
        from the City of Tempe for students attending Tempe high schools.</p>
      <p>SCENE, a
          nonprofit educational organization, is itself built as a collaborative
          partnership between ASU's Center for Environmental Studies and members
        of the private sector.</p>
      <p>Applications for the 2003 - 04 year are due Sept.
          15 and can be found online at (http://aspin.asu.edu/scene). For information,
          call Kyle at
