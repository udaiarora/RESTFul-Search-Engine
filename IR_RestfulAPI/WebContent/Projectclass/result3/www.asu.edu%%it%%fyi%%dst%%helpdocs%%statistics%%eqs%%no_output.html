<p> 
It appears that having a character in the 71st column of a line in your EQS 
syntax file, causes EQS not to write any information to the output file. 
It does successfully create an output file but does not write anything 
to it. 
<p>
Hence as a rule, limit the number of columns in the EQS syntax file 
to 70 columns. This way, this and other similar problems can be avoided.
