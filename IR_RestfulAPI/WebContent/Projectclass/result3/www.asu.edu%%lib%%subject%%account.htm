    <BR>
    A final compilation of the pronouncements of the Committee on Accounting Procedure and the Committee on Accounting Terminology, both no longer in existence. Accounting Research Bulletins are explanations of accounting problems and procedures. As such, they are forerunners of the APB Opinions. Accounting Terminology Bulletins are clarifications of terminology and represent only four pronouncements. APB opinion no. 6, &quot;Status of Accounting Research Bulletins,&quot; explains which of these publications are still in force and recommends some revisions. Portions of this opinion have since been superseded by APB-11, 16, 17, 26, and FASB-8. <BR>
    <BR>
  <li><u>APB Opinions</u>. Accounting Principles Board, 1962-1973. These are the opinions of the Accounting Principles Board which preceded the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Many of them are still in effect today; however, the opinions themselves are now out of print. They can still be found, though, in the <u>Journal of Accountancy,</u> (<B>HF 5601 .J7</B>) where they were printed in their entirety at the time they were originally issued. <br>
