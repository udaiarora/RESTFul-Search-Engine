            <h3>Change in Reporting for New and Trial Databases</h3>
            <p> Heather Knowles and Diane White are now responsible for the New/Trial 
              page, the Broad Subject categories pages, database pages produced 
              by DBdb, and the Alphabetical list of databases. Please report changes 
              or additions to these pages to Heather or Diane via Outlook.</p>
            <h3><br>
              Secure Telnet Now Required</h3>
            <p>Following in the secure steps of the ASU IT department, the ASU 
              Libraries will no longer support unsecure telnet access to the Online 
              catalog and Integrated Library System (INNOPAC). The &quot;Text 
              Version (Telnet)&quot; option will be removed from the ASU WebOPAC 
              main menu screen on Sunday December 5th. Public users must use the 
              WebOPAC to search the online catalog.<br>
              <br>
              Staff who access the Integrated Library System from off-campus, 
              including users running VPN software at home, will need to use a 
              secure telnet client to connect to the system. Secure Shell telnet 
              is available free from ASU IT: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/it/security/software/html/ssh/index.htm">http://www.asu.edu/it/security/software/html/ssh/index.htm</a>.<br>
              <br>
              Once the off-campus access has been secured, on-campus users who 
              still need to access staff functions via telnet will be moved to 
              secure telnet. Unsecure telnet access will be deactivated entirely 
              and all passwords will be changed at that time.<br>
              <br>
              <font color="#FF0000"><strong>Millennium users will not be affected 
              by these changes.<br>
              </strong></font><br>
              On Thursday, December 2, 2005 from 1:00-2:00 p.m. in Hayden C6A, 
              Fred McIlvain and Keith Swartz will be meeting with affected staff 
              members to demonstrate how to download and install the Secure Shell 
              Client software and configure it for access to the Integrated Library 
              System. All interested staff are invited to attend.<br>
              <br>
              If you have any questions or need additional assistance, please 
              contact Fred McIlvain (5-9427) or Keith Swartz (5-2854).<br>

          <h3 align="left">McIlvain Hosts Arizona Innovative Users Group (AZIUG) 
            Meeting</h3>
          <p align="left"> The ASU Libraries, represented by ILS administrator 
            Fred McIlvain, hosted the inaugural meeting of the Arizona Innovative 
            Users Group on Wednesday October 27, 2004.</p>
          <p align="left">There were 22 participants, from ASU, ASU West, NAU, 
            U of A, Pima Community College, Tempe Public Library and Scottsdale 
            Public Library. Two representatives from Innovative Interfaces also 
            attended.</p>
          <p align="left">Members of the group discussed their individual implementations 
            of the INNOPAC/Millennium system, what modules were up and running 
            and expected for the future. The Innovative representatives did a 
            presentation on continuing development at Innovative Interfaces.</p>
          <p align="left">The group is going to hold meetings twice a year (Spring 
            and Fall) with the next meeting tentatively scheduled for March 2005 
            in Tempe. There will be a presentation from Innovative staff and breakout 
            groups to discuss implementation, processes and procedures for a variety 
            of the Millennium Modules.</p>
          <p align="left">The agenda for the next meeting will be posted, and 
            interested ASU staffers are invited to attend. For more information 
            regarding the AZIUG, please contact Fred McIlvain (fred.mcilvain@asu.edu)
