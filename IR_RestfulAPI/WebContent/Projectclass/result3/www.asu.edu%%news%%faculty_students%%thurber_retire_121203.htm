      <h2>Thurber takes early offer</h2>
      <p>        Professor Frances Thurber is one of 78 ASU faculty members who have opted
          to take advantage of the Voluntary Separation Retirement Incentive
        Program implemented in August for eligible employees.</p>
      <p>The deadline for
            making the decision was close of business on Dec. 8, but Thurber
        didn't need that long to decide she would retire earlier
          than expected.</p>
      <p>At 61, Thurber still has the drive, enthusiasm and commitment
          that have made her a top academic, teacher and nursing practitioner
        for 40 years.
          Unfortunately, health problems have zapped her stamina and she's not
          willing to compromise the level of activity needed to be on the front
          lines of nursing when she's teaching.</p>
      <p>"I saw the early retirement offer
          as an opportunity for me to make a break before my production level
        went down as a result of my health,"
          Thurber says. "When I'm teaching, I want the kind of energy level that
          allows me to run around the clinical area and see what I need to see."</p>
      <p>Thurber
          joined ASU from the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing in
        1991. She has been a division chair for 12 years, and also runs the
          Westside Community Center Youth Clinic in Tempe. The clinic provides
          primary and acute episodic care to students from three elementary schools
          and one middle school.</p>
      <p>Thurber is leaving the ASU School of Nursing at
          a time when nurses are in high demand and the school is taking measures
          to respond to that demand. </p>
      <p>"I'm really pleased with the emergence of nursing over the past several
          decades toward a higher level of recognition of the value nursing brings
          to the health care scene," says Thurber. "Nursing has transformed from
          a vocation to a profession, with a well-established scientific base
        and ongoing research generated to support the educational environment."</p>
      <p>Thurber's
          retirement isn't effective until May 15, 2004, and she's not slowing
          down in the meantime. Thurber is relocating to the ASU West Campus
          for the spring semester to be the site manager for ASU's hosted Nursing
        program there.</p>
      <p>Thurber said she loves teaching and working with students,
          but also is looking forward to spending more quality time with her
        husband of 36
          years and delving into some hobbies, such as cooking, reading and gardening.
          In addition, her church choir will be traveling to Italy in mid-June
          for a two-week tour that will include stops in Rome, Florence and Venice,
        as well as a performance at St. Peters Basilica.</p>
      <p>Thurber was among about
          550 employees who were eligible for the Voluntary Separation Retirement
          Incentive Program - tenured faculty and academic
          professionals with continuing status who, by Dec. 1, 2003, had attained
          the age of 55 and above with 10 years of completed service to ASU.
        In all, 91 faculty are retiring this year, compared to 45 last year.</p>
      <p>The
          early retirement program gives the university much needed flexibility
          to expand or alter academic areas of emphasis in a time when current
          funding levels don't accommodate the addition of new faculty lines,
        while maintaining existing faculty lines.</p>
