      <p class="text">It seems like only yesterday that we each received that
        all-important letter from ASU announcing our selection into the Leadership
        Scholarship Program. Even as we were feeling a tremendous sense of pride
        and excitement in the moment, it would have been impossible to begin to
        imagine how our participation in such a program would so definitively
        impact each of our college experiences. And now, looking back on our college
        years, could we honestly begin to imagine what things would have been
        like without having participated in the Leadership Scholarship Program!?</p>
      <p class="text">Who doesn&#146;t recall receiving numerous phone calls,
        letters or selection process invitations throughout our years at ASU from
        all of our biggest fans -- those special people who always seemed to be
        looking out for us? People like Christine Wilkinson, Bob Francis, Leon
        Shell and June Malos who were constantly keeping us up-to-date about the
        latest leadership conference, new organizations to join, or employment
        opportunities scholarship that would help us make ends meet. We were definitely
        &#147;in the know&#148; on pretty much everything on campus -- we were
        Leadership Scholars! And, now we are Leadership Scholarship alumni, and
        I am very proud to be an LSP alumna!</p>

      <p class="text">It seems only yesterday that we were selected for the Leadership
        Scholarship Program at ASU. Can you believe it&#146;s been 15 years? You
        probably remember taking Neil&#146;s leadership class, (does anyone remember
        who said, &#147;Loose links sink ships&#148;?) and meeting incredible
        people on and off campus while participating in the program. Whether it
        was Bill Schultz, Dr. Shell, or Eva Bowen, we met and made friendships
        with amazing people.</p>

        Entering Class of 1989 </h4>
      <p class="text">Here are some of my memories from the LSP incoming class
        of 1989: All of us chipped in and bought a TV for Wendy as a wedding gift
        that first year&#133;Bob Hancock&#146;s intense, blue eyes and insurmountable
        energy in the Admissions Office&#133; Marilyn Singleton, the scholarship
        woman!&#133;Gatherings at Christine Wilkinson's home&#133; The yearly
        LSP picture, sporting our maroon shirts, on that day if at no other time&#133;Our
        first LSP retreat at Camp T. Does anyone remember the ice breaker &#147;high
        heels, cowboy boots and tennis shoes&#148;? How about bowling in town?
        How about our pathetic attempt to sing a version of &#147;So Long, Farewell&#148;
        from the Sound of Music as we introduced ourselves to all the other LSPers?</p>
      <p class="text">At Leadership 2000 that first year, Michael Thompson tried
        to &#147;break-up&#148; the segregation exercise. He wasn't afraid to
        challenge Gabriel one-on-one.</p>
      <p class="text">We were the 50/50 class: the first two years were spent
        with Gabriel Vasquez as our advisor and the second two years were with
        Jeff Thompson. During our college career the first Native American/Hispanic
        ASASU president (Matt Ortega-LSP) and first African American ASASU president
        (Rossi Turman) were elected.</p>

        Student Services at Ohio State University. </h2>

        Entering Class of 1990 </h4>
      <p class="text">It is hard to believe that it was more than ten years ago
        when we were named as the Leadership Scholarship Program&#146;s incoming
        class of 1990. We were the &#147;new&#148; freshmen who were introduced
        at the ASU football game, we met with our advisors pretty frequently,
        we attended Gabe&#146;s class and we had a great time at the retreat where
        our Brady Bunch skit was a hit. We later became the sophomores and juniors
        who had gotten extremely involved in leadership activities on campus,
        in our communities and within our different degree programs. Eventually
        we became the graduating seniors who had the opportunity to thank all
        of the people who helped make our Leadership Scholarship Program experience
        so rewarding and also to welcome and congratulate the new incoming LSPers.</p>
      <p class="text">Last year, I attended the LSP Homecoming reception and I
        also attended the senior speeches for the graduating class of 1999. Attending
        both of those events made me think about how I could give back to the
        Leadership Scholarship Program. I had a great time at last year&#146;s
        Homecoming event, and this year I hope to see many more of you at the
        party. I hope each of you is doing very well and I would love to catch-up
        with you.</p>
