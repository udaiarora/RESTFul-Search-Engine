      <h2>$1 million gift to the W. P. Carey School of Business establishes ASU
        PETsMART Chair in Services Leadership</h2>
      <p>  PETsMART, Inc., the nation's leading specialty retailer of services and solutions
    for the lifetime needs of pets, has given a $1 million gift to the W. P.
    Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, establishing the PETsMART
    Chair in Services Leadership.</p>
      <p>The funds will support an outstanding professor's
      scholarly research and teaching in management or marketing. PETsMART has
      determined that the first chair holder,
    as yet unnamed, will be chosen from the services marketing field - and will
    be a "pet parent."</p>
      <p>"PETsMART, with its commitment, vision and savvy, makes an
    excellent partner for us. The gift from PETsMART represents a tangible piece
    of a larger partnership
    with the W. P. Carey School of Business. Of course, I value what the gift
        does for us in helping us to realize our potential and strengthen our
        renowned marketing
    faculty, but a strong professional school like ours depends on its partnerships
    with business in so many ways," said Dean Larry Edward Penley. "This gift
        will strengthen the already renowned marketing faculty."</p>
      <p>The W. P. Carey School of
    Business is known internationally for its marketing programs and research,
    especially in the area of services marketing. W. P.
    Carey faculty were among the first to identify services as a product that
        could lead to profitability, and the Center for Services Leadership is
        respected
    throughout the world as a definitive source of services knowledge for companies
    who compete through service. </p>
      <p>PETsMART is a major corporate supporter of the
    center's work. The company's Senior Vice President, Services, Strategic Planning
    and Business Development,<br>
    David Lenhardt, serves on its board of advisors and was a presenter at a
    general session of the center's &quot;Compete Through Service&quot; symposium last
    fall. &quot;Our partnership with ASU is a natural fit for us as PETsMART has
    developed a strong business model that's built on a mix of retail products
    and high-quality pet services. Funding this Chair is a tremendous opportunity
    to educate the future leaders in the retail and services industries.&quot;</p>
      <p>PETsMART
    also supports the W. P. Carey MBA through speaking engagements and student
    projects. Last spring, W. P. Carey MBA students specializing in services
    marketing and management conducted an award-winning project for PETsMART
        on how to more effectively nationally market pet grooming services. </p>
      <p>Photos of
    Lenhardt are available to download at http://wpcarey.asu.edu/top/news_media.cfm. </p>
      <p>U.S. News &amp; World Report ranks the W. P. Carey undergraduate marketing
    major 21st in the nation. The W. P. Carey MBA -- ranked 12th among programs
    housed at public schools of business - is known for its services marketing
    specialization.</p>
      <p>About the W. P. Carey School of Business --<br>
        The W. P. Carey School of Business provides quality undergraduate, masters
          and doctoral programs that draw upon a dynamic learning environment
          to prepare students at all levels for the future. Internationally recognized
          faculty enrich the curriculum with their latest research findings,
          and deliver this knowledge in a technology-rich environment. Ranked
          25th in the nation by U.S. News &amp; World Report, the undergraduate
          degree offers Business Honors to some of the best students at the university.
          The W. P. Carey MBA, ranked 12th in the nation among public programs,
          combines business fundamentals with marketplace issues and trends,
          giving graduates the knowledge and experience to excel in a global
          economy. W. P. Carey School of Business alumni are lifelong learners
          connected to the school and each other through an active alumni community
          and executive education opportunities.</p>
