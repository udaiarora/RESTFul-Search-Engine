      <h2 align="left">President updates Academic Assembly: Faculty members get glimpse at evolution</h2>
      <p>Faculty members attending the Academic Assembly Breakfast Aug. 30 got a glimpse of ASU's evolution under the "One University in Many Places" plan, which first was announced to the entire university last April. </p>
      <p>The plan is the result of substantial work by the University Design Team, with engagement and input from faculty, staff and others. </p>
      <p>Implementation of the plan will focus on schools clustered on individual campuses. <br>
"We are, at the end of the day, one university that will operate a series of high-performing schools on multiple campus locations around metropolitan Phoenix," said ASU President Michael Crow during his remarks to the Academic Assembly. </p>
      <p>To illustrate the implementation and outcome of the plan, Crow highlighted the new campus names, which can be used now but will go into effect officially on July 1, 2005. </p>
      <p>"It is now Arizona State University everywhere," Crow said. "There is no more ASU Main, or ASU West or ASU East." <br>
  The proper reference for each campus is as follows: Arizona State University (or ASU) at the Tempe campus; Arizona State University at the West campus; Arizona State University at the Polytechnic campus; and Arizona State University at the Capital Center campus. </p>
      <p>A style guide for referencing the new campus names, as well as updates to the Graphic Standards Manual, will be part of a broad communications effort to institutionalize the campus name changes appropriately across the university by next summer. </p>
      <p>Crow said all of the campuses are going to be Arizona State University; any student attending schools on any of the campuses will be able to receive a full-service college education without having to go somewhere else to pick something up. </p>
      <p>Two of the campuses - Tempe campus and West campus - will be comprehensive in their orientation, while the Polytechnic campus and Capital Center campus each will have a specialized orientation. </p>
      <p>"This is the direction we're moving in, not what we have achieved," Crow said. "This is a very difficult process, and there are parallel activities running alongside it." </p>
      <p>One parallel activity is the Comprehensive Development Plan, which is the blueprint for evolving the university physically to accommodate anticipated enrollment growth to nearly 100,000 students over the next 20 years. </p>
      <p>The Tempe campus will grow to about 50,000 students, and the other three campuses each will grow to about 15,000 students. </p>
      <p>"We're building a great university for this metropolitan area, with 20 to 30 comprehensive schools covering key disciplines," Crow said, "and we want to disperse and cluster them together in ways where we can be out among the people in a broader and more flexible way." </p>
      <p>Crow said individual schools will achieve greatness by identifying the niches in which they compete, competing effectively within those niches - and then, within the university, being complementary colleagues to one another. </p>
      <p>Already, there are new schools, new programs and new areas of study being implemented. Everything is going through the normal processes and procedural reviews by faculty, administrators, regents and other officials. </p>
      <p>Crow encouraged everyone to go to his Web site to review the "One University in Many Places" white paper. <br>
"If you have thoughts, comments, or concerns, now is the time to get them on the table, because we have gone from the planning phase and have moved into the implementation phase," Crow said. </p>
