Also exempt are designing, developing, or testing prototypes, processes, or new products.  This exemption includes research and development of computer software that is embedded in or an integral part of the prototype or new product or that is required for exempt machinery or equipment to function effectively.<p>For purposes of this exemption, research and development do not include manufacturing quality control, routine consumer product testing, market research, sales promotion, sales service, research in social sciences or psychology, computer software research that is not included in basic and applied research in the sciences and engineering, or other nontechnical activities or technical services.<p>The exemption of sales tax does not apply to equipment with a life expectancy of less than one year or project cost of less than &#036;5,000.

Property Control will screen for equipment costing &#036;20,000 or more.  Screening must be documented by department personnel on the department copy of the purchase order.<p>If the equipment is available elsewhere on campus, the acquiring department should attempt to purchase the equipment, share usage, or make arrangements with the custodial department to transfer the equipment at no cost (see <a href="pcs210.html">PCS 210</a>, &#147;Interdepartmental Acquisition of Used Equipment,&#148; and <a href="pcs502.html">PCS 502</a>, &#147;Transferring Equipment between Departments at Zero Cost.&#148;<p>Under certain circumstances Purchasing and Business Services will assist departments in purchasing used equipment (e.g., from ASU Surplus Property and Recycling, the Arizona Department of Administration&#146;s Surplus Property Management Office, or other salvage facilities).  However, Purchasing and Business Services&#146; assistance is not required when purchasing used capital equipment (unless it is purchased through ASU Surplus Property and Recycling).  Departments considering purchasing used equipment from other university departments should be directed to PCS 210, &#147;Interdepartmental Acquisition of Used Equipment,&#148; for procedures.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Obtaining Approval for the Purchase of Used Equipment</b></font><p>Before purchasing used equipment, an individual must obtain approval from the department chair, dean, director, or designee.  Approval may be given in a memo or as a statement on the requisition.<p>Purchasing and Business Services is not obligated to assist the department in purchasing used equipment unless it is purchased from the Arizona Department of Administration&#146;s Surplus Property Management Office.<p><b>Capital Budget</b><p>Most purchases require equipment to be in an approved capital budget.  If the equipment is not budgeted, the supervisor&#146;s or sponsor&#146;s approval may be necessary before purchasing.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Equipment Purchased with Sponsored Funds</b></font><p>The title to equipment purchased with sponsored funds may change depending on the terms of the contract or grant; however, a standard provision of sponsored equipment purchases requires that such equipment shall be used only for the purpose for which it was purchased according to the contract or grant.<p>To determine the title of equipment purchased with sponsored funds, contact the sponsored property coordinator.<p>In most cases, a project director may purchase equipment using sponsored project funds when the equipment is budgeted in the contract or grant.  However, some awards require specific prior approval on certain types of equipment, e.g., automatic data processing equipment (ADPE), even if listed in the approved budget.  Contact the sponsored projects officer before purchasing equipment with sponsored funds to determine allowability.<p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>For sponsored equipment acquisitions not itemized in the approved budget, prior approval must be obtained through one of the following methods:<p><ol><li>Organizational Prior Approval System&#151;This system is used to request internal approval from the Office for Research and Sponsored Projects Administration.</li><p><li>Request from sponsor&#151;Notify the sponsored projects officer to request prior approval from the sponsor.</li></ol></td></tr></table><p><img src="pcshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Procedures</b></font></center><img src="pcshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Equipment Costing More than &#036;5,000 and Less than or Equal to &#036;20,000</b></font><p>The department must prepare an off-campus purchase request (RX) or an Internal Purchase Order (PO) and obtain necessary approvals to permit the document to be forwarded to Purchasing and Business Services.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Equipment Costing More than &#036;10,000</b></font><p>The department must<p><ol><li>screen throughout the college or vice presidential area for available comparable equipment before purchasing the equipment.</li></ol><p>If comparable equipment is not available within the college or vice presidential area:<p><ol start="2"><li>prepare an off-campus purchase request (RX) or an Internal Purchase Order (PO) and obtain necessary approvals.
