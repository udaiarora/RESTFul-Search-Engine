      <p align="left"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
        is community service? Simply put, it's when someone volunteers their time 
        to make a difference in their community. When we think of someone who 
        made a significant difference for people of all races, we think of Martin 
        Luther King.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Another 
        person that I know personally, who has made a tremendous impact in communities 
        across the nation is my dad. He's Chairman of a volunteerism program for 
        the National Basketball Association called TEAM UP! When he gives his 
        passionate message to young people using the acronym T for teamwork, E 
        for effort, A for attitude, and M for motivation, I see the enthusiastic 
        reactions on their faces. They can't wait to get out there to do various 
        volunteer projects like planting trees, helping to feed and clothe the 
        homeless, and helping in elderly homes. My dad is a great person to admire, 
        not just because I love him but because he cares about people and making 
        the world a better place to live in. And by doing this, he's keeping kids 
        more involved with their community rather than drugs and gangs. Through 
        listening to and helping my dad in some of his projects, I realized three 
        things: one, It was fun to do, two, I made new friends, and three, helping 
        the community made me feel better about myself and it made me want to 
        volunteer more.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I am 
        very proud to have someone within my family who has contributed to making 
        Dr. Kings legacy of uniting all people last.</font></p>
