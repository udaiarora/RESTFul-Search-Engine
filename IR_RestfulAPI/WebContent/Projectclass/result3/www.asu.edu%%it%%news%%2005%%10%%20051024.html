				<h1><acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> Seeking Student Stars For Quiz Show Event</h1>
				
				<p class="article">Game show excitement is coming to <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> as <strong><em>Are You In Jeopardy?</em></strong> debuts at the campuses. The quiz show is a one-of-a-kind event thatâ??s not to be missed! Itâ??s a new activity at the universityâ??s annual Security Awareness Week, which begins October 31.</p>
				<p class="article">Fabulous prizes will be awarded for playing the <strong><em>Are You In Jeopardy?</em></strong> game. Students who show their &ldquo;security smarts&rdquo; will have a chance to win prizes ranging from iPods to laptop computers. The Information Technology departments at ASU Tempe, West, Polytechnic and Downtown campuses are sponsoring the contest to increase awareness of important security practices that everyone needs to know.</p>
				
				<h2>Level One: Play Online October 24 â?? November 3</h2>
				<p class="article">Remember these dates -- the online event only runs two weeks! When you take the <strong><em>Are You In Jeopardy?</em></strong> online quiz, youâ??ll be automatically entered in the prize drawing that will be held November 4. Everyone at ASU &#151; faculty, staff and students &#151; is eligible to win one of these prizes for their online participation. To take the quiz and learn more about computer security at ASU, visit the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/security/">Computer Security Web site</a>.</p>
				
				<h2>Level Two: Register Online When You Play</h2>
				<p class="article">To win the really BIG awards, you must be an ASU student! Students who take the online quiz can also register online to play at the <strong><em>Are You In Jeopardy?</em></strong> event. The event is an exciting, live action quiz show to be held during Security Awareness Week! The game will be a fast-paced competition played before a cheering &ldquo;studio audience&rdquo;. </p>
				
				<h2>Contest Days: November 1 â?? November 4</h2>
				<p class="article">The excitement will be rising as the top-scoring online finalists meet their opponents for the first time at the Tempe, Polytechnic and West campuses during three days of intense competition. As contestants hear their names called, they will run onstage to stand at one of three podiums. Players will have to be quick with a buzzer and ready to &ldquo;gamble it all&rdquo; as they bid on questions, just like in a real <acronym title="Television">TV</acronym> game show!</p>
				<p class="article">Of course, spectacular prizes will be waiting for the winners!! <strong><em>Are You In Jeopardy?</em></strong> will award <acronym title="Personal Data Assistant">PDA</acronym>s for the third highest scores in the live event, Xboxes for the second highest scores, and laptop computers to the top contest winners. Prizes will be awarded on the final day of Computer Security Week, and each campus will have first, second and third place awards for the winners at their contest location. Consolation prizes will be given to all players who compete in the event, even if they do not win one of the nine finalist awards. Contestants must sign a legal release and must be available at their chosen location at the time their game show begins to be eligible to win.</p>
				<p class="article"><strong><em>Are You In Jeopardy?</em></strong> is looking for enthusiastic audience participants to attend and support the contestants at each campus! Audience members will be recognized for their participation. A drawing for door prizes to be given to audience members will be held on each of the competition days.</p>
				
				<h2>Learn More Online</h2>
				<p class="article">To play the game that turns computer fears into confetti and cheers, and to learn about computer security recommendations and security software from ASU, see the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/security/">Computer Security Web site</a>.
