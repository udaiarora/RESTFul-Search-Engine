<h2>Crouch to lead ASU&rsquo;s global engagement efforts</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">ASU President Michael Crow has appointed Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering Dean Peter Crouch to lead the university&rsquo;s global initiatives. Crouch will remain dean of the Fulton School while an accelerated search for a permanent successor takes place.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0;"><br>
            Crouch, who has been at ASU since 1984 and a dean for the past 10 years, will serve as vice provost for global engagement and report directly to University Provost and Executive Vice President Milton Glick.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><img src="campus_images/PeterCrouch.jpg" width="100" height="135" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            Global engagement, originally noted as one of Crow&rsquo;s eight key design imperatives during his 2002 inauguration, is vital to the university&rsquo;s evolution.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&quot;Dean Crouch has shown the strength and vision needed to lead this initiative &ndash; one that is critical to the future of the university,&rdquo; Crow says. &ldquo;His experience in fostering international efforts, in terms of students and faculty members, will be vital as we move forward. He fully understands that there is no aspect of our teaching, research or public service that does not possess global implications.&rdquo;</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            ASU has had significant international success in the last few years, including vibrant research and academic programs under way around the world. Some notable accomplishments include:</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&bull; ASU became the first university to partner with the government of China to offer an executive MBA program. The first MBA Shanghai class for the W. P. Carey School of Business graduated June 4 with a ceremony in Shanghai, China.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&bull; ASU was the first international institution invited to participate in China&rsquo;s national science exposition, China Science and Technology Week. ASU&rsquo;s exhibit &ndash; titled &ldquo;Welcome to Mars!&rdquo; &ndash; featured significant findings from researcher Phil Christensen and his Mars research team.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>
&bull; In 2004, ASU signed a partnership with CONACYT, Mexico&rsquo;s equivalent to the National Science Foundation, to provide 75 fellowships &ndash; the largest number awarded to a U.S. institution &ndash; for Mexican graduate students at ASU and other large-scale joint research funding.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&bull; ASU created a dual executive MBA program with the Instituto Tecnol&oacute;gico Aut&oacute;noma de M&eacute;xico (ITAM) in Mexico City. Students earn two degrees: an executive master&rsquo;s of business administration from the W. P. Carey School of Business and a Maestr&iacute;a en Direcci&oacute;n de Empreses from ITAM. The first class started in the fall of 2004.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&bull; The university has developed multiple partnerships with Mexico&rsquo;s Tec de Monterrey (Tec), including an advanced degree in higher education leadership for Tec high-level administrators. Starting in spring 2006, ASU&rsquo;s College of Education will offer the three-year doctoral program to an initial 15-member selection of Tec administrators. </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&bull; The Ministry of Education of China invited Crow to be the American host of the U.S.-China Forum on University Design June 1 &ndash; 2 in Chengdu, China. More than 40 top-level Chinese university leaders attended the forum, which will be the inaugural meeting of another global initiative, the Institute for University Design.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&bull; ASU is creating two new schools to focus on global implications, including the School of Global Studies, within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and the School of Global Health, which is in the planning process.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            Crouch says his role will be to help synthesize the overall strategic view of ASU&rsquo;s global efforts and develop a plan to move the university forward. The position will serve as a nucleus for the university&rsquo;s wide-ranging international efforts.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&quot;We have to work out and strategize what our priorities are, and really define what regions we want to be fully engaged in,&rdquo; Crouch says. &ldquo;For us to make global engagement a hallmark of ASU, we must have a coordinated approach throughout our international planning efforts.&rdquo;</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
              Crouch says a great deal of work has been achieved, but he believes ASU needs to continue its focus in three crucial areas:<br>
            Helping students prepare for the global economy by increasing study abroad, recruiting and retaining scholars, and providing more international curriculum opportunities.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&bull; Helping faculty shape the university into a global hub of knowledge by fostering collaboration worldwide, offering incentives to scholars, and recruiting a greater percentage of international faculty and world fellows.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            &bull; Building the university&rsquo;s capacity for global engagement by enhancing interdisciplinary, international research; establishing bi-national institutes; and increasing nontraditional funding sources for research.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0;"><br>
            As dean, Crouch strengthened ASU&rsquo;s Fulton School of Engineering, quadrupling its funded research from $10 million in 1995 to $40 million today. Since his appointment in 1995 - after serving as a visiting professor in the ASU mathematics department, an associate professor in electrical and computer engineering, director of the Center for Systems Science and Engineering and chair of the electrical engineering department - Crouch has &ldquo;had real success in all dimensions of the faculty.&rdquo; </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">He has overseen the hiring of 145 faculty members, more than two-thirds of the school&rsquo;s faculty whose numbers have included six National Academy of Engineering members, 20 National Science Foundation Career Award winners, and numerous other nationally honored and recognized faculty.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            He also has guided the school through other major transitions, including setting the college&rsquo;s initial direction under Crow and fostering the $50 million naming gift from Ira A. Fulton.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            Global engagement has been a hallmark during Crouch&rsquo;s tenure as dean. He has played pivotal roles in many university global engagement efforts, including developing academic, industrial and government partnerships in China, India, Italy, Korea, London and Mexico. </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            One partnership with Motorola in Beijing allowed ASU to offer a high-tech MBA degree in China, which was the first of its kind. Another partnership reserved the Fulton School&rsquo;s Center for Professional Development as the recommended source for Korean industry training in Six Sigma and lean manufacturing practices. One result of this particular agreement is that POSCO, the third largest steel company in the world, trains its management through ASU and recently brought executives from 14 different countries to Arizona for further certification. </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            Crouch, who was an international graduate student in the United States himself, has encouraged faculty and students to become involved globally both through academics and service. Under his watch, students in the Fulton School of Engineering, many of whom are international students, have studied and served abroad in programs such as the Corporate Leaders Program (CLP). This year CLP students traveled to Cambodia to set up a computer center for children in an orphanage in Siem Reap. </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&quot;I have been working in this global environment for several years now,&rdquo; Crouch says. &ldquo;Structurally, this may seem like a big change for me, but intellectually it is not such a big leap.&rdquo;</p>
