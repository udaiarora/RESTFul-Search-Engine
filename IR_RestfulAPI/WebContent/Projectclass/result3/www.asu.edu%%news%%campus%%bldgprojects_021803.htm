      <h2>Regents approve seven new ASU building projects</h2>
      <p> The Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) has approved the planning and design 
        for seven new ASU building projects that will help advance the university's 
        educational and research enterprise mission.</p>
      <p>Approval for the projects came during the board's Jan. 23 - 24 meeting 
        in Tucson. By granting approval, the board acknowledges the university's 
        intent to initiate the projects within this fiscal year.</p>
      <p>ASU sought board approval because it revised its 2003 Capital Development 
        Plan by adding the seven new projects and deleting four previously approved 
        projects. The revised plan increased the net cost by $101 million, says 
        Mernoy Harrison, executive vice-president of finance. </p>
      <p>Projects removed from the current Capital Development Plan include the 
        Interdisciplinary science and engineering building and associated projects; 
        the interdisciplinary materials cleanroom; and the interdisciplinary high 
        bay building. The south campus parking structure was also deferred.</p>
      <p>Harrison said the four previously-approved projects were postponed for 
        at least one year and will be included in future Capital Development Plans. 
      </p>
      <p>The seven newly approved projects are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The Arizona Biodesign Institute Phase II - The second building of 
          a multi-phased interdisciplinary research complex on Main Campus will 
          provide laboratory and office space for state-of-the-art research focusing 
          on the life sciences, bioengineering and biotechnology. The design of 
          the 170,000 gross-square foot (GSF), $60 million facility will include 
          an open, flexible interior that encourages research collaboration and 
          can be adapted to changing project needs. </li>
        <li>Parking Structure 7 - A new four-to-five tier $15-million project 
          for Main Campus that will replace surface parking for lots 8, 26, 40 
          and 44 that have been eliminated due to campus expansion. The structure 
          will be located on the southeast corner of Lot 59 and will accommodate 
          about 1,500 vehicles. The structure's preliminary plans include two 
          passenger elevators and a security camera as part of the design.</li>
        <li> McAllister Residential Life Housing I - A two-building, 1,300-bed 
          project designed as the second of the four-phased South Campus Redevelopment 
          Projects on Main Campus. The $68-million construction project will be 
          located on McAllister, north and south of Apache. The university plans 
          to fast track the project to accommodate the dramatic increase in the 
          freshman class in recent years. University officials say they recognize 
          a need for more residence halls so every student, particularly freshmen, 
          who wants to live in an on-campus residence hall can do so. The project 
          should be completed by July 2004.</li>
        <li> Healthy Lifestyles Institute - To be established on the East Campus 
          and serve as a focal point for research promoting physical activity 
          and the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. The university plans to renovate 
          22,000 GSF of the existing Health Science Center to provide the necessary 
          laboratories and animal care facilities to support the nutrition department's 
          research faculty. The cost of the project is estimated at $3.3 million.</li>
        <li> Applied Biological Sciences Research Complex - The project will include 
          a complete renovation of 21,000 GSF within the East Campus Classroom 
          Building to provide necessary laboratory and classroom space. The project 
          will also develop 18.5 acres of vacant land south of the Academic Center. 
          The $ 3.7-million project will include a multifaceted greenhouse, instructional 
          space, display arboretum and field research facility that serves programs 
          in urban horticulture, applied biological sciences, wildlife habitat 
          management and ecological restoration. </li>
        <li>Human Factors Institute - Will facilitate the development of human 
          factors research on the East Campus, in cooperation with the U.S. Air 
          Force Research Laboratory, as well as other research and development 
          at the Williams-Gateway Airport. The institute is envisioned as a multi-disciplinary 
          research enterprise. When completed, the institute will be located in 
          the newly renovated Simulator Building. Total cost of the project is 
          $2.98 million </li>
        <li>Research and Instruction Building - Located on West Campus, the building 
          will expand research capacity by establishing a 60,000 GSF, $14-million 
          center devoted to the study of social and urban issues, particularly 
          those faced by the metro-Phoenix area. The center will provide integrated 
          learning environments to explore informational sciences and technology 
          with applications that can be directed to K - 12 education.</li>
