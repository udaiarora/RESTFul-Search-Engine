          <p><strong>University presidents decry state of science education</strong></p>
          <p> Many attendees at the Science Coalition dinner in New York bemoaned the nation&rsquo;s K-12 science education as inadequate. But a suggestion that a debate over evolutionary theory has led to science&rsquo;s declining presence in the classroom was roundly dismissed. ASU president <strong>Michael Crow</strong> said the issue hasn&rsquo;t appeared &ldquo;at any time, at any level&rdquo; during his three-year tenure. </p>

          <p><strong>Scientific creativity may skirt ethical boundaries</strong></p>
          <p>Scientists are mixing animal and human genes, hoping to test new drugs more safely and accurately, harvest organs for transplant and find new cures for human diseases. Some find the idea morally repugnant. &ldquo;Scientists are under a lot of pressure to be creative,&rdquo; says bioethicist <strong>Jason Robert</strong>, &ldquo;to come up with solutions that will help lessen the lag between basic research and cures. But it&rsquo;s not clear that building chimeras is going to solve the problem&rdquo; </p>

          <p><strong>Inconsistent test scores cause concerns over validity</strong></p>
          <p>Nearly all of the Houston schools suspected of possible cheating on the state&rsquo;s standardized achievement tests last year produced sharply weaker exam results this year. While it is not proof of wrongdoing, &ldquo;you wonder about the validity of scores when they jump around like that,&rdquo; says education professor <strong>Thomas Haladyna</strong>. Teacher turnover rates and changing student populations could cause score changes, but not in every suspected school. </p>

          <p>A police officer who made a presentation touting the benefits of Tasers to the Chandler, Ariz. city council should have revealed that he received stock options from the company. Just because no laws were broken doesn&rsquo;t mean he acted ethically, says <strong>Marianne Jennings</strong>, business ethics professor. &ldquo;The council might have made the same decision anyway, but they deserved to know.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>Neurologist William Polk Cheshire, affiliated with a Christian think tank, questioned the diagnosis of Terri Schiavo and also criticized the media for skewing the issue of stem-cell research. His conclusions drew criticism from his peers. &ldquo;Presumably what Cheshire wants is not really analysis of words but that we all recognize his particular view of truth,&rdquo; says biologist <strong>Jane Maienschein.</strong> &ldquo;This is highly problematic.&rdquo; </p>

          <p><strong>Phoenix housing market appears to have staying power</strong></p>
          <p>With mortgage rates heading higher, some economists are forecasting that home sales and ever-escalating prices are likely to drop. But not everyone is predicting ballooning prices will burst. In Phoenix, the market has been so hot, it&rsquo;s going to take a while for it to cool down, says business researcher <strong>Jay Butler</strong>. </p>

          <p><strong>Social norms may trump danger concerns</strong></p>
          <p>Eight men who arrived at a condominium for a ski trip smelled propane gas, but nobody acted with any sense of urgency, so they ignored it. The lodge exploded a few hours later, killing three. <strong>Stephanie deLus&eacute;, </strong>interdisciplinary studies lecturer, says this is common behavior because social rules of belonging and acceptance trump looking different. &ldquo;People tend to look at how everyone else is acting when the danger is not clearly defined.&rdquo; </p>

Builders are quietly buying up land. &ldquo;Thirty years ago, if you had said there will be this huge growth out here, people would have laughed their heads off,&rdquo; says policy researcher <strong>Rob Melnick</strong>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re poking into all kinds of areas that you wouldn&rsquo;t have believed.&rdquo; </p>

Teams are paying more attention to what their customers want. &ldquo;The experience is really important today,&rdquo; says sports business expert <strong>James Kahler</strong>. &ldquo;You are not just selling tickets to a baseball game.

          <p><strong>Expert sees laws harming cultural education</strong></p>
          <p>Many educators worry that an unintended consequence of the No Child Left Behind law may be that Native American students will lose instruction in their cultural traditions, history and language. &ldquo;We feel an effective education is one that&rsquo;s defined primarily by the goals of the community,&rdquo; says <strong>Denis Viri, </strong>researcher in the Center for Indian Education. &ldquo;In my opinion, No Child Left Behind is just another one of those roadblocks.&rdquo; </p>

          <p><strong>Finance officers, journalists face communication disconnect</strong> </p>
          <p>Business reporters rarely understand corporate finance, and finance officers have to be terrific communicators because they are expected to explain it. W. P. Carey School dean Robert Mittelstaedt says he has chided journalists for not making an effort to understand compensation practices. Stock options are very different from salary, for instance, but they are &ldquo;reported as income, because that&rsquo;s what the formula says.&rdquo; </p>
