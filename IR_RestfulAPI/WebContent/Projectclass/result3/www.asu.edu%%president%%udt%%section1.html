Arizona State University:&nbsp; who are we? </strong></h1>      <h2><strong>i.&nbsp; ASU is already one of the largest public universities          in the United States</strong></h2>      <p><font size="2">ASU has achieved recognition for its teaching, research,          and public service, attaining university status in 1958, and the        conferral of Research I status granted by the Carnegie Foundation in        1994.&nbsp; ASU today        enrolls nearly 60,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students        on four campuses in metropolitan Phoenix, maintaining a tradition of        academic excellence in core disciplines while gaining recognition as        an important global center for innovative interdisciplinary research.&nbsp; ASU        currently ranks third among public universities in its enrollment of        freshmen National Merit Scholars.&nbsp;</font> </p>      <h2><strong>ii.&nbsp; ASU            is located in one of the fastest growing and most rapidly diversifying            metropolitan regions in the United States</strong></h2>      <p><font size="2">The transformation of ASU from a territorial teachers          college to a major research institution parallels the transformation          of metropolitan Phoenix from a frontier settlement to a dynamic and          emerging global city.&nbsp; The        explosive population growth and rapidly changing demographic profile        of metropolitan Phoenix and the state of Arizona present unique challenges        to ASU.&nbsp; Arizona was the second fastest growing state in the nation        between 1990 and 2000, increasing 40 percent in population.&nbsp; And        since 1990 the population of metropolitan Phoenix has grown by 54 percent,        representing the second largest increase for a metropolitan area in the        United States.&nbsp; The population of the metropolitan region is projected        to double during the next two decades, from the present 3.3 million to        6 million by 2030, and eventually to 7 or 8 million.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">Arizona&rsquo;s demand for higher education will continue to increase.&nbsp; In        2001-2002 the number of high school graduates in Arizona totaled 46,774.&nbsp; That        number in 2017 is projected to be 72,697&mdash;a 55.4 percent increase.&nbsp; This        increase&mdash;second only to Nevada in projected growth&mdash;is anticipated        despite Arizona&rsquo;s low high school graduation and college participation        rates.&nbsp; Currently in Arizona, for every 100 ninth grade students,        59 graduate from high school and 29 go on to post-secondary education.&nbsp; The        national averages are 67 and 38 respectively.&nbsp; Arizona has fewer        college graduates, lower per capita income, and a greater percentage        of the population living below the poverty line than the national average.&nbsp; The        national average of low-income students who attend post-secondary education,        for example, is 23.1 percent.&nbsp; That percentage in Arizona is 15.7        percent. </font></p>      <p><font size="2">The burgeoning enrollment of ASU parallels the unprecedented          growth of metropolitan Phoenix and the state of Arizona.&nbsp; ASU has experienced        an enormous increase in enrollment during the past several decades.&nbsp; Whereas        in 1975 ASU enrolled 35,000 students, the university today enrolls nearly        60,000 students&mdash;more than the University of Arizona and Northern        Arizona University combined.&nbsp; Consistent with increasing statewide        demand for higher education, enrollment levels at ASU are projected to        increase dramatically in the decades ahead.&nbsp; In 2000 Governor Hull&rsquo;s        Task Force on Higher Education estimated that by 2020 over 200,000 students        would be enrolled in Arizona&rsquo;s community colleges and over 150,000        students would be enrolled in the state universities.<a href="endnotes.html#_ftn2"><sup>2</sup></a></font></p>      <p><font size="2">The demographic profile of ASU is changing dramatically,          reflecting the demographic transformation of the region.&nbsp; The past decade has        witnessed an 88 percent increase in the Hispanic population of our state,        for example, and today one of every four Arizonans is of Hispanic origin.&nbsp; Half        of the population under 18 in both Phoenix and Tucson is now Latino.<a href="endnotes.html#_ftn3"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp; It        is estimated that within the next 20 years, Latinos will make up over        one-half of the homegrown labor force.&nbsp; At the same time the economic        gaps between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; is        growing in Arizona.&nbsp; During the decade of the 1990&rsquo;s Arizona        ranked fifth among the 50 states in the growth of the income gap between        the top fifth and bottom fifth in family income.<a href="endnotes.html#_ftn4"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp; Many        Latino immigrant families as well as African American and Native American        families fall into that bottom fifth.&nbsp; At the same time, Arizona        is attempting to move from a service economy to an economy powered by        technology.&nbsp; Providing access to higher education to minority populations        and ensuring their success may well prove to be the difference between        economic growth and economic decline in Arizona&rsquo;s future.&nbsp; ASU        champions diversity, and minority enrollment at all ASU campuses hit        an all-time high of 22 percent of the total student body this year, up        from 10 percent in 1985 and 15.5 percent just ten years ago, a trajectory        the institution is committed to accelerating.&nbsp; </font></p>      <h2><strong>iii.&nbsp; The State of Arizona is the largest investor in ASU </strong></h2>      <p><font size="2">The State of Arizona is the primary investor in ASU,<a href="endnotes.html#_ftn5"><sup>5</sup></a> but        to a degree rarely appreciated, major research universities, whether        public or private, function in a fiercely competitive environment, and        in such a context, each must operate with &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; <em>entrepreneurial</em> speed        and ingenuity.&nbsp; In order to become competitive, a relatively young        institution that does not yet have the endowment resources of a more        established university, and has had to rely heavily on its annual state        appropriation, must focus on acquiring sufficient resources, both financial        and physical.&nbsp; ASU will become competitive to the extent that the        faculty, staff, and students embrace <em>a culture of academic enterprise</em>.&nbsp; It        is essential that the university community discard the paradigm that        ASU is an agency of the state government.&nbsp; ASU is an <em>enterprise</em> responsible        for its own fate, an enterprise that the state government charters and        empowers, and in which it <em>invests</em>. </font></p>      <p><font size="2">Comparisons to other major research institutions demonstrate          the extent to which ASU is not economically competitive.&nbsp; Rankings of universities        by sources of revenue (tuition and fees, state appropriations, federal        grants and contracts, all other grants and contracts, gifts, investment        income, other income sources) place ASU far below peer institutions.&nbsp; The        situation becomes untenable when one takes into account sources of revenue        per FTE student.&nbsp;</font></p>      <h2>iv.&nbsp; ASU is the sole research university in one of the nation&rsquo;s        emerging major metropolitan areas</h2>      <p><font size="2">ASU is the sole research university in a metropolitan          region characterized by explosive population growth and unprecedented          demographic transformation.&nbsp; As        a result, ASU bears the responsibility to educate students and advance        knowledge, as well as to improve the quality of life and quality of place        in metropolitan Phoenix and the region.&nbsp; In other metropolitan regions,        this responsibility is shared by a number of educational institutions.&nbsp; Major        research universities in the metropolitan Los Angeles region, for example,        include UCLA, USC, and Caltech, with UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine, UC        Riverside, and UC San Diego within close proximity.&nbsp; A host of other        institutions&mdash;public (several California State University campuses)        and private (Occidental College and the prestigious Claremont Colleges        and Claremont Graduate University)&mdash;complement these national universities. </font></p>      <p><font size="2">A comparison between the number of enrolled students          and number and variety of academic institutions in metropolitan Phoenix          and metropolitan Philadelphia, both with current populations of approximately          3.5 million, offers a glimpse of one dimension of the strategic situation          confronting ASU academically.&nbsp; In addition to a number of prestigious institutions        such as the University of Pennsylvania, Bryn Mawr College, Swarthmore        College, and Haverford College, 214,000 enrolled students in metropolitan        Philadelphia are able to choose from over thirty recognized educational        institutions.&nbsp; By contrast, metropolitan Phoenix, with approximately        180,000 enrolled students, supports few institutions apart from ASU and        the Maricopa Community College System. </font></p>      <p><font size="2">Metropolitan Phoenix lags behind the top cities in the          nation with the highest percentage of educational attainment in adults          aged 25 to 34.&nbsp; A        comparison between the number of college graduates as a percentage of        the adult population in such metropolitan areas as San Francisco-Oakland        (53.4 percent), Boston (51.2 percent), Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill (45.2        percent), Austin-San Marcos (38.9 percent), Denver-Boulder (38.1 percent),        Portland, Oregon (31 percent), and Phoenix (24.6 percent) reveals another        dimension of the challenge facing ASU as it prepares the workforce of        the region for the knowledge economy of the twenty-first century.</font><a href="endnotes.html#_ftn6"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp; </p>      <h2><strong>v.&nbsp; ASU&rsquo;s organizational structure is based on the          traditional academic model</strong></h2>      <p><font size="2">ASU is a relatively young but rapidly evolving institution          of higher education in the United States.&nbsp; Although ASU traces          its origins to the territorial teachers college established in Tempe          in the nineteenth century, its trajectory as a comprehensive research          university does not begin until 1958.<a href="endnotes.html#_ftn7"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp; The          present reconceptualization of the design of the university represents          the most recent stage in the continuing evolution of an institution.&nbsp; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">ASU is currently based on the traditional model for institutions          of higher education. Like most major research universities, the organization        of ASU is based on an historical prototype.&nbsp; The distinctively American        model of the research university came into being in the nineteenth century        when the German model of the elite scientific research institute offering        specialized graduate training was &ldquo;grafted&rdquo; onto the traditional        American undergraduate liberal arts college.&nbsp; Following the lead        of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, fifteen American institutions        came to define the American research university.<a href="endnotes.html#_ftn8"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp; Such        has been the influence of these fifteen institutions that, to this day,        every university in the nation measures itself according to their standards.&nbsp; Although        these universities represent the gold standard, it is the gold standard        of the past. These universities are considered definitive prototypes,        and their disciplinary departments are the departments by which all others        are judged.&nbsp; But because academic departments tend to structure        themselves to resemble the most highly ranked departments in their respective        disciplines, academic departments tend to resemble one another across        the nation.&nbsp; The model for the New American University proposes        a rethinking of the static organizational paradigms of American research        universities.</font></p>      <p><font size="2">Over the course of centuries universities became organized          into a rigidly codified hierarchy of academic departments based on          the traditional disciplinary affiliations of scholars.&nbsp; Knowledge does not fall within strict        disciplinary categories, yet American research universities maintain        an institutional organization that derives from the medieval academy.&nbsp; But        the traditional disciplinary organization of universities may not be        the optimal way to organize the institution, or to organize knowledge        itself, or to teach students, or to address the social, economic, and        technological challenges that face us.&nbsp; Although we build on the        bedrock of traditional disciplines, if we are to advance knowledge in        the face of its rapidly changing nature, and come to terms with the explosion        of new knowledge that characterizes the academy in recent decades, a        new and more fluid organization is urgently required.&nbsp; Because it        is no longer sufficient to neatly categorize knowledge into disciplinary-based        academic departments, the design of ASU must accommodate the establishment        of interdisciplinary research centers construed across the university.&nbsp; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">The design and implementation of new colleges and schools          and the rethinking and redesign of existing colleges and schools provides          opportunities to break out from the confines of traditional disciplinary          organization, and to actually build the kind of interdisciplinary programs          needed to institutionalize and implement intellectual fusion.&nbsp; And because        of external pressures of enrollment and demographic change, ASU will        have flexibility to better serve the needs of its many diverse constituencies.&nbsp; The        evolving design of ASU permits both internal flexibility and allows the        university to address the challenges and serve the needs of the region.</font></p>      <h2><strong>vi.&nbsp; ASU&rsquo;s operations are distributed over four primary          locations</strong></h2>      <p><font size="2">ASU is spatially distributed across the fourteenth most          populous metropolitan region in the nation.&nbsp; Although a single and unified institution,        the academic units comprising ASU are distributed across metropolitan        Phoenix in four differentiated &ldquo;academic complexes,&rdquo; i.e.,        campuses (&ldquo;One University in Many Places&rdquo;).&nbsp; In addition        to the historic Tempe campus, the university comprises two newer campuses        with more specialized missions:&nbsp; the West campus, in northwest Phoenix        adjacent to Glendale, and the Polytechnic campus, in Mesa.&nbsp; The        conceptualization and design of the Capital Center campus in downtown        Phoenix is presently underway.&nbsp; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">There are currently weak and uneven relationships between          and among the ASU campuses.&nbsp; ASU is a single institution with units geographically        distributed across metropolitan Phoenix.&nbsp; The present organization        of ASU, with a campus designated &ldquo;Main,&rdquo; two tiered secondary        campuses, and a nascent downtown campus, does not represent effective        planning, nor does it serve to advance the institution from its present        regional status to that of a national university.&nbsp; The current organization        of the university lacks clear definition of campus identities, and perpetuates        unnecessary duplication of programs and resources.&nbsp; The structure        of the university does not encourage interdisciplinary collaboration        of programs construed across the campuses.&nbsp; The present design discourages        the emergence of capable enterprise-building units. </font></p>      <p><font size="2">Consistent with the ABOR Changing Directions Initiative,          planning efforts by the administration of ASU led to the formation          of the University Design Team (UDT), charted to explore bold and innovative          thinking about how the university should prepare for its new and expanded          mission.&nbsp; UDT        has determined that the missions of each of the anchor campuses and the        extended campus must be redefined so that the sum of the parts will more        effectively and efficiently serve the expanded mission of ASU conceived        as a prototype New American University.&nbsp; As specified in the president&rsquo;s        concept paper &ldquo;Changing Directions&rdquo; (October 2003):&nbsp; </font></p>      <blockquote>        <p><font size="2">ASU must reorganize and focus the anchor campus offerings            as a means of increasing flexibility and coordination and promoting            beneficial synergies and cost effectiveness.&nbsp; It is already            clear that the plans will call for moving some programs from the            main campus to the east campus and perhaps the west campus, consolidating            some programs, redirecting some existing programs, developing some            new programs, and differentiating programs that are common to the            three anchor campuses.&nbsp;
