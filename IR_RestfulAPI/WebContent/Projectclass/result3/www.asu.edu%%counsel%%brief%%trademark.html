<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>In recent years, as the
popularity of collegiate sports<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>has
increased, so too has the demand for officially licensed university
memorabilia.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Such memorabilia may bear
not merely the University?s name, but may bear the University mascot, the University
nicknames, and the various logos and slogans associated with the University.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Officially licensed products earn billions in
revenue for American universities each year.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>In response to the growing
popularity of college athletics, many universities have developed trademark
licensing programs to ensure control over their names and marks, to ensure that
those marks are associated with quality goods and services, and to generate for
university programs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the earnings
reports indicate, the rewards from a successful licensing program can be
great.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, establishing a
successful program requires careful planning, implementation and
management.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A university has a
significant interest in protecting its name and public reputation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In order to facilitate successful licensing,
and to avoid awkward situations, the employees of a university should become
familiar with the fundamentals of trademark and licensing law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In particular, they should become aware of
certain measures that every university should take to protect that its
trademarks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><u>Trademark Law</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b>1.<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>         </span>Definition of Trademarks</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Trademarks and service marks
are the means by which the providers of goods and services identify and
distinguish their goods and services from those provided by others.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, consumers have come to associate
the golden arches design with McDonald's restaurants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>But a trademark or service mark
does more than just identify the origin of goods or services.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It conveys to consumers the quality and
desirability of the product or service bearing that mark.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because trademarks and service marks are
repeatedly seen by customers, they come to symbolize all of the things that an
institution is trying to convey to the public about its products or
services.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is referred to in the field
of trademark as the ?goodwill? associated with the institution.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This ?goodwill? or reputation is often one of
the most important assets of an institution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>A trademark or service mark encourages customers to continue to purchase
the marked products and services because of past favorable experiences
associated with those products and services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Thus, the value of a trademark
or service mark rests in its ability to promote customer loyalty and
goodwill.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This makes trademarks and
service marks of particular value to colleges and universities, which have
strong interests in enhancing their reputation among their communities, as well
as in generating revenue for their scholastic, research and athletic
programs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;page-break-after:avoid'><b>2.<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>         </span>Types of Trademarks</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>A trademark or service mark may
be a word, phrase, symbol, design, device, or a combination thereof.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because the law recognizes that colleges and
universities have a protectable property interest in their name and emblems,
these symbols can function as trademarks and service marks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Words such as &quot;<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Arizona</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>&quot; or
symbols like the distinctive ASU &quot;Sparky&quot; Sun Devil are examples of
trademarks in the context of collegiate sports.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Although many university
symbols traditionally are associated with athletic programs, the use of these
symbols is not limited to sports memorabilia.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>A university's name or logo can be affixed to a virtually unlimited list
of products.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The most traditional goods
to which University marks are affixed are clothing, cups and mugs, pencils and
calendars.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But in recent years, this
list has expanded to many less conventional promotional items, such as stuffed
animals, dolls, aprons, lamp shades, and telephones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>University symbols can also be
used as service marks to identify first and foremost the educational services
provided by the University, as well as its sponsorship of research and various
kinds of promotional events, from charitable fundraisers to college football
games. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><u>Trademark Licensing</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b>1.<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>         </span>The License</b> <b>Agreement</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>A trademark license agreement
is at the heart of any merchandising program, because it delineates the
relationship between the owner of a trademark (the licensor) and the producer
of the goods or services to which the mark is to be affixed (the licensee).<sup>2</sup><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Through a trademark license, the licensor,
such as a university, grants to the licensee the right to affix certain
products or services with the licensor's mark; in return, the licensor receives
some sort of monetary compensation, generally in the form of a royalty payment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The license itself may be
either written or verbal, but as with any formal agreement, it is in the
trademark owner's best interest to put the license in writing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Verbal agreements are much more likely to
have missing terms, and to lead later to a swearing match as to what each party
really intended.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is important that
the agreement clearly define the rights and responsibilities of the parties, so
that any future disagreements can be quickly and efficiently resolved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>A written license agreement
with well thought out terms can also help avoid disputes over whether or not
the license was intended to be exclusive in any regard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, an exclusive license may be
granted as to &quot;sportswear&quot; may or may not be intended to cover
headwear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Putting things down on paper
tends to force parties to focus on what each intends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b>2.<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>         </span>Reasons For Licensing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>There are many reasons for a
university to license its trademarks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A
university, particularly a large university, may enjoy public recognition as an
advanced institution of higher learning, research, and athletics.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That reputation, in turn, fosters a demand
among consumers for products bearing the university's name or logo.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Licensing programs serve to protect and
strengthen a university's reputation by ensuring that its marks appear only on
quality products and in connection with approved events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Moreover, whenever government
funding of academic institutions declines, collegiate licensing programs
provide a university with a source of supplemental income - income that can be
used to fund the institution's academic and athletic programs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That income can come from unlikely
places--many universities find that goods bearing their marks generate
substantial revenues in certain foreign countries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>With the advent of the Internet
and video-on-demand sites like ?Youtube,? the trade symbols used in American
universities are more likely than ever to be seen in other countries.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is likely to add to consumer demand for
certain marked products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><u>Establishing a Successful
Trademark Licensing Program</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Trademark licenses are
essentially transfers of property rights, and therefore must be accomplished
with great care.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A licensor must have
the ability to control which products or events are identified with its marks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Without that control, a trademark can lose
the goodwill associated with it, and be considered &quot;abandoned.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Every licensing agreement
should be tailored to meet the particular needs and responsibilities
anticipated by each licensing arrangement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>However, there are certain provisions that should be universal to every
agreement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The following discussion
examines four of the more critical elements of any licensing program: quality
control, preventing infringement, keeping records, and termination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b>1.<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>         </span>Registering Your Marks <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>In order to have a successful
licensing program, it is important to obtain appropriate protection.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This includes registering your important
marks, particularly at the federal level.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>By obtaining a federal registration from the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> and Patent and
Trademark Office, this provides the institution with the legal presumption that
it has the exclusive right to use the mark nationwide, in connection with the
goods or services for which the mark is registered.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A federal registration also provides additional
remedies in the event of infringement, such as increased monetary awards and
reimbursement for attorneys? fees in certain cases, in addition to access to
the federal courts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Federal registration
also allows the trademark owner to use the ® designation to put others on
notice as to trademark ownership and registration.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The ® designation can only be used after
federal registration is complete ? up and until then you can use the ?
designation with the mark as used in connection with goods, and <sup><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-no-proof:yes'>SM</span></sup><span
style='mso-no-proof:yes'> in connection with services.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally, it is also important to register
appropriate domain names associated with the institution?s marks, both
offensively in order to secure the rights to these domain names, and
defensively to prevent infringing parties from using them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b>2.<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>         </span>The Selection of New Marks<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Selecting new names, logos,
designs, phrases and other marks can be an effective method of increasing
licensing revenue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, prior to
using any such new marks, it is important that the new marks be searched and
analyzed by an attorney, to help ensure that the new marks are protectable, and
that they are not infringing upon any third parties? rights.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A trademark search today can be well worth
its cost over time, in helping to avoid the prospect of costly trademark
disputes down the road.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region></st1:place>
adherence to the Madrid Protocol, it became even more important to conduct
searches broadly and to schedule follow up searches.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is much easier now for residents of the
60+ other Madrid Protocol countries to apply for trademark registrations in the
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Consequently, the danger has increased that
following the date when a search is conducted by a university for a particular
mark, that a foreign applicant for the same or a similar mark might claim
priority through a later filed application that relates back six months.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b>3.<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>         </span>Executing Appropriate License Agreements<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The university also needs
appropriate, written license agreements to govern the relationship with its
licensees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The license agreements should
clearly set forth the rights granted to the licensee, as well as the
limitations of those rights.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For
example, the license agreement should specify the types of goods or services
covered, and whether or not the license is exclusive, and should set forth
quality control obligations, and the scope, territory and duration of the
license, the structure of the license fees, criteria for appropriate use of the
marks, as well as conditions for termination and (if applicable) renewal, among
other terms and conditions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
university also needs to be careful in selecting appropriate licensees that
will produce quality goods or services, that will generate sufficient revenues,
and that will represent the university well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>After all, their products will be bearing the university?s names and marks,
and with it the reputation and goodwill of the university.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b>4. <span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>        </span>The Importance of Quality Control</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The success of any licensing
arrangement relies on the licensor's ability to control the nature and quality
of the goods or services bearing its name or emblem.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The value of a trademark depends upon the
goodwill it fosters in consumers, who associate that mark with the quality of
the service or product it identifies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
the licensor does not exercise control over the manner in which the mark is
used, then the value of the mark as an indicator of quality is lost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>A significant part of trademark
control can be achieved by carefully drafting the license agreement to protect
the university's interests.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The
agreement should require the licensee to provide the university with representative
samples of all licensed products for approval prior to their sale or
distribution. In addition, the university should be allowed to inspect the
licensee's facilities on a regular basis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Finally, the university should retain the right to approve of all
artwork developed by the licensee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Of course, contractual
provisions alone will not guarantee that a university's marks are being used
only with quality merchandise - the university itself must take affirmative
steps to exert direct control over the licensee.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In part, this means sticking to the
provisions in the licensing agreement: conducting regular inspections, and
requiring written confirmation that quality control procedures have been
implemented.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Exerting control can also
entail additional activities such as providing the licensee with guidelines for
the proper use of the mark, and conducting periodic checks of the
marketplace.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Visiting retailers, for
example, can help to ensure that the university's name and logos are being used
on the appropriate products with approved designs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>These and other general tips
for developing a quality control program are summarized in Appendix 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;page-break-after:avoid'><b>5.<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>         </span>University Standards for Use and Codes
of Conduct<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Universities need to establish
standards or manuals that govern uses of their marks by licensees.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This ensures that marks are used properly and
consistently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Universities are also increasingly
creating various type of codes of conduct for their licensees, and/or for other
companies with university contracts. Codes of conduct may include, for example,
provisions to ensure certain minimum standards for the workers manufacturing
the licensee?s products.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Indeed, there
has been a growing trend toward enforcement of minimum standards for the labor
conditions of licensees in the collegiate licensing context.<sup>3</sup><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These considerations, and any related
university codes of conduct, also play a role in choosing the appropriate
licensees, and in drafting and enforcing the university?s trademark license
agreements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>University codes of conduct
have recently been extended to try to negotiate uses by students and University
personnel of domain names that incorporate University marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b>6.<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>         </span>Preventing Unauthorized Use of Trademarks</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The most common way in which
rights to a trademark or service mark can be lost is by failing to prevent use
of the mark by unauthorized parties.<sup>4</sup><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Such unauthorized use is a form of trademark
infringement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Allowing infringement to
continue can mean not only the loss of control over the trademark, but a loss
of income as well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Manufacturers will be
unwilling to pay royalties to a university if that university allows others to
use the mark for free.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>There are several steps a
university can take to protect itself against unauthorized use.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As suggested above, a university should conduct
market checks to detect unauthorized use of its trademarks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A university should enlist the assistance of
its licensees as well; a licensing agreement may obligate a licensee to provide
the university with written notice of any infringement it encounters in the
marketplace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Once it discovers evidence of
unauthorized use, a university's course of action should depend upon the extent
of the infringement, and the threat it represents to the institution's
licensing program.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With first-time
infringement, it may be in the university's best interest, subject to the
reputation of the infringer and the circumstances of the infringement, to give
some infringers, where appropriate, the opportunity to take a license with the
university.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some first-time infringers may
have innocently used the university's mark, and if the infringer can provide a
quality product, the university will gain a new licensee for its merchandising
program.<sup>6</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Policing sometimes requires
educational institutions to face off against one another.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Universities find themselves often in the
uncomfortable position of making high school districts cease copycat uses of
the University?s marks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example in
October 2006, the <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Wisconsin</st1:PlaceName> challenged use of the W by a school
district in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iowa</st1:place></st1:State>,
claiming that the school district?s W was nearly identical to the University?s
logo.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From 2003 to 2006, the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Wisconsin</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> was reported to have stopped
20 school districts to cease use of copycat logos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Continued unauthorized use of a
university's trademarks, however, may warrant a different approach.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cease and desist letters or even litigation
may become necessary to prevent further harm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Of course, if a dispute with an infringer reaches this stage, a
university should seek assistance of legal counsel.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are a number of legal remedies
available to stop unauthorized use of one?s trademarks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is particularly true today with the
continuing development of trademark laws over the past decade, which, for
example, have created new causes of action for trademark owners such as
trademark dilution and cybersquatting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>For a discussion of some recent cases brought by universities against
infringers, see Appendix 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b>7.<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>         </span>Keeping Records</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>It is important for a
university to keep accurate records of its correspondence with its licensees.
If a licensee has failed to comply with the terms of the license, all efforts
by the university to obtain compliance should be documented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Record keeping is also
important within the context of infringement, as discussed above.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All correspondence with infringers, including
initial contacts and demand letters, should be kept on file by the
university.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If further action or
litigation becomes necessary, this documentation will provide proof that the
university has consistently tried to stop the infringement, and has not
abandoned its marks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Record keeping is
also important in documented proof in infringement actions (for example, proof
of consumer confusion), and in monitoring licensees for compliance with the
university?s quality control standards and code of conduct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b>8.<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>         </span>Terminating a Licensing Agreement</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Because a university must
maintain quality control standards and its code of conduct, it is important for
the university to be able to cancel the licensing agreement due to the
licensee's nonperformance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The license
agreement should contain a revocation provision, granting to the university the
right to terminate the agreement after reasonable notice (usually 30 to 60
days).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Universities should be wary of
automatic renewal provisions or provisions that make termination by them as
licensor more procedurally difficult or complicated.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Licensees who are underperforming will try to
rely upon failure to adhere strictly to such provisions in order to try to avoid
termination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Termination provisions should
also make it clear that the licensee's rights to use the marks, or to refer to
the prior licensing relationship, cease upon termination of the agreement.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The licensee should be required to report to
the university its inventory of licensed merchandise at regular intervals, as
well as at termination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many licensing
agreements permit licensees to sell their remaining inventory for a brief
period after termination; however, the agreement should require the ex-licensee
to return or destroy any unsold merchandise after this period has ended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Social issues often affect
licensing programs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There may be new
cultural issues that arise with respect to certain licensed items or
words.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Words or terms that may have been
previously non-controversial when introduced may become unacceptable as
cultural norms change.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Stanford</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> changed from Indian to
Cardinal, and some other high schools and colleges also did so.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Washington Redskins? professional football
team mark continues to be the focus of ongoing litigation in 2007.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the conditions where licensed products are
manufactured becomes the focus of social and political activists, so too will
the beneficiaries of sales or such manufactured goods.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The most popular goods licensed by
universities, particularly apparel, are increasingly become the source of
controversy because the conditions of manufacture in third world countries,
where many licensed goods are made, are perceived by social activists to be
repressive or unfair.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hence, in
selecting licensees, universities must also now consider the conditions under
which licensed goods will be manufactured, as well as any ongoing efforts by
other universities, or group of universities, to affect that conditions at
factories producing logoed items, such as clothing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the licensing agreement itself,
universities may include provisions that try to be protective of the conditions
for those workers who will help create the licensed goods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;page-break-after:avoid'><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The continued popularity of
college athletics, along with an increasing number of potential licensors and
licensees, should ensure the expansion of collegiate trademark licensing in the
years to come.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Revenue and enhanced reputation
are just two of the benefits to universities entering into licensing
programs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, these benefits can
take time to accrue, and a university runs the risk of losing its rights in its
marks along the way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A carefully
constructed licensing program, and active control over the use of its marks,
are a university's best means of avoiding the pitfalls and reaping fully the
many rewards of trademark licensing.</p>

SOME RECENT RELEVANT CASE LAW AS COMPILED BY STEVE LAWRENCE AND GLENN BACAL<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Board of Supervisors of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and
Agricultural and Mechanical College, et al., v. Smack Apparel Co.</u>, 438 F.
Supp. 2d 653 (<st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">N.D. La.</st1:address></st1:Street>
2006).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this case, defendant Smack Apparel was sued by four
universities and their licensing agent, Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC) for
unfair competition, based on Smack?s design and sale of shirts in connection
with major football bowl games.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The four
universities -- the <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Oklahoma</st1:PlaceName>, <st1:City w:st="on">Louisiana State
 University</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State> State University,
and the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Southern California</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> --
claimed that Smack had infringed on their trademarks by selling shirts bearing
the distinctive two colors used by each university, along with other symbols
which identify each university.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For
example, in connection with the 2004 Sugar Bowl BCS National Championship Game,
Smack created shirts for fans of both teams, in maroon and white for <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Oklahoma</st1:State></st1:place> and purple and
gold for LSU, with slogans proclaiming each school?s claim for the national
championship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Smack made similar shirts
for USC and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Ohio</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> fans that same season.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The universities and CLC prevailed on their unfair
competition claims at the summary judgment stage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Oklahoma</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
also prevailed on its companion trademark infringement claim based on a family
of ?OU? registered trademarks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While
there was no doubt that Smack?s shirts referred to the universities, making likelihood
of confusion almost a foregone conclusion, it is significant that the Court
found each school had protectable trademark rights in their two-color schemes,
based on longstanding use and association with each university (all four
schools had been using their particular colors for athletic contests since at
least 1895).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, this case demonstrates that universities with
prominent athletic programs -- likely including, at least, all schools in the
major athletic conferences (Big Ten, Big 12, Big East, SEC, ACC, Pac-10) -- can
seek protection under the Lanham Act against infringers who seek to use the
university?s colors to create a false association between themselves and the
university?s athletic teams.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><u>Texas</u></st1:PlaceName><u> <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Tech</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>
v. Spiegelberg</u>, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2006 WL 3190278 (N.D. <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Tex.</st1:place></st1:State> Nov. 2, 2006).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this case, defendant Spiegelberg operated two retail
stores under the name ?Red Raider Outfitters,? which primarily sold Texas Tech
Red Raider apparel and novelties.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
two stores were located in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Lubbock</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>, home of Texas Tech, with
the main store located across the street from the Texas Tech main campus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spiegelberg had been a longstanding licensee of the
university, authorized to sell Texas Tech-related goods until 2003, when his
license was terminated because of his failure to account for the university?s
royalties.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, Spiegelberg
continued to sell Texas Tech-related goods after the termination of his
license.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many of these goods bore Texas
Tech trademarks, including the ?Double T? mark, the ?Masked Rider,? the ?Raider
Red? character, and the red and black color scheme commonly affiliated with
Texas Tech?s athletic teams.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court had no trouble finding these marks to be deserving
of strong protection, and found in favor of the university on all claims.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In particular, the court found that
Spiegelberg was liable not only for trademark infringement and unfair
competition, but also for trademark dilution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>This finding necessarily implies a finding by the court that the
university?s marks, or at least some of them, were ?famous? and therefore
deserving of protection from dilution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
</span>Unfortunately, the court does not discuss the issue of the fame of the
marks at all, leaving the finding of dilution possibly open to further legal
challenge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is particularly significant here was the broad damages
award granted to the university, which included Spiegelberg?s full gross
profits for 2004 through October 2005, as well as a reasonable royalty (8%) on
same.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This award was in part because
Spiegelberg failed to present any evidence that any portion of his gross sales
was not related to the infringing use of Texas Tech?s marks, and because of
Spiegelberg?s status as a former licensee and willful infringer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court further awarded Texas Tech its reasonable
attorney?s fees, finding that Spiegelberg was fully aware that his license had
expired in 2003, and had continued to willfully and deliberately infringe on
Texas Tech?s trademarks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This case therefore
shows that very broad remedies are available under the Lanham Act against
former licensees who refuse to stop producing trademarked goods after a license
has expired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><u>Villanova</u></st1:PlaceName><u>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></u></st1:place><u> v.
Villanova Alumni Educational Foundation, Inc</u>., 123 F. Supp. 2d 293 (E.D.
Pa. 1999).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In another case involving a former licensee, <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Villanova</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> sought, and was granted, a
preliminary injunction preventing a disaffiliated alumni group from using any
of the university?s trademarks, or its new name ?Villanova Alumni Education
Foundation.?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This alumni organization got its start as an alumni-founded
group dedicated to raising financial support for Villanova?s athletic
programs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With the approval of the
university, it operated under the name ?Wildcat Club.?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the university dropped its football program
(which it later reinstated), the relationship with the organization soured, and
eventually terminated with the university asking the organization to cease all
use of university trademarks, including ?Villanova? and ?Villanova Wildcats,?
among others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shortly after its disaffiliation, the organization changed
its corporate name to ?Villanova Alumni Education Foundation,? and continued to
make use of university trademarks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
part, the organization argued that it was not infringing because it prominently
used the word ?Alumni,? both differentiating it from the university and
correctly identifying its own origin (it had been founded by Villanova
alumni).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court disagreed, and
granted preliminary injunctive relief against the organization.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Significantly, this case held that a former licensee such as
this alumni organization is held to a higher standard of conduct with respect
to use of the <a name=KItmp></a>trademarks of the former licensor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is because the public is easily confused
into thinking that the ex-licensee?s relationship with the licensor university
continues in good standing even when the license has been terminated.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court noted in particular the possible
confusion of donors who, erroneously thinking that their donations would go to
the university, might give money to the alumni organization.</p>
