Transferring ASCII Files to ASU UNIX Server, Should I use Disk or Email?
</center></h2>
<p>
Question:<br>
Would it be better to get my ASCII data files from another institution to 
my Stats account on a disk or via email?
<p><oul> 
<li>The easiest way is to have the data files transferred to a temporary area
on AFS e.g to /afs/asu.edu/xfer/ and then you have upto three days to move
them from there.  The drawback, is that you will need to give the other party
your userid and password to your Stats account.  However, you can change
your password as soon the files have been transferred.
<p> 
<li>Mail may not be be a suitable option for the following reasons:
<p> <ol>
<li>There is limitation as to how big the mail attachment can be.  I believe
Pine on the Stats server allows for file sizes upto 2 megabytes.
<li>The files will need to be encoded before sending and then decoded after
receiving.  The encoding and decoding need to done by utilities that
are for the same operating system.
<li>If the files are over 2 megs, they can be compressed (before decoding) to
reduce the file size before sending and then uncompressed after receiving.
The compression and decompression will need to done by utilities that are
also on the same operating system.
</ol><p> 
If you decide to go with this option.  You may also want to contact the
email consultants who are more knowledgable in this area.  Their email address
is "email-q@asu.edu".
<p> 
<li>The third option is to send the data files on an external storage 
media such as on a floppy, zip disk, or CDROM.  The media
should be one that can be used with your personal computer or one in the
computer sites.  The files can then be transferred to your Stats 
account via FTP.
</ol>
