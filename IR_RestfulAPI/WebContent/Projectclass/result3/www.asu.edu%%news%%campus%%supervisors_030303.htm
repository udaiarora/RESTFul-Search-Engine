      <h2>Council, Crow honor top ASU supervisors</h2>
      <p>        Great supervisors create a positive working environment by opening the
          lines of communication, and by encouraging employees to be their best.
        Ultimately, such supervisors are able to elevate morale and productivity.</p>
      <p>The
            2003 Outstanding Supervisor Awards ceremony, sponsored by ASU's Classified
          Staff Council (CSC), honored 10 ASU supervisors on Feb. 20 at the University
          Club for their outstanding work. </p>
      <p>ASU President Michael Crow presented
          the awards and said supervisors serve a crucial role at ASU.</p>
      <p>"Success for an organization is only possible
          when there is mutual respect between supervisor and staff," Crow said.
          "And what better measure of
          success is there for a supervisor than to be honored by your own employees.
          It means so much coming from them because they are the people who really
          know you."</p>
      <p>Deirdre Irvine, library supervisor, senior, serves as chairwoman
          of the CSC staff development committee, and said having a good supervisor
          can
          make even the most challenging job assignment seem manageable.</p>
      <p>Recently
          Irvine and a small group of volunteers sifted through 69 Outstanding
          Supervisor Award nominations and narrowed the group down to 10 winners.</p>
      <p>"It
          was definitely encouraging reading the nominations," Irvine said. "Each
          one was heartfelt and sincere and we had difficulty paring it down."</p>
      <p>Irvine
          said the nomination forms most often cited compassion and communication
          skills as the most compelling reasons a supervisor was outstanding. </p>
      <p>Lynne
          Kincaid, business manager for the Office of Research/Sponsored Projects,
          says she first learned of the honor when she was surprised
          during a staff meeting.</p>
      <p>"My staff arranged for Deirdre Irvine to surprise
          me with the announcement of my selection at a regularly scheduled managers
          meeting," Kincaid said.
          "All of the other managers in attendance knew of the upcoming announcement,
          so, of course, I was the only one completely startled by the sudden
        knocking at the door. What a wonderful surprise." </p>
      <p>Kincaid said she was thankful
          not only for the award, but also for being able to work with such a
        terrific staff.</p>
      <p>"As a supervisor, I cannot take
          credit for the wonderful work ethic that my staff hold and the professionalism
          they bring to ASU," Kincaid says.
          "It is always enjoyable to celebrate special times such as these with
          the people we work closest with. I respect and admire my teammates.
        This is a wonderful experience."</p>
      <p>CSC President Pam Mulhearn said this year's
          outstanding supervisors are examples to others that a good relationship
          with staff can create a happy,
        cooperative, productive unit. </p>
      <p>"These supervisors are important to ASU
          because a supervisor can make all the difference in staff members'
        performance," Mulhearn said. "Generally
          when people are happy and satisfied within their units, their positive
          attitudes shine through in their work and maybe even become contagious,
        ultimately benefiting the customers of the university."</p>
      <p>Linda Sullivan,
        executive coordinator, Student Development &amp; Memorial
      Union/Student Affairs, said she appreciated the award tremendously.</p>
      <p>"It
          is truly one of the highlights of my professional career," Sullivan
        said. "I feel very fortunate to work with wonderful, talented people
          who enjoy doing what they do. It is a pleasure to be in their company
        every day. Receiving this honor is really the icing on the cake." </p>
      <p>Kevin
        Cook, director and associate dean for Residential Life &amp; Student
      Development, said he is extremely surprised he was nominated.</p>
      <p>"I am filled
          with tremendous joy and gratitude to be appreciated by staff," Cook
        said. "As a supervisor, my goal is to value the entire person -
          not just the professional, but the personal as well. Clearly, the two
        are inextricable."</p>
      <p>In addition to Kincaid, Sullivan, and Cook, this year's
        Outstanding Supervisors are: Sharon Bushart, technology support analyst
        coordinator, Liberal
        Arts &amp; Sciences; Traci Helwig, business manager, senior, W. P. Carey
        School of Business; Kathryn Kilroy, executive director, KAET/ASSET; Jim
        Newell, shop supervisor, Facilities Management; Cynthia O'Neil, business
        operations manager, Electrical Engineering; Kern Poyner, manager, Information
      Technology, KAET; and Marjorie Zatz, associate dean, Graduate College.</p>
      <p>Each
          award winner received a personalized desk clock and a gift certificate
          donated by a local sponsor. For information about the 2003 Outstanding
        Supervisor Awards and to read nomination comments, go to (www.asu.edu/csc).</p>
