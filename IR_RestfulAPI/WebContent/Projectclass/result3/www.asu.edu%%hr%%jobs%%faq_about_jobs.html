				Questions about getting a job at ASU.</B></FONT></P> 
			 <p><B>Where can I get a job
			 application?</B><BR> 
			 <BR>
			 Arizona State University DOES NOT use job
			 applications. The University relies strictly on cover letters, resumes, and
			 references for its application process. Refer to the "TO APPLY" section on the
			 Vacancy Notice to see what materials that particular department is requesting
			 applicants to submit.<BR> 
			 <BR> 
			 <B>What if I want to teach at ASU?</B><BR> 
			 <BR>
			 If you are interested in teaching at ASU, you need to contact each department
			 directly. For example, if you are interested in teaching Economics, you would
			 contact the Economics Department directly to see if there are any open faculty
			 positions.<BR> 
			 <BR> 
			 <B>Where do I send my resume?</B><BR> 
			 <BR> 
			 Approximately
			 65% of the Departments at Arizona State University at the Tempe campus,  at the Polytechnic campus, and  at the Downtown Phoenix campus, request that
			 applicants send their materials (cover letter, resume, references, etc.)
			 through the Human Resources Department located on ASU's main campus (ASU West
			 has a separate Human Resources Department which handles their hiring). However,
			 the remaining 35% request that applicants send their materials directly to the
			 department advertising the opening. This request is indicated at the bottom of
			 each and every vacancy notice. Please make sure to direct your materials to the
			 correct department.<BR> 
			 <BR> 
			 <B>How do I put together a resume for an ASU
			 position?</B><BR> 
			 <BR>
      For online assistance please go to <A HREF="../resource_center/Resume_coverletter.html">Resume/Cover 
      Letter</A>. ASU now offers a one hour session, once a month on Thursdays 
      from 3:30 pm - 4:30 pm, entitled "Understanding the ASU Hiring Process". 
      The class includes suggestions and information on preparing a resume for 
      ASU employment for classified, service professional and administrative staff. 
      To register, email <A HREF="mailto:HRstaffingservices@asu.edu">HRstaffingservices@asu.edu</A>. 
      Please include your name and phone number in your email. Registration confirmation 
      will be emailed to you and will include the date and location of the class.<BR> 
      <BR>
      <B>Can I email my resume?</B><BR> 
      <BR>
      Yes, if the job notice
			 requests that your materials be sent to the Human Resources Department, you can
			 submit your resume as an email attachment to resumes@asu.edu . Include the Job
			 number (SR#) on your resume. Type "Resume" in the subject line of the message
			 box. <BR>
			 <BR>
			 If the job notice requests that you materials be sent to the
			 department directly, they may or may not specify an email address for resumes
			 to be sent to. Note: if resumes are to be sent directly to the department, do
			 not email them to the Human Resources Department.<BR> 
			 <BR> 
			 <B>Where do I get
			 the name of the contact person to whom I should address my cover letter, resume
			 and references?</B><BR> 
			 <BR> 
			 The Human Resources Department at ASU DOES NOT
			 have this information. If this information has not been provided at the bottom
			 of the Vacancy Notice, please contact the department advertising the opening
			 directly OR simply address your materials Dear Hiring Coordinator OR Attention
			 Selection Committee.<BR> 
			 <BR> 
			 <B>Will I be contacted regarding my resume?<BR>
			 </B><BR> 
			 (A) If the Department selects you for an interview, you will be
			 contacted. (B) If you participated in an interview, and were not chosen for the
			 position, you will be sent a rejection letter from the Department that
			 interviewed you. Otherwise, it is the Department's decision as to whether or
			 not to notify applicants who fall outside of categories A and B.<BR> 
			 <BR>
			 <B>How do I find out the status of my resume?</B><BR> 
			 <BR> 
			 If the Department
			 advertising the opening has requested that applicants' resumes be sent to the
			 Human Resources Department, the resumes will be held in Human Resources until
			 the closing date indicated at the top of the Vacancy Notice. Once the
			 Department has received the resumes from Human Resources, it then takes
			 approximately 2 to 3 weeks for candidates selected for an interview to be
			 notified. If you want to speak to someone sooner regarding your resume, you
			 must contact the department advertising the opening directly, and request to
			 speak to the hiring coordinator.</p>
			 <p><strong>How do I self-disclose information for the University's Affirmative Action Plan?</strong></p>
			 <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <font size="3">ASU offers applicants an opportunity to voluntarily self-disclose information for the University's affirmative action plan; applicants may complete an EEO survey for the position(s) to which the applicant is applying at <a href="http://www.eoaa.asu.edu/aa_EEO_Survey.asp">http://www.eoaa.asu.edu/aa_EEO_Survey.asp</a></font>  </p></TD>
