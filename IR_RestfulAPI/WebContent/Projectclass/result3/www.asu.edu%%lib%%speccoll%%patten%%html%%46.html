This English translation of Gesner's Latin work on distillation,
 the plants to be distilled, and their cures, is a well known work
 published originally in 1554.  Konrad Gesner used scientific
 methods in his study and was probably the first to discover many
 new species which are now credited to Clusius, Bauhin, and others.
 Gesner, born in Zurich, Switzerland, was a renowned man of
 learning who wrote about medicine, mineralogy, and zoology as
 well as botany.  He is remembered as one of the greatest of the
 16th century naturalists as well as the bibliographer of the famous
 <I>Bibliotheca Universalis.  The New Jewell of Health</I> focuses
 primarily on the distillation process, and its lengthy subtitle give
 further insight into its contents "wherein is contayned ...
 the best approved remedies for
 the diseases as well inwarde and outward, of all the partes of
 mans bodie: treating very amplye of all Dystillations of Waters,
 of Oyles, Balmes, Quintessences, with the extraction of artificiall
 Saltes, the use and preparation of Antimonie, and potable Gold."
