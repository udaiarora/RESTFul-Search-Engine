          <h2>New ASU Book Provides Insight Into the Cases that Shaped First Amendment Law</h2>
          <p><em>&ldquo;Defending the First&rdquo; brings together the major legal figures of this era who litigated the landmark cases before the U.S. Supreme Court</em></p>
          <p>A federal judge orders <em>New York Times</em> reporter Judith Miller jailed for contempt of court for refusing to testify to a grand jury investigating the leak of a CIA operative&rsquo;s name.</p>
          <p>In a unanimous decision the U.S. Supreme Court rules that Internet file-sharing services can be held responsible for violating copyright law if they intend for their customers to use software primarily to swap songs and movies illegally.</p>
          <p>These high-profile First Amendment cases, which transpired this summer, illustrate that the fight over civil liberties in this country carries on. </p>
          <p>A new book edited by Joseph Russomanno, associate professor in the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at ASU, sheds light on these contemporary cases by re-examining some of the most important and influential U.S. Supreme Court First Amendment cases of this era.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Defending the First: Commentary on First Amendment Issues and Cases&rdquo; offers a collection of new perspectives on the First Amendment in legal and mass communication contexts. Russomanno brings together major figures who have helped shape First Amendment law over the past 40 years.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;This book contributes an understanding of First Amendment issues and the types of expression that it protects, and why protection of these rights is important in a participatory, self-governing democracy,&rdquo; Russomanno says. &ldquo;In addition, it provides readers with the unique perspective of those who have been on the front lines of these cases.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>The contributors to this volume &ndash; all of who have litigated cases before the U.S. Supreme Court &ndash; tell about their experiences at the highest court in America.</p>
          <p>In her foreword, Nadine Strossen, president of the American Civil Liberties Union, writes: &ldquo;In addition to reminding us about the constant need to refight old free speech battles in new factual contexts and new historical circumstances, &lsquo;Defending the First&rsquo; also reminds us that free speech is constantly threatened by many strategies. The fight for free speech is one that must invoke not only First Amendment law, which directly constrains only government conduct, but also the more general values that underlie the First Amendment, cherishing the free flow of ideas and information and resisting any inhibition by anyone, including private-sector actors.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Noted attorneys who contribute book chapters include Jerome Barron, the Harold H. Green Professor of Law at George Washington University; Rodney Smolla, dean of the University of Richmond School of Law; and Marjorie Heins, founding director of the Free Expression Policy Project at the NYU School of Law Brennan Center for Justice.</p>
          <p>The authors reflect on landmark First Amendment cases, including:</p>
          <p>&bull; Cohen v. Cowles Media Co., which held that media organizations whose agents promise anonymity to a source must keep their word </p>
          <p>&bull; Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, a ruling that resulted in a Florida law on access to the media being ruled unconstitutional.</p>
          <p>&bull; Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District, which stated that school officials cannot infringe on their students&rsquo; right to free speech expression when it does not interfere with school order.</p>
          <p>&bull; R.A.V. v. St. Paul and Virginia v. Black, which concluded that statutes outlawing cross burning were unconstitutional.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Can the law be written to control behavior without violating the First Amendment?&rdquo; Russomanno asks. &ldquo;I always tell my students that the laws can be the problem. Just because you are charged with violating the laws doesn&rsquo;t mean the challenge is over.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Russomanno, also author of &ldquo;Speaking Our Minds: Conversations with the People Behind Landmark First Amendment Cases,&rdquo; considers himself a lifelong &ldquo;student of the law.&rdquo; He believes that any constitutional right has its limits, and understanding where the limits are drives his research, which focuses on mass communication law.</p>
          <p>Russomanno sees several major issues sharing the legal spotlight.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;The debate over whether reporters have a constitutional right to protect their sources will continue and fuel discussions about the need for a federal shield law,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The Internet and the future of communication technology, as Paul Smith and John Morris Jr. address in the last two chapters of &lsquo;Defending the First,&rsquo; will no doubt pose new challenges to the First Amendment and protected speech.&rdquo;</p>
