      <h2>Survivor says success due to family, friends </h2>
      <p>As 23-year-old Joshua Kolsrud graduated this week with a bachelor's degree in management from the W. P. Carey School of Business, he is filled with optimism. His confidence is not due to his 3.95 grade-point average or his extensive group of friends, but to the fact he has already proven himself to be a survivor. </p>
      <p>When many of his classmates were fighting to juggle their part-time jobs and social lives with term papers and exams, Kolsrud was fighting for the chance to keep on living. </p>
      <p>Kolsrud says it wasn't always that way. There was a time he was a typical college student. </p>
      <p>"There was a time I was into my looks, working out a lot, had good grades and felt invincible," Kolsrud says. "But, I got a big reality check that fateful night." </p>
      <p>It was the night of Feb. 13, 2002, when Kolsrud and two friends decided to attend the Mardi Gras festivities on Mill Avenue. When leaving a nightclub, a man stabbed Kolsrud, cutting through the nerves and arteries of his left upper arm so deeply it was nearly severed. </p>
      <p>While the assailant fled, Kolsrud's friends realized the gravity of his injury, tried to slow the horrific bleeding, put him into their car and raced to Tempe St. Luke's Hospital. </p>
      <p>Kolsrud was later rushed by helicopter to Maricopa Medical Center, and doctors, fearing he had lost too much blood, seriously doubted he would live through the night. His parents were counseled to prepare themselves for the worst. </p>
      <p>After a 16-hour surgery, and almost a month in the hospital, his doctors were amazed by his miraculous recovery. But, those who knew Kolsrud best were not the least bit surprised by his resolute will to survive. </p>
      <p>Hoskie Largo, a disability specialist with ASU Disability Resources, has known Kolsrud since 2001 and says his friend has been blessed with resiliency, fortitude and character. </p>
      <p>"He has a quiet determination, a positive attitude and a good sense of independence that will serve him well in his promising future," Largo says. </p>
      <p>Though Kolsrud has lost feeling and use of his left arm, he has adapted well and says his harrowing experience has taught him a great deal. </p>
      <p>"I have been given this wonderful gift as a result of the stabbing," Kolsrud says. "I find myself taking more time to enjoy the little things in life, things I used to take for granted. I know now that I absolutely love life, and realize how precious it is." </p>
      <p>This life affirming realization has served him well, getting him through extensive physical therapy, which continues twice a week to this day. </p>
      <p>Largo, who considers Kolsrud the perfect role model, says education comes in all forms and many of the most important lessons for life are experienced outside of the classroom. </p>
      <p>"These life lessons learned, though painful, can create positive change not only in the individual but within the communities we choose to live and work," Largo says. "I'm sure Joshua is a role model to someone and has provoked some positive change without even realizing it." </p>
      <p>As he graduates, Kolsrud says he is filled with a deep sense of gratitude. </p>
      <p>"The reason I'm here today, the reason for me surviving, the reason for my habitual optimism, I owe to my family and friends," he says. "I'm so grateful for my family and friends, Kenny Lange, Justin Schmitt, Melissa Alvarez, Shannon Beily and Sara Sandler." </p>
      <p>Kolsrud is continuing his education, and plans to earn concurrent degrees in law and bioethics. </p>
      <p>"One of my goals when I come out of law school is to write policy for stem cell legislation, lobby bioethical issues and be involved in politics," he says. "I hope my efforts will help many people." </p>
