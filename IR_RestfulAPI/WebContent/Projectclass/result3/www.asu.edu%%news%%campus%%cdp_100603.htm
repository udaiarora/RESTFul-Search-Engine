      <h2>Serving Arizona's needs key as ASU evolves: Year-long planning process
      underway</h2>
      <p>        Becoming "One University - In Many Places" is the goal as ASU embarks
          on preparing a comprehensive development plan to support the eventual
        doubling of the population of metropolitan Phoenix.</p>
      <p>"With ever-increasing
          quality students coming to ASU, we're having a difficult time keeping
          up with demand for what ASU has to offer," says
          President Michael Crow. "There are about 100,000 people per year moving
          into central Arizona, and they are coming with children, relatives
        and expectations for a quality education." </p>
      <p>The process of building a comprehensive
          development plan for ASU will involve detailed analysis of all four
        campus sites, focusing on issues
          related to transportation, university access, blending university learning
          facilities with non-university facilities, and blending the university
          into its surrounding towns and cities.</p>
      <p>Crow kicked off the process with
          a presentation Sept. 26 to about 400 faculty, staff and students. The
          endeavor will take about a year and
            will include some 80 focus group sessions with various internal and
            external constituencies. The planning process also has been presented
            by Crow
            to the Arizona Board of Regents. Crow says it's important to define
            ASU as a niche so it becomes something other than one of the 200
        or so indistinguishable
            higher education institutions that people have a hard time remembering.
            ASU, Crow says, will be remembered because we have been able to accomplish
            in the next decade or two the following three things:</p>
      <p>. Increasing the
          university in size and enhancing its quality at the same time;<br>
        . Expanding ASU's research position dramatically to benefit both this
          region and the state; and<br>
        . Embedding the university as intimately as possible with our community
          beyond what we have already accomplished.</p>
      <p>This comprehensive development
          planning process is an effort to help lay the physical foundation for
          accomplishing those three goals. </p>
      <p>"The
          thing we are trying to avoid in the evolution of this university is
        a multi-tiered university system," says Crow. "Our desire is to build
          one university - all of our campuses will be ASU, not 'ASU light,'
        'ASU
          junior,' or 'ASU catching up.' The university has to be high quality
          everywhere.</p>
      <p>"If you attend Arizona State University you will have access
          to high quality schools on any of these campuses. Each school will
        be competitive
          nationally, within the realm of what that school has to offer. So,
        we will take a school-centric approach, as opposed to a campus-centric
        approach,
          as we advance the preparation of our comprehensive development plan."</p>
      <p>In
          the end, Crow says ASU needs to end up as a unique, one-of-a-kind institution.
          He wants ASU to be the one university that found a way to
          grow and meet the challenges of dealing with a major metropolitan area's
          population growth, and population and cultural diversification. He
        says the challenge of ASU's comprehensive development planning process
        is
          a tough one. Most people, when they think of ASU, think about the central
          core of the Main campus, or the central core of the other campuses. </p>
      <p>"We
          need input, perspective and ideas about how we can build the entire
        university, not just the individual campuses or units," says Crow. "We're
          trying to work on the notion of having soft boundaries, not hard boundaries.
          It's the only way we believe that we can move toward success."</p>
      <p>Rough estimates
          of enrollment growth patterns suggest the Main campus would grow to
        50,000 students, the East and West campuses would grow
          to 20,000 students each, and Downtown to 10,000-12,000. Crow says if
          ASU doesn't find a way to accommodate this growth, other institutions
          will be built to serve them. </p>
      <p>"I am of the strongest opinion that if we
          were to allow that, we would lose our central strategic position as
        The Arizona State University,
          the public university for this metropolitan area, too early," he says.</p>
      <p>The
          architecture firm Ayers, Saint, Gross is under contract with the university
          to complete the comprehensive development plan under the direction
          of Mernoy Harrison, vice president of Administration and Finance; Scott
          Cole, deputy executive vice president for university services; and
        Ron McCoy, university architect. They already have begun conducting focus
          groups to gain input from key constituents. </p>
      <p>"This team will help us grasp
          something we haven't been grasping well enough - how do we make ASU
        the most successful university that we possibly
          can," says Crow.</p>
