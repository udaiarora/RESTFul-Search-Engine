Premium costs are shared by the employee and the university.<P>Payroll deductions for medical and dental premiums are made only on a pretax basis, thereby reducing Social Security and federal and state income taxes.  These benefits are not offered on an after-tax basis.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Coverage Effective Dates</B></FONT><P>A <A HREF="acd002.html#facultymember" TARGET="New">faculty member</A> or <A HREF="acd002.html#academicprofessional" TARGET="New">academic professional</A> who signs the enrollment form by the 20th day of the month in which he or she was hired will have health/dental coverage effective the first day of the following month.  A new faculty member or academic professional who does not sign the application until the 21st day of the month, or later, will have health/dental coverage effective the first day of the second month.<P><B>Example</B><P><OL><LI>If the employment date is October 5, and the faculty member or academic professional signs on or before October 20, the health/dental coverage will be effective on November 1.</LI><P><LI>If the employment date is October 5, and the faculty member or academic professional signs on or after October 21, the health/dental coverage will be effective on December 1.</LI></OL><P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Changes to Coverage</B></FONT><P>Both individual and dependent coverage are available.  Coverage selected will remain in force unless changed during the annual open enrollment period.  Because medical/dental coverage is offered as a pretax benefit, <A HREF="acd002.html#employees" TARGET="New">employees</A> cannot change before the open enrollment period except for <A HREF="acd002.html#family" TARGET="New">family</A> status changes, i.e., marriage or divorce, death of a spouse or <A HREF="acd002.html#child" TARGET="New">child</A>, birth, adoption, or change in dependent status of a child, or a change in spousal employment.  Faculty members or academic professionals are able to add dependents or delete them from coverage only during open enrollment or as a bonafide family status change.<P>A terminating faculty member or academic professional has 60 calendar days to elect continuation of group coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA).  This coverage is available on a direct-pay basis for 18 months.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Medicare and Social Security</B></FONT><P>Faculty members, academic professionals, and their dependent spouses will become eligible for Medicare upon reaching the age of 65.  The State Health Insurance Program requires the transfer of enrollment for faculty, academic professionals, or spouses reaching the age of 65.  The employee is responsible for contacting the Social Security Administration before reaching the 65th birthday and for assuring similar action on the part of the spouse.  While Human Resources (HR) attempts to advise each faculty member or academic professional in advance of the need for a change in plan, HR cannot assure that notification will be given.  The faculty member or academic professional does not have to retire or receive Social Security benefits in order to enroll in Medicare.<P><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Procedures</B></FONT><A HREF="acd601-01table.html"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">D</FONT></A></CENTER><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Health/Dental Selection</B></FONT><P><HR NOSHADE><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 CELLSPACING=1><TR><TH>Responsibility<HR></TH><TH>Action<HR></TH></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Faculty member<BR>or<BR>academic professional</TD><TD><OL><LI>Select and complete the appropriate application for selected coverage at orientation.</LI></OL></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Human Resources (HR)</TD><TD><OL START="2"><LI>Submit the health insurance application to the State Department of Administration to be forwarded to the company.</LI></OL></TD></TR></TABLE><HR NOSHADE><P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Health/Dental Cancellation or Changes</B></FONT><P><HR NOSHADE><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 CELLSPACING=1><TR><TH>Responsibility<HR></TH><TH>Action<HR></TH></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>Subject to qualifying family status change or open enrollment:</TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Faculty member<BR>or<BR>academic professional</TD><TD><OL><LI>Visit Human Resources to complete the necessary documentation.</LI></OL></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Human Resources</TD><TD><OL START="2"><LI>Stop payroll deduction of the premium.</LI><P><LI>Notify the State Department of Administration of the cancellation.</LI></OL></TD></TR></TABLE><HR NOSHADE><P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Health/Dental Claims (Indemnity)</B></FONT><P><HR NOSHADE><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 CELLSPACING=1><TR><TH>Responsibility<HR></TH><TH>Action<HR></TH></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Faculty member<BR>or<BR>academic professional</TD><TD><OL><LI>Complete the appropriate section of the claim form.</LI><P><LI>Attach the original copy of the physician&#146;s or pharmacy&#146;s bill and forward to carrier.</LI></OL></TD></TR></TABLE><HR NOSHADE><P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Health Claims (HMO)</B></FONT><P><HR NOSHADE><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 CELLSPACING=1><TR><TH>Responsibility<HR></TH><TH>Action<HR></TH></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Faculty member<BR>or<BR>academic professional</TD><TD><OL><LI>Pay fees at time of the visit.
