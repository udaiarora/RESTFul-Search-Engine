				      <h3>Suggestion/Comment</h3>
				      <p> I looked in the online catalog to see if ASU had a subscription to The Scientist and it said that you had ordered an electronic subscription almost a year ago (!) What happened? Please find out why it's not available and get our money back for the past twelve months. Thanks. </p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention. Our electronic serials staff were able to resolve the problem, and The Scientist should <a href="http://pl8cg5fc8w.search.serialssolutions.com/?S=AC_T_B&C=scientist&V=1.0&L=PL8CG5FC8W">now be available online</a> through our &quot;Find Journals&quot; link. The catalog record will be updated soon to reflect this as well. <br>

				      <p> the newest suggestion made about the people on the computers... the person said &quot;I don't feel safe sitting next to them...&quot; and that it is &quot;NEVER a pleasant experience simply because of these people...&quot; Your response? That the people on those computers &quot;do not share the computing resources adequately...&quot; This is missing the point.... The person is afraid of these people, and quite frankly, so am I! . . .</p>
				      <p>Please, put time limits on the public terminals, so that they time out after 10 minutes or so. Something has to be done about this. And again, you missed the point of that suggestion, it's about feeling safe, not about them monopolizing computers.<br>
				        </p>				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Library Response </h3>
				      <p>Thank you for adding your concerns. As we stated in our earlier response, we are working on a solution to this situation, but we are not able to announce any specifics at this time. Again, if you feel unsafe when you are in the library please let the library staff know immediately. We are committed to providing a safe environment for all of our users. </p></td>

				      <p>Why is there only 5 all day rooms available on the Weekend.</p>
				      <p>How can there be more room. I notice student don't acknowledge your silent rules. I was in the silent study room on the third floor. There were student on there cellphone talking. So how do you intend to impose such rules. </p>
				      <p>Yes we are in college, but notice that college doesn't always teach us respect.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>In the Hayden Library we have twelve total individual study rooms that can be checked out by students. Six of these are all day, and the remaining six can be checked out for four hours. Currently that is what we've been able to offer students as the remaining rooms are all assigned to faculty. Students are also welcome to take advantage of the individual study rooms at the Noble Library across campus, as that library has twenty five study rooms available for check out.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <p>As for the noise levels, we are more than happy to assist you when you are disturbed, but we do rely on our customers alerting us to the problem. If you do not feel comfortable reminding your fellow students of the expectations of silence in the silent study spaces, please consult with library staff. We are happy to intervene on your behalf. <br>

				      <h3>Suggestion/Comment</h3>				      
				      <p>Why do you have two pages for searching for Journals, and why do they look different? When you click on &quot;Find Books and More&quot; and then from that page clidk on &quot;Journal title&quot; it looks one way, but if you just click on &quot;Find Journal&quot; it looks a different way. Kind of weird, no?</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>These are great observations. We do have two search interfaces for finding journals currently, and we know that it is &quot;weird&quot; and can cause confusion. I'll try not to give you too much information to explain why. </p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <p>The screen you see when you click on &quot;Find Books and More&quot; leads you to the online catalog. The catalog will provide information about journals we have in print, and will link to our electronic journals as well. However, currently the catalog does not provide information about what the coverage dates are for the electronic journals. The screen under &quot;<a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/find/journals/">Find Journal</a>&quot; will take you first to information on the electronic journals, including coverage dates, but also provides a way to search the catalog for the print journals.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <p>We know that these two search paths are confusing, and we are actively working on a solution to have only one place to search for information on all journals. <br>

				      <h3>Suggestion/Comment</h3>				      <p>It would be very helpful for library users if links in the catalog to online journals would state the years of access available, rather than the user having to do a separate search through e-journals or click on the link and go through what is available to find out years of access.</p>

				      <p>This is an outstanding suggestion, and it is something we are actively working on to implement. We understand the frustration of having to search multiple locations to find this information. We will announce this improvement in the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/news/">&quot;News and Events</a>&quot; section of the web site when it is implemented, or you can subscribe to the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/libnews/">LibNews email newsletter</a> to be notified about this and other library developments. </p></td>

				        <h3>Suggestion/Comment</h3>				        <p>I was aked not to bring my bike in to the library (hayden) the other day. I said &quot;it's an expensive bike, I don't want it to get stolen.&quot; They say, just lock it up at the bike racks. Question - why does this not apply to staff? I see people who I know work at Hayden bring their bikes in all the time. Surely they can be made to lock their bikes at the bike racks if I have to? I also notice a lot of bikes down in the courtyard, propped up against windows.... there is one bike that is ALWAYS there, leaning against the glass wall by the reference area. I don't mind following rules, but they should be enforced for everyone not just me. Thank you for your time.</p>

				      <p>Hi, just wanted to say that I'm really happy to hear about the new &quot;study zones&quot;! Noise has indeed become a problem in recent months, and hopefully this will help! While it's important to have an air-conditioned area for students to just hang out, it's indeed important for some areas of the library to be reserved for actual study. Thanks for addressing this issue!</p>

				      <p>Thank you so much for taking the time to send us your feedback on the <a href="https://librarynews.blog.asu.edu/2006/10/17/new-study-zones-introduced-in-hayden-library/"><b>new study zones in Hayden Library</b></a>. We have been listening to student's requests about needing many types of study spaces, and hope that this new system will help meet those needs. Please don't hesitate to let us know if you run into any difficulties with it as we are evaluating the location of the zones this semester.<br>

				      <p> I think it would be great if the study rooms on the third floor were open to everyone not just grad students. <br>

				      <p>This is a timely suggestion.

While the study rooms on Level 3 are currently all assigned to PhD students, we have fairly recently made available <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/news/studyrooms1.htm">individual study rooms</a> on the Lower Level that any student can check out on a daily or hourly basis. We are continuing to look for other similar opportunities to offer additional study options for students. </p></td>

				      <p>Me and my friends really have problems with not having any one on service on the 3 floor. Without having a degree in Library Science, it is often very hard to get around in a huge library, with many floors and shelves. The system of coding, the book locations, the whole search prosedure oresent sometimes enourmous difficulties to us and we sure need a lot of help to navigate through the Library treasures. Since during the week-days a lot of us are so busy, we reseave wee-ends for library visits, and then - we are lost and only waste our time. Please, place somebody on duty on week-ends, we really need it!!!!!!!!!</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Library Response </h3>				      <p>We are very sorry that you are having difficulties on Level 3. We agree that it can be a challenge to navigate the book shelves in that area, even for those of us who have degrees in library science! We are in the process of evaluating the deployment of our staff resources on evenings and weekends, and for now are unable to staff the help desk on Level 3. Please, if you have trouble there at any time, consult with the Information/Reference desk on the Entrance Level and the staff there will be happy to assist you. <br>

				      <p> I tried to hunt on the web site to find where (in which library) I could find video tape players to watch a tape. I could not find it so had to call a reference librarian.

				      <p>I understand that the Brown Bag Area can be used to have somthing to eat and study at the same time. But is it also for students to get together to discuss school issues very loudly, and sometimes to socialize? I would appreciate your doing something about it. </p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>Thank you for taking the time to inquire about this. The &quot;Brown Bag&quot; area (soon to be named something else since food and drink are welcome in most areas of the library) is not designated to be a quiet study space. Because of its location near the busy area of the library entrance, it is a place for students to gather and work together and talk. It is also adjacent to a library staff work space, and the noise of the staff working can sometimes be heard in the Brown Bag area. We understand if that is not an environment that is conducive for you to study in. We'd like to direct you to the many other areas of the Hayden Library where it is quiet, and where students are not encouraged to socialize: the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/lowlevel/">Lower Level</a> (especially in the individual study carrels - you can check keys out to these at the Circulation/Check Out desk); <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/level1/">Level 1</a> (by the windows) and <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/level2/">Level 2</a>. In addition there are many quiet study tables on the outer perimeter of <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/level3/">Level 3</a>. </p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <p>We are in the process of formalizing these &quot;quiet zones&quot; with signage and other announcements. We hope that these steps will help balance the needs of all of our student customers.<br>

				      <p>Lately I have been frustrated in trying to get access to e-journals in the medical field that ASU libraries do not carry but that UA libraries do.

				      <p>I was browsing the library catalog for &quot;America's best graduate schools / U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and found the title was available online and in hard copy at law treatises reserve collection. I wanted to access the title through online and when i clicked on the link it give me the following error.&quot;Lost Your Way?&quot;. I referred this to the staff peersonnel at the hayden Lower level during the summer session and till now it havent been rectified. I would like to browse the online content as it will be easy for filtering and i wanted it so desperately as i am planning to apply for some schools for my doctoral program.</p>
				      <p>Can you please let me know whether the online version is still subscribed by the librray or we have subscribed only for the hard copy. if the library is subscribed to hardcopy only is it possible to have a copy of it in the hayden or noble reserve collection also.why there is a online link in the catalog?.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>Thanks for checking back in on this. We have been trying to track down information on this. It looks like the &quot;America's Best Graduate Schools&quot; issue isn't part of our print subscription. According to the Law Library, they buy each issue on their own and put it on reserve (which is reflected in the online catalog). The online catalog information also links to the US News ranking web site, which only includes partial information. We will forward this to our electronic journals department to see if we can somehow subscribe to this resource. <br>

At ASU, our web site serves as a gateway to eight total libraries, each with its own set of hours. If we put them all on the front page, there wouldn't be room for anything else. We are always, however, working on  improving the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/hours/">hours information</a> that is linked from the front library page. </p></td>

				      <h3>Suggestion/Comment</h3>
				      <p>Thanks for giving a wonderful oppurtuniy to explore the wealth of resources available at the libraries.<br>
				        I have the following suggestions to make. This is regarding ensuring the fair availability of recommended class texts for all the students.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <blockquote>
				        <p>1.Prior to the start of a semester, obtain the recommendation on books from the faculty on the course that they will be offering.<br>
				          2. Ensure that atleast two copies of all these books are available in the library (if not please buy them).<br>
				          3. One can be allowed to be borrowed by a student while other needs to be marked as the &quot;reference &quot; which must be used by the patrons only in the library and cannot be borrweod.</p>
				        <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      </blockquote>				      <p>This will ensure that the patrons will not suffer in their courses just for the reason that they couldnot afford to buy the class text.
				        I hope you have understood my idea and will try to implement it.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>We absolutely empathize with the students' stress relating to the ever rising costs of textbooks. Unfortunately, if the library spent our materials budget buying textbooks for each class each semester, we would not have funds to add other items to our collection that would have more lasting value. We can, however, place professor's personal copies on <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/access/reserves/">course reserve</a> for individual classes, so please ask your instructor if they have a personal copy they can spare. </p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <p>We are aware that the Associated Students of ASU are championing this cause this year, so please be sure to become active with them as they try to find a better solution for textbooks. <br>

				      <p> I have noticed that many of the questions on this suggestion box are really mean spirited in nature. I also think that it is unfair to post &quot;suggestions&quot; that aren't really suggestions but just complaints against certain departments. I am refering specifically to the complaint made about the staff in the lower level. There was really no suggestion there, was there, just a gripe about the people down there being rude. That's unfair to those people down there to post allegations like that. SO now anyone with a chip on their shoulder can just write a nasty &quot;suggestion&quot; and then have the satisfaction of seeing it posted on the library website. </p>

				      <p>Many students require a typewriter for filling out official applications and other school neccesities. Please make sure that we have easy access to typewriters, they have a minimal cost and would be greatly used.<br>

				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>It is true that the Libraries no longer have public typewriters available. Due to their aging technology, it simply was no longer cost effective for us to maintain them, especially considering their extremely low use. The sad reality is that they were not minimally expensive because they were so old. We do know that it can be frustrating occasionally, because there still are times when official forms and applications require typing. We have found out that the Tempe Public Library, located at Southern and Rural, does have typewriters available to the public.</p>

				      <p>There's no reason to be worried! Just like the old &quot;telephone game&quot; the grapevine has gotten this slightly wrong. The library is absolutely, positvely not cancelling the Academic Search Premier/Ebscohost resource that so many students (and librarians) rely on. What is being cancelled is another product by the company, Ebsco EJS, which is a service we have used to manage our electronic subscriptions. That management is being replaced by other services, and you should actually see no real changes in your access to electronic information resources. </p></td>
