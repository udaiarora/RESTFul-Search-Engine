<P>6 v. London: Published by Richard Evans, J. Haddon, printer, 1814. An
edition of the author's <I>The English Physician Enlarged</I>, first issued
in 1653--Cf. Osler, Sir William. Bibliotheca Oslerians, item 2401. "A key
to Galen's method of physic:" p. [376]-395. References: Johnston, S. H.
Cleveland coll. 773. Includes index. Hand-colored plates. Plates 13 and
39 damaged; plate 40 wanting.
<P>This edition contains three works by Culpeper, ie., the <I>Complete
Herbal</I>, <I>English Physician Enlarged</I>, and <I>Key to Physic</I>.
<P>Culpeper begins his epistle to the reader with a note of warning about
copies of his work which had been falsely printed, and which contained
"twenty or thirty gross mistakes in every sheet, many of them such as are
exceedingly dangerous to such as shall venture to use them." These false
editions were printed "of that Letter the small Bibles are printed with"
and also have variant titles. The author then mentions that other authors
have written about herbs, but have not given the reasons why a particular
herb is appropriate for a particular part of the body or why it cures a
given disease. Culpeper notes that he himself has been sickly and so understands
the blessings of health and healing. Culpeper belonged to the astrological
school of medical botany which continued into the seventeenth century.
He begins his work with an alphabetical listing of herbs, giving a description
of the herb, where it is found, when it flowers, and what its virtues are.
This section is then followed by a discussion on the various ways to make
"Syrups, Conserves, Oils, Ointments, &amp;c, of herbs, roots, flowers,
&amp;c. Whereby you may have them ready for your uses at such times when
they cannot be had otherwise." This is then followed by a "Catalogue of
Simples in the New Dispensatory." The work concludes with a "Key to Galen's
Method of Physic" and a general index. The colored plates are located at
the end.
