      <h2>ASU launches global effort to study cities and growth </h2>
      <p>Arizona State University is taking its leading research on urban areas
        and environments global with the formation of the Consortium for the
        Study of Rapidly Urbanizing Regions. </p>
      <p>The effort will combine ASU's successful environmental science and engineering
        research activities in metropolitan Phoenix, the most rapidly growing
        urban area in the United States, with other related studies and expand
        the work to global dimensions.</p>
      <p>"More than ever before, the world is becoming urbanized," said ASU Center
        for Environmental Studies Director Charles Redman, who will direct the
        new consortium. "The greatest single challenge to the world today is
        the issue of rapidly urbanizing regions - having them develop so that
        they don't become seeds of poverty and terrorism, but sustainable places.
        Our work in this area has been strong and an expanded research partnership
        could have major impact."</p>
      <p>The consortium is one of a series of new "use-inspired" research initiatives
        being developed by ASU President Michael Crow to apply fundamental research
        to pressing community, national and global problems. </p>
      <p>"The policy decisions that we make today will determine the quality
        of our environment 100 years in the future," said Crow. "To think clearly
        about sustainability, we must understand the relationships between all
        the variables involving human interaction with natural systems-past,
        present, and future."</p>
      <p>"Phoenix is the ideal platform for this initiative in that it is among
        the most rapidly urbanizing regions in North America," noted ASU Vice
        President for Research and Economic Affairs Jonathan Fink. "ASU leads
        the way with a variety of local, federally funded research programs whose
        results and approaches can be leveraged into national and global initiatives."</p>
      <p> "Because of long-standing rapid growth, Phoenix is somewhat of a laboratory
        for determining how science can help solve human and environmental problems.&quot; said
        Rob Melnick, director of the Morrison Institute for Public Policy. "The
        power of an ASU-led international consortium of universities and businesses
        will foster the creation of a network for export solutions developed
        in Arizona to other regions. This will bring acclaim to greater Phoenix
        and put it in a national and international spotlight." </p>
      <p>Along with launching the consortium, ASU released the Greater Phoenix
        2100 Atlas, a demonstration regional atlas with maps and scientific information
        that will be a resource for analyzing and solving a range of regional
        problems. The atlas is the first product of Greater Phoenix 2100, an
        initiative to develop and assemble regional information and projections
        to help decision makers understand the very long-term (100-year) implications
        of current urban policies and issues.</p>
      <p>Much of ASU's research in urban areas and environments has been conducted
        under the direction of the Center for Environmental Studies (CES). CES
        is home to the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research
        (CAP LTER) project, one of only two urban sites in the National Science
        Foundation's system of ecological research centers. Since the creation
        of CAP LTER in 1997, the center has leveraged funding to become an extensive
        socio-environmental research enterprise, receiving NSF support for a
        new interdisciplinary graduate research program in urban ecology and
        for a new nationwide study of Agricultural Landscapes in Transition. </p>
      <p>Other ASU projects related to urban research include satellite-based
        remote sensing studies of global urban environments, extensive educational
        outreach programs, cutting edge environmental informatics projects and
        the Greater Phoenix 2100 initiative. </p>
      <p>The Greater Phoenix 2100 Atlas shows the extent of the issues that GP
        2100 and related projects have been involved in studying. &quot;This
        atlas is really a demonstration project to show many of the different
        concepts we are looking at,&quot; said Ray Quay, Assistant Director in
        the City of Phoenix's Water Services Department and GP 2100's former
        director.</p>
      <p>The atlas's data, drawn from research conducted at ASU and by many federal,
        state and regional agencies, focuses on a broad range of relevant topics,
        including transportation, water supply, air quality, pollen and allergies,
        changing demographics, Hispanic education, housing affordability, the
        high-tech new economy, open space preservation, and the urban heat island.
        Each topic area includes a number of maps illustrating aspects of the
        issue, with an accompanying discussion and a brief essay on the topic
        by a local leader. The atlas also includes overview chapters that summarize
        basic information and look at future research directions.</p>
      <p>Along with the printed document, there will also be an electronic version
        of the atlas that will be linked to CES's databases, and eventually to
        many government and community-based databases, where additional extensive
        and up-to-date information will be available.</p>
      <p>Building on the work of separate ASU projects such as GP 2100, CAP LTER,
        and urban remote sensing with NASA's ASTER instrument, the Consortium
        for the Study of Rapidly Urbanizing Regions will bring a new focus on
        rapid urban development issues and apply a wide range of resources and
        expertise.</p>
      <p>"The consortium will be involved in developing global partnerships while
        being based at ASU," explained Redman. "It will be a place where urban
        things at all scales will be thought about and pursued. Beginning next
        year, it will sponsor conferences and other events to engage the community
        locally, nationally and internationally. The goal is to be a world leader
        in this critical field of social and scientific study."</p>
