Combining Different Language Programs (e.g. C, FORTRAN, etc.)
</center></h2>
<p>
On each system, there  are  compilers for different type of 
languages (C, Fortran, Pascal, etc.)
<p> 
If you only compile the program (using the -c ) option it will 
generate an object file "filename.o" , then using the appropriate 
libraries and linker-loader (ld command) you can load and link the 
object files.
<p>
On most Unix systems, if you do not want to go and find out all 
the system and language libraries you need to use to link the 
programs via "ld", you can use the Fortran compiler.  The Fortran 
compiler in most cases will include all the necessary system files 
(and C language related files) and some more, such as the math 
library (be careful with the array memory-location differences).
<p> 
From system to system (AIX, HP-UX, SunOS, etc.) the options and 
the capabilities of the compilers change.  Some of them go to the 
extend to categorize the files based only on the file extenssion 
and call the appropriate language translater to compile the program.
<pre>
  .f    <----- Fortran
  .c    <----- C
  .C    <----- C++
  .p    <----- Pascal .......
</pre> 
The bottom line is , when you decide on what system to compile 
the files, depending on how sophisticated you want to get you can do 
different things.
<p> 
Bellow is the simplest case for compiling files :
<p>
Let's have two files:    main.c, subroutine.f   
(one in C and the other in Fortran)
<p>
Here is how we can compile and create an executable.
<p><dl>
<dt>
$cc -c main.c    <dd>will produce the object file main.o
<dt>$f77 -c subroutine.f    <dd>will produce object file subroutine.o
<dt>$f77 -o myexec  main.o subroutine.o   <dd>will produce the executable 
myexec 
<dt>$myexec     <dd>will run the program
</dl><p> 
 
Note:<br>
<ol>
<li>Again, depending on the system you are on, the  "calling interface" 
for the routines may be different.
<li>The extensions above are important (.f, .c, .o)
<li>Different languages store array differently and when passing 
variables between subroutines, they behave differently.
</ol>
