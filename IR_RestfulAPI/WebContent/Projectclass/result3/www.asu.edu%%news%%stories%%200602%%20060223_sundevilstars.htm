<h1 class="storyhead">MU honors student leaders at 2006 Sun Devil Stars </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>When it comes to student leadership, there are stars all around us at ASU. In an effort to recognize this diversity of young leaders on campus, ASU&rsquo;s Memorial Union coordinates Sun Devil Stars, an annual leadership recognition program.</p>
<table width="122" border="5" align="right" bordercolor="#FFFFFF" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<p>Now in its eighth year, Sun Devil Stars serves to recognize students across campus who are not necessarily in a visible leadership position, but have demonstrated leadership characteristics that have boosted the ASU campus. More than 450 students have been recognized to date for their contributions.</p>
<p>In a ceremony Feb. 21, 67 undergraduate students were recognized as Sun Devil Stars. The ceremony included brief speeches by Sally Ramage, interim vice president for Student Affairs, and Brett Perozzi, director of the Memorial Union.</p>
<p>David Wahls, a 2003 Sun Devil Star recipient, addressed the crowd during the event and discussed extending student leadership skills beyond college life. Wahls, a 2005 ASU alum, works as a project manager for the chief of staff at the ASU Foundation.</p>
<p>Students are nominated for the Sun Devil Star award by ASU faculty and staff in January. These students represent a variety of leadership roles on campus, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Student employees.</p>
<p>&bull; Individuals who volunteer on campus or in the greater community.</p>
<p>&bull; Members of student organizations.</p>
<p>Here are some excerpts of nominations received for this year&rsquo;s Sun Devil Stars. All recipients and nominations are available on the Web at (<a href="http://www.asu.edu/mu/sundevilstars">www.asu.edu/mu/sundevilstars</a>).</p>

As a future teacher, Brian has prepared himself by volunteering in local schools and has masterfully handled some tough classrooms in his facilitation of DCI 194.

<p>&ldquo;Monica Van Steenberg is a wife, mother, student and student worker who balances all with finesse, patience and professionalism. Monica joined the Graduation Office at a time when our office was short-staffed and in need of assistance. Her assigned duty was to man the front counter and assist students applying for graduation. She not only learned her job but also was quick to learn and take on other tasks to assist the staff members who, at times, were overwhelmed with their daily assignments. Monica volunteers to help whenever and wherever she can, always with a smile. As a returning student, she exhibits leadership in the way she treats each student that visits our office. Monica is a superb representative of the graduation office and is a valuable member of our team. Monica is a dedicated wife, mother, student and student worker and deserves to add &lsquo;Sun Devil Star&rsquo; to the many hats she wears.&rdquo;</p>
