<p><b>3. Announcements and Communications.</b>


<p><b>3.A. Senate President's Report </b>(David Burstein)<b>.</b>


<p>There four items that I want to talk to you about today. The first is


something near and dear to all our hearts, the scheduling issue. I met


with Walter Harris and Mernoy Harrison on Friday and they have had meetings


with others as well. The scheduling group has set up meetings with all


the college Deans' councils to gather concerns about scheduling. What I


think we have learned is that in starting any new computer system is difficult.


It is particularly difficult when it affects so many different people in


so many ways. Second, I strongly suspect that due to the way scheduling


was done previous to this program, a lot of us felt that there was no use


in complaining about the schedule that we received, because it would not


have done us any good. I think with many of the problems this year we had


some pent-up emotions behind them, and finally some of that exploded. I


hope those emotions have been released. We think we can make the program


work better and I would ask each of you senators to feel free to comment


on this issue. The administration wants to work with us in making the scheduling


process work better.


<p>Vice Provost Walter Harris is here with us today for Provost Glick.


He has set up two new task forces; he has invited me and a number of other


faculty and administrators to serve on them. One is a task force to study


the issues related to non-permanent faculty, namely, instructors and lecturers.


The second task force will look into the policies relating to promotion


and tenure, in light of post-tenure review. On the second task force a


lot of us think that the task is well overdue and we will try to complete


it this year.


<p>I intend to provide you with periodic updates on how things are going


with our negotiations with SAP on the new student information system. To


recap, we are in the process of working with SAP to make a new software


package that we are calling IQ Campus and they are calling Campus Management.


We hope by early winter to test this software. This software is directly


tied to programs such as Outlook, so you will be familar with it already.


It is a new program and there will be a learning curve. If some of you


are administrators or advisors in your department and you learn the new


system, I think you will find that you can do your jobs more efficiently.


The university is currently in negotiations with SAP to a package that


will include the Campus Management program, Human Resources, Finance and


Research Programs. I will report to you as I learn more.


<p>Last is the issue with the removal of the lockers in P.E. West when


the Memorial Union is remodeled. Mernoy Harrison is working with both the


Student-Faculty Policy Committee and the University Services and Facilities


Committee on this issue and we hope to have something concrete to report


by the beginning of next semester. Are there any other questions?


<p>Senator Moore: Is the make up of those committees going to be published?


<p>Senate President Burstein: The makeup of both the task forces will be


public once the actual members of those task forces are known.


<p><b>3.B University Provost's Report</b> (Walter Harris for Milton Glick).


<p>Provost Glick has been giving you updates on what is happening around


the university, and I am going to continue that today by talking about


the Center for Teaching and Learning. As many of you know, Duane Roen,


who has been on our faculty for a number of years as the director of the


freshman writing program in English, is now serving as the interim director


for the Center for Teaching and Learning. He is involved in a number of


exciting programs. One of the things that we hope to do is make the Center


an integral part of the fabric of the university. Toward that end, Duane


has been meeting with a number of people across campus to talk about how


we can make the Center a very active part of the University community.


Tomorrow he will visit with the Chairs and Directors group to get more


of their ideas about ways the Center can serve all faculty on campus. He


will give a good introduction about the work of the CTL today.


<p><b>3.B.1 Center for Teaching and Learning</b> (Duane Roen)


<p>The handout that I gave you summarizes a lot of what we are doing this


year. I want to thank you for inviting me today. Doug Johnson also gets


thanks for the interview he had with me, which appeared in the September


issue of the Academic Senate Newsletter. Several of the members of the


Senate have agreed to facilitate at our academic workshops this year: Max


Underwood, Barry McNeill, Betty Craft and Doug Johnson. The activities


of the Center are described on the handout (each senator received a handout


and those that were absent were sent one) and I will not talk about the


history of the staff today or the mission. I will go to the bottom of the


first page (handout) and talk to you about goals: The second one is to


provide workshops designed to enhance specific instructional practices.


On the overhead an asterisk means that the workshops are co-conducted between


several areas on campus. One thing that I need to say is that we will continue


to co-sponsor and co-conduct workshops. This is because, as you will notice


on the first page of the handout, we have a small staff, at least compared


to two centers that I looked at as models, the University of Michigan and


the University of Washington. They have a relatively large staff and a


whole range of functions that our center does not provide. This is because


our university is organized differently. For example, evaluation of courses


at those schools would be done through their centers and we have a separate


office that handles that function on our campus. I would invite you to


email me about your suggestions that you may have for workshops, or any


other activities the center should be involved in. I will respond as promptly


as possible. I would also like to have conversations with individuals or


groups of senators.


<p>The next item, under the specific goals for the Center (handout): We


serve as a clearinghouse for events, resources, and projects that may enhance


teaching and learning. Again, we see ourselves as a clearinghouse in the


Center because of the size of our staff and because there are some other


units on campus doing wonderful work in support of teaching. I am talking


about Instructional Support and the Graduate College's PFF program. We


do not want to duplicate those resources on campus but want to work with


them to provide faculty with whatever services are necessary.


<p>The next item is developing good working relationships with these existing


units. I have spent a lot of time over the last four months developing


our relationships with the Graduate College, with Instructional Support,


with Information Technology, University Evaluation and Human Resources,


just to name a few.


<p>If you turn to the second page of my handout, the web page is what we


hope faculty will turn to when they seek to know what resources are available


through the Center. We have worked very hard this semester to revitalize


the web page, the new edition of it with this new look will be available


sometime in December. We have links to other centers across the United


States, which in turn have links to other important services that we do


not want to duplicate. We have information about grants that support instruction;


we have information about conferences in the U.S. and around the world.


If you have other information you would like to see linked to our web page;


please email that information to me.


<p>I will call your attention to the third item under programs, resources


and services: Individual teaching consultations. Susan Ledlow and I are


delighted to talk to faculty about their teaching or even if you just want


to bounce off ideas, please call us. Again, all the consultations that


Susan and I conduct are completely confidential.


<p>Other things that are available include a modest library that we are


attempting to build up. We do the new faculty orientation each year and


roughly, 55-60 new faculty participate in that. We get good responses on


our efforts to introduce new people to ASU. We have some awards that we


are working on; some of you may be familar with the Teacher of the Month


Awards. We have not presented them for two years and we are working to


revitalize that web page right now. If you know of faculty who should be


highlighted on that page, I would be delighted if you would send me their


names. When we are finished revitalizing the page and make it public again,


the first thing we want to do is showcase a faculty member. We are also


developing some new Excellence in Mentoring awards. We will have several


of them and we are not looking at individuals that mentor well, but rather


programs and departments that mentor well. We want to recognize systematic


programs across campus that are designed to support junior faculty, non-track


faculty and TAs as well. Another award for the reflective use of technology


and instruction will be coming online soon.


<p>On grants and funding, right now we have some very modest efforts to


help faculty to identify sources of grants to support their instruction.


We need to work on that area quite a bit. For example, I was told recently


by the University of Washington that this past year their Center was able


to attract over 5 million dollars to support those kinds of efforts. I


do not know if we will ever reach that goal, but we should at least aim


for it.


<p>On the Fulbright Scholar Program, next month we will conduct a workshop


for people that want to apply for the Fulbright Award, by bringing in some


people who have done that in recent years to talk about the process and


their experience.


<p>One final thing. If any of you senators would like to take over the


home locator service, I will be happy to hand it off to you.


<p>I want to mention that Vice Provost Harris recently got a letter from


the Provost at the University of New Hampshire, which has a wonderful summer


institute on college teaching. Their institute has had 1/3 of their faculty


participate in that program. I will work to see if we can make that happen


at our university as well. We are looking at this institute as something


that would serve faculty on campus, at no cost, which would be available


to graduate students who were working on Ph.Ds that wanted to enhance their


teaching skills, and we would also invite a number of community colleges


in the valley to participate. The six components listed on the handout


are ones that we have thought about using in the first summer institute


that we offer. I have talked with people across campus who are excited


and eager to participate in "Teaching with Technology"--people in Instructional


Support are eager to be involved. Pat Green is eager to do the one on "Strategies


for Approving Teaching through Assessment." I will stop here. If you have


questions I can answer them now or you may email them to me.


<p><b>3.C ASASU Senate President's Report</b> (Wyatt Smith for Jenny Holsman).


<p>This week is Homecoming Week "Launching 2000". On Thursday, there will


be a spirit and cultural day out on the Hayden Library lawn. Congressman


Matt Salmon will be there too. The lantern walk up A Mountain will take


place Friday night and the Homecoming Parade will be Saturday morning.


The Grand Marshal will be astronaut Dr. John Phillips.


<p>On November 15, we will be sending out the teacher evaluation packets


to the departments for distribution along with the department evaluations.


Three hundred total classes will be evaluated this year.


<p>Book Swap is a new program this year. Students can use it here at ASU


on the ASASU Home Page (http://www.asu.edu/asasu/). We hope that by using


this service students at East, West and Main can save some money.


<p>The S.A.V.E. (Students are Voting Everywhere) program is in progress.


We are still competing with NAU and UofA, so faculty here are encouraged


to spread the word in their classes that we will be registering students


to vote at all the Homecoming activities.


<p>Senator Ferraro: How does the swap program work? (You leave an email


of a book to offer or a book needed and then wait to hear on it. The program


is located on the ASASU Home Page).


<p>Senator Solis: What can we tell our students? (That they may register


to vote at all the main events of Homecoming including the game.)


<p>Senator Bortner: How did you choose Matt Salmon as the speaker? (I do


not know how he was selected.)


<p>Senate President Burstein: Today East and West Senate Presidents could


not join us and our President-elect Johnson is serving on the Governor's


Task Force: Economic Development work group which is meeting every Monday


2-4 p.m. downtown. As an update, I understand that the other study work


groups will be appointed and members of the Arizona Faculties Council will


take their turns on these committees.


<p><b>4. Open Forum</b>.


<p>Senator McNeill: Why are the Senate Minutes not being posted on the


web page this year? Last year they were.


<p>Darby Shaw: There has been a change in our web master, who usually posts


the minutes and the newsletters on the web for us. Information Technology


people are busy revamping all the web pages at this time. Jeni Shoecraft


took over the position and is working with us to allow us permission to


load our own documents.


<p>Senate President Burstein: We will make note of your request and push


for getting the minutes onto the web page (September 13 and October 18


minutes that are now approved).


<p><b>5. Unfinished Business (Motions from Senate Committees--SECOND READING)</b>


<p><b>5.A Senate Motion #1 (1999-2000): The Curriculum and Academic Programs


Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted by


the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to disestablish the Bachelor of


Science in History </b>(A copy of this motion w/rationale was distributed


to senators, and is available from the Academic Senate Office 5-9245vm).


<p><b>Senator Jacob:</b> Is this indicative of a move of the History department


from the area of social sciences to the area of humanities?


<p><b>Senate President Burstein: </b>Will you email your question to me


so I can pass it along?


<p><b>Senator Mignolet:</b> Are there any other degrees left in the History


Department? (Yes. They are retaining just the BA).


<p><b>Senator Jacob: </b>I should explain my question; the reason I asked


is that in the justification portion it states that there is a lack of


interest in quantitative history--this might be indicative that these requirements


will be moved from social science to humanities to fulfill the General


Studies requirements.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> That would be a good question to ask


in the College Senate.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein: </b>Hearing no further questions, we will


move to a vote. The motion comes to us from a Senate committee and requires


no second. All in favor?


<p><b>Senator Jacob:</b> I move to table the motion until someone can be


present from the History Department to answer questions.


<p><b>Senator Bieber:</b> I second the motion to table.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein</b>: Hearing no further discussion we will


vote on the motion to table until the next Senate meeting.


<p>The motion is tabled by a show of hands. We will ask for representatives


of the History Department to be present at the next Senate meeting.


<p><b>6. New Business (Committee Reports and new motions--FIRST READING).</b>


<p><b>6.A Executive Committee</b> (David Burstein).


<p><b>6.A.1 Senate Motion #4 (1999-2000)</b> was introduced<b>.</b> "The


Academic Senate Executive Committee recommends Academic Senate ratification


of the ASU Intellectual Property Management Implementation Policy."


<p>The draft of the implementation policy was distributed by email and


is attached in the agenda. The ABOR policy 6-908 is also provided for your


reference.


<p>Let me ask that the Senate ratify this policy based on the fact that


the ABOR policy is already in effect. The ASU implementation policy (October


14) is what we need to ratify so that we may proceed to implement the Board's


policy on our campus. Our draft policy, modeled on the other Senate grievance


procedures, details the procedure to go through when there a dispute between


an inventor or a writer and the Intellectual Policy Committee, or rather


with the Vice President's Office for Research. It is to our benefit that


we pass this policy. Please look at the document as an implementation policy.


You may email me your comments, but we will not entertain motions to revise


the draft implementation policy from the floor of the Senate on December


6.


<p><b>6.B Committee on Committees</b> (Brent Brown). No report.


<p><b>6.C Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee</b> (Jack Fouquette).


<p><b>6.C.1 There are three items of information</b> from CAPC that require


no Senate action: The first is a name change of a concentration under the


BA degree in Plant Biology from: a concentration in Molecular Biosciences/Biotechnology


to: a concentration in Plant Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The second


item is the disestablishment of (4) concentrations under the MS Recreation


degree: Outdoor Recreation, Recreation Administration, Social/Psychological


Aspects of Leisure and Tourism and Commercial Recreation. The third item


is the transfer of the Doctor of Public Administration degree from its


present location in the Graduate College to the School of Public Affairs.


<p><b>6.C.2 Senate motions #2, 3, 5, and 6</b> are tied together under


one umbrella.


<p><b>Senate Motion #2(1999-2000)</b> was introduced: The Curriculum and


Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal


submitted by the Interdisciplinary Program in Science and Engineering of


Materials to establish a MS in Material Science.


<p>This interdisciplinary program involves both the College of Engineering


and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.


<p><b>Senate Motion #3 (1999-2000)</b> was introduced: The Curriculum and


Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal


submitted by the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences to establish


a MS in Materials Engineering and MSE in Materials Engineering.


<p>The difference between these two degrees is that one requires a thesis


and one does not. The main difference in the degree involved in SM #2 and


the one in SM# 3 is those students coming in with a more liberal arts and


sciences background and very little engineering courses would opt for the


first degree (MS Materials Science). The other one is designed for people


with an engineering background (MS in Materials Engineering and MSE in


Materials Engineering).


<p><b>Senate Motion #5 (1999-2000)</b> was introduced: The Curriculum and


Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal


submitted by the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences to establish


the Department of Bioengineering.


<p>This motion is paired with Senate Motion #6


<p><b>Senate Motion #6 (1999-2000)</b> was introduced: The Curriculum and


Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal


submitted by the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences to change


the name of the Department of Chemical, Bio, and Materials Engineering


<b>to:</b>


the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering.


<p>Essentially, they are splitting one department into two, taking Bioengineering


out of the current department, therefore taking the Bio out of the name


and establishing a new department.


<p><b>Senate Motion #7 (1999-2000)</b> was introduced: The Curriculum and


Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal


submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to establish an undergraduate


certificate program in History and Philosophy of Science.


<p><b>Senate Motion #8 (1999-2000)</b> was introduced: The Curriculum and


Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal


submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to change the name


of the BA and BS in Interdisciplinary Studies to BA and BS in Integrated


Studies.


<p>The reason behind this request is the confusion between the BA in Interdisciplinary


Studies and the BS in Interdisciplinary Studies with the new degree, Bachelor


of Interdisciplinary Studies.


<p><b>Senate Motion #9 (199-2000)</b> was introduced: The Curriculum and


Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal


submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to establish an undergraduate


certificate program called Enriched Liberal Arts and Sciences Undergraduate


Certificate Program.


<p><b>Copies of all these motions with their rationales may be obtained


from the Academic Senate Office, 965-9245vm.</b>


<p>Senate President Burstein: Are there any questions of information concerning


these motions?


<p>Senator O'Grady: Can you give an example of what this enriched certificate


program contains in the way of courses?


<p>Senator Fouquette: I do not have the complete packet with me. Generally,


in Liberal Arts there is a program that parallels General Studies called


the College Distribution Requirements, which requires about twice as many


as General Studies requires. For those extra General Studies courses that


are already required by the college, (so that no additional hours are required


for the certificate) instead of having the students randomly pick courses,


the courses will be grouped together with a common theme. They would take


courses in three different disciplines that had a similar theme. One example


that comes to mind was the theme of the environment, which could be organized


with a course from the ecological area of biology, one from environmental


architecture and one from engineering. There is also a bridge course required.


There is a requirement for a spoken English course as well.


<p><b>Senator O'Grady</b>: Would that be an English Department course?


(Not necessarily.)


<p><b>Senator Mayer:</b> It originally was presented as a course that requires


a major oral presentation. It was not designed as having any particular


course in mind. Two of the five courses could come from another area outside


of Liberal Arts.


<p><b>Senator McCoy:</b> Was it developed for only high ability students?


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> It is not so much designed for high


ability students but rather students who would plan from the beginning


what courses they would take. It is more likely something that highly motivated


students would do.


<p><b>Senator Bieber:</b> How does this mesh with the CLAS college distribution


requirements, as far as humanities, social, and behavioral sciences--and


now you are talking about engineering and architecture as a part of that


package.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> What most people will do is construct


their theme within the college.


<p><b>Senator Bieber:</b> It seems that they would have to do away with


the distribution requirements are set up.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> No.


<p><b>Senator Bieber:</b> It seems that they will have to change the distribution


requirements.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> They are not doing away with the distribution


requirements; what they are doing away with is any duplication between


the college distribution requirements and the General Studies requirements.


That is a different problem than what we are addressing here.


<p><b>6.D Personnel Committee</b> (Kathleen McCoy). No report.


<p><b>6.E Student-Faculty Policy Committee</b> (Michael Mayer). No report.


<p><b>6.F University Services and Facilities Committee</b> (Anne Kopta).


<p>Senate President Burstein introduced Anne Kopta, the new chair of the
