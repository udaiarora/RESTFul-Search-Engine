      <h2>ASU chosen for minority scholarship program</h2>
      <p>        ASU is one of only 13 colleges in the United States chosen to participate
          in a new scholarship program to recruit, enroll and graduate minority
          engineering students. The university has been named a NACME Scholar
          Institution by the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering,
          Inc., the nation's largest private source of scholarships for African
        American, American Indian and Latino engineering students.</p>
      <p>More than
          120 schools applied for the new program, according to Mary Anderson-Rowland,
          associate dean of the College of Engineering &amp; Applied
        Sciences (CEAS). <br>
        ASU will receive 10 scholarships of $2,500 each for incoming minority
        engineering students who have both academic qualifications and financial
        need. More than 15 percent of minority engineering graduates since 1974
        have received NACME scholarship support and are now leaders in government,
        industry and academia.</p>
      <p>"In the last 11 years we have more than doubled
          our enrollment of undergraduate engineering majors from underrepresented
          minority groups, from 315 in
          1991 to 771 this past fall," Anderson-Rowland says. "These enrollment
          numbers demonstrate our commitment. Receiving this scholarship grant
          is very big, as these scholarships usually have gone to minority institutions.</p>
      <p>"We
          have very strong recruiting and support programs for underrepresented
          students, and a critical base of minority students to support them
        when they come here."</p>
      <p>The engineering college has a number of summer programs,
          including a two-week residential Minority Summer Bridge program for
        admitted freshmen
          and a two-week Summer Transportation Institute, a residential camp
        for high school juniors and seniors also targeted at underrepresented
        minority
          students. </p>
      <p>Freshman retention from the 2001 Minority Summer Bridge program
          was 93 percent at ASU, and 86 percent of the total remained in engineering,
          Anderson-Rowland says. <br>
        More than 700 young minority students from over 30 schools participate
          in annual design competitions through MESA (Mathematics Engineering
          Science Achievement). During the academic year hundreds of high school
          students
          come to campus for a day of tours and meetings with engineering students
          and faculty. Other summer programs are open to all students.</p>
      <p>Support continues
        once students enroll, through the Freshman Year Experience program as
        well as a two-hour academic success class geared for minority
        engineering freshmen. The CEAS Center for Engineering Diversity &amp; Retention
        offers engineering students nearly 100 events each semester, including
        workshops and speakers from industry.</p>
      <p>ASU is one of the top 10 producers
          of American Indian engineering baccalaureate degrees in the country.</p>
      <p>"Engineers create and design solutions to problems,
          to help people," says Anderson-Rowland. "The more diverse an engineering
          team, with people
          who think differently and have different experiences, the better solutions
          there will be. Engineering is a very creative profession and one of
        the best backgrounds you can have for being a contributing citizen."</p>
      <p>The 13
          schools chosen to participate represent geographic diversity as well
          as diversity in student population. They include the University
          of California San Diego, the University of Washington, University of
          Central Florida, Georgia Institute of Technology and the University
        of Illinois Chicago.</p>
