The university provides release time from regular duties for employees to participate in training that will enhance skills and abilities on the job, provide professional growth and development, and expand knowledge. An employee must receive approval from his or her <A HREF="spp002.html#supervisor">supervisor</A> before using release time for training. In granting release time for training, the supervisor considers department needs and the employee&#146;s request.<P>Employees should not be required to make up work time missed in participating in supervisor-approved training. If an employee chooses to participate in training or educational activities on his or her own time, the time spent is not considered as time worked and will not be considered for <A HREF="spp002.html#overtime">overtime</A> or <A HREF="spp002.html#standard comp time">compensatory time</A>.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Minimum Requirement for Professional Development</B></FONT> <P>Supervisors are required to allow employees a minimum of 16 hours of release time per year for professional development. The university encourages employees to take advantage of this opportunity.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Yearly Plan for Training</B></FONT> <P>Because employees are expected to complete their regular job responsibilities, supervisors and employees should work together to identify reasonable accommodations that allow the employee to participate fully in training, without negatively impacting service. It is suggested that the employee and supervisor agree to a tentative yearly plan for training during the performance evaluation cycle; such a plan helps in planning release time.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Fees for Classes</B></FONT> <P>Fees for classes are not automatically reimbursed; departments are encouraged to fund those training opportunities that will enhance the employee&#146;s contributions to the university.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Employee Training and Development</B></FONT><P>For more information on employee development classes, workshops, and conferences, see the <A HREF="hrclasses.html" TARGET="NEW">Human Resources Professional Development</A> Web site.<P><B>Employment Credit for Training Classes</B><P>Supervisory employment credit for training classes may be earned through a series of workshops specifically designed to prepare employees for supervisory positions at ASU.
