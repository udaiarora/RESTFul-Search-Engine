The vision of one university in many places is part of The New American University conceptualized by President Crow when he came in 2002. Since that time, some steps have been taken to implement this vision: the University redesign project aligned programs with campuses to fit each campus&#8217; distinctive identity, the West campus separate accreditation was eliminated so that all campuses are part of a single ASU accreditation, and the downtown campus opened. However, in order to fulfill the complete vision of one university in many places I have recommended to President Michael Crow some necessary organizational changes and he has accepted those recommendations. This document describes the new structure and the general responsibilities associated with each position. </p>	              <h3>Proposed Structure</h3>	              <p>The President is President and Chief Executive Officer of the University which includes all locations. The Executive Vice President and University Provost is Chief Operating Officer of all the colleges and schools regardless of location. Administrative affairs, planning, facilities, auxiliaries, libraries, student affairs and all other administrative functions are run centrally. </p>	              <h3>The Budget </h3>	              <P>There is one budget system for the university, based on implementing goals set by the president. The Executive Vice President and University Provost allocates the budget to the deans and other academic unit heads and to the administrative units following principles established with the President and Budget Office. Budget allocation is made not to campuses, but to academic units and administrative units. The budget model rests on a school-centric model where deans bear the primary responsibility for academic excellence and student success. Academic and administrative unit heads are evaluated by their achievement of objectives, set by the president for their units, and by comparison to aspirational peers in the nation for their achievement of quality. Measures of quality are determined by the units. </p>	              <h3>Campus Program Identity &nbsp; </h3>	              <P>Each campus has a unique identity. The Tempe campus focuses on research and graduate education along with an undergraduate education that is analytic and preparatory for graduate or professional school or employment. The Polytechnic campus focuses on learning by doing offering an applied approach to professional and technological programs that meet business and societal needs and an emphasis on technical education that is a direct preparation for the workforce. The West campus focuses on interdisciplinary liberal arts education with professional programs that connect to the community. The Downtown campus is focused on programs with a direct urban and public connection. The Polytechnic, West and Downtown campuses are each led by a Vice President and Executive Vice Provost. </p>	              <h3>Vice President and Executive Vice Provost </h3>	              <P>The Vice President and Executive Vice Provost ensures that all programs and activities of the faculty, staff and students are aligned with the mission and identity of the campus. </p>	              <P>In addition the Vice President and Executive Vice Provost: </p>	              <ul>                    <li>Oversees campus operations coordinating with university-wide officers.
