In it, industrial and graphic design students and  faculty work with those from business and engineering to commercialize  product design concepts that solve significant social problems. He also  was named &ldquo;Outstanding Professor&rdquo; by industrial design students for  five of his six years at ASU.</p>	    <p>&ldquo;In his classes,  Professor Rothstein welcomes students into a research environment that  typically only occurs at the graduate level,&rdquo; says Jacques Giard,  director of the School of Design, in his February nomination of  Rothstein. &ldquo;He adopted a teaching approach that is hands-on, highly  interactive and demanding, bringing students into a peer-based  community of learners where they freely interact with faculty. He is an  exemplar of teaching excellence.&rdquo;</p>	    <p><a href="../index.html"><em>Return to home page </em></a></p>      <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->    <div class="footer"> <p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/provost">Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University</a><br>      Location: ASU Fulton Center, Suite 420, 300 E.
