NEW FEATURES

This version of VirusScan Enterprise provides
several new features that help to prevent and more
effectively detect intrusions:

-   Product Version Number

    The new version is 8.0i.

    The product version number has changed from 7.1
    to 8.0 to reflect the major changes within the
    product since the last release. See the
    following "New Features" and "Changed Features"
    for more information.

    The "i" has been added to represent that McAfee
    VirusScan Enterprise is the first anti-virus
    product in the world that contains proactive
    Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) protection
    capabilities. These IPS capabilities are
    provided in the Buffer Overflow Protection
    feature which comes from McAfee Entercept, our
    host intrusion prevention security product.

-   Access Protection.

    Use this feature to prevent intrusions by
    restricting access to ports, files, shares, and
    folders.

    You can block ports by creating rules to specify
    which ports to block and whether to restrict
    access to inbound or outbound processes. You can
    also exclude processes from the rule if you want
    a specific process, or list of processes, to be
    allowed access to the otherwise blocked port.
    When you block a port, both TCP and UDP accesses
    are blocked.

    You can restrict access to shares by making them
    read-only or blocking read and write access to
    all shares.

    You can block files and folders by creating
    rules that specify which processes to block from
    the files or folders you define, which file
    actions to prevent, and what action to take when
    an attempt is made to access a blocked item.

    These Access Protection features can be very
    effective in preventing intrusions. In the event
    of an outbreak, the administrator can block
    access to the infected areas until a DAT is
    released.

       NOTE:
       If you block a port that is used by the
       ePolicy Orchestrator agent or the Entercept
       agent, the agent's processes are trusted by
       the filter and are allowed to communicate
       with the blocked port. All other traffic not
       related to these agent processes will be
       blocked.

    This version of VirusScan Enterprise provides
    some sample port blocking rules and some sample
    file and folder blocking rules. With a default
    installation, some of these rules are in warning
    mode and others are in blocking mode.

       WARNING:
       These rules have been chosen to protect
       against a broad range of common threats but
       they may also block legitimate activity.
       Before deploying VirusScan Enterprise, we
       recommend that you review these rules to
       ensure they are suitable for your
       environment.

    Things to consider:

   -   Whitelists. Each Port Blocking rule includes
       a list of applications which are excluded
       from being blocked. These lists have been
       populated with many of the most common e-mail
       clients and web browsers. Be certain to
       review each of these lists to ensure they
       include all programs that are allowed to send
       email and download files. Including these
       programs in the whitelist ensures that these
       programs will not be blocked.

   -   Blocking of file system activity that
       originates on the network. Some rules such as
       "Prevent remote
       creation/modification/deletion of files
       (.exe)" are very effective at stopping
       viruses that copy themselves from share to
       share. However, they may also block
       management systems that rely on pushing files
       to workstations. For example, when the
       ePolicy Orchestrator server deploys an agent,
       it does this by pushing the agent installer
       onto the workstations' administrative share
       and running it. Be certain to select the
       correct mode (off, warn or block) for each
       rule before deployment.

       McAfee Installation Designer can be used to
       configure a VirusScan package for
       deployment.

       WARNING:
       The default rules cannot provide complete
       protection for your environment. The
       restrictions that you need depend on your
       environment. The rules that we provide are
       examples of what the feature can do and how
       rules can be used to prevent some specific
       threats.

       As new threats are discovered, the Virus
       Information Library will provide
       recommendations on how access protection
       rules can be used to block these new threats.
       Access the Virus Information Library at this
       location:

       http://vil.mcafee.com

-   Source IP (On-access scanning).

    When the on-access scanner detects a virus
    written to a file share, it displays the Source
    IP for the detection in the on-access scan
    statistics dialog box and the on-access scan
    messages dialog box.

-   Blocking (On-access scanning).

    Use this feature to block further access by
    remote computers that have placed infected files
    in a shared folder. You can specify how long to
    block these connections. If you want to unblock
    all connections before the specified time limit,
    you can do so from the on-access scanning
    statistics dialog box.

-   Buffer Overflow Protection.

    Use this feature to block exploited buffer
    overflows from executing code on your computer.
    Buffer Overflow Protection detects code starting
    to run from data in a heap or stack and prevents
    that code from running. It does not stop data
    from being written to the heap or stack. Do not
    rely on the exploited application remaining
    stable after being exploited, even if Buffer
    Overflow Protection stops the exploited code
    from running.

    VirusScan Enterprise protects against buffer
    overflows for approximately 30 of the most
    commonly used and exploited software
    applications and Microsoft Windows services.
    These protected applications are defined in a
    separate Buffer Overflow Protection Definitions
    (DAT) file. This DAT file is available for
    download along with the Virus Definitions file
    during regular updates. As of the date of this
    product release, these applications are included
    in the Buffer Overflow Protection Definitions
    file:

   -   dllhost.exe
   -   EventParser.exe
   -   excel.exe
   -   explorer.exe
   -   frameworkservice.exe
   -   ftp.exe
   -   iexplore.exe
   -   inetinfo.exe
   -   lsass.exe
   -   mapisp32.exe
   -   mplayer2.exe
   -   msaccess.exe
   -   msimn.exe
   -   mstask.exe
   -   msmsgs.exe
   -   NaimServ.exe
   -   Naprdmgr.exe
   -   outlook.exe
   -   powerpnt.exe
   -   rpcss.exe
   -   services.exe
   -   sqlservr.exe
   -   SrvMon.exe
   -   svchost.exe
   -   visio32.exe
   -   VSEBOTest.exe
   -   w3wp.exe
   -   winword.exe
   -   wmplayer.exe
   -   wuauclt.exe

    This list will change when the Buffer Overflow
    Protection Definitions file is updated.

-   Unwanted Programs Policy.

    Use this feature to detect and take action on
    unwanted programs, such as spyware, adware,
    dialers, jokes, etc.

    You can select whole categories of programs or
    specific programs within those categories from a
    pre-defined list which comes from the current
    DAT file. You can also add your own programs to
    detect.

    Configuration is a two-step process:

   -   First, you configure what programs to detect
       in the Unwanted Programs Policy. This policy
       is enabled by default in each of the
       scanner?s property pages.

   -   Second, you independently configure each of
       the scanners (on-access scanner, on-demand
       scanner, and e-mail scanners) to specify what
       actions you want the scanner to take when an
       unwanted program is detected. The actions you
       specify here are independent of your other
       scan settings.

    The actual detection and subsequent cleaning of
    unwanted programs is determined by the DAT file,
    just as it is for a virus. If you detect a
    program and you have the primary action set to
    "Clean," the DAT file tries to clean the program
    using the information in the DAT file. If the
    detected program cannot be cleaned, or is not in
    the DAT file, for example a user-defined
    program, the clean action fails and the
    secondary action is taken. If you select
    "Delete" only the process defined as unwanted is
    deleted and modified registry keys may be left
    intact.

-   Script Scanning (On-access scanning).

    Use this feature to scan JavaScript and VBScript
    scripts before they are executed. The script
    scanner operates as a proxy component to the
    real Windows scripting host component. It
    intercepts the execution of a script, for
    example an Internet Explorer web page script,
    and scans it. If the script is clean, it is
    passed on to the real host. If the script is
    infected, it is not executed.

-   Lotus Notes (E-mail scanning).

    Both the on-delivery e-mail scanner and the
    on-demand e-mail scanner now scan Lotus Notes
    messages and databases, in addition to
    MAPI-based e-mail, such as Microsoft Outlook.

    You configure one set of properties that applies
    to whichever e-mail client you have installed.

    The client scanners have some behavior
    differences that are described in the E-mail
    Scanning section of the Product Guide. For
    example, Microsoft Outlook messages are scanned
    on delivery, but Lotus Notes mail is scanned
    when it is accessed.

-   Selective Updating (AutoUpdate).

    Selectively update just the DAT file, scanning
    engine, product upgrades, HotFixes, Patches, or
    Service Packs, etc., using the AutoUpdate task
    in the VirusScan Console.

    If you are managing VirusScan Enterprise with
    ePolicy Orchestrator, the selective updating
    feature is only available in ePolicy
    Orchestrator 3.5 or later. It does not work with
    earlier versions of ePolicy Orchestrator.

-   Alert Manager Local Alerting.

    Generate SNMP traps and local event log entries
    without installing Alert Manager Server
    locally.

-  Repair Installation.

    A new item in the VirusScan Console Help menu
    allows you to repair the installation. You have
    the option of restoring the product to the
    original installation settings or reinstalling
    the program files.

    The user must have administrative rights to
    perform these functions. The administrator can
    protect this feature by setting a password for
    it from the User Interface Options, Password
    Options dialog box.

       WARNING:
       Customized settings will be lost when
       restoring the product to the original
       installation settings.

       HotFixes, Patches, and Service Packs will be
       overwritten when reinstalling the program
       files.

-   Error Reporting Service.

    When enabled, the Error Reporting Service
    provides constant background monitoring of
    Network Associates applications and prompts the
    user when it detects a problem. When an error is
    detected, the user can choose to either submit
    data for analysis or ignore the error. Enable
    the Error Reporting Service from the Tools menu
    in the VirusScan Console.


_____________________________________________________
CHANGED FEATURES

These features have changed since the previous
release of VirusScan Enterprise:

-   Daily Updating (AutoUpdate).

    The default AutoUpdate task schedule has been
    changed from Weekly to Daily. The schedule can
    be modified by the administrator.

-   Default Download Site (AutoUpdate).

    When performing an AutoUpdate, the default
    download site is now HTTP with the FTP site as
    the secondary site. See the VirusScan Enterprise
    Product Guide for more information.

-   System Utilization (On-demand scanning).

    CPU utilization has been changed to system
    utilization. When an on-demand scan starts, the
    feature takes CPU and IO samples over the first
    30 seconds, then scans based on the utilization
    level you specified in the on-demand scan
    properties. This provides more realistic scaling
    of both CPU and disk resources.

-   Resumable Scanning.

    The on-demand scanner has been changed to
    perform true resumable scanning. The scanner
    automatically resumes scanning where it left off
    if the scan is interrupted before it completes.
    The incremental scan feature of the scanner
    recognizes the last file it scanned, so the next
    time it starts, it resumes from where it left
    off.

-   Scanning of Compressed Files.

    The "Scan compressed files" option has been
    removed from the scanning options because the
    feature has been permanently enabled in each of
    the scanners. The scanner always scans
    compressed files.


__________________________________________________________
INSTALLATION AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

See the product documentation for complete
information on installation and system
requirements.


TESTING YOUR INSTALLATION

You can test the operation of the software by
running the EICAR Standard AntiVirus Test File on
any computer where you have installed the software.
The EICAR Standard AntiVirus Test File is a combined
effort by anti-virus vendors throughout the world to
implement one standard by which customers can verify
their anti-virus installations.

To test your installation:

1. Copy the following line into its own file, then
   save the file with the name EICAR.COM.

       X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

    The file size will be 68 or 70 bytes.

2. Start your anti-virus software and allow it to
   scan the directory that contains EICAR.COM.

    When VirusScan Enterprise scans this file, it
    will report finding the EICAR test file.

3. Delete the file when you have finished testing
   your installation to avoid alarming unsuspecting
   users.

    IMPORTANT:
    Please note that this file is NOT A VIRUS.


__________________________________________________________
RESOLVED ISSUES

The following list describes issues from the
previous release of this software product that have
been resolved with this current release.

1.  ISSUE:
    The VirusScan Enterprise 7.1 on-access scanner
    could take action on data contained in
    quarantine folders of other McAfee anti-virus or
    security products, unless you excluded those
    folders from scanning. For example, if you were
    using McAfee GroupShield or IntruShield on the
    same computer where VirusScan Enterprise
    resided, their respective quarantine folders
    might contain legitimate infected data. Those
    quarantine folders should have been excluded
    from on-access scanning to avoid the possibility
    of cleaning, deleting, or moving the legitimate
    infected data.

    RESOLUTION:
    The installer detects the other products and
    adds exclusions for them.

2.  ISSUE:
    Resumable scanning did not work for on-demand
    scan tasks created and deployed using ePolicy
    Orchestrator 3.0. This occurred if the on-demand
    scan that was created in ePolicy Orchestrator
    ended before the scan completed (due to system
    shutdown, etc.). When the on-demand scan task
    started again, it began scanning at the
    beginning, rather than resuming from the last
    file scanned.

    RESOLUTION:
    Resumable scanning works correctly for on-demand
    scan tasks that were created and deployed using
    ePolicy Orchestrator.

3.  ISSUE:
    When a user with user rights (as opposed to an
    administrator with administrator rights) rolled
    back DAT files, the following error occurred:

       "Failed to save the version of the DATs that
       have just been rolled back"

    This meant that VirusScan Enterprise failed to
    create the correct registry key identifying that
    the rollback had occurred. Because of this,
    performing an update could allow the rolled-back
    DATs to be reapplied. This could cause problems
    if the rolled-back DAT versions were corrupted
    (usually the reason for performing a DAT
    rollback).

    Normally, VirusScan Enterprise did not update
    DAT versions that had been rolled back.

       NOTE:
       This problem only occurred when a
       non-administrator performed the DAT rollback.
       When administrators performed it, the
       rolled-back DAT versions could not be applied
       through updating.

    RESOLUTION:
    Rolled-back DATs cannot be reapplied.

4.  ISSUE:
    The VShield icon did not appear in the system
    tray when VirusScan Enterprise was deployed via
    ePolicy Orchestrator or when a silent
    installation was used.

    RESOLUTION:
    The VShield icon now displays in the system tray
    after deployment via ePolicy Orchestrator or
    when using a silent installation.

5.  ISSUE:
    When installing VirusScan Enterprise to an Intel
    64-bit processor-based system, the VSUPDATE.DLL
    file did not register correctly with the
    REGSVR32.EXE. As a result, when an update was
    performed after installation, an error occurred
    and the following error message was displayed:

       "Error occurred while loading COM component."

    To correctly register the .DLL, enter the
    following command at the command prompt:

       "<drive>:\Winnt\syswow64\regsvr32.exe <installation path>vsupdate.dll"

       NOTE:
       If you are installing VirusScan Enterprise to
       the default location, the installation path
       is:

       <drive>:\Program Files\Network Associates\VirusScan\

    RESOLUTION:
    This issue has been resolved in VirusScan
    Enterprise 8.0


_____________________________________________________
KNOWN ISSUES

INSTALLING, UPGRADING, AND UNINSTALLING

1.  An optional restart is required at the end of
    installation to load the TDI network driver.
    Port Blocking, Infection Trace, and Infection
    Trace Blocking are disabled until the computer
    is restarted.

2.  Internet Explorer requirement. The VirusScan
    Enterprise 8.0 Installation Guide incorrectly
    lists the Internet Explorer requirement as
    version 5.0 or later. The Internet Explorer
    requirement is version 4.0 with Service Pack 2
    or later.

3.  If you plan to install VirusScan Enterprise 8.0
    and use the AutoUpdate feature on a computer
    with a Windows NT4 operating system, you must
    first install Internet Explorer 4.0 with Service
    Pack 2 or later on that computer.

    If Internet Explorer 4.0 with Service Pack 2 or
    later is not installed before you begin
    installing VirusScan Enterprise 8.0 on a Windows
    NT4 operating system, error 1920 "Service Failed
    to Start" is generated and you are given the
    option to "Abort," "Retry," or "Continue" the
    installation. If you "Continue" the
    installation, the AutoUpdate component is not
    installed. If you decide later to install the
    AutoUpdate feature, you must first install
    Internet Explorer 4.0 with Service Pack 2 or
    later then completely remove VirusScan
    Enterprise 8.0 and re-install it.

4.  If you are installing VirusScan Enterprise on a
    Windows NT4 Terminal Server using the
    uncompressed setup utility; "SETUPVSE.EXE", you
    must first switch the Terminal Server to
    "Install Mode" before you execute
    "SETUPVSE.EXE." For more information, see
    Knowledge Base article KB37558.

5.  To install the VirusScan Enterprise product
    using MSIEXEC.EXE, complete these steps:

   a.  Extract the .MSI and other files by entering
       this command at the command prompt:

       SETUP.EXE -nos_ne [-nos_o"<output path>"]

           NOTES:
           The -nos_ne command extracts the setup
           files from the SETUP.EXE, but does not
           execute the SETUP.EXE or delete the setup
           files.

           The -nos_o"<output path>" command
           specifies the folder to which you want to
           extract the setup files.

           If you do not specify the output path,
           the files are extracted to the user
           profile's "Temp" folder.

   b. Ensure that any competitor's products are
      removed including previous versions of McAfee
      VirusScan and VirusScan Enterprise.

   c. Run MSIEXEC.EXE by entering this command at
      the command prompt:

       "msiexec.exe /i vse800.msi"

6.  When installing Buffer Overflow Protection,
    these limitations apply:

   -   If Buffer Overflow Protection is installed on
       a computer that already has the McAfee
       Entercept agent installed on it, the Buffer
       Overflow Protection feature is disabled in
       the VirusScan Console.

       The McAfee Entercept product provides more
       complete coverage, so it takes precedence
       over the Buffer Overflow Protection feature
       in VirusScan Enterprise.

   -   Buffer Overflow Protection cannot be
       installed on 64-bit platforms.

   -   When using Buffer Overflow Protection with
       Microsoft Windows XP Fast User Switching,
       only session 0 is protected.

   -   Buffer Overflow Protection does not protect
       Terminal Sessions for Windows Terminal Server
       or Citrix MetaFrame. Only the local login is
       protected.

7.  ScriptScan cannot be installed on 64-bit
    platforms.

8.  Right-click scan cannot be installed on 64-bit
    platforms.

9.  This release supports deployment using
    Administration Installation Points (AIP).
    However, you must run SETUP.EXE from the AIP to
    perform upgrades or to uninstall other
    anti-virus software.

    To create an AIP, type "setup.exe /a" at the
    command prompt. A wizard appears to take you
    through the process of creating the AIP. When
    the AIP is created, all of the necessary files
    in the compressed (.ZIP) file are also copied to
    the AIP. These files are:

   -   CMU300.NAP
   -   CONTACT.TXT
   -   EXAMPLE.SMS
   -   EXTRA.DAT
   -   INSTALL.PKG
   -   INSTMSIW.EXE
   -   PKGCATALOG.Z
   -   PACKING.LST
   -   README.TXT
   -   SETUP.INI
   -   SETUPVSE.EXE
   -   SIGNLIC.TXT
   -   UNINST.DLL
   -   UNINST.INI
   -   VSE800.NAP
   -   VSE800DET.MCS

    Since these files are automatically copied to
    the AIP, the administrator does not need to
    manually copy the files.

       NOTE:
       If you deploy VirusScan Enterprise via Active
       Directory group policies, which install using
       MSIEXEC.EXE, you must remove any existing
       anti-virus products prior to installing
       VirusScan Enterprise.

10. When silently over-installing the Computer
    Associates eTrust Antivirus program, the action
    is not completely silent. The Computer
    Associates eTrust Antivirus program displays a
    message box stating that a restart is needed
    with an "OK" button. Once you click "OK", the
    over-installation continues normally. This
    problem is a known Computer Associates problem
    referenced on the Computer Associates' web site
    under article QO19636. The web site provides a
    downloadable file that fixes this problem. The
    problem references Computer Associates eTrust
    Antivirus version 6.0, but the fix also works
    for version 7.0.


COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER PRODUCTS

Alert Manager

1.  VirusScan Enterprise 8.0 can only send alerts to
    Alert Manager 4.7.x. It cannot send alerts to
    earlier versions of Alert Manager.

    Furthermore, VirusScan Enterprise 8.0 cannot be
    installed on a computer where an Alert Manager
    version earlier than 4.7.x is already installed.
    If you are installing VirusScan Enterprise 8.0
    onto a system where Alert Manager 4.5 or 4.6 is
    installed, you should also install Alert Manager
    4.7.x, which automatically replaces the older
    version of Alert Manager.

    However, also note that Alert Manager 4.7.x can
    receive alerts from earlier versions of
    NetShield and VirusScan. You can configure
    earlier versions of these software programs to
    send alerts to an installation of Alert Manager
    4.7.x.

2.  When installing Alert Manager on a Windows 2003
    (.NET) Server, alert messages do not
    automatically display in VirusScan Enterprise
    8.0. You must manually start the messenger
    service:

   a.  From the Start menu, select
       Settings | Control Panel | Administrative Tools | Services | Messenger

   b.  Open the Messenger Properties dialog box.

   c.  On the General tab under "Startup type,"
       select "Automatic."

   d.  On the General tab under "Service status,"
       click "Start."

   e.  Click "OK" to apply the changes and close the
       Messenger Properties dialog box.

Common Management Agent

1.  Installing VirusScan Enterprise 8.0 in ePolicy
    Orchestrator 3.0.x does not automatically
    upgrade the Common Management Agent from an
    earlier version to 3.5. If you are using ePolicy
    Orchestrator 3.0.x and VirusScan Enterprise 7.x,
    then add the VirusScan Enterprise 8.0
    installation package to the ePolicy Orchestrator
    repository, the Common Management Agent is not
    upgraded to version 3.5.

    To upgrade the Common Management Agent from an
    earlier version to version 3.5, you must install
    Common Management Agent version 3.5, then push
    it to the clients or perform an update task.

       NOTE:
       Common Management Agent 3.5 is not required
       when using ePolicy Orchestrator to manage
       VirusScan Enterprise 8.0. The only
       differences between Common Management Agent
       version 3.5 and earlier versions are:

       - Common Management Agent 3.5 has the ability
           to perform selective updating and earlier
           versions perform updating as a whole.
           Selective updating allows you to
           individually update just a DAT, scanning
           engine, Patch, etc.

       - Common Management Agent 3.5 does not filter
           events on the client side.

2.  Installing ePolicy Orchestrator 3.0.x fails if
    Common Management Agent 3.5 is already
    installed. If you attempt to install ePolicy
    Orchestrator 3.0.x on the same computer where
    you installed VirusScan 8.0, the ePolicy
    Orchestrator installation fails due to an issue
    with upgrading the Common Management Agent.
    Since VirusScan Enterprise 8.0 installs Common
    Management Agent version 3.5 and ePolicy
    Orchestrator 3.0.x installs an earlier version
    of the Common Management Agent, the agent cannot
    be upgraded and the installation fails.

    To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

   a.  Remove VirusScan Enterprise 8.0.

   b.  Install ePolicy Orchestrator 3.0.x.

   c.  Re-install VirusScan Enterprise 8.0.

   d.  To upgrade the Common Management from an
       earlier version to version 3.5 in ePolicy
       Orchestrator 3.0.x, install Common Management
       Agent 3.5 in ePolicy Orchestrator 3.0.x, then
       push it to the clients or perform an update
       task.

ePolicy Orchestrator

1.  If you are planning to use ePolicy Orchestrator
    to manage VirusScan Enterprise 8.0, you must use
    ePolicy Orchestrator version 3.0 with Service
    Pack 1 or a later version.

2.  Selective updating. To use the new selective
    updating feature, you must be using ePolicy
    Orchestrator 3.5 or later to manage VirusScan
    Enterprise. Earlier versions of ePolicy
    Orchestrator perform updates but do not support
    selective updating of just a DAT file, scanning
    engine, etc.

3.  This version of VirusScan Enterprise 8.0
    provides two .NAP files that must be added to
    the ePolicy Orchestrator repository. In
    addition, if you are running ePolicy
    Orchestrator version 3.0.x, you must run an
    update executable to fix an issue related to
    registering the event parser, after you add both
    of the .NAP files.

       NOTE:
       It is not necessary to run the update
       executable if you are using ePolicy
       Orchestrator version 3.5 or later.

    These files are included in the VirusScan
    Enterprise 8.0 installation package and can be
    found in the location where you downloaded the
    files:

   -   VSE800.NAP

   -   VSE800REPORTS.NAP. This file is an extended
       reports .NAP file.

   -   VSE800UPDATEFOREPO30.EXE. This file is an
       update executable.

   a.  Add both .NAP files to the ePolicy
       Orchestrator repository.

           NOTE:
           We recommend that you install the
           VSE800REPORTS.NAP file before you install
           the VSE800.NAP. Installing the .NAP files
           in this order prevents an issue with the
           VirusScan Enterprise English description
           that is displayed under Managed Products.
           See Known Issue number 8 in this section
           for more information.

   b.  If you are using ePolicy Orchestrator version
       3.0.x, execute the VSE800UPDATEFOREPO30.EXE
       on the computer where ePolicy Orchestrator
       3.x is installed.

       This executable registers the event parser
       .DLL on ePolicy Orchestrator 3.0.x servers.
       This update fixes an issue with ePolicy
       Orchestrator that causes the event parser to
       not be correctly registered when the extended
       reports .NAP is added.

       NOTE:
       See the VirusScan Enterprise 8.0
       Configuration Guide for use with ePolicy
       Orchestrator for details.

4.  Checking the VSEREPORTS.NAP file into the
    ePolicy Orchestrator version 3.01 or 3.02
    repository may result in an "Unspecified
    error."

    This is a console time-out error which can be
    ignored. The server completes the execution of
    all of the SQL scripts in the .NAP file even if
    the console timed out.

5.  If you are using Microsoft SQL Server version
    7.0 with ePolicy Orchestrator 3.01 or later,
    on-demand scan tasks are not preserved when you
    check the VSE800.NAP file into the ePolicy
    Orchestrator Repository. You must have Microsoft
    SQL Server version 2000 or later installed to
    preserve on-demand scan tasks.

6.  A replicated repository may become corrupted
    when replicating via UNC from an ePolicy
    Orchestrator server to a server that has these
    file blocking rules enabled in the Access
    Protection Properties:

   -   "Prevent remote modification of files
       (.exe)"
   -   "Prevent remote modification of files
       (.dll)"
   -   "Prevent remote
       creation/modification/deletion of anything in
       the system root"
   -   "Prevent remote
       creation/modification/deletion of files
       (.exe)"

    When these rules are enabled, some file
    replications are blocked because the ePolicy
    Orchestrator server remotely opens the files for
    write access and modifies their contents in the
    same way that a share-hopping worm performs.

    If you plan to replicate a repository via UNC
    from an ePolicy Orchestrator server, be certain
    to disable these file blocking rules on the
    target server before you perform the
    replication.

7.  The ePolicy Orchestrator compliance baseline
    does not recalculate compliance when you remove
    items from the repository.

    For example, when you check VirusScan Enterprise
    8.0 into the ePolicy Orchestrator repository, it
    is flagged as the new compliance baseline for
    the environment. All computers with VirusScan
    Enterprise versions earlier than 8.0 are flagged
    as non-compliant. However, if you remove
    VirusScan Enterprise 8.0 from the repository,
    rather than recalculate compliance, the
    compliance baseline remains at version 8.0. The
    compliance baseline only increases
    incrementally, even if you re-check VirusScan
    Enterprise 7.1 into the repository.

8.  The English description for VirusScan Enterprise
    8.0 may not be available in the ePolicy
    Orchestrator Repository under Managed Products |
    Windows | VirusScan Enterprise | 8.0.0 depending
    on the order in which you installed the two
    VirusScan Enterprise 8.0 .NAP files.

   -   If you installed the VSE800.NAP to the
       Repository before you installed the
       VSE800REPORTS.NAP, the English description is
       not available.

   -   If you installed the VSE800REPORTS.NAP before
       you installed the VSE800.NAP, the English
       description is available.

9.  Disable event filtering in the ePolicy
    Orchestrator Event Filtering policy. VirusScan
    Enterprise generates many event IDs that are not
    listed in the ePolicy Orchestrator filter list.
    To ensure that all VirusScan Enterprise events
    are sent, disable event filtering in the
    policy:

   a.  Log on to the ePolicy Orchestrator Console.

   b.  Under "Reporting," select "ePO Databases" and
       expand it.

   c.  Select the server and log in.

   d.  Select "Events."

   e.  In the right pane, select "Do not filter
       events."

   f.  Click "Apply" to save these settings.

GroupShield

1.  If you plan to use GroupShield in addition to
    VirusScan Enterprise 8.0 and Alert Manager
    4.7.1, be certain to install GroupShield before
    you install Alert Manager. This installation
    sequence is required to ensure alerting works
    correctly.

ProtectionPilot

1.  If you plan to use ProtectionPilot to manage
    VirusScan Enterprise 8.0i, you must use
    Protection Pilot version 1.0 with Patch 1 or
    later.

2.  Checking the VSEREPORTS.NAP file into the
    ProtectionPilot repository may result in an
    "Unspecified error."

    This is a console time-out error which can be
    ignored. The server completes the execution of
    all of the SQL scripts in the .NAP file even if
    the console timed out.

3.  Selective updating does not work with
    ProtectionPilot. This feature is only available
    in ePolicy Orchestrator 3.5 or later.

Third Party Software

1.  Spy Sweeper. If you are using Spy Sweeper to
    scan the VirusScan Enterprise installation
    folder, a false detection occurs when it detects
    BHO.DLL. This file is not spyware; it is a
    component of ScriptScan that is installed as
    part of VirusScan Enterprise.

2.  Microsoft Windows XP with Service Pack 2. If you
    are using Microsoft Windows XP with Service Pack
    2 and plan to manage VirusScan Enterprise with
    ePolicy Orchestrator, the Windows XP Firewall
    will block the ability to do so unless you add
    FRAMEWORKSERVICE.EXE to the Windows XP Firewall
    exclusions whitelist. For information about how
    to do this, refer to the Microsoft Knowledge
    Base Article 842242.

3.  These third party products are not compatible
    with the Buffer Overflow feature of VirusScan
    Enterprise 8.0. If you find it necessary to use
    these products, we recommend that you disable
    the VirusScan Enterprise Buffer Overflow
    feature:

   -   Tiny Personal Firewall

   -   CyberArmour Firewall

   -   Zone Alarm Pro

       NOTE:
       When VirusScan Enterprise 8.0 and Zone Alarm
       Pro are both installed on the same computer,
       Zone Alarm Pro crashes.

   -   BlackIce Firewall

       NOTE: Install VirusScan Enterprise 8.0 before
       you install BlackIce Firewall to ensure they
       are compatible.


ACCESS PROTECTION

1.  Ports associated with known vulnerabilities and
    exploits. Use this link to access a web site
    that provides top lists of exploited TCP ports.

       http://www.us-cert.gov/current/services_ports.html

       NOTE:
       If you cannot access this link by clicking on
       it, copy and paste it into your web browser
       to access the site.

2.  If you disable the on-access scanner, you also
    disable the port blocking rules and the file,
    share, and folder rules that you have
    configured.

3.  If you are using Access Protection in a
    non-English or localized environment, the
    default rules may contain references to folders
    that do not exist on the localized operating
    system. For information about how to fully
    utilize these default rules in this scenario,
    see the VirusScan Enterprise Best Practices
    Guide.


ADDING FILE TYPE EXTENSIONS

1.  If you are using wildcards to specify file type
    extensions in either the Additional File Types
    or Specified File Types dialog boxes, you cannot
    use an asterisk (*) as the wildcard. You must
    use a question mark (?) as the wildcard when
    specifying file type extensions in these
    scenarios.


AUTOUPDATE

1.  Updating from a mapped drive only works if you
    are logged on when the update occurs and you
    have at least read rights to that mapped drive
    location. If no one is logged on to the system,
    or if you are logged on but do not have at least
    read rights to the mapped location, the update
    fails.

2.  When editing the repository list to use a UNC
    path, the "Edit AutoUpdate Repository List"
    dialog box does not validate that the path
    entered is in fact a valid UNC share before
    accepting it. Be sure that you enter a valid UNC
    server, share, and path name. Entering an
    invalid UNC path could cause problems when
    updating from this location.

3.  EXTRA.DAT information in VirusScan Enterprise
    Product Guide. This corrects information in the
    Updating section of the VirusScan Enterprise
    Product Guide.

    In the Updating section under "Activities that
    occur during an update task" it incorrectly
    states:

       "By default, detection for the new virus in
       the EXTRA.DAT is ignored once the new virus
       definition is added to the weekly DAT
       files."

    This should be corrected to state:

       "By default, detection for the new virus in
       the EXTRA.DAT is deleted once the EXTRA.DAT
       expires."

4.  If updating an EXTRA.DAT file manually, for
    example by copying it to the engine folder, you
    must restart the VirusScan Enterprise e-mail,
    on-demand, and on-access scanners before they
    can detect and use the new EXTRA.DAT file.

   -   For E-mail Scan, close and then restart
       Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Domino.

   -   For On-Demand Scan, stop and restart the
       on-demand scanner if it is running, using the
       VirusScan Enterprise Console.

   -   For On-Access Scan, disable and then
       re-enable the On-Access scanner using the
       VirusScan Enterprise Console.

       NOTE:
       Updating EXTRA.DAT files using AutoUpdate
       does not require manually restarting
       scanners.

5.  If you are using content scanning and filtering
    software on your network, you may experience
    some problems with updating. This can occur if
    your content filtering software modifies a
    McAfee update package.


BUFFER OVERFLOW PROTECTION

1.  When the sasser worm or any other malware that
    uses MS04-011 infects your system, the infection
    may result in an exploited buffer overflow. The
    Buffer Overflow Protection feature can detect
    and prevent the buffer overflow code from
    executing on your computer. Although the
    execution of malicious code is prevented, the
    actual buffer overflow is not stopped. If a
    buffer overflow occurs as a result of the sasser
    worm, the LSASS.EXE becomes unstable and the
    computer automatically restarts.

2.  These third party products are not compatible
    with the Buffer Overflow feature of VirusScan
    Enterprise 8.0. If you find it necessary to use
    these products, we recommend that you disable
    the VirusScan Enterprise Buffer Overflow
    feature:

   -   Tiny Personal Firewall

   -   CyberArmour Firewall

   -   Zone Alarm Pro

       NOTE:
       When VirusScan Enterprise 8.0 and Zone Alarm
       Pro are both installed on the same computer,
       Zone Alarm Pro crashes.

   -   BlackIce Firewall

       NOTE: Install VirusScan Enterprise 8.0 before
       you install BlackIce Firewall to ensure they
       are compatible.


LOG FILE FORMAT

1.  The default format for all of the log files is
    Unicode UTF8 except when installing Virus
    Enterprise 8.0 on Windows NT operating systems.
    The default format for log files on Windows NT
    operating systems is ANSI.


LOTUS NOTES

1.  When accessing a local database on Windows 2000
    Server, Windows 2003 Server, or Windows XP, the
    user is prompted for a password. When the user
    types the password, the text search dialog is
    initiated and the password is inserted into the
    text search dialog instead of being inserted
    into the password dialog. The password dialog
    box is not completely modal. Selecting the
    dialog box again allows the user to input the
    password.

    When using Lotus Client Release version 6 or
    later, we recommend that you do not prompt for a
    password from other notes-based programs. To
    select this option follow these steps:

   a.  From Lotus Notes, select File | Preferences |
       Security | User Security | Dialog.

   b.  Select "don?t prompt for a password from
       other notes-based programs."

       NOTE:
       This option is not available on other
       versions of the Lotus Client.

2.  If you are using Microsoft Windows XP and Lotus
    Notes, you will receive a "File not found" error
    when launching Lotus Notes from the Start menu
    or any shortcut that calls upon the default
    e-mail client. For more information about this
    issue see McAfee Knowledge Base Article
    KB37774.


MIRROR TASKS

1.  If you are using a VirusScan Enterprise 8.0
    mirror task to mirror the NAIFTP site, the task
    may fail in two ways. First, the task does not
    mirror 100% of the files on the FTP site. For
    example, if a file is missing on the NAIFTP
    site, the task does not replicate anything other
    than the "current" folder. Second, if you
    configured the schedule to do so, it will
    execute the task again, but will not execute any
    programs that were specified to run after
    successful completion of the task.

       NOTE:
       If the scheduled mirror task is manually
       executed in this scenario, the programs that
       are specified to run after successful
       completion of the task will run.

    We recommend that you use McAfee AutoUpdate
    Architect to create a task to mirror the NAIFTP
    site.


SCANNING

1.  On-Delivery Scanning. When Microsoft Outlook is
    configured to deliver new e-mail to a personal
    folder and rules are used to move e-mails, the
    on-delivery scanner may not detect infected
    e-mails. We do not recommend that you configure
    Microsoft Outlook to deliver new e-mails to a
    personal folder if you use rules to move e-mails
    to other folders in Microsoft Outlook.

2.  On-demand or right-click scanning of compressed
    files. If you are performing an on-demand scan
    or a right-click scan on an infected compressed
    file with the primary action set to "continue"
    (this is the default for right-click scan) and
    the secondary action is set to delete or move,
    the secondary action fails.


UNWANTED PROGRAMS POLICY

1.  Wildcards are not supported when configuring
    user-defined unwanted programs.
