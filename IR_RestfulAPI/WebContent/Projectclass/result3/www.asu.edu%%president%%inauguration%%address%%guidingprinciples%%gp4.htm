If we sequester the scholarship and creativity that characterize         our university, if we build walls around our campuses, we diminish our         own potential, and the magnitude of our contribution to society. ASU has         more than one campus, and the capacity&#8212;and the obligation&#8212;to 
        offer opportunities to as broad a segment of the populace as possible.       </p>      <p>Without exception, academic institutions profess a commitment to excellence.         I believe we should take a commitment to excellence for granted, and demand         more from ourselves. I believe we should recognize and champion diversity,         not for the sake of diversity itself, but because our ideas and our theories         and our practices and our analysis and our solutions to the problems of         both the natural and social world are incomplete and inadequate. We have         not yet found solutions to the problems of poverty and sustainability         and thee long-term viability of capitalism. All of these require new perspectives,         and diversity may be the enabling catalyst. Diversity is the means to         find mechanisms to expand our understandings of the natural and social         world, and to expand our understanding of how to advance these in ways         we cannot yet fully understand. </p>      <p> I believe we should find the mechanisms to be more than a place where         faculty gather with students. I believe we must find mechanisms to project         our knowledge, our willingness to be of value and to learn and to listen         and to offer what we have to broader segments of society. I believe we         should not build walls, but rather bridges, and while this is certainly         a clich&eacute;, it is no longer a clich&eacute; if in fact one can see         those bridges actually carrying traffic&#8212;the traffic of learners         of all ages, from children in elementary school to retirees, somehow connected         to the university and all that it has to offer. </p>      <p> By openness and access I do not mean opening the institution to people         not prepared for college-level education. By openness and access I mean         building a university that is linked to the K-12 educational system, linked         to families, linked to the community to provide mechanisms to enhance         the preparedness of students for college in an effort to increase the         likelihood of their ultimate success.</p>      <p>Openness and access to our learning environment could be regarded as         contrary to academic excellence. Let no one think that I am opposed to         academic excellence. On the contrary, I am its champion, and will demand         excellence from my new colleagues and our students. The building of academic         excellence is the building of an environment where teacher and student         can succeed together. And that is not a function of size. </p>      <p>Openness and access to our learning environment means opportunities for         students once they are already at ASU. We live in a world that is changing         rapidly and becoming increasingly global. A moment ago I spoke of the         desirability of interdisciplinary collaboration in our research. Similarly,         I hope to broaden educational opportunities available to our students.         I would like to encourage students to explore disciplines outside their         major areas. I would like to see physics majors to enroll in courses in         musicology, and students in urban planning enroll in courses in Russian.       </p>      <p>Because we live in a world characterized by an accelerated pace of advances         in scientific knowledge and technological capability, I would like to         see the building of new and broader programs intended to create higher         levels of scientific and technical literacy, as well as higher levels         of technological capability, even for those who do not happen to be gifted         in calculus. I would like to see interested students from all majors enroll         in appropriate courses in the School of Engineering. </p>      <p> Above all, I would like to see our learning environment accessible to         all who are sufficiently prepared, with no financial barriers to students         qualified to attend the university. Only then will we be able to speak         of openness and access to all.</p>      <p></p>      <h2>&nbsp; </h2>      </td>    <td align="center" valign="top"> &nbsp;<BR> </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="bottom"><a href="gp3.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="../images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="../index.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Index</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="../index.htm"><img src="../images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>    <td align="center" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
