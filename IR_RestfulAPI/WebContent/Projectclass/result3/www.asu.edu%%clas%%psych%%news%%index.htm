          <p class="style14">A team of early career prevention scientists from the Department of Psychology at Arizona State University were crowned the winners of the Inaugural Sloboda-Bukowski SPR Cup in a prevention research competition against two other teams of early career prevention scientists from the University of Michigan, and from Penn State University. Members of this team of Arizona State prevention scientists were: Michelle Little, Kevin King, Freda Liu, and Scott Weaver, who represented Arizona State University and also the ASU Prevention Research Center. </p>
          <p class="style14">This first research competition was sponsored by the Society for Prevention Research, a prestigious research society founded in 1991 by Dr. Zili Sloboda and Dr. Bill Bukowski along with a few other leaders in the field of prevention research. Accordingly, this SPR Cup competition was named after these two pioneers in the field of prevention research. Two prevention scientists, Mark Eddy and Charles Martinez, both from the Oregon Social Learning Institute were the organizers of this first SPR Cup competition.</p>
          <p class="style14">This research competition involved taking a major research dataset, the Monitoring the Future dataset, and within a period of a few weeks, conducting all phases of a research project: identifying a research problem, reviewing the literature, developing and testing one or more research hypotheses, and presenting results to a professional audience. Each of the three research teams presented at a session dedicated to this SPR Cup competition. This session was held recently at the 14th Annual Meeting of the Society for Prevention Research in San Antonio, Texas. </p>
          <p><span class="style14">These early career prevention scientists from Arizona State University conducted an analysis of one individual risk factor and its relationship to actual drug use, as mediated by secular tends in social norms regarding the acceptability of drug use when examined yearly across over two decades. The results as presented by each research team were judged by a panel of seven senior prevention scientists, as well as by members of the audience who attended the session in which each of the three teams presented their projects and reported on their results. This team of Arizona State early career scientists thus captured the SPR Cup for 2006, and will be challenged to defend it at next year&rsquo;s 15th Annual Meeting of the Society for Prevention Research, which will be held in Washington DC, in June of 2007. </span></p>

          <p align="left" class="style14"><a href="../people/faculty/bimontenelson.html">Dr. Heather Bimonte-Nelson</a> received her Ph.D. from the University of Connecticut in 2000. Heather&rsquo;s research interests are to characterize the cognitive and brain changes that occur during aging, as well as to develop behavioral, pharmacological, and dietary strategies to attenuate mnemonic and neurobiological age-related alterations using animal models. Towards this goal, one of her primary interests is to determine the roles that sex, hormones, and brain chemistry play in brain function and cognition in young versus aged animals. More recently, her interests incorporate these goals with relevance to Alzheimer&rsquo;s and application of her research questions to the human population via clinical research. Heather&rsquo;s research is currently funded by two research grants from the National Institute on Aging entitled &ldquo;Progesterone, Aging, and Memory Loss&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sex Differences in Factors Influencing Cognitive Aging.&rdquo;</p>
          <p align="left" class="style14"><a href="../people/faculty/apina.htm">Dr. Pi&ntilde;a</a> joins the faculty from Florida International University where he received his doctorate in Applied Developmental Psychology. He studies intra-individual level risk factors in the development of anxiety disorders in youths and the evaluation of psychosocial interventions for use with this population. Dr. Pi&ntilde;a&rsquo;s work integrates Hispanic/Latino ethnocultural and child-adolescent anxiety research and is aimed at developing empirically informed, culture specific assessment and intervention services for the growing Hispanic/Latino population residing in the United States. His publications have appeared in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and the Allied Disciplines, and Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Dr. Pi&ntilde;a is a fellow of the American Psychological Association Minority Fellowship Program and currently serves as an initial review board member. </p>

Craig's primary research focus to date has been concerned with the analysis of missing data, and he has had publications on this topic appear in journals such as Psychological Methods, Multivariate Behavioral Research, and Structural Equation Modeling. In addition to his missing data research, Dr. Enders is also interested in longitudinal modeling, and is currently working on computer simulation studies that examine the behavior of growth mixture models.<br>
