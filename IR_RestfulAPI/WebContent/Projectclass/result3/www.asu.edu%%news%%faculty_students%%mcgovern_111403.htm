      <h2>McGovern earns top professor nod</h2>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/TomMcGovern.jpg" alt="Tom McGovern" width="180" height="258" align="right">        Thomas V. McGovern, professor of psychology at ASU West, has been selected
          as the 2003 Arizona Professor of the Year by the Carnegie Foundation
          for the Advancement of Teaching and the Council for the Advancement
          and Support of Education (CASE). McGovern was selected from among nearly
        400 top professors in the United States.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Professors of the
            Year program salutes outstanding undergraduate instructors who excel
            as teachers and influence the lives and careers
          of their students. McGovern and the other awardees were honored at
        a Nov. 13 luncheon at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>"This
          award is a tremendous acknowledgement of Dr. McGovern's dedication
        to engaging students in the learning process," says ASU President Michael
          Crow. "It reflects the university's commitment to excellence in undergraduate
          education."<br>
        McGovern, who has taught at ASU West since 1990, co-founded the campus'
          Integrative Studies Department. Integrative Studies emphasizes interdisciplinary
          study in the liberal arts, the development of critical thinking skills,
          respect for diversity, and the capacity to synthesize problem-solving
          strategies for life in the 21st century.</p>
      <p>"Tom's courses changed my life,"
          says Maren Fagerman, an integrative studies graduate. "He helped me
        break a lifetime pattern of pleasing
          others and pushed me into a world where I must be authentically me
        to be successful."</p>
      <p>Fagerman changed her major to integrative studies from
        accounting after suffering a major stroke that forced her to relearn
        simple mathematical
        computations. She and McGovern shared the experience of recovering from
        a serious illness; in 1997 McGovern was paralyzed by Guillain Barr&eacute; Syndrome,
        a rare neurological disease that kept him out of the classroom for more
        than a year.</p>
      <p>McGovern wrote "Patients/Patience: A psychologist's rehabilitation
          memoir" about his recovery process, published in The Washington Post.</p>
      <p>"The memoir
          documents a time when this professor became a student again, learning
          how to roll over, to sit up, to eat with a fork, to write with
          a fat pencil, and to walk," McGovern says. "It was a time when I deepened
          my empathy for my students who feel helpless about their basic skills,
          adrift in unfamiliar surroundings, and uncertain about whether to even
          perform the tasks that professionals prescribe for them."</p>
      <p>"Integrative
          Studies graduates, all of whom have taken at least one of Tom's classes,
          have later commented to program reviewers about leaving
          ASU West with an ability to appreciate different modes of thinking,
        to think critically themselves about real issues, and to feel comfortable
          in an increasingly diverse world," says Emily Fourmy Cutrer, dean of
          the ASU West College of Arts and Sciences. </p>
      <p>McGovern has provided campuswide
          leadership at ASU West in establishing learning communities for freshman
          students and in devising methods to
          assess outcomes of student learning. He has served as president of
        the Arizona Faculties Council and representative to the Arizona Board
        of
          Regents.</p>
      <p>Nationally recognized in the field of psychology, McGovern is
          a Fellow of the American Psychological Association (APA). </p>
      <p>McGovern is the second
          ASU West professor chosen as Arizona Professor of the Year. Vincent
        Waldron, professor of communication studies, earned
        the award in 1996.</p>
      <p>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching
          was founded in 1905 by Andrew Carnegie and is the only advanced-study
          center for teachers
        in the world and the third-oldest foundation in the nation. </p>
      <p>CASE is the
          largest international association of educational institutions, with
        more than 3,200 colleges, universities and independent elementary
        and secondary schools in nearly 50 countries.</p>
