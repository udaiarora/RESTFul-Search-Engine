<h1 class="storyhead">Graduate Partners in Science Education: Community outreach program takes mask off science for youths</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>One of ASU's newest community outreach programs, Graduate Partners in Science Education, is changing the face of science education in urban public schools. </p>
<p>The program is the brainchild of graduate students Nathan (Nate) Morehouse and Jon Davis in the School of Life Sciences. </p>
<p>Davis and Morehouse's program aims to bolster science and technology education for students from under-represented and economically challenged groups in downtown Phoenix. This year, their program matched eight graduate student mentors from the School of Life Sciences with teachers Karen Griff and Keith Brazier, and 45 seventh- and eighth-grade students from Phoenix Preparatory Academy. </p>
<p><img src="images/20060623_gpse.jpg" width="305" height="421" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">?I think that GPSE has been an awesome opportunity,? says Griff, a science educator for the last 17 years. ?It opened new experiences for the students in investigative research and with their mentors. The students are really close to their mentors. The kids could count on them. That is really important for these kids. They don't like change.? </p>
<p>Griff says urban children see more challenges than their counterparts in schools in the suburbs. There are more frequent transfers in and out of classes for them. Many students have a parent working two jobs, and the whole family lives under socially and economically difficult circumstances. One student participant lives with her family in a homeless shelter. </p>
<p>Davis can identify with that. </p>
<p>?I grew up in the Phoenix school system,? he says. ?One of the reasons I wanted to do this sort of program is because I've been in these kids' shoes, and I understand how education can give you that route out.? </p>
<p>Adds Morehouse: ?I think it was a real shock for them to see what we looked like. We were young people, sort of normal, with earrings. We are just pulling the mask off science a bit. We're showing that scientists are just normal people who are pursuing something that they feel passionate about.? </p>
<p>The graduate partners program has opened lots of new doors, from hands-on research to tours through Papago Park, natural history collections and laboratories at ASU, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and the Translational Genomics Research Institute. </p>
<p>Their final field trip is particularly special; teachers, students and mentors will go to San Diego and go aboard Sea World's marine science research ship ? something not usually available to the public. </p>
<p>?Our kids don't get exposed to much science before coming here,? notes John Ewing, principal of Phoenix Preparatory Academy. ?Having this direction is the chance of a lifetime. They don't realize it now, but someday they will know.? </p>
<p>Part of the training that the children receive is how to present their research findings. Students draw up graphs, figures, hypotheses and produce a poster display. A poster session is held in April showcasing the work they've done since October. Seventeen posters were displayed this year. </p>
<p>Mentor Melissa Meadows guided the project, ?Hermit Crab Behavior,? by Giberto Vega and Chelsey Schaff, who came with her little sisters. </p>
<p>Mentor Bethany Cutts directed ?Stationing the Armies,? about ant behavior, by Noe Garcia, Christian Carter and Jessie Henshaw. </p>
<p>?Fish Scale Development: How Scales Grow with Age,? was put together by Camden Jernigan, Bryce Craig and Mitchell Burnett. With guidance from Morehouse, the group identified a project, used the scientific approach to test their theory, and analyzed their results. </p>
<p>Bryce's mother, Marklyn Craig, owner of the Way Hot coffee shop on 16th Street and McDowell Road , watched as Bryce described his project to interested viewers. </p>
<p>?Bryce transferred here because I heard about the science program at Phoenix Preparatory Academy,? his mother says. ?He talks about Nate like nobody's business. I think Nate has the patience of Job.? </p>
<p>Craig touches on an aspect of mentoring that has nothing to do with test tubes, diagrams, or data analysis: the bonds of trust and faith that form between the students and their mentors. </p>
<p>Some of the youths put it differently. </p>
<p>?They are fun, smart, guys,? says Edith Cuarenta, an eighth-grade student mentored by Davis who's interested in becoming a pediatrician ?I'm really glad they came. I wasn't really interested in science, and now I realize it's fun.? </p>
