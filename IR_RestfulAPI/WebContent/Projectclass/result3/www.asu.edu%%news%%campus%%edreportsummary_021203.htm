      <h2>Recruiting, Preparing and Retaining High Quality Teachers: An Empirical 
        Synthesis </h2>
      <p class="endnote"><strong>Executive Summary</strong></p>
      <p>Quality education rests largely on finding and keeping good teachers. 
        Yet, many teachers leave the profession, whether because of frustration 
        with the system or planned retirements. There is reason to believe that 
        a teaching shortage will exist during the next six years as the teachers' 
        pool ages and K-12 enrollments increase.</p>
      <p>In addition to retirements, staffing difficulties are associated with 
        inadequate salaries, student discipline, student motivation, and in high 
        poverty urban schools, lack of opportunities for advancement and environments 
        perceived as unsafe.</p>
      <p>Further complicating the matter of teacher supply and demand are factors 
        such as the reduction in class sizes, a federal requirement for "highly 
        qualified" teachers, the trend toward reduced teacher autonomy, and the 
        pressures associated with high-stakes testing. </p>
      <p>High Quality Teachers </p>
      <p>Arguments persist over how to define the characteristics of a good teacher. 
        For example, it is not clear that a person's content knowledge, math test 
        scores, verbal skills, or enthusiasm for learning, mark a person as likely 
        to be a "successful" teacher.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the appropriate indicators of quality might well depend on 
        the circumstances and the context of the teaching. </p>
      <p>Methods used to measure quality are similarly controversial. The most 
        frequently used indicators of teacher quality are imprecise. There are, 
        for example, many ways of defining "content knowledge." Compounding the 
        problem is that some of the indicators used to signify complex phenomena, 
        such as "student achievement," are inadequate. Student achievement may 
        be defined in a variety of ways and many forces that affect student achievement 
        lie outside the control of the school.</p>
      <p> The complexity of teaching and the long list of possible indicators 
        of quality suggest that there should be no single model of teacher preparation. 
      </p>
      <p>Recruiting, Preparing and Retaining High Quality Teachers </p>
      <p>Among the approaches currently used to recruit teachers are improved 
        salaries, community college programs, and outreach to students in high 
        school to encourage them to pursue teaching as a career.</p>
      <p> It has also been suggested that fewer state-specific certification laws 
        would facilitate teacher transfers and the reentry of those returning 
        after an absence from the profession. Offering sign-up bonuses and forgivable 
        loans, as well as portable seniority guarantees can increase the attractiveness 
        of the teaching profession. Wider collaboration between community colleges 
        and Colleges of Education would facilitate the entrance of minority students 
        into the profession.</p>
      <p> Arguments continue about matters such as whether certified teachers 
        do better than "under-certified" teachers; the importance of verbal skills; 
        the role of salary levels in attracting and retaining teachers; the assignment 
        of higher priority to retention of teachers, and the use of mentoring 
        as a means of encouraging new teachers, especially in urban schools.</p>
      <p align="center" class="endnote"><strong>Recommendations </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Teacher Recruitment </strong></p>
      <p>&middot; Salaries matter-Colleges of Education should be strong and consistent 
        advocates for adequate teacher salaries. <br>
        &middot; Colleges of Education at four-year institutions of higher education 
        should seek to establish collaborative programs with community colleges 
        to recruit new teachers. Community colleges are preparing an increasing 
        proportion of teachers and they enroll a large number of minority students. 
        Four-year institutions, on the other hand, have expertise and connections 
        not found in the community college environment. Partnerships would prove 
        mutually beneficial.</p>
      <p>&middot; Colleges of Education should establish programs to encourage 
        high school students to consider careers as teachers.</p>
      <p><strong>Teacher Preparation </strong></p>
      <p>&middot; Colleges of Education should seek to develop training programs 
        that reflect complex models of teacher quality. Research clearly shows 
        that teaching cannot be reduced to a few indicators of quality that transcend 
        all situational variations.</p>
      <p>&middot; Colleges of Education should seek to develop programs that will 
        ease the transition from the lecture hall to the classroom. Such programs 
        might well include beginning teacher induction programs that match new 
        teachers with experienced ones.</p>
      <p><strong>Teacher Retention</strong> </p>
      <p>&middot; Colleges of Education should, in collaboration with school districts, 
        develop programs to improve the retention of existing teachers. Reducing 
        turnover of existing teachers would greatly reduce the difficulties in 
        finding new teachers. </p>
      <p>In the short term, this may be the single most effective strategy for 
        reducing the need for new teachers. </p>
