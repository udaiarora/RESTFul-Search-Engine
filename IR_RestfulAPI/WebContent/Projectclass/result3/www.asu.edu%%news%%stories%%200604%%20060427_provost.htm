<h1 class="storyhead">ASU announces 3 finalists for provost position </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>Three finalists for the position of university provost and executive vice president for academic affairs - all distinguished scholars, and all with significant university management experience - will visit ASU May 4 - 9 for town halls that will be open to the campus community. </p>
<p>The finalists were recommended by a search committee led by Sander Van Der Leeuw, director of the School of Human Evolution &amp; Social Change, to replace Milton Glick, who will be stepping down from that post to assume a new role as University Professor in July. </p>
<p>The provost is ASU's chief academic officer, providing leadership to the university's campuses and academic programs and fostering excellence in research, teaching, and service to the community. The provost represents the university to external agencies and constituencies and engages in ASU's fundraising initiatives. </p>

<p>As the chief academic officer of the university, the provost provides leadership to the university's mission of providing educational excellence, access and impact. The provost also directs the university's efforts in strategic redesign of its academic programs to achieve the vision of the New American University. </p>
<p>The three candidates are: </p>
<p>. Ilene Busch-Vishniac, former dean of the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University . </p>
<p>. Elizabeth Capaldi, vice chancellor and chief of staff at the State University of New York, Albany . </p>
<p>. Linda Sheryl Greene, former associate vice chancellor for faculty and staff programs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. </p>
<p>Busch-Vishniac, who is a professor of mechanical engineering at Johns Hopkins, earned her doctoral degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She was a professor at the University of Texas-Austin from 1982 - 1998. </p>
<p>In her five years as dean of the Whiting School of Engineering, Busch-Vishniac supervised a school with 1,275 undergraduate and 400 graduate students, and a budget of $130 million to $150 million. </p>
<p>During her tenure, the school enjoyed a 25 percent growth in undergraduate enrollment and a 5 percent increase in the number of faculty. Research dollars grew by more than 85 percent. She also oversaw the establishment of numerous interdisciplinary centers, increasing the number from three to more than 20. </p>
<p>Busch-Vishniac, a strong supporter of diversity, also recruited the first African-American scholar for the engineering program. </p>
<p>She has served as president-elect, president and past president of her professional society, the Acoustical Society of America, the largest acoustic society in the world. </p>
<p>Bush-Vishniac's research interest is transduction and noise control. Her noise-control work has centered on the effective design of highway noise barriers, and a new project focuses on the noise environment in hospitals. </p>
<p>Bush-Vishniac said she is motivated to be a candidate for provost of ASU because of her "sense that this is just the sort of extraordinary opportunity I see. ASU has articulated a bold, new strategic plan which has the potential to redefine the role of higher education in the United States." </p>
<p>She adds: "I believe the big challenges for public institutions are to develop strong, open and supportive relationships with the state legislature, to both influence and be influenced by the local community, and to develop some of the entrepreneurial spirit that is present at the private universities without sacrificing openness and accountability. ASU seems to have considered these issues in crafting their strategic plan and is thus very attractive to me." </p>
<p>Greene earned her law degree at the University of California-Berkeley. Her career has included stints as a civil rights attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, counsel for the United State Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and as senior adviser for the Dukakis for President's California campaign. </p>
<p>She is the Evjue-Bascom professor of Law at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Law. </p>
<p>After spending a year as a visiting endowed chair at West Virginia University's College of Law in 1992, Greene returned to Madison, where she was sought out as a legal and political analyst. She conducted a radio show on the Supreme Court and became the only legal and political analyst for Wisconsin Public Television. </p>
<p>Greene co-founded the regional People of Color Legal scholarship Conference, which provided scholarly development and mentoring to legal scholars throughout the Midwest. </p>
<p>As associate vice chancellor in Wisconsin, she played an instrumental role in the development of several key initiatives, including Cluster Hire, which developed the process to allocate 150 new faculty lines in interdisciplinary faculty clusters for collaborative teaching and research. </p>
<p>Greene also is interested in sports and the arts. She was vice chair of the audit committee of the U.S. Olympic Committee from 1997 - 2001 and is a co-founder of Black Women in Sports Foundation. As an athlete, she has participated in numerous track and field events since 1963. </p>
<p>She also is a member of the board of trustees of the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art. </p>
<p>Greene is interested in coming to ASU because she would like to have "a role with greater impact, and she is intrigued by what she has heard about ASU and President Michael Crow." </p>
<p>Elizabeth Capaldi earned her doctoral degree in experimental psychology, with an emphasis on animal learning, from the University of Texas-Austin. </p>
<p>Before joining the State University of New York, she was provost at the University at Buffalo, SUNY, and the University of Florida. She also has taught and held administrative positions at Purdue University. </p>
<p>At Buffalo, she stepped into a situation where several faculties had just been brought together, unhappily, and they had completed a "no-confidence" vote in the president. The community also had a love-hate relationship with the university. </p>
<p>She worked on finding resources for the new cluster of arts and sciences, hired a new dean, and sought to strengthen relationships with the community. This goal was met, in part, by obtaining a commitment from the governor to create a center of excellence in bioinformatics that would call upon the university's medical center and computing strengths. </p>
<p>The center is helping to build a new economy in what had been a dying city. </p>
<p>Her role as assistant to the president of the University of Florida, from 1991 - 1996, involved a great deal of problem-solving. Upon investigating the reason for long lines at student registration, she discovered that there was no enrollment planning for majors, so required courses often were not available and departments could not anticipate their needs. </p>
<p>She also implemented the tracking system known as Measuring University Performance System (MUPS), aimed at improving the timeliness and efficiency of university operations, which received a $5 million grant from the Florida Legislature. </p>
<p>Capaldi is interested in joining ASU because she "sees the distinctiveness of what ASU is undertaking and believes that her own thoughts about higher education are in close alignment." She is described as "a builder who likes to make things happen." </p>
<p>"I would like to commend Sander Van Der Leeuw and the search committee for excellent work in obtaining three finalists of this caliber," Crow says. "The position of executive vice president and provost is singularly important to the success of this institution. I am pleased with the prospect of working with one of these three individuals in leading ASU in achieving our objectives."</p>
