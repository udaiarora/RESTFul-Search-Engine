ASU:&nbsp; What do we need to become?</strong></h1>      <h2><strong>i.&nbsp; Aspirational peers:&nbsp; public metropolitan research          universities </strong></h2>      <p><font size="2">ASU is a public metropolitan research university, and,          as such, the profile of our student body, the character of our research          enterprise, and the scope of our community engagement must differ from          that of other institutions.&nbsp; Peer institutions in the United States&mdash;large        public metropolitan research universities&mdash;represent a unique institutional        type, distinct from most land grant universities and other comprehensive        academic institutions, as well as technical institutes, medical schools,        and state colleges.&nbsp; Prominent among this category of institution        are the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); the University        of Washington; the University of Texas, Austin; the University of Minnesota;        and Ohio State University.&nbsp; Each draws on the unique advantages        of being situated in the heart of a diverse urban environment, and each        contributes to the prosperity and advancement of their regions. </font></p>      <p><font size="2">ASU is striving to become competitive as a national university.&nbsp; Its        success in attracting the best faculty and students, competitive research        funding, and greater levels of private investment would be enhanced by        attaining recognition as a national research university.&nbsp; The national        standing ASU seeks can only be attained by improving our ranking in comparative        categories, such as those utilized by the Association of American Universities        (AAU) and the National Research Council (NRC).&nbsp; We must measure        progress not against our past performance, but against the objective        standard of the accomplishments of national research universities.&nbsp; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">The Lombardi Program on Measuring University Performance,          commonly referred to as The Center, is a respected institutional research          group based at the University of Florida.&nbsp; In their annual report, <em>The Top        American Research Universities</em>, the group gathers and compares objective        data about the top private and public American research universities        in nine categories:&nbsp; total research support, federal research support,        endowment assets, annual giving, faculty membership in the national academies,        faculty awards, doctorates granted, postdoctoral appointees, and median        SAT scores.&nbsp; Among public research universities in the second tier        (26-50) that receive over $20 million in federal research funding, ASU        ranked in only three categories:&nbsp; faculty awards, private support,        and the number of doctorates granted.<a href="endnotes.html#_ftn9"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp; ASU        did not achieve a single superior ranking in the most recent evaluation        of graduate programs produced by the National Research Council (1993),        and in categories established by the AAU, ASU is recognized only for        the quality of its faculty. </font></p>      <p><font size="2">Increased potential for ASU to attain national status          comes from dramatically increasing research infrastructure in all fields,          from the arts to the humanities to the sciences to engineering.&nbsp; With current plans to        add over one million square feet of research space within the next few        years, space on the crowded Tempe campus is at a premium.&nbsp; With        projected enrollment increases, ASU can only accommodate additional students        at the other campus locations.&nbsp; Greater research productivity will        also be facilitated by a flexible university design that encourages the        formation of interdisciplinary research groups.&nbsp; ASU will also attract        better faculty and students with new facilities that can be built at        sites other than the Tempe campus.&nbsp; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">But as the only major research university in the heart          of one of the most rapidly urbanizing metropolitan areas in the nation,          a region marked by explosive population growth, unprecedented demographic          change, rapid development, and environmental trends that threaten its          sustainability, ASU bears the additional responsibility of providing          leadership for a region that lags far behind comparable metropolitan          areas in several leading indicators.&nbsp; Numerous measures of educational performance        and outcomes in metropolitan Phoenix and Arizona are not only below average,        but rank near the bottom nationally.&nbsp; Arizona ranks last for the        rate of high school completion, for example.&nbsp; And in terms of the        educational attainment of its adult population, Arizona lags far behind        most metropolitan regions.&nbsp; The regional economy has yet to evolve        to an appreciable degree from one that is resource-based and service        oriented to one that is knowledge-driven and competitive.&nbsp; And the        long-term environmental sustainability of the region remains in serious        jeopardy.&nbsp; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">As a consequence of investment in research infrastructure,          a dramatic acceleration of the research enterprise, and the recruitment          of prominent faculty, the contributions of ASU are expected to receive          increasing national and international recognition in the coming decades.&nbsp; The        attainment of such recognition is sought because it increases access        to federal funding and private investment, possibilities for collaboration        with top tier institutional partners, as well as the ability of the university        to attract and retain the best students and faculty.&nbsp; Along with        other honors, the consummate institutional recognition that comes with        election to membership in the Association of American Universities (AAU),        the prestigious association of 62 leading North American research universities,        is therefore an explicit institutional goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>      <h2><strong>ii</strong><strong>.&nbsp; Aspirational Goals:&nbsp; Design          Imperatives for a New American University&nbsp; </strong></h2>      <p><font size="2">ASU is one of our nation&rsquo;s youngest major research institutions,        and is positioning itself to emerge as a prominent national university.&nbsp; The        transformation of ASU from an important regional university to one of        our nation&rsquo;s leading public metropolitan research universities        is guided by the vision of an institution that measures its academic        quality by the education that its graduates have received rather than        the academic credentials of its incoming freshman class; one at which        researchers, while pursuing their scholarly interests, also consider        the public good; one that does not just engage in community service,        but rather takes on major responsibility for the economic, social, and        cultural vitality of its community.&nbsp; These tenets, first proposed        in the inaugural policy paper, &ldquo;A New American University:&nbsp; The        New Gold Standard,&rdquo; guide an effort to spur the evolution of an        institutional form rooted in the past.<a href="endnotes.html#_ftn10"><sup>10</sup></a></font></p>      <p><font size="2">In response to a new era marked by unprecedented demographic          change, and quantum leaps in scientific discovery and technological          innovation, ASU will endeavor to create a unique institutional profile          and serve as a model for other large research universities.&nbsp; The concept of        the New American University serves as a new model for the American research        university, one that breaks the mold that has constrained these institutions.&nbsp; The        reconceptualization of ASU will be consistent with the vision of the        institution as a prototype for the New American University&nbsp; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">The eight &ldquo;design imperatives&rdquo; of the inaugural policy paper        represent new standards&mdash;or guiding principles&mdash;by which to        measure the progress of the institution (Appendix A).&nbsp; The reconceptualization        of the university must be consistent with the design imperatives of the        New American University, intended to advance the status of the institution        to the ranks of research universities of national standing. </font></p>      <p><font size="2">As more fully set out in <a href="appendixa.html">Appendix A,</a> the design process of the university        will serve to foster teaching, research, and public service that </font></p>      <ol>        <li>leverages the location of the university in a burgeoning metropolitan            region in the American Southwest (<strong>&ldquo;ASU must embrace            its cultural, socioeconomic, and physical setting&rdquo;</strong>); </li>        <li>underscores the role of ASU as a preeminent catalyst for societal              change to transform society, improve the human condition, foster          sustained social advancement and economic growth, and promote responsible          planetary stewardship (<strong>&ldquo;ASU must become a force, and          not only a place&rdquo;</strong>);</li>        <li>&nbsp;promotes the intellectual capital of ASU as both the source            of the institution&rsquo;s potential to transform society and its            economic prosperity through the commercialization of its research            (<strong>&ldquo;a            culture of academic enterprise&rdquo;</strong>); </li>        <li>balances the need for, and importance of, continuing basic research,              i.e., fundamental discovery, with a research agenda focused on          addressing actual and immediate problems (<strong>&ldquo;Pasteur&rsquo;s          Principle&rdquo;</strong>); </li>        <li>focuses on outcome-determined excellence (<strong>&ldquo;a              focus on the individual&rdquo;</strong>); </li>        <li>advances knowledge through interdisciplinary scholarship (<strong>&ldquo;intellectual                fusion&rdquo;</strong>); </li>        <li>assumes major responsibility for the economic, social, and cultural              vitality of the region (<strong>&ldquo;social embeddedness&rdquo;</strong>); </li>        <li>promotes international collaboration, exploration, and understanding              (<strong>&ldquo;global engagement&rdquo;</strong>).&nbsp; </li>      </ol>      <p><font size="2">As a New American University, ASU will be an institution          that offers openness and access to as broad a segment of the populace          as possible.&nbsp; ASU        will foster creativity and generate new knowledge, and disseminate that        knowledge as widely as possible, serving students, the local community,        and the larger national and global communities. &nbsp;ASU will be an        institution that is inclusive rather than exclusive, and its success        will be measured not by who the university <em>excludes</em>, but rather        by who the university <em>includes</em>.</font></p>      <p><font size="2">The objective of the reconceptualization of the university          is to build a world-class institution here in the American Southwest,          one that will prove of lasting value to the state and nation in the          centuries ahead.&nbsp; In        seeking to become a major research institution of national rank, ASU        will serve as a prototype for the New American University. </font></p>      </div>    <!-- InstanceEndEditable --> </div> </td>    <td width="20%" rowspan="3" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#FFCC33"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="RightColumn" -->      <table width="85%"  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">        <tr>          <td align="left" valign="middle"><a href="section1.html" class="nodecor"><img src="../images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="10" height="13" hspace="2" border="0" align="absmiddle"> <font color="#000000" size="2">Back </font></a></td>          <td align="right" valign="middle"><a href="section3.html" class="nodecor"><font color="#000000" size="2">Next</font> </a><a href="section3.html"><img src="../images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="10" height="13" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>        </tr>      </table>    <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->      <div class="indent">        <p><font color="#222222"><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=1><BR>      <img src="../images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="3" hspace="0" vspace="0"></FONT></font> </p>    </div></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</td>    <td bgcolor="#FFCC33">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td rowspan="2">&nbsp;</td>    <td colspan="3" align="right" valign="middle" bgcolor="#CCCC99"> <img src="http://www.asu.edu/president/images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="2" hspace="0" vspace="0"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td colspan="3" align="right" valign="bottom"> <p class="smallbold"><a href="http://www.asu.edu/copyright"><font color="#666666">Copyright    and Trademark Statement</font></a> | <a href="http://www.asu.edu/president/contact/"><font color="#666666">Contact</font></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
