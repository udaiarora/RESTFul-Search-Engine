      <h2>Lockheed Martin gift helps ASUSat Lab reach for stars</h2>
      <p> Lockheed Martin representatives have presented the last installment 
        of a five-year, $150,000 gift to the ASUSat Lab. </p>
      <p>Under the direction of Helen Reed, professor of aerospace engineering, 
        high school through Ph.D. students in the ASUSat Lab create small satellites 
        that perform a wide range of tasks. Lockheed-Martin became involved with 
        the ASUSat Lab six years ago when students were building ASUSat1, a 13-pound 
        nanosatellite launched in January 2000. </p>
      <p>"It was very interesting to us because they were creating a satellite 
        that would actually be launched," said Steve Lasswell, Engineering &amp; 
        Technology, Lockheed Martin Management &amp; Data Systems. "Also, the 
        program is driven by students, not a professor."</p>
      <p>Students are responsible for every aspect of each satellite project, 
        from the initial design to documentation and safety checks. </p>
      <p>The ASUSat Lab's main focus for the past few years has been Three Corner 
        Sat, a collaborative project with New Mexico State University and the 
        University of Colorado at Boulder. The three-satellite constellation will 
        perform formation flying, stereoscopic imaging of clouds and other atmospheric 
        structures, and end-to-end command and data handling. The satellite was 
        scheduled for launch from the space shuttle later this year or early in 
        2004, but the timetable is now unknown.</p>
      <p>"Students get to see how things are done in the real world," said Lauren 
        Egan, program manager for Three Corner Sat and a senior in chemical engineering. 
        "They apply what they learn in class to the real thing, and have to deal 
        with the same regulations anyone would."</p>
      <p>With the completion of Three Corner Sat, the ASUSat Lab team has turned 
        its attention to several new projects, including ASUSat3, which will carry 
        payloads for UCLA and the Air Force research Laboratories; BalloonSat, 
        a high altitude balloon that will test systems for other satellites; and 
        CubeSat, a fully functional satellite contained in a cube four inches 
        on each side. </p>
      <p>The ASUSat Lab also performs community outreach by doing presentations 
        at local junior high and high schools and Valley events. The lab is supported 
        by the NASA Space Grant program, the NASA University Education Research 
        Technology Institute for Cell Mimetic Space Exploration, the Air Force 
        Office of Scientific Research, and several industry sponsors.</p>
      <p>The Lockheed Martin gift, which has included $25,000 from the corporate 
        office and $5,000 from the local office each year, has primarily been 
        used to buy equipment for the ASUSat Lab. In addition to their financial 
        support, Lockheed Martin employees have helped students with their design 
        reviews and have given talks about what it is like in the "real world."</p>
      <p>"The requirements that U.S. technology companies have for new engineers 
        and scientists are far greater than the number of students who graduate 
        with these degrees. We work at the college, high school and grade school 
        levels to interest students in math, science, and ultimately engineering," 
        Lasswell said. "Our partnership with the ASU satellite lab has been an 
        excellent one for both sides."</p>

        reached at (480) 965-5854 or (linley.hall@asu.edu).<br>
