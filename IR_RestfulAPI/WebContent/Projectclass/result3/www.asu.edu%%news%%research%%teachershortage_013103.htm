      <h2>Shattering the shortage - Report challenges conventional wisdom on teacher 
        availability</h2>
      <p> For years, Arizona educators and policy leaders have decried a shortage 
        of K-12 teachers. However, according to a report being released by ASU's 
        Morrison Institute for Public Policy, Arizona may actually have a very 
        small overall teacher surplus between now and the year 2010.</p>
      <p><img src="research_images/tscover_013103.jpg" width="180" height="233" align="right">The 
        new study, "Is There A Teacher Shortage? Demand And Supply in Arizona" 
        is the first comprehensive analysis of supply and demand for certified 
        teachers in Arizona. The study's researchers "did the numbers." They examined 
        the projected output of Arizona's teacher training institutions, analyzed 
        the prospects for certified teachers moving into the state, interviewed 
        hundreds of currently certified but inactive teachers and projected Arizona's 
        student population to the year 2010. </p>
      <p>In the end, the study corroborates recent national evidence that the 
        dire overall teacher shortage that was predicted is not materializing 
        per se.</p>
      <p>"Until the Morrison Institute study, the nature and extent of teacher 
        supply and demand in Arizona was not well understood. However, their data 
        provide an important new tool for teacher recruitment and training and 
        also for understanding several issues that affect a teacher's classroom 
        experience," said Penny Kotterman, president of the Arizona Education 
        Association. </p>
      <p>However, the Morrison Institute study does show that, despite an overall 
        small surplus to 2010, shortages are both present and expected in certain 
        situations. For example, teaching positions in some fast growing and rural 
        areas of the state and in some specialty fields such as special education 
        and Limited English Proficiency are not being filled.</p>
      <p>"One of the reasons that a comprehensive study like this has not been 
        done before is the difficulty in collecting data for the different components 
        of teacher demand and supply," said Morrison Institute Policy Analyst 
        Rebecca Gau, who is the primary author of the report. "The assistance 
        from several state agencies, school districts and Arizona's teacher training 
        institutions was vital."</p>
      <p>A new, statewide survey presented in the report focused on why certified 
        but inactive teachers in Arizona left (or never entered) the classroom. 
        Surprisingly, while salary is a factor in such decisions, the "conditions 
        of education" turned out to be even more important. This survey also found 
        that as much as one-third of this pool would seriously consider teaching 
        again if conditions, especially in the classroom, were changed.</p>
      <p>"There's strong agreement among Arizona policy leaders and residents 
        alike that improving the quality of public education should be the state's 
        number one priority. And, there's no surer way to reach that goal than 
        by having a sufficient number of well qualified teachers," said Rob Melnick, 
        director of the Morrison Institute and a co-author of the report. </p>
      <p>The report recommends policy changes in the areas of teacher production 
        and recruitment, compensation, classroom environment, and data tracking.</p>
      <p>The report will be the centerpiece of discussion at the upcoming State 
        Forum on Teacher Education in Arizona - an invitational meeting of state 
        leaders that is being convened by ASU's College of Education on Feb. 14. 
        Michael Crow, ASU president; Susan Sclafani, counselor to the secretary 
        of Education/U.S. Department of Education; and Tom Horne, Arizona superintendent 
        of Public Instruction are scheduled to make remarks at the forum.</p>
      <p>Morrison Institute for Public Policy is a part of the School of Public 
        Affairs (College of Public Programs) at ASU.</p>
