      <h2>ASU creates grant from tuition revenue for students</h2>
      <p>        During these next few weeks ASU will be sending out a large mailing to
          incoming freshmen and returning students with information about their
          financial aid packages. Some students will be awarded an "ASU Grant,"
      a new grant created from revenue set aside from the tuition increase.</p>
      <p>"This
            is all going to students based on their financial need," says Diane
            Stemper, director of ASU's Student Financial Assistance Office. "Hopefully
            this will
    give more students the ability to enroll or continue taking classes at ASU."</p>
      <p>Each
    year Arizona Board of Regents policy requires that ASU set aside 8 percent
    of its tuition revenue to award to students who demonstrate financial need.
    The funds are traditionally distributed as "University Grants," with awards
    ranging from $400 to $2,000. </p>
      <p>Stemper says this year, because of the tuition
    hike and a change in the amount set aside for grants to 14 percent of tuition
    revenues, the amount available
    for grants has increased by approximately $12 million. </p>
      <p>"These new funds will
    be awarded to the 'neediest of the needy students,' who tend to be Pell grant
    recipients," she says. "They will be called the 'ASU
    Grant' and will be awarded in addition to the 'University Grants' to qualifying
    students. Individual grants may range as high as $1,500 for the new funds."</p>
      <p>On
    March 6 the Arizona Board of Regents voted 9-0 in favor of raising ASU tuition
    $1,000 for resident and nonresident undergraduate students and $1,200 for
        resident and nonresident graduate students for the 2003 - 04 academic
        year.</p>
      <p>Stemper says
    the tuition increase has raised questions from many students and their families,
    who are struggling financially to pay for school. She hopes
    the information packages about the "ASU Grant" will help answer their questions.</p>
      <p>"It's
    important to deliver on the promise that was made by our administration to
    assist and provide students the opportunity to attend ASU," she says. "We
    don't take this subject lightly, because we are dealing with a person's future,
    financial situation and their chance to evolve through the education system." </p>
      <p>Stemper says there are currently a little more than 20,000 applications
        on file for the 2003 - 04 academic year. Each application will be considered
        for
    all grant funds, including the new grant. Students who still need additional
    financial assistance may be offered workstudy and student loans as an option.</p>
      <p>"Again,
    it's based on who demonstrated the most financial need when they applied,"
    Stemper says. "As is always the case, early applicants have the best chance
    of receiving funds."<br>
      </p>
      <p>A list of outside scholarships is available online at: (www.asu.edu/fa/scholarships/index.html).
    Scholarships are listed in five categories: freshmen scholarships, tuition
    waiver scholarships, departmental/college scholarships, private scholarships
    and community scholarships. Deadlines for applications vary.<br>
    Information on academic loans is available online at: (www.asu.edu/fastt/loans/dirinfo.html).  </p>
