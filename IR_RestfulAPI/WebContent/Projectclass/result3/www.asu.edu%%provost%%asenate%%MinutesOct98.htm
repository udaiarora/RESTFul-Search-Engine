<P>&#9;3.A  Senate President's Report </B>(William Davey).</P>



<P>&#9;During the spring semester of 1998 under a directive from the Provost, the School of Social Work was instructed to review alternatives to remaining as a freestanding school.  A September 1998 deadline was established on what would happen to the school.  During the ensuing months the School of Social Work held many discussions with Main campus deans, ASU West, and the provosts.  External consultants were brought in to facilitate the discussion within the School of Social Work.  A recommendation by the School of Social Work was transmitted to the Provost suggesting affiliation with the College of Public Programs at ASU Main.  The students in the School of Social Work have supported the faculty in their decision to affiliate with the College of Public Programs.  The College of Public Programs faculty assembly endorsed this recommendation.  The Arizona Board of Regents and university policies require that a transfer of this type be announced to the Academic Senate as an information item and that the university will submit the proposed transfer to the Executive Director of the Arizona Board of Regents.  I am happy to announce that ASU will submit the necessary paperwork to the Executive Director this week.   Dr. Elizabeth Segal is here today to respond to any questions you may have.</P>



<P>&#9;Dr. Segal: We have been feeling our way through the transition; it has been a difficult process but I hope the solution is very workable.  We are pleased that the College of Public Programs has affirmed our recommendation.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senator Escobar: I hope that School of Social Work will continue to have the same strong community outreach efforts.  </P>



<P>Dr. Segal: Yes.  That is our mission.</P>



<P>Senator Escobar: This is something very important to the Department of Chicana/o Studies because we are also very community orientated and wish to continue our common outreach efforts.</P>



<P>&#9;Senate President Davey: The Arizona Board of Regents has not had a meeting since the last Senate meeting.  They will meet on November 19 and 20 at ASU main campus in the Memorial Union.  Any of you who wish to attend that meeting please feel free to do so.  The Board will be holding a tuition hearing (a statewide hearing) transmitted by indirect TV to all the universities.  The hearing will be held in the College of Business building on November 5.  We really do not know yet how much of a tuition increase will be recommended; there seem to be rumors of around 3%.</P>



<P>&#9;The second issue the Board will consider is the results of a committee that has been working for several months now to consolidate all of the measurements that are being used to evaluate the universities.  The hope is to simplify the measures and to develop a more standardized approach.  It will require some modification of the Hurwitz measures, a simplification of those, and it is also is an attempt to achieve greater consistency by making the measures similar among the universities, so that a more comparable synthesis can be made on the university report card.  </P>



<P>&#9;Lastly, the Board will set tuition for the next year.  </P>



<P>&#9;A draft of the university's whistleblower policy has been distributed by the Office of the General Counsel to central administration, the deans and the faculty leadership.  It is currently being reviewed by the Senate Personnel Committee.  If individual senators have not received a copy through your college channels, and you are interested in reviewing this document, please contact the Senate Office and we will provide a copy.  </P>



<P>&#9;We will be trying to make a presentation to you of the ASASU Faculty Evaluation Program during open forum.  Two years ago, the Senate gave conceptual approval to this program and today we will hear detail about the implementation of it.  </P>



<P>&#9;Remember to attend our legislative coffees.  We have two this week, one in District 19 (Tuesday, October 27) at 6:00 p.m.  The host is Jan Baxter Smith, at 7194 West Crystal Road in Glendale.  The second reception is in District 29 (Thursday October 29).  The hosts are Bill and Corrine Hochgraef, at 515 South El Dorado in Mesa.  </P>



<P>&#9;Last week Past Senate President Darwyn Linder sent a short questionnaire asking you to identify your legislative district and your telephone number on campus.  If you have received this form, please return it to the Academic Senate Office as quickly as possible.   </P>



<P>&#9;As the Senate moves from a paper trail to an electronic distribution, we hope that we will be more automated shortly; this means that you should be checking your email for most Senate documents.  All the senators have been automatically enrolled in the listserve for the Academic Senate.    </P>



<P>I am pleased to announce that the Board of Regents has approved the Arizona Faculties Council web site on higher education futures; it will be operational as of November 1.  All senators will be sent an email with instructions on how to enroll in this.  It is a series of sophisticated chat rooms based on the Arizona Board of Regents seven focus areas.  It gives you an opportunity to discuss those areas with members of the university communities from ASU, UofA and NAU.  Everyone system wide will be linked to this web site, including the Board of Regents and their staff.  </P>



<P>We urge you to look for your next issue of the <I>Academic Senate Newsletter</I> which will be coming out shortly; on the first page will be an updated report on the President's Committee for simplifying the undergraduate curriculum.  This will be part of a column that Chuck Bantz and I have written together and will give you an update on where we are going, the nature of the problem, and some of the solutions that we are suggesting.  We would really like responses to those suggestions so that eventually they can be incorporated into a policy.   </P>



<B><P>3.B  University President/Provost Report </B>(Milton Glick).</P>



<P>I wish to express my appreciation to Elizabeth Segal and to Anne Schneider and their faculties for the very constructive way in which they dealt with the important issues that were placed upon them vis-a-vis the transfer of the School of Social Work.  </P>



<P>We now have data on the entering classes.  This information is important to many of you.  These data illustrate where ASU's entering class lives compared to what I think are appropriate comparator groups such as public BIG 10s and public PAC 10s.   The Pac10 is a much more selective group of universities and is visible in a way that I had not realized before.  When we first set our goal for what our class profile should look like, I thought about what kind of universities we should emulate.  We clearly could not and would not wish to emulate Berkeley or UCLA because theirs is not the structure of higher education in Arizona.  I believe the University of Washington, University of Arizona, University of Oregon, and University of Minnesota are institutions that have profiles we should aspire to.   Five years ago, 22% of our entering class was in the top 10% of the high school class and realistically that should be 30%.  We were at 49% and we ought to have 60% top quartile.  We were 82% and would like to move up into 90% of the top half.  The top quartile is especially important.  The top 10% show persistence much above our goal, the next 15% achieved at our goal; there is a big drop off after that.  We went from 22% to 23%, 24%, 25%, and 29% and that is in spite of doubling the size of the freshman class.  That really does move us up two levels to up to roughly where Arizona and Oregon have been.  If you look at the top quartile, we have gone from 47% of our freshman to 57%, and finally, in the top half, we have gone from 79% to 87%.  I think the effort to retain an open door, yet increase the proportion of top students both from Arizona and nationally is an important one and will take each one of our individual efforts to achieve that goal.  We will have to deliver to those students, because we do not want to attract students and then not deliver the product that we promise.  </P>



<P>        At the next Board of Regents meeting, we will be presenting the three universities post-tenure review results.  </P>



<P>        We have received all faculty and AP salary increases in our office; you should receive official notification on your CSA and merit increases soon.  The CSA increases will go into effect on October 1, although they will be paid retroactively.  Merit increases will begin on January 1.  We have completed the CSA increases for classified staff but their merit increases will now be done separately.   </P>



<P>We have signed an agreement with Microsoft which allows any college to make an agreement where faculty and staff will be given complete access to a Microsoft package without having to purchase individual programs.  You will receive updates automatically.  If you have a personal machine at home that will be automatically included.   </P>



<P>The president has initiated a Next Century Series, a series of speakers who have different positions on where higher education is going vis-a-vis technology.  The first speaker will be in November: Sir John Daniel, who is Vice Chancellor of the British Open University, which is now making a major move in the United States; Brian Hawkins, president of the recently merged EduCause, previously Executive Vice President of Brown University; Stan Ikenbury, President of ACE and until recently, president of the University of Illinois; Clifford Lynch, who leads the Consortium for Network Innovation and formerly with Stanford; and Professor Jim O'Donnell who was here a few years ago; he is a classist who has a complete classics program on the Web.  We hope at the end of this series we will be better able to understand where in this very fluid arena that ASU should take its place and to make sure that we are aware of any advances in new technology.  </P>



<B><P>3.C ASASU President's Report</B> (Paul Frost).</P>



<P>Under open forum, I will give the report on the teacher evaluation program.</P>



<P>Last Senate meeting, I failed to bring up the fact that we were involved in the Faculty/Staff Appreciation Day effort, which was a great success.  It was a good collaboration between Intercollegiate Athletics and ASASU and Dr. Davey and Dr. Burstein.  We helped with manpower, handing out different items that ICA had provided.  Robert Strick, my chief of staff spoke at the event.  I wanted to recognize everyone for his or her efforts.</P>



<P>Homecoming Celebration is next week.  Activities start on Thursday and continue until Saturday.  On Thursday, of course, there is the tuition setting hearing from 5:00 - 7:00 p.m.-- not really a part of Homecoming but it is still quite "fun."  There is an event called the Battle of the Bands and that will take place in the area by the Student Recreation Complex.  On Friday there will be a Lantern Walk and on Saturday, the game.  </P>



<P>We in Associated Students are committed to raise the quality of education for all students.  Therefore, we hope to do our part in bringing the best students from among people graduating from Arizona high schools, into ASU.  We think that it is a great school, therefore, we want to do our part in bringing the best students here.  </P>



<B><P>3. D  ASU West Senate President's Report </B>(In<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">&#74;</FONT>



s Chisholm).</P>



<P>Senate President Davey: In<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">&#74;</FONT>



s Chisholm could not join us today, but the Academic Senate at West is actively looking at the issues that concern mobility and the transferability between students at ASU Main and ASU West.  We will set up a small but useful committee on both campuses; to look at these issues based upon a white paper written by Vi McLean to isolate some of the major issues this subject.</P>



<B><P>3.E  ASU East Academic Assembly President's Report</B> (Ernest Hirata for Andy Jackson).  No report  </P>



<B>



<P>4.  Open Forum.</P>



<P>&#9;</B>4.A<B> </B> Senator Linder: I just wanted to underline what you said about the legislative form that I circulated.  It went to all the faculty and academic professionals in the units.  Please encourage everyone in your unit to return it.  We are trying to update the telephone list that we have at the Alumni Office. We need people to identify their legislative district and their campus telephone number.  If they do not know their legislative district, they can call the Alumni Office and get that information based on their home address.  The more forms we receive back, the more effective our telephone contact efforts will be.  Spread the information among your colleagues.</P>



<P>&#9;4.B  Senator Bieber: A colleague raised the issue of faculty and staff season ticket prices.  There has been a large increase ($30).  Was this due to the use of an off campus venue?  If so, is that legal?  Was this done with faculty and staff input?  A ticket-pricing scheme should allow for options rather than including a mandatory increase.</P>



<P>&#9;Senate President Davey: Please give that item to me when you leave and I will contact Kevin White with your issue and put an answer out over listserve.  I do know that the $30.00 charge was for two games because you get to see both games.  I think that is one of the reasons for the higher price.  I do not know the rules and regulations for pricing off hand.</P>



<P>&#9;4.C  ASASU President Paul Frost: Due to technological difficulties, we will not be able to show our Power Point presentation today.   The data that we have here with us will have to suffice to get us through this discussion.  I hope at the next Senate meeting (November 23) we can give a complete presentation.  </P>



<P>&#9;As an overview, the teacher/course evaluation program has developed over the past few years.  Beginning in 1995-96, Mark Baumgartner, former ASASU President brought up the issue of using the course evaluations done by students to the Senate.  The issue was approved by the Academic Senate that year.  Since then, ASASU has been working on the implementation of the original proposal.  These student course evaluations are different from ones that are done in the departments.  The way that they are different is that they contain across-the-board questions.  The individual department evaluations focus on different aspects.   ASASU believes that there are numerous benefits for this proposal.  Three of the basic benefits are 1) The students will be better prepared for class.  2) The students and the faculty members will consider the evaluations more seriously.  3) The quality of teaching at the university will be highlighted.  We are concerned with and dedicated to improving the quality of education at ASU.  We feel that this program is an important one.  In the plan that I am not able to show you today, the steps that are taken to do this type of review are as follows.   First, the academic department is contacted by ASASU; our proposal is to evaluate only 100 and 200 level courses.  These evaluations will only be done on faculty members and no TAs will be evaluated.  Institutional Analysis maintains a database on all of the 100 and 200 level courses.  Then we will send out letters based upon what Institutional Analysis sends to us.  The department will distribute the different evaluations in your boxes, just like the other evaluations that they distribute.  In the material we generate, there will be the course line number, the instructor's name, and then a letter will accompany that information addressed to the administrative assistant in your departments explaining what this material is.  There will also be a letter to the student monitor that will explain their role.  Our computer will generate the checklist to make sure that the sheets we are sending out are actually according to the department's guidelines.  After the evaluations are done, the student monitor will collect all the evaluations and then separate the ASASU evaluations from the department evaluations.  It is done on a scantron sheet (Maroon in color with our logo).  ASASU will then go and pick the sheets up in every department.  </P>



<P>&#9;The reason we distributed the evaluations to you today is so you can see the questions that will be asked of the students.  The data that you see on the other page here are the data that were collected in the pilot program that was done last spring.  We have blocked out the names of the instructors that were evaluated.  This is the raw data.  You can compare the long question, for instance, number one, "The instructor respected the students in his class."  You can compare it with the ones that were in the evaluation.  Of course, because of the range of the field, we could only fit a certain amount of letters in; so we summarized the sentence "Respects the Students."  You can see the data is separated into percentages; if you look at the field in the upper left-hand corner, Introduction to Human Communication, there are 404 students enrolled and only 235 actually took the survey.  Then you can see the percentages of those students that responded to the questions that were asked.  If you look at the second field of the left hand column, the second one down, Design Principles, number 2, you can see that there are 43 students filled in E.  It would be useless to ask whether a textbook is useful; the reason for this is that that class, Design Principles, does not use textbooks.  They put a N/A answer or just said it was useless.  That is where we are at right now.  We are on the verge of implementing a greater number of surveys, but we wanted you to see what progress we have made.  What questions do you have?</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Balling: When does this all start?  You never mentioned what semester you will begin the next pilot.</P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: The last pilot we did was in the spring semester.  We will get the data next week from that.  We have already begun but we have not published the results.</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Winkelman: In the Design Principles course, what am I to infer when the fact that only 21% of the students found the textbook useful?  </P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: I do have an answer to that.  One of the students working on the data with us said that the professor had recommended readings but there were no required texts.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senator Blumenfeld-Jones: Is there a question in this survey where the students are asked to evaluate themselves, as a part of the evaluation?</P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: The Student-Faculty Policy Committee reviewed and approved the questions that are on the evaluation.  It has been pretty much agreed upon that these are the questions to be included in the evaluation.</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Gully: What is the reason for only using 100 and 200 level courses?</P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: There was a reason for excluding 300 and 400 level classes.  There are approximately 2000 classes that are taught by faculty only and we felt that, at least in this case that it would be best to limit it to for now because of the logistics of covering that number of classes.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senator Gooding: Were all the 100 and 200 level courses surveyed last time, or how many?</P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: Last spring, ten classes were surveyed and this next semester we are looking at 500 or so.  Our goal is, by next fall, a year from now, to have surveyed 1,000 courses.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senator Goggin: I teach in the English Department.  There over 200 courses are 100 level and many are taught by TAs.  </P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: Yes.  How would we know the difference between a TA and a regular faculty member that is teaching the class?  That is something more for Institutional Analysis to differentiate.  Also, like I said before, we sent out a follow-up letter to check and see if there are any mistakes in the things we sent, making sure that we are only sending these to faculty and not As.</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Goggin: There are also part-time instructors and academic professionals in English.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senate President-elect Burstein: What I would say that what you want to survey people who are likely to teach a course again.  A TA is hit or miss obviously.  We want to survey people in the department who are going to be teaching that course over several years, so that the student is likely to encounter that person again in another year.  I would urge the ASASU to coordinate with the large departments such as English and Math, where you do employ a lot of  TAs.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senator Jacob: Have you done any studies on doing this on-line to save cost and time?  You would get a greater response is this form were online. </P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: At the time this proposal was approved two years ago, the issues of being online were more touchy than they are now.  About the developments of taking it online, that is a good point and something that we have not really researched because we have just been developing the aspect of going into the actual classes.</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Moore: Do you have any criteria to negate a ballot, for example, when a student who is angry marks "not applicable" to the instructor rating scale?  </P>



<P>Paul Frost: That is a good question.  For instance, a student may play connect-the-dots on the evaluation.  That is the same question you may get on the department evaulations as well.  I am sure some students do not take them very seriously.  Our hope is that the students will take this matter seriously because the student government sponsors it.  </P>



<P>Senator Moore: That is not the question I asked.  I asked, "Is there a mechanism to throw a ballot out that is marked inappropriately?"  </P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: I do not think we have a mechanism for negating those right now because they are just simply the reflections of what institutional analysis found when they ran the scantrons through.  The answer to your question is: no there is not.</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Komnenich: Do I understand you correctly that this next pilot could be done in as many as 500 courses; will they be randomly distributed among 100-200 courses?</P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: What we would like to do on this next stage is to choose a couple of the large departments like English, Math, and Sociology and evaluate the entire department.  We feel this is a process and we are learning as we go.  If we can take an entire large department like that and evaluate them, we will get a lot more responses about how well they are doing.</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Komnenich: You are still in the process stage, then?</P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: That is right; we are still in the process of working some of these things out.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senator Gooding: I am trying to figure out how a "not-applicable" mark can be made on this evaluation form.  </P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: If the response was "not applicable," the question was just left blank. We were going to change that field to say just "blank." </P>



<P>&#9;Senator Pessler: How are these results going to be published?</P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: We discussed the possibility of getting it done and printed in books, but we would instead like to put those online.  We would like only the students to have access to that information.  They must have valid student id numbers to sign on.  All the instructors will be protected this way.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senator Singhal: Will the process be improved by more summary work on the statistics before it is put on a website?</P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: We will look into that.</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Kahn: Some of the courses in the natural sciences are hard subjects.  You can expect much more of a negative response in those areas based upon the difficulty of the discipline.  Therefore, I would suggest that there be no comparison between the natural science course results with, say, the humanities.</P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: These are evaluations for all students and they are not for use by the departments.  On our evaluation form, we tried to create questions that are across-the-board for all students.</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Ashley: The literature on teaching evaluation and course evaluation all have some sort of bias in that they will be engineered for what are specifically ideal courses.  The question just asked implies that the instrument is biased in favor of some sorts of courses taught in some sorts of disciplines and is less likely to generate equally promising positive scores for other sorts of courses in other sorts of disciplines.  If that is such a well-established point in the literature the question then arises, what tests of this bias have you performed?  Have they been performed?   A second issue is for the consumers of this information, to what extent are they to be good consumers who can make sense of it be alerted to these biases.  </P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: I think this is something that has been up to the Student-Faculty Policy Committee many times and it has been reviewed and mulled over in the past few years.  The idea of  course evaluation was approved by the Academic Senate two years ago, and all these considerations have been taken into account.   The program is carried forward; we are doing what we said we would and this is the data that is reflected.</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Ashley: The answer then is that there have been careful studies.  I would also like to underscore the second part of my question; to what extent will the results of these careful studies be produced for the student consumers who will look at these results and try to make sense of them?</P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: I will ask Dr. Burstein.  Has that been a consideration?</P>



<P>&#9;Senate President-elect Burstein: Those that were in the Senate two years ago know we went through a lot of the same discussion.  In terms of field to field, the students will judge our physics, not against humanities courses but against our own physics courses, if they have options.  If an Astronomy course were labeled "hard" by these evaluations, that would be preferred over students entering with the feeling that it is a course in, say, Astrology.   At the same time, there will be a statement about bias that will be crafted by the Student-Faculty Policy Committee.  The bottom line is that it will make the student a much better informed consumer of our courses, if we can get this information out to them.  That is my feeling.  They will have a better idea of what is out there.  Secondarily, while this university over time has been under pressure to prove the worth of our teaching, the vast majority of our professors are good teachers and that is well hidden.  When these evaluations are out, that hidden fact will become a much-publicized fact.  We all know that we are both devil and saint to our students.  I doubt anyone here has not gotten an E, nor has not gotten and A on their evaluation in the same class.  We cannot be all things to all people.  What we can have is on average most of us grade out as a B, between the B+ and the B- level.  Some really good people grade out as A, some other people grade out as C.  I know of no one in my department who ever graded below that.  By and large, the students are kind when they come to grading us, in that if we have taught them something they grade us in a reasonable manner.  </P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: I agree with Professor Burstein when he says that.  This is based on the premise that we do believe that the students are being instructed well at ASU.</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Kronenfeld: Someone here made a statement about what would be considered a good teacher and then you talked about some people would grade out an A, B, or C.  Would any of those three grades meet your definition of an acceptable teacher then and are these evaluations going to be figured into departmental evaluations as well?</P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: They will not be used to figure into the departmental evaluations; they will be for only the students to access.  These are also evaluations used relative to other teachers.  The students will be able to draw a comparison between teachers based upon their ratings for the results of the evaluations.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senator Margolis: Have you considered including the breakdown of the students' performance, their GPAs as a part of this?   </P>



<P>&#9;Paul Frost: Do you mean the GPAs of the students filling out the evaluation forms; it is not a part now, but perhaps it should be.</P>



<P>&#9;Senate President: What we are going to do is summarize the points you have given to Paul and we will provide them to him as your feedback.  Before the Student-Faculty Policy Committee will allow any of these course evaluations to be done, we will have a good plan in place.  There is more work to be done before we begin the next pilot.  Dr. Crawford has been working with the student government to make this program work, but we are well aware of the seriousness with which we take our evaluations and that departmental evaluations have a lot to do with our performance ratings.  It is to be made clear to the Senate that the student evaluations done by ASASU have absolutely no connection whatsoever with departmental evaluation process.  The only kind of relationship is that they will be distributed and collected on the same day.  </P>

Dr. Boulin-Johnson is present today to answer any questions the Senate may have.        </P>

<B><P>5.A.3  Senate Motion #3 (1998-99)(second reading): "The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of the request from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to establish a Certificate in Scandinavian Studies." </B>Documentation was made available to senators before this meeting.<B>  </B>Any questions, comments, discussion?</P>



<P>Senator Karady: What will the students do if they get this certificate?  Is it good for something, to get a job for instance?  These are very interesting subjects, but is there improvement in their job search?</P>



<P>Senator Johnson: Are you talking about a certificate in general, or this one?  </P>



<P>Senator Karady: A certificate in Scandinavian studies.</P>



<P>Senator Johnson: Is there someone who can address this in the Senate?</P>



<P>Professor Reese: This is a first step in the creation of a major in Scandinavian Studies.  It will be offered only to students with expertise in a certain area.  </P>



<P>Senator Johnson: Are there any further questions?</P>



<P>Senate President Davey: Hearing no further discussion we will move to a vote.  S.M. #3 (1998-99) passed by voice vote.</P>



<B><P>5.A.4 Senate Motion #4 (1998-99): "The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval for the request from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to establish an undergraduate Writing Certificate." </B>Documentation was made available to senators before this meeting.  Are there any questions or comments pertaining to this motion?</P>



<P>Senate President Davey: Hearing no further discussion we will move to a vote.  S.M. #4 passed by voice vote.</P>



<B><P>5.A.5 Senate Motion #5 (1998-99): "The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval for the request from the College of Business to change the name of the Master of Accountancy TO Master of Accountancy and Information Management." </B>Documentation was made available to senators before this meeting.  Any questions or comments concerning this proposal?</P>



<P>   &#9;Senator Mignolet: Is it the common policy that a new set of programs in the same college can have the same name as one already established there?</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Johnson: Is there someone in the Senate who can answer that?</P>



<P>&#9;Senator St. Louis: I think you are referring to the Master of Science in Information Systems.  This one is the Master of Accountancy and Information Systems.  The Accountancy Department is going to the 150-hour requirement from 120 hours, for every program but the CPA.  We were trying to develop a program that is well suited to students to get a masters degree or to satisfy the 150-hour requirement to pursue the CPA exam.  The emphasis is on information systems.</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Mignolet: It is an interesting comment but it was a question more about the name itself.  There seems to me to be some confusion about the degree names.  </P>



<P>&#9;Dean Bernstein: This issue came up in the Graduate Council.  The degree has the name Accountancy and Information Management that we are considering today.  They are not the same degree.</P>



<P>&#9;Senate President Davey: Hearing no further discussion, we will move to a vote.  S.M. #5 (1998-99) passed by voice vote.  </P>



<P>&#9;<B>5.A.6  Senate Motion #6 (1998-99): "The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of the request from the College of Business to change the name of the Department of Business Administration TO the Department of Supply Chain Management."  </B>Documentation was made available to senators before this meeting.

<P>&#9;<B>5.A.7  Senate Motion #7 (1998-99): "The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of the request from the College of Fine Arts to establish a Ph.D. Theory and History of Arts." </B>Documentation was made available to senators before this meeting.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senate President Davey: Senator Gully is present here to answer questions.</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Solis: In the middle of Page 2 of the documentation, it says this collaborative program is administered by ASU/UofA  Ph.D. Steering and Academic Committee.</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Gully: Yes there will be a committee with equal representation.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senator Solis: In the middle of Page 4, a second question, on the language requirement, the reading knowledge of two foreign languages.  A Macedonian student could come in reading Macedonian and English. </P>



<P>&#9;Senator Gully: That matter would depend entirely upon a student's choice and the committee.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senate President Davey: Hearing no further discussion, we will move to a vote.  S.M. #7 passed by voice vote.  </P>



<P>&#9;We have been working on this for how long, Senator Gully?  </P>



<P>&#9;Senator Gully: Since 1976!</P>



<B><P>6.  New Business (Committee Reports).</P>



<P>&#9;6.A.  Executive Committee </B>(William Davey).  No report.</P>



<P>&#9;<B>6.B   Committee on Committees </B>(Tim Karcher).  No report.</P>



<P>&#9;<B>6.C   Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee </B>(Linda Johnson).</P>



<P>&#9;Action Item:&#9;</P>



<B><P>Senate Motion #8 (1998-98)</B>(first reading), a request from the College of Law to establish a Certificate Program in Indian Law.</P>



<P>Senator Linder: It is unclear if the title of this certificate program indicates it is for the laws of India or Native American law.  Is there a reason for this?</P>



<P>&#9;Senator Johnson: It does apply to Native Americans.  </P>



<P>&#9;Vice Provost Bantz: My memory of the proposal is that it applies to American Indian Law and that was their choice of words for the certificate title.</P>



<P>&#9;Senate President Davey: Documentation for this item is available in the Academic Senate Office (and was later mailed to senators following this meeting).</P>



<P>&#9;Information Item:</P>



<P>&#9;A proposal from the College of Architecture to establish a minor in Interior Design History.</P>



<P>&#9;Are there any questions about any of these proposals?</P>



<P>&#9;Another Information item that I announce to the Senate is from the Hispanic Border Leadership Institute, a proposal to offer a dual MBA program with the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey.</P>



<P>&#9;<B>6.D   Personnel Committee </B>(Kevin Carroll).</P>



<P>&#9;The Personnel Committee brings three motions forward for a first reading:</P>



<P>&#9;Senate Motion #9 is for changes in ACD policy 506-12 "Promotion from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer."  If you look at the copy you have, the changes are in the second and third line; the phrase in parentheses is removed.  The reason for that is the original language said that a review would occur in the second year of a three-year contract. Many departments wanted the review to occur in the third year of the contract with the decision taking effect in the following year.  That would make the process similar to what is done in tenure decisions for faculty.  Are there any questions on that?  </P>



<P>&#9;Senate Motion #10 on health-related leave.  As you all know, due to late action by the state legislature this policy was adopted over the summer.  The Personnel Committee reviewed it and recommends two changes.  They are both in all caps on your copy.  One change is that faculty sick leave will be debited in 4-hour increments.  This is taken to make policy similar to policy for exempt classified staff.  The second change was in our old policy, wherein the President of the University, under extraordinary circumstances, can grant additional sick leave.  We can put that in the new policy also.  UofA has had accrued sick leave for faculty forever.  They also have such a provision in their policy.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senate Motion #11 "Vacation Leave--Fiscal Year Appointments."  This only applies to people on fiscal year appointments.  What's going on here is that classified staff do have the cash buy out provision for their accrued vacation leave; academic professionals have asked why that was not true for them.  What our change does is put that cash buy out option into the policy for faculty and academic professionals.  </P>



<P>&#9;Dr. Davey already mentioned the Whistleblower Policy.  The Personnel Committee will take up that issue at their meeting next Monday and we will keep you informed.  </P>



<P>&#9;Senate President Davey: The sick leave accruing for faculty will be credited to your account sometime in late spring.</P>



<P>&#9;<B>6.E  Student-Faculty Policy Committee </B>(John Crawford).  </P>



<P>&#9;We are continuing to explore the possibility of establishing a mechanism to handle the changes to the grading system to accommodate a plus/minus option.  There are some technical issues that will take time to resolve, but we are moving that direction.  </P>



<P>&#9;As other business, the Committee received and approved a report from the three universities, attempting to revise the Student Code of Conduct.  There will be a dissemination of the revised Student Code of Conduct in the near future.  The Board of Regents had mandated this revision.  Approval by the three universities comes as a proforma action in step with that.  It looks like there will be quite a few matters of substance and a lot of it has to do with bringing the policy up to date with Century 21.</P>



<P>&#9;<B>6.F  University Services and Facilities Committee </B>(Rodney Rogers).</P>



<P>&#9;Our committee is examining items related to health benefits: 1) any recurring problems in the system and if there is clear dissemination about new information, on programs currently available.  2) the issue of relocation of health benefits (for example, the closing of the Thomas Davis Clinic).  3) a student request regarding increasing the size of nonsmoking areas around the buildings.  Some people feel that there is still a problem inside the building, in terms of  smoke coming in from areas that are designated for smoking.   </P>







<B><P>7.  Adjournment.</P>
