Many departments on campus receive cash and check payments.  The standards listed below provide minimum cash-handling requirements for these departments.  Personnel from Financial Services or ASU Internal Audit are available to assist departments in revising cash receipting procedures to comply with these standards. Assistance of an hour or less quarterly is provided at no charge; assistance of more than an hour may necessitate the need for the department to hire an accounting firm under contract to ASU.<p><img src="finhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height=2><center><font size=+2><b>Policy</b></font></center><img src="finhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height=2><p>Each department and area on campus receiving average cash payments of at least $2,000 per month and/or average check payments of at least $4,000 per month is to review the standards in the &#147;<a href="#Checklist of Departmental Cash Receipting Procedures">Checklist of Departmental Cash and Check Receipting Procedures</a>&#148; below and ensure that they are meeting at least the minimum requirement.  While the chief business or financial manager of each department (e.g., the ASU Bookstore, Campus Health Service, the Sun Card Office, and the <i>State Press</i>) is responsible for the adherence of staff to these policies and procedures, the chief business or financial personnel for each college and vice presidential division are also responsible and accountable to: <p><ol><li>at least annually review the procedures and internal controls, especially separation of duties, for completeness and accuracy, and to certify that the procedures comply with the university cash-handling policies;</li><p><li>annually certify that cash-handling personnel receive adequate training (the business managers will work with areas within their colleges or units on a continual basis to identify procedures where improvements may be warranted); <p>and</li><p><li>annually review and attest that each department within their colleges or divisional units has a current <a href="fin003.html#Deskmanual">desk manual</a> that includes cash- and check-handling procedures.  This desk manual needs to be tailored to the individual area&#146;s cash-handling needs, encompass all relevant and minimum university cash-handling policies, and include all procedures relating to any subsidiary systems used by the department.  While the standards and procedures presented in this policy can be used as a starting point for each department&#146;s desk manual for cash and check handling, each department&#146;s procedures need to be specifically tailored to the individual department&#146;s circumstances.</li></ol><p>By September 1st of each year (starting September 1, 2006), the chief  business or financial person of each department and college or vice presidential division will submit to the Cashiering Services department of Financial Services an <a href="finforms.html">Annual Certification/Attestation (Cash and Check Handling Procedures)</a> form to attest that adequate internal controls are in place and are functioning as intended, that all cash-handling personnel have received adequate training, and that each department has a current desk manual that contains all the necessary procedures to comply with university cash-handling policies.<p>In addition to the certification/attestation form to be completed annually, each department below the dean and vice president level also needs to complete an <a href="finforms.html">Annual Disclosure Supplement (Supplement to the Annual Certification/Attestation, Cash and Check Handling Procedures)</a> for the most recently completed fiscal year and file by September 1. To assist many departments in completing this disclosure supplement form, certain information from ASU&#146;s Cashiering System will be available in the Data Warehouse.<p>As noted in the procedures below, there is also an employee annual review form (which is different than the certification form needed by the chief business or financial manager of each department and college or vice presidential area) that needs to be signed by each employee having cash- and check-handling responsibility. This annual review form is not to be filed with Cashiering Services but instead maintained in each department&#146;s and employee&#146;s file.  Only the annual attestation form required of the chief business or financial person of each department and college or vice presidential division is to be filed annually with Cashiering Services.<p>Even though some departments may not meet the dollar thresholds noted above requiring adherence to this policy, the standards presented in this policy provide good business practice regardless of the amount of cash and checks received.  For that reason, following these standards as is reasonable and practical is also recommended for departments that are below the thresholds presented above, where adherence is required by this policy.<p>As a supplement to the individual training that each department supervisor must provide to his or her employees, Financial Services, through the Human Resources department&#146;s training program, periodically offers a hands-on Cash Receipting and Cash Reconciliation class that ASU departments may voluntarily decide to have their cash-handling employees attend. This Cash Receipting and Cash Reconciliation class is offered several times annually.<p>Departments are to review, at least annually, their operations to see if there are ways to eliminate or substantially reduce the need for cash and currency transactions through the sole or greater use of credit cards, the ASU Sun Card, and/or checks. <p>Violation of these departmental cash and check receipting policies and procedures could subject the violator, and his or her supervisor, to disciplinary action ranging from reprimand to involuntary termination.<p><img src="finhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height=2><center><font size=+2><b>Exception</b></font></center><img src="finhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height=2><p>Any department that is unable to comply with the minimum standards listed in the &#147;<a href="#Procedure">Procedure</a>&#148; below must apply in writing to Financial Services for approval of the deviation.

As indicated in<a href="fin303.html"> FIN 303</a>, &#147;Gift Deposits,&#148; all gifts are to be forwarded to the ASU Foundation for deposit to either the (1) ASU Foundation, if the specific criteria for depositing to the ASU Foundation are met (<a href="fin301-02.html">FIN 301-02</a>, &#147;Deposits&#151;ASU-Approved, Financially Related Organizations&#148;) or (2) ASU.  The ASU Foundation is a separate 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nongovernment organization whose purpose is to support ASU. The ASU Foundation operates the financial management aspects of the ASU Development Office, which is responsible for processing all gifts to ASU. It is most important, however, that only gifts and other deposits meeting the specific criteria for depositing to the ASU Foundation or other ASU-approved financially related organization be deposited to that organization.  All other receipts are public funds and, therefore, must be deposited to only ASU. <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> &#167; 35&#150;301 provides penalties for knowingly depositing public funds to a non-public funds bank account.<p><center>The following table outlines departmental cash and check receipting procedures.</center><p><table border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1><tr><th colspan=7><a name="Checklist of Departmental Cash Receipting Procedures">Checklist of Departmental Cash and Check Receipting Procedures</a></th></tr><tr><th colspan=2><font size=-1>Sales/Service</font></th><th rowspan=2><font size=-1>Gifts</font></th><th rowspan=2><font size=-1>Minimum Standards (STD)</font></th><th rowspan=2><font size=-1>Preferred Standards (STD)</font></th><th rowspan=2><font size=-1>Current STD<br>(M or P)</font></th></tr><tr><th><font size=-1>Cash</font></th><th><font size=-1>Checks</font></th></tr><tr><td align=CENTER valign=TOP>&#160;<p><b>X</b></td><td align=CENTER valign=TOP>&#160;<p><b>X</b></td><td align=CENTER valign=TOP>&#160;<p><b>X</b></td><td valign=TOP><b>Hiring and Training</b><ol><li type="1">As required by university policy (<a href="../acd/acd126.html">ACD 126</a>), perform a background investigation (criminal check) for all non-student hires.<p>All non-student staff hires who handle cash and checks on an ongoing basis are designated as &#147;security- or safety-sensitive&#148; positions and also require a fingerprint check.<p>A background investigation (criminal check) is required for all student staff hires who handle cash and checks on an ongoing basis.

Forms that contain credit card information must be kept in a secure and restricted area as described in Step 10.</li></ol></td><td valign=TOP><ol start="23"><li>Same as minimum.</li></ol></td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>&#160;<br><hr noshade size=1 width=25></td></tr><tr><td align=CENTER valign=TOP><b>X</b></td><td align=CENTER valign=TOP>&#160;</td><td align=CENTER valign=TOP>&#160;</td><td valign=TOP><ol start="24"><li>All cash receipts need to be deposited in total and not used for small miscellaneous purchases.</li></ol></td><td valign=TOP><ol start="24"><li>Same as minimum.</li></ol></td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>&#160;<br><hr noshade size=1 width=25></td></tr><tr><td align=CENTER valign=TOP><b>X</b></td><td align=CENTER valign=TOP>&#160;</td><td align=CENTER valign=TOP>&#160;</td><td valign=TOP><ol start="25"><li>Departments are not allowed to cash personal checks from cash receipts.</li></ol></td><td valign=TOP><ol start="25"><li>Same as minimum.</li></ol></td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>&#160;<br><hr noshade size=1 width=25></td></tr><tr><td align=CENTER valign=TOP><b>X</b></td><td align=CENTER valign=TOP>&#160;</td><td align=CENTER valign=TOP>&#160;</td><td valign=TOP><ol start="26"><li>For all cash receipts where there is no cash register, prenumbered receipts, or other independent party to verify and reconcile the cash receipts, two individuals are to receive and count the cash.  For coin-operated machines, e.g., copying machines, consideration should be given to using an outside contractor rather than self-operation by an ASU department. <p>Another possibility is that two locks be used: one lock that opens the machine and to which only maintenance people have the key and a lock inside the machine to the cashbox, to which only the cash collector has the key. The maintenance person could open the machine and not the cashbox, and the cash collection person could open the cashbox but not the machine. Accordingly, both a maintenance person and a cash collector would have to be present to collect and verify the cash.</li></ol></td><td valign=TOP><ol start="26"><li>Same as minimum.</li></ol></td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>&#160;<br><hr noshade size=1 width=25></td></tr></table><p><hr noshade><p><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">FIN</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | FIN&#160;manual&#160;<a href="fin001.html">contact</a> | Financial&#160;Services&#160;Web&#160;<a href="comptrollers.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
