      <h2>Almost 5,000 will graduate from ASU Main Campus on May 15 </h2>
      <p>        Nearly 5,000 students will receive their sheepskins from ASU President
          Michael Crow on May 15, in the first spring commencement for the energetic
          president who is cutting a wide swath with his vision for the future
          of the university. The Main Campus ceremony will be at 4 p.m. in Wells
      Fargo Arena.</p>
      <p>Commencement for ASU West will be at 6:45 p.m., May 16,
            in the Sundome Center for the Performing Arts in Sun City West. ASU
            East's 365 graduates
        will participate in the Main Campus ceremony.</p>
      <p>First in the minds of many
          graduates is the job search, as the sluggish economy begins to warm
        up. Many companies, particularly accounting and
          computer software development firms, are hiring, keeping the talent
        pipeline open to meet the need for well-educated workers in the future.</p>
      <p>A record
          325 ASU students are receiving bachelor's degrees in interdisciplinary
          studies (BIS), a relatively new degree program that allows students
        to combine two subject areas, preparing them for careers in a world that
          increasingly bridges academic disciplines - such as philosophy and
        religious
        studies or English literature and urban planning.</p>
      <p>The next most popular
        degree program is elementary education, with psychology and communication
        coming in next. Marketing, management and finance all
        rank high, with justice studies rounding out majors with the largest
        number of graduates.<br>
        Ten students have been named the outstanding graduates from their colleges,
        including Katie Peterson, outstanding graduate of the College of Liberal
        Arts &amp; Sciences, who has a 4.0 grade-point average and a double major,
        English and biology. She is the only undergraduate ever to hold the position
        of associate editor of the literary magazine "Hayden's Ferry Review,"
      and is an opinion columnist and reporter for the State Press. </p>
      <p>Lisa Prout,
        the outstanding graduate from the College of Engineering &amp; Applied
        Sciences, makes presentations in high school science classes and was
        a presenter at the recent Sally Ride science festival. Both Lisa and
        her brother Brian are graduating with honors. Brian is one year older
      and is getting a degree in architecture.</p>
      <p>Jonas Zygas, named outstanding
        graduate from the W. P. Carey School of Business, has already been hired
        by Citigroup, where he interned, as
        an analyst in the investment banking division. While studying in Lithuania
        last year, he participated in a debate with the country's former president
      about public and private education.</p>
      <p>Other outstanding graduates include
        Joseph E.V. Benesh, Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts; Wendy
        Coursen, College of Public Programs;
        Andrew Jacob, College of Law; Meredith Banasiak, College of Architecture &amp; Environmental
        Design; Collin Raymond, Barrett Honors College; Luis Cortez, College
      of Nursing; and Marina Gair, College of Education.</p>
      <p>Sixteen students will
          receive the Moeur Award, ASU's oldest continuing honor presented by
        the Alumni Association, for having 4.0 GPAs and all
          their coursework completed at ASU. They are Brooke Bagwell, Sandra
        Bensley, Marie Blanchard, Rebekah Bratrud, Mhairi Brown, Kate Buenau,
        Kortney
          Gray, Kurt Hinterbichler, Lauren Kientz, Jonathan Land, Melissa Ludens,
        Sara McKenzie, Joanna Pearson, Donya Pettit, Sulema Sutton and Jack Zeal.</p>
      <p>The
          commencement will be Webcast live on the Internet at (http://is.asu.edu/live).<br>
        Parking is free in all lots across campus on that day. The closest
          parking for guests is in lot 59 and parking structure 5.</p>
