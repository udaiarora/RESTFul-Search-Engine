Holiday pay is based on an eight-hour work day.  Regular employees who are less than 100 percent <a href="spp002.html#fte">FTE</a> are granted time off with pay for a pro-rated portion of the holiday based on their percentage of FTE.<p>Holidays normally designated are:<p><ol><li>New Year&#146;s Day</li><p><li>Martin Luther King Day</li><p><li>Memorial Day</li><p><li>Independence Day</li><p><li>Labor Day</li><p><li>Veterans Day</li><p><li>Thanksgiving Day</li><p><li>Friday after Thanksgiving Day<p>and</li><p><li>Christmas Day plus one additional day between Christmas and New Year&#146;s, determined by university administration on an annual basis.</li></ol><p>Designated holidays occurring on a Saturday or Sunday normally are observed on Friday or Monday as designated by the university.<p>Employees whose regular day off is a designated holiday are granted an alternative day off.<p>Employees who are required to work on a designated holiday must be granted an alternative day off work during the same work week.<p>Employees must be in pay status both the scheduled working day before and the scheduled working day after a holiday in order to receive the holiday off with pay.  Pay status is any paid work or paid leave time as authorized by the administrative official.  Staff will not be paid for holidays occurring during a leave without pay.<p>Holidays occurring during scheduled paid absences will not be charged against accrued vacation leave, sick leave, or military leave.<p>Employees are expected to work their normal schedules on work days immediately preceding official university holidays.  Any time off on these days must be charged to accrued vacation time or time off without pay.<p><b>Exception</b><p>An employee assigned to a police, dispatch, or police aide position in the ASU Department of Public Safety (ASU DPS) who is required to work on a designated holiday and is unable to be granted an alternative day off during the same work week will be granted eight hours of <a href="spp002.html#standard comp time">standard compensatory time</a> in lieu of an alternative day off during the same work week, in addition to pay for the hours worked on the holiday.<p>An employee who actually works more than 40 hours in that work week, or whose combined hours worked and paid leave hours exceed 40 hours, will be granted compensatory time at the applicable rate for hours exceeding 40 in the work week.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Religious Holidays</b></font><p>Employees may request time off from work to observe religious holidays that are not designated university holidays. Administrators shall reasonably accommodate individual religious practices for all employees. A request for time off from work to observe religious holidays must be granted unless undue hardship to the department or university would result from accommodating the employee&#146;s request. Employees may not be discriminated against because of their religious beliefs or practices, or absence of religious beliefs or practices.<p>Employees must charge time off to accrued vacation leave or take time off without pay.<p><img src="spphr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="spphr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>For a reference on employees who work alternative work schedules and the proper recording of time worked and not worked, see <a href="spp306.html">SPP 306</a>, &#147;Work Schedules.&#148;<p>For a reference on how to manage overtime compensation, see <a href="spp404-04.html">SPP 404&#150;04</a>, &#147;Overtime&#151;General Policy.&#148;<p>For information on overtime for work performed for specific university events, see <a href="spp404-06.html">SPP 404&#150;06</a>, &#147;Overtime for University Extraordinary and Specific Events.&#148;<p>&#160;<font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">SPP</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | SPP&#160;manual&#160;<a href="spp001.html">contact</a> | Human&#160;Resources&#160;Web&#160;<a href="hr.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
