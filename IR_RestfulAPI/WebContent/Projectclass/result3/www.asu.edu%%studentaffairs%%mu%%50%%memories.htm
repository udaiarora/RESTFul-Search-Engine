					<h1>Read Memories</h1>
					<p>The following memories about the Memorial Union have been 
                      submitted by ASU alumni and community members:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was involved in MU committees and then with the 
                      then brand-new MUAB throughout my four undergraduate years. 
                      Cecilia Scoular, that lovely lady who was the original director 
                      and was still there my first two years, called the MU &quot;our 
                      home away from home&quot;....we all kind of joked about 
                      that, but whether we were just passing through for a doughnut 
                      or listening to music in one of the lounges, or coming for 
                      a meeting or a movie....deep down, we knew she was right! 
                      Great memories with so many people -- Mrs. Scoular, Mrs. 
                      Thomas, Gay Holliday, Rick Eden, Roseanne Cartledge, Christine 
                      Wilkinson, and then all the students I met during those 
                      years because I was involved with the MU. I just want to 
                      recognize and express my gratitude to all of them on this 
                      wonderful anniversary.&quot;<br>
                      <strong>- Layna Taylor, '75, '80</strong></p>
                    <p>&quot;I vividly remember Jan. 28, 1986 (is that the right 
                      year?) when I walked into the open TV room on the first 
                      floor and everyone was watching the space shuttle take off 
                      then explode. I remember wondering why I was so shaken when 
                      I didn't know the people but I cried for them and their 
                      families. Then I had to go back to work at the Business 
                      Advising counter and felt sad the rest of the day. It was 
                      surreal to watch someone lose their lives right before your 
                      eyes and then go on like everything was normal and nothing 
                      happened. That date (Jan. 28) is also my only brother's 
                      birthday. Not a great moment, but I've never forgotten it. 
                      It had an emotional impact upon me. I do remember studying 
                      in the quiet room so long that I would fall asleep on the 
                      comfy couches. Then a piano was put in there and I'd listen 
                      to the people playing instead of studying. Once, I wore 
                      a Venezuelan t-shirt to school and I was in the lower level 
                      MU at the copy counter, when a girl passed by and asked 
                      me where I got the t-shirt. I told her I had visited Venezuela 
                      and my husband was from there. We invited her to meet more 
                      of our Venezuelan friends and she ended up marrying the 
                      cousin of our good friends, the Gonzalez family. Rosa Gonzalez 
                      (her aunt-in-law) still works as ASU. She lives in Texas 
                      and is happily married with a baby boy.&quot;<br>
                      <strong>- Kari Bowman</strong>, <strong>'86</strong> </p>
                    <p>&quot;The MU was the place where my friend, Angie and I 
                      would meet in between classes. We would like to sit on the 
                      comfy couches and just people watch. The MU also allowed 
                      us to take naps during finals!!&quot;<br>
                      <strong>- Olga De La Torre, '92</strong></p>
                    <p>&quot;As an incoming freshman, I remember my very first 
                      visit to the Memorial Union - it was for Orientation in 
                      the Spring. I remember the building being really large and 
                      sitting in the Arizona Ballroom listening to a myriad of 
                      speakers. Little did I know that four years later, my home 
                      away from home would be the Memorial Union and the offices 
                      of ASASU. I remember very fondly planning Homecoming as 
                      an undergraduate and working with students and advisors 
                      who would become lifelong friends. Storing over 5,000 gold 
                      leis' for a Homecoming celebration or painting signage that 
                      would hang on the bridge over University Drive are the many 
                      things we all worked on inside the Memorial Union. The MU 
                      truly was our home and even as I come back and visit as 
                      an alumnus, the first place I go is always the Memorial 
                      Union!&quot;<br>
                      <strong>- Tom Studdert, '98</strong></p>
                    <p>&quot;When I first attended ASU in the early 1980s, I was 
                      an aeronautical engineering technology (AET) major, headed 
                      into the Navy after graduation to fly jets. I was a full-time 
                      student, working part-time at nights, and in flight training 
                      almost all other times in between -- except for about one 
                      hour per week when I could get away to relax. The place 
                      was the lower level of the Memorial Union, where for about 
                      75 cents I'd play three games this stupid Star Wars-like 
                      video game called Gorf. I beat the &quot;aliens&quot; so 
                      many times that I wound up with more than three games, and 
                      had to leave the machine running for the next round of students, 
                      while I raced out to go fly or work. The MU, simply, was 
                      my escape and my sanctuary. It was also a place of refuge. 
                      When I returned in 2004 as an adult student, the MU was 
                      still there. The video games were still there, but not Gorf. 
                      That's OK. What stood out two decades later was how much 
                      this place seemed like &quot;home.&quot; If I were 18 all 
                      over again, the MU would be everything to me -- the place 
                      to eat, socialize and study. Why would anyone need anything 
                      other than a ratty studio apartment to sleep in, when they 
                      have the MU for everything else?&quot;<br>
                      <strong>- Ben Winton, '82, '06</strong></p>
                    <p>&quot;I remember when you could drive past the Union when 
                      College Avenue was a thru street to University. I also remember 
                      when the ASU Bookstore was in the basement of the MU. I 
                      have enjoyed the Union as a student and a staff member. 
                      Happy Birthday!&quot;<br>
                      <strong>- Linda Van Scoy, '71</strong></p>
                    <p>&quot;My very first memory of the MU was when I was still 
                      a freshmen attending ASU east (now Polytechnic campus). 
                      I had to drive to the Tempe campus in order to get my tuition 
                      payment credited. I got lost driving around on Mill Avenue 
                      and finally just parked anywhere I could find a spot. I 
                      was told by one of the ASU staff to just walk until I found 
                      a building called the MU. It was a big brick building and 
                      there should be a lot of students in or around it. I finally 
                      found it and thought wow! how cool would it be to go to 
                      Tempe campus and be able to chill here everyday with my 
                      friends. That next year I did attend Tempe campus and hung 
                      out with my friends at the MU. We would usually be on the 
                      patio outside or in the fireplace lounge area. Burger King 
                      and Jamba Juice were the hot places to eat and Hoodlums 
                      was the place to get your new CD at! I had great times at 
                      the MU and never will forget my first visit to it! Happy 
                      Birthday MU! keep it up!&quot;<br>
                      <strong>-Jenifer Glavan-Lind, '05</strong></p>
                    <p>&quot;I worked at ASU from 1968-1989. They were wonderful 
                      years and I remember how much I enjoyed the MU -- especially 
                      the annual Holiday breakfast. It was the one time each year 
                      that I would see folks from across campus -- it was always 
                      a great 'reunion day.' My high school prom was held in the 
                      ballroom in 1959. That's how old I am! I remember playing 
                      on a bowling team back in the 'good ole days.' Until I read 
                      the site, I forgot that I had participated. Although I've 
                      been gone since 1989, ASU and the MU still occupies a place 
                      in my heart. Congratulations on 50 years of service to not 
                      only students, but faculty and staff alike.<br>
                      <strong>- Barbara Hallack</strong></p>
                    <p>&quot;I remember the MU being the place to go and have 
                      a cup of coffee with friends. I really enjoyed the peace 
                      in quiet during the long afternoons between classes.&quot;<br>
                      <strong>- Steven Goitia, '87</strong></p>
                    <p>&quot;The MU was an excellent escape to socialize, study 
                      in a great setting and create lasting memories.&quot;<br>
                      <strong>- Dan Dangelo, '92, '02</strong></p>
                    <p>&quot;I remember when I first started going to ASU. My 
                      mom worked at Hayden Library, where I also worked as a student 
                      worker in between classes. I was 17 years old in the Fall 
                      of 1986. I used to meet her for lunch. I also used to meet 
                      my friends at the lower level of the MU to study - People 
                      used to be able to smoke down there and I would go home 
                      after studying all afternoon smelling like I was at a bar! 
                      - I don't and never smoked. There used to be a burger place 
                      down there, that later became a Burger King - The first 
                      fast food joint on campus! I also remember studying in the 
                      quiet room - much better than the basement...I also remember 
                      on ocassion getting an apple fritter and a chocolate milk 
                      for breakfast at the small cart/bakery in the hall that 
                      crosses the MU from North to South. I also remember the 
                      long lines that used to form on the second floor of the 
                      MU for early registration and eating lunch in the Pima room. 
                      It's hard to believe! That it was 20 years ago - I don't 
                      feel that old and the numbers sound so big! I had a lot 
                      of good times over the years and during my time at ASU and 
                      the MU was definitely a place where we hung out a lot. Those 
                      were the days....I also remember the small movie theater 
                      in the basement -- I think there's a gift shop (or there 
                      used to be) in its place now. I saw &quot;9 and a Half Weeks&quot; 
                      there!! There used to do improv/stand up comedy down there 
                      also.&quot;<br>

                    <p>&quot;My first job in Arizona was at the Recreation Center 
                      in the Memorial Union. While I was only a part timer down 
                      there, I have fond memories of the nice folks that I associated 
                      with down there including staff members Terry, Dee, Bruce 
                      G., Ralph V., and Cliff. The MU was truly at the heart of

                    <p>&quot;My most vivid memory of the MU occured on November 
                      22, 1963...I was walking by the front and there was a car 
                      parked (in those days you could still drive through campus) 
                      with its radio going and the passenger door was open with 
                      some students listening...I went over and heard the news 
                      that president kennedy had just been shot...I went inside 
                      the mu and they had a color TV in a lounge that was turned 
                      on to the shooting and many students had already gathered 
                      to watch...so while my memory of the MU is very vivid, it 
                      is not of a positive nature...&quot;<br>

                      and a couple of memories: I walked to school (Mt. Carmel 
                      School, the brick building where the art annex is in front 
                      of the swimming pool) from home on Mill Ave. down College 
                      Avenue through the ASU campus and watched the construction 
                      of the MU every day. I was fascinated by the amount of brick-laying 
                      that went in to the project. I thought that I may want to 
                      someday be a brick-layer. Another memory was the annual 
                      MU Birthday parties probably in the early to mid sixties. 
                      A friend and I would go every year and next to Christmas

                      in the early mornings for the fresh bagels that were so

                      the range of cultural experiences I received through the 
                      concert and lecture series: the likes of Max Ernst, Agnes 
                      Moorehead, Les Brown and his band of renown, Merce Cunningham, 
                      and Jose Limon. It wasn't until after I later moved to NYC 
                      that I understand the depth of the talent that ASU brought 
                      to my front door. I also remember fondly my time as a Freshman 
                      Hostess, wearing white gloves as I handed out programs at 
                      these events. Another highlight of the MU was the "MU Birthday 
                      Party" era: I was involved in organizing 2 or 3 (San Francisco 
                      and an Elizabeth Theme - Footprints on the Sands of time 
                      or something like that). These were amazing and wonderful 
                      events - turning the building into a playland built around 
                      one theme each year. Lots of energy, team building, and 
                      an amazing learning experience were central to these events. 
                      I treasure those times and remember so very fondly the kindness 
                      and friendship of Cecilia Scoular and Trudy Thomas, who 
                      were committed to making the MU the best that it could be."<br>

                      offices of MUAB (Memorial Union Activities Board) were housed 
                      there. A weekly ritual among the staff members of MUAB was 
                      to bowl (we were a makeshift league of sorts) and then retreat 
                      to the TV lounge to watch "Moonlighting". The MU continues 
                      to grow and change but still manages to maintain that "living 
                      room" feeling -- a home away from home and a great community

                      across from the bowling alley. I was the VP of Membership 
                      my junior year and we hung out and worked down there from 
                      early in the morning until late, late at night. I have fond 
                      memories of napping on the couches, using the KROY machine 
                      to create posters and flyers, and participating in MUAB 
                      events. I made many great friends that year, most of whom 
                      I've lost touch with over the years. It was some of the

                      "I remember November 22, 1963, as if it were yesterday. 
                      I was having lunch in the ballroom of the MU and listening 
                      to a concert by the ASU Symphony Orchestra. At the end of 
                      the concert, the conductor informed the large student audience 
                      that Pres. Kennedy had been assassinated in Dallas, Texas. 
                      People streamed out of the ballroom crying or stunned in 
                      disbelief. One girl fell down the stairs and hurt herself 
                      (we later found out she had broken her leg). Everyone was 
                      in such a state of shock that for quite a while, no one 
                      stopped to help her. We all stood for the longest time in 
                      front of the Union as if in a daze, a very bad dream. It 
                      was surreal. It was as if we were afraid to leave the MU 
                      for fear the world was falling apart. It isn't a pleasant 
                      memory, but it is etched on my brain forever. I used to 
                      work in the catering department at the MU and waited tables 
                      in the faculty dining room. I spent lots of time there and 
                      made many wonderful friends. It was my home away from home. 
                      I am so glad to hear it is still there. I would love to

                      or before, a place to "grab" something to eat, a snack,

                      to see movies, find a ride or rider to California, a place 
                      to sit by a fireplace, a place to take a catnap - de-stress, 
                      to meet friends, to play in a backgammon tournament, or, 
                      my very special experience - to see a renowned speaker (as

                      night in 1986). Indeed, to me, the MU is the "gateway" to
