All administrative appointments are on a year-to-year basis only.<P>A person holding a continuing academic professional appointment does not lose that appointment by reason of appointment to, or relief from, the year-to-year administrative appointment.  Administrators do not accrue time toward continuing status as administrators but do accrue time toward continuing status if they also have a probationary appointment as an academic professional.<P>When a vacancy occurs in an administrative assignment and there is insufficient time for recruitment, an acting or interim appointment, not to exceed 12 months, may be made by the supervising dean.  Such appointment may be made after consultation with academic professionals and faculty in the unit and/or other administrators as appropriate for the position to be filled.  A memorandum outlining the consultative process and the terms and conditions of the acting/interim appointment should be filed with the <A HREF="acd002.html#eo/aaoffice" TARGET="New">EO/AA Office</A> as a matter of record.<P>&#147;Acting&#148; appointments are those without the full authority associated with the position.  &#147;Interim&#148; appointments are those with the full authority associated with the position.<P><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Cross-References</B></FONT></CENTER><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><P>See also&#58;<P><OL><LI><A HREF="acd504.html">ACD 504</A>, &#147;<I>Conditions of Administrative Service</I> at ASU&#148;<P>and</LI><P><LI><A HREF="acd505-04.html">ACD 505&#150;04</A>, &#147;Recruitment/Appointment.&#148;</LI></OL><P>&#160;<P><HR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">ACD</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="acd001.html">contact</A> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="provost.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
