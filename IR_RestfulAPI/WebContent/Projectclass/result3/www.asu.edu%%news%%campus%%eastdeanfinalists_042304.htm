      <h2>ASU names four finalists for East campus vice president and provost position </h2>
      <p>The search committee for the next vice president and provost of the East campus at ASU has narrowed the pool of candidates to four finalists whose names have been forwarded to President Michael Crow and Executive Vice President and Provost Milton Glick. </p>
      <p>Each finalist will visit the university for two days for interviews and open forums. Crow will make the final selection. </p>
      <p>The finalists are: </p>
      <p>. Richard M. Durand, dean, College of Business and Economics, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Penn. Durand has a Ph.D. in business administration, an M.B.A., and a B.A. in political science, all from the University of Florida. Prior to working at Lehigh, Durand was a professor and chair of the marketing faculty at the University of Maryland, College Park. He will visit the university from 10:30 to 4 p.m., April 30. An open faculty/staff forum will be held from 1:30 to 3 p.m. and a student forum from 3:15 to 4:15 p.m., in the Campus Union Ballroom on the East campus. </p>
      <p>. Gerald S. Jakubowski, P.E., dean, College of Science and Engineering, Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles. Jakubowski has a Ph.D. in engineering science, and an M.S. and B.S. in mechanical engineering, all from the University of Toledo. Prior to being named dean at Loyola, Jakubowski held interim dean, associate dean and assistant dean positions at Memphis State University. He will visit the university from 10:30 to 4 p.m., April 27. An open faculty/staff forum will be held from 1:30 to 3 p.m. and a student forum from 3:15 to 4 p.m., in the Campus Union Ballroom on the East campus. </p>
      <p>. Stephen A. Szygenda, dean, School of Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas. Szygenda holds a Ph.D. and M.S. in computer engineering from Northwestern University and a B.S. in applied mathematics from Fairleigh Dickinson University. Before joining SMU as dean, Szygenda served as dean of the School of Engineering at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. He visited the university April 22. </p>
      <p>. David A. Wagie, dean of faculty, United States Air Force Academy, Colorado. Wagie has a Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Purdue University; an M.S. in Systems Management from the University of Southern California; an M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University; and a B.S. in Engineering Sciences from the United States Air Force Academy. Prior to being named dean of faculty and chief academic officer, Wagie was vice dean and assistant chief academic officer for the academy. Wagie holds the rank of brigadier general in the Air Force. He visited the university April 20. </p>
      <p>Glick, who chaired the search committee, said, "The strength of our finalists and overall candidate pool demonstrates a high level of interest by the academic community in ASU, particularly the evolving polytechnic campus. I am pleased that we have such outstanding candidates to consider for this important position." </p>
      <p>Roc Arnett, president and CEO of the East Valley Partnership and a member of the search committee, said, "The search committee looked for a person who could take the polytechnic model envisioned by the faculty, staff and President Crow, and implement that model. This is going to require a person who is extremely intelligent with a phenomenal ability to lead the faculty, staff and community in this direction, and we have four candidates who fit that bill." </p>
      <p>The East campus consists of three colleges - East College, offering liberal arts and professional-oriented programs; the College of Technology and Applied Sciences, which offers engineering technology programs; and the Morrison School of Agribusiness and Resource Management, a specialized business school focusing on the agribusiness sector. Currently serving 3,660 students, the campus is slated to grow to up to 15,000 students in the next 15 years and focus on offering a wide variety of professional and liberal arts programs, applied science and technology curricula. </p>
