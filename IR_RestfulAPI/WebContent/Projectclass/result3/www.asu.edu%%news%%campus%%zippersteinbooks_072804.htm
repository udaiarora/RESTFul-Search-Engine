      <h2><strong>Jewish scholar donates 10,000-volume collection to ASU Library </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>For many years, Jewish scholar and author Edward Zipperstein, and his wife, Mae, collected books on many different aspects of Judaism and related subjects. </p>
        <p>Over more than 40 years of collecting, they acquired 10,000 volumes, and the Zipperstein Collection soon outgrew the bookshelves in their Los Angeles home. </p>
        <p>For a time, the books were housed in a building behind the couple's home, but now, thanks to the Zippersteins and their son Steven, a professor at Stanford University, the Zipperstein Collection is an important part of Arizona State University's Hayden Library. </p>
        <p>At the urging of Zachary Baker, Reinhard Family Curator of Judaica and Hebraica Collections at Stanford University Libraries, The Zippersteins' son, Steven, chose Hayden Library to receive the collection because of the growing reputation of ASU's Jewish Studies Program, which is directed by Irving and Miriam Lowe Professor Jack Kugelmass. </p>
        <p>Steven Zipperstein is Daniel E. Koshland Professor of Jewish Culture and History and co-director of the Taube Center for Jewish Studies at Stanford University. </p>
        <p>Selected titles from the collection, "Living With Jewish Books," are on exhibit at Hayden Library, through Aug. 31, on the Concourse Level. </p>
        <p>Edward Zipperstein, a well-known CPA who wrote his doctoral dissertation on business ethics in Jewish Law and published six volumes of essays, articles and monographs, holds numerous advanced degrees in philosophy, business administration and law. </p>
        <p>"His library was used as his primary resource, providing him with the necessary scholarly and Rabbinic sources he needed in the pursuit of his public and private life as a lecturer, writer and perpetual student," said Rachel Leket-Mor, Jewish Studies bibliographer for Hayden Library. </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p>He collected - and studied - books on the history of Judaism and the Jewish people, American Jewish history, history of Zionism, biblical studies, religious studies, the history of Christianity, philosophy, Jewish education, Hebrew instruction in Jewish day schools and American Jewish sermons throughout the 20 th century, among other topics. </p>
        <p>Prepared by Leket-Mor, the exhibit illustrates the diversity and profoundness of the Zipperstein Collection. <br>
    Many of the sermons, Hebrew instruction textbooks and titles in the children's literature collection are becoming rare and sought-after, Leket-Mor said. </p>
        <p>The exhibit focuses on 12 themes: Key Jewish texts; children's adaptations of Biblical stories and Jewish histories; 350 years of Jewish communal life in America (in conjunction with "Celebrate 350: Jewish Life in America, 1654-2004," a year-long series of programs initiated by the national Jewish community); the Jewish education system in the United States; Hebrew instruction in early 20 th century Jewish day schools; Bar/Bat Mitzvah books; children's literature; Jewish way of life (holidays, rituals, prayer books); Holy Land and Israel travel guides; history of Zionism; religious studies; and Jewish sermons. </p>
        <p>Edward Zipperstein collected hundreds of modern American-Jewish sermons for his own use in sermons he delivered in Young Israel, a Jewish orthodox congregation in Los Angeles, and elsewhere. According to Leket-Mor, the Jewish sermon is an ancient tradition that may have originated in the custom to translate Hebrew Bible segments into the Aramaic vernacular and rephrase them for those who could not follow the Hebrew reading, adding folktales and dramatization and using various rhetorical means. </p>
        <p>Contemporary sermons touch on such themes as the controversy between religion and science, the role of the State of Israel, the permissive society, intermarriage and the use and abuse of wealth. </p>
        <p>Leket-Mor said of the collection, "Any future research of American Judaism in the 20 th century will benefit from this immense collection." </p>
        <p>The exhibit may be viewed during library hours&nbsp; (go to <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/mainlibs.htm">http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/mainlibs.htm </a>). For more information about the exhibit, call Leket-Mor at (480) 965-2618. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
