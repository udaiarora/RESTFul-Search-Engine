Main motivations seemed to be cost savings, multi-user and remote accessibility, and real-time updating</li><li>AAD charged with developing a publishing and archiving plan </li><li>December 1996: 1st meeting w/AAD requested help creating an archiving plan for the policy manuals. </li><li>January 1997 issued draft report on electronic archiving with the following major points:</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Academic and Administrative Documents and Information Technology:</h1><ul><li>Use  non-proprietary HTML codes in compliance with the current W3 standard (currently HTML 2.0) Test compliance using the W3 verification service.</li><li>Establish firewalls to prevent tampering with university records.</li><li>Do not use compression algorithms in backup systems.</li><li>Insure that newly revised official versions of the entire web site are backed up immediately. Real time revisions made on the local AAD copy may be backed up on their regular weekly cycle.</li><li>Establish a program of media maintenance and refreshment for backup tapes based upon the reliable shelf life of the media, the frequency of policy updates and availability of the hardware needed to read the implemented media format.</li><li>Keep an extra set of backup tapes off campus in case of disaster.</li><li>Test migrations to new platforms with non-vital records before migrating vital records to avoid data loss or data corruption. </li><li>Each time the live policy manual is migrated to a new system the superceded versions should be migrated as well.</li><li>Draft and submit a migration plan to the Arizona Department of Library Archives and Public Records, Records Management Division for review and approval in accordance with public records laws.</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1 class="first">Campus-Wide Considerations:</h1><ul><li>Establish an official campus standard for HTML browsers and require compliance with the current W3 standard for any campus world wide web application involving official university records.</li><li>Establish an official campus standard for backup media and insure that campus vendors support that media. Review the standard and revise as necessary.</li><li>Investigate rules of evidence and chain of custody requirements regarding electronic records in Arizona and Federal courts.</li><li>Review and/or implement university policies regarding tampering or distribution of falsified university records.</li><li>Establish a permanent campus-wide consultative or enforcement body to review technological applications for creation of university records, monitor developments in migration technologies, evidential or audit requirements and assure compliance with state records laws.</li><li>June 1997,  ADLAPR memo issued to &#8220;University and Community College Registrars&#8221; suggesting that &#8220;use of electronic systems for retention of permanent public records would be a violation of permanent media requirements.&#8221;</li><li>ADLAPR staff advised that policy manuals were already scheduled as permanent public records and that permanent media requirements applied.</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1 class="first">Campus-Wide Considerations:</h1><ul><li>Graduate College interested in ETD&#8217;s</li><li>concerns about unauthorized course descriptions presented by departments on the web</li><li>email retention questions coming to my office</li><li>January 1998: With AAD we drafted a records retention schedule and hardcopy archiving plan for policy manuals [display draft schedule]</li><li>Dean arranged meeting with Provost Glick to request reversal of electronic retention decision and discuss other matters</li><li>Feb 10, 1998 ­ Provost approved:<ul><li>hardcopy archiving updating plan</li><li>concept of official university policy manuals site</li><li>updating cycle of three times per year</li><li>declined to establish university wide regulatory group; suggested we host this conference&#8230;</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1 class="first">Campus-Wide Considerations:</h1><ul><li>Fall 1998 we discovered that one content manager had created their own policy website and posted a number of new policies or updates that did not appear in the official site. Their major concern was that the updating plan would not support policy changes that had immediate or retrospective implementation dates.</li><li>An ad hoc committee on manual updating was charged by the Provost to address this and recommended:</li><li>Revision of updating procedure to allow for content managers to apply to the Office of the Provost for update out of cycle:</li><li>Criteria for updating out of cycle are:</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1 class="first">Campus-Wide Considerations:</h1><ul><li>Revised policy has an &#8220;immediate and significant impact on university employees or students that it must be communicated&#8230;&#8221;</li><li>Absence of policies will result in legal liabilities</li><li>Changes mandated by US or AZ Legislature, Regents or legal opinion with an immediate implementation date</li><li>Updates would be drafted and marked up by the content managers and sent to AAD for posting on the official site</li><li>AAD would print the update at the time of posting and send copies to Archives</li><li>AAD would reformat the new posting to the standard presentation at the next full revision cycle.</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Other issues we addressed in this process:</h1><ul><li>Linking to external documents not controlled by ASU, e.g. Regents Policies</li><li>Chain of custody procedures for dating printouts and logging delivery to Archives</li><li>Disclaimer language for web presentation that official copy resides at Archives</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Lessons Learned (I think):</h1><ul><li>HTML encoded documents and websites in themselves are effective access tools, but not effective recordkeeping systems</li><li>Decentralized client-server computing and the popular ethos of an unregulated internet make it much more difficult to establish information policy and recordkeeping standards.</li><li>Capturing the record of an interactive website is a matter of snapshot timing as well as format and content scope.</li><li>In some instances it may be acceptable to identify the text of a web document as the record and the html presentation of that text as non-record artistry.</li><li>Contextual information or metadata about snapshot and backup procedures and how they were executed is important in establishing authenticity of the record.</li><li>We don't yet understand the costs of web preservation, particularly for &#8220;permanent&#8221; records,  and cannot effectively compare it to the costs of hardcopy publication, distribution and retention.</li><li>Should appearance and functionality be deemed essential elements of the record, use of proprietary software and html codes increases the risk of record loss or corruption.</li></ul></div><!-- footer --><p class="nav">[ <a href="../../"><acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym> Home</a> |<a href="../../archives.html">Archives</a> |<a href="../">1999 Presentations</a> ]</p><div class="footer">    <p class="postdate">&copy;&nbsp;1999    Samuels &nbsp;&#8212;    Last Modified		Wednesday 11 February 2004		<br />Visits to this page: <img src="/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?pad=0|dd=E|ft=0|tr=T|trgb=ffffff|df=ickim-ecure-speaker-presentation-spindler-html.dat" alt="Number of visits to this page" />	</p></div></body></html>
