<h2>
The SEM Program: An Interdisciplinary Approach</h2>
The Science and Engineering of Materials Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program
at Arizona State University was established in January 1987 by the <a href="http://www.abor.asu.edu">Arizona
Board of Regents</a> and is administered by the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate">Graduate
College</a>, with the concurrence of the <a href="http://www.eas.asu.edu">College
of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> and the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/clas">College
of Liberal Arts and Sciences</a>. The Program is operated by its faculty
whose members are drawn from the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/clas/csss/">Center
for Solid State Science</a> and the departments of<a href="http://www.eas.asu.edu/~cbme/">Chemical,
Bio and Materials Engineering</a>, <a href="http://www.eas.asu.edu:7001/">Electrical
Engineering</a>, <a href="http://www.eas.asu.edu/~mae/">Mechanical &amp;
Aerospace Engineering</a>, <a href="http://www.asu.edu/clas/chemistry/">Chemistry
&amp; Biochemistry</a> and <a href="http://www.asu.edu/clas/dopa/dopa.html">Physics
&amp; Astronomy</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The Program provides excellent graduate education in materials through
both instruction and research participation, with emphasis on the solid
state science underlying the broad spectrum of materials science and engineering.
Most research done by <a href="4facult.htm#students">students</a> in the
program emphasizes synthesis of new materials, microstructural characterization,
including methods development, down to the atomic resolution level, and
selected properties measurements as functions of microstructure. Between
1990 and the end of 1995 nineteen students completed work for their doctorates
in the program. The response of major industry and academic employers to
our program graduates has been excellent. All of our graduates readily
achieved challenging positions in industry and universities in the US and
in other countries.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The interdisciplinary <a href="4facult.htm#faculty">faculty</a> strives
to deliver the best educational experience to students while simultaneously
contributing to the development of new knowledge through research accomplishments.
Program <a href="4facult.htm#alumni">graduates</a> are well prepared for
careers in research, development and teaching.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The SEM program emphasizes synthesis of new materials, with emphasis
on atomistics and bonding approaches, and quantitative structure-property
relations education and research. Six graduate courses treating characterization
and analysis of microstructure, physical materials science, chemical thermodynamics
and reaction kinetics, quantum theory of solids and solid state chemistry
and physics provide the academic core for the program. Click here for <a href="gradcors.htm">course
and credit requirements.</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Other courses for students enrolled in the program are determined by
the student's faculty supervisory committee in consultation with the student.
Study program planning for individual students who enter the SEM Program
from diverse engineering and scientific disciplines takes into account
the breadth of the students materials knowledge and experience as well
as the student's primary materials interests and career goals. Dissertation
research topics pursued by students in the program span a wide range of
new materials topics. Two recent examples are Interfaces in Silicon Carbide
Whisker Reinforced Silicon Nitride Based Composites and Extrinsic Gettering
of Impurity Elements by Near-Surface Dislocations in Copper-Diffused Czochralski
Silicon.
