                study area (room C-55) is now equipped for wireless access! The 
                system&#8217;s range extends far beyond the room itself so that 
                patrons can use their laptops both outside and inside in areas 
                adjacent to C-55. If you are considering using this new service, 
                an IEEE 802.11b or an IEEE 802.11b-g compatible wireless network 
                card is required. For a review of various network cards or for 
                recommendations on selecting a card, visit IT&#8217;s Network 
                Card Review page at <a href="http://asu.edu/comm/wlan/review.html">http://asu.edu/comm/wlan/review.html</a>.

          <p align="left"><strong>Q. <em>&quot;Whenever I submit an SOS ticket 
            online, it&#8217;s usually for a problem with access to an electronic 
            resource. Why do we have so many problems with these?&quot;</em></strong></p>
          <p align="left"><strong>A.</strong> The library provides thousands of 
            electronic resources, including databases, electronic journals, PDF 
            files and others. LIST maintains some electronic resources on-campus, 
            but a majority of our resources are owned and maintained by off-site 
            vendors. Given the sheer number of resources we provide our patrons, 
            we actually have relatively few problems with them, but there are 
            a few commonly reported technical issues. Problems can occur at the 
            vendor site, with the network outside of ASU, or with the network 
            within ASU. Further complicating this are the various methods of authenticating 
            our users so each resource recognizes them as valid ASU users. Most 
            of our vendors recognize an ASU IP address as valid; some require 
            additional configuration. We use the proxy server to allow our off 
            campus patrons to appear as though they have an ASU IP address.</p>
          <p align="left">Below are some typical problems, and possible solutions. 
            Any problems should be reported to SOS, who will diagnose the problem 
            and forward it to whomever can best solve the problem.</p>
          <p align="left"><strong>Symptom: The electronic resource is asking me 
            for a userid and password, although ASU Libraries has a subscription, 
            or the resource is acting differently that it did yesterday.</strong><br>
            1. The Vendor has changed something (server, software, network), which 
            no longer recognizes ASU as a valid user. This generally requires 
            Collection Development (licensing problem), Tech Services (payment 
            problem) or LIST (technical problem) to contact the vendor to sort 
            out.<br>
            2. The user is off-campus and has not logged into the ASU Library 
            System&#8217;s proxy server, or the resource&#8217;s URL has not been 
            added to the proxy server.<br>
            3. The site offers additional personalization beyond what is available 
            via ASU Libraries&#8217; subscription, which may or may not be a free 
            service to individual users.<br>
            4. ASU Libraries subscribes to part of the resource, but not all parts 
            of the resource.</p>
          <p align="left"><strong>Symptom: When I click on the URL I get a Bad 
            Gateway error page.</strong><br>
            1. This usually means that the resource&#8217;s server is down or 
            unavailable.<br>
            2. This could also mean that there is network interference between 
            ASU and the resource site.</p>
          <p align="left"><strong>Symptom: When I click on the URL I get a 403 
            Forbidden error page.</strong><br>
            1. This is a problem with permissions. The site does not recognize 
            ASU as a valid user.<br>
            2. If this happens to an off campus user it may mean that the resource 
            has not been entered into the proxy forward table.</p>
