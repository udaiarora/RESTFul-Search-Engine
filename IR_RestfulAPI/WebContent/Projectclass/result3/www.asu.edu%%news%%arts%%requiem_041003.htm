      <h2>Brahms' Requiem performed in its entirety by ASU choral and orchestral
        ensembles</h2>
      <p> Ein Deutsches Requiem (A German Requiem), considered by many to
        be Brahms's first major success, will be performed in its entirety (all
        seven movements) by the University Symphony Orchestra and combined ASU
        Choirs. All the groups are in the ASU Herberger College of Fine Arts
        School of Music. Guest soloists are bass-baritone Stephen Bryant and
        soprano Jayne West.</p>
      <p>WHEN: May 4 (Sunday), 2:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>WHERE: Gammage Auditorium, 1200 S. Forest Ave., main ASU Campus, Tempe</p>
      <p>HOW MUCH: Free, no tickets required. Doors open at 2 p.m.</p>
      <p>INFORMATION: 480-965-8863</p>
      <p>All seven movements of Brahms' Ein Deutsches Requiem (A German Requiem),
        will be performed by the School of Music's University Symphony Orchestra
        and the combined ASU Choirs: Concert Choir, University Choir, Women's
        Chorus and Choral Union.</p>
      <p>The concert is May 4 at 2:30 p.m. in Gammage Auditorium, which is on
        the ASU campus in Tempe at 1200 S. Forest Avenue. Admission is free,
        no tickets are required. Doors open at 2 p.m.</p>
      <p>"Brahms's composition, a memorial not of any one death but of all deaths,
        is indeed a work of consolation and promise that transcends dogma to
        address all humanity," writes ASU director of choral activities David
        Schildkret in the program notes for the concert.</p>
      <p>"Brahms worked on the Requiem intermittently over a period of some fourteen
        years. The earliest material - the opening of the second movement - dates
        from 1854, when it was sketched as part of an aborted symphony in D minor.
        The last music was the fifth movement, composed in June of 1868, after
        the first performance. Several pivotal events in the composer's life
        seem to have provided the impetus for the work: in 1854, Robert Schumann,
        Brahms's close friend, mentor, and enthusiastic supporter, attempted
        suicide; Schumann died in an asylum in 1856; Brahms's beloved stepmother
        died in 1865. At each of these times, Brahms did some significant work
        on the Requiem. The title itself may have been inspired by Schumann,
        who contemplated writing a work by the same name. Despite its superficial
        connection to these events, however, the German Requiem remains a meditation
        on death and redemption, rather than a memorial either to Schumann or
        to Brahms's stepmother.</p>
      <p>"Musically, the work reflects its composer's eclectic nature. There
        are influences of Beethoven, Cherubini, J.S. Bach, and even the motets
        of such Renaissance composers as Palestrina.But the vessel into which
        Brahms poured his musical creativity is the text. As a large sacred work,
        the Requiem is unique; for its text is neither liturgical (as in a Mass)
        nor a poetic meditation on a Biblical narrative (as in an oratorio),
        but the composer's own compilation of texts from the German Bible and
        the Apocrypha," notes Schildkret.</p>
      <p>"Brahms might well have called his composition 'A Human Requiem,' for
        it deals with human concerns and emotions: sorrow, trouble, anxiety,
        the meaning of life and death, and the hope and promise of a better life
        to come. Yet, in spite of its transcendent universality, it remains the
        personal expression of a complex and powerfully creative spirit. The
        mighty forces of the Requiem speak to all humanity with a single voice
        - that of Brahms himself - and therein lies its power to touch us so
        deeply," writes Schildkret.</p>
      <p>Guest soloists for the concert are Stephen Bryant and Jayne West. Bass-baritone
        Stephen Bryant's distinguished career in concert and opera has taken
        him around the world, with performances in the U.S., Europe, the Middle
        East and Asia. He is especially known for his artistry as soloist in
        orchestral works. In addition to his extensive concert engagements, Bryant
        also maintains an active opera career and has sung with numerous companies,
        including Santa Fe Opera, New York City Opera and Arizona Opera. Soprano
        Jayne West has performed with many of the country's leading orchestras
        and chamber groups. In addition to having sun most of the Bach Cantatas,
        West has sung several times on Emmanuel Music's seven-year Schubert series
        and in its performance of Schubert's Mass in E-Flat, Bach's B Minor Mass
        and Handel's Hercules, Saul and Brockes Passion. <br>
