<h2><b>Minutes of Meeting</b></h2>

      </font></font> 
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">November 7, 2001</font></b> 
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Present:</b> Patricia Feldman, 
        Carol Behl, Stefan Myhajlenko, Linda Shackle, Santos C. Vega<br>
        <b>Members Excused:</b> Annie Platoff<br>
        <b>Guest Speaker:</b> Dr. Gail Hackett, Vice Provost for Academic Personnel<br>
        <b>Agenda:</b> Review minutes from 10-03-01; Old business; new business; 
        Plan next neeting; Adjourn.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The review of 10-03 minutes 
        was postponed until next meeting.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The old business included the 
        invitation of Dr. Hackett to visit with CAPS. Patricia Feldman, Chair, 
        asked Dr. Hackett for an overview.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G.H. said that she did not 
        have expectatiosn of the CAPS committee. Patty Feldman will provide the 
        direct connection between CAPS and the administration and university business 
        as being member of the Provost Advisory Personnel Council (PAC 20). Patty 
        can propose issues important to CAPS before the C. of 20.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main points discussed at 
        CAPS meeting included the efforts to educate the rest of the campus on 
        what APs are and do.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Hackett once more demonstrated 
        an interest in the Associate Advisors and asked to up-date last year's 
        letter in regards to that issue. The letter written and submitted to Dr. 
        Vega as Chair of CAPS last year by Carol Behl and Victor Becerra, was 
        retyped in computer, signed and sent to Dr. Hackett by S. Vega. The matter, 
        placed on hold during the summer, can be redirected again this year. It 
        was suggested that to avoid confusion, the issue should be presented along 
        three lines of status of APs: year-to-year, probationary, and continuing. 
        A new revised letter in these regards of the issue should then be sent 
        to Dr. Morton E. Munk, President of Academic Senate and a copy to Dr. 
        Gail Hackett. APs are part of Academic Senate.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A long discusssion ensued about 
        how APs were believed to have been created and how Academic Associates 
        should include recognition and gain voting rights and use APs resources. 
        Adding to the mix was the action taken last year of some classified staff 
        personnel becoming Administrative Associates, a move that ended in providing 
        less benefits and promotions. Academic Asociates were created for a temporary 
        need but are not temporary need in reality. The some colleges deal differently 
        with how classified staff mvoe into associate ranks. The end result is 
        that the process of placing in rank, promotion, and continuing status 
        for Associates is not rational. The realm of personnel including promotion 
        and tenure of faculty, year-to-year faculty, and faculty associates who 
        teach part-time is in need of study and readjusting toward understanding 
        and protection of personnel. In reality, everyone on campus, including 
        tenured faculty, have a year-to-year contract. Other issues discussed 
        included hiring, promotion, scholarly work definition, faculty retention, 
        and partners (example man and wife teams) recruitment and hiring. These 
        partner combinations may create problems such conducting a national search 
        for one and then hiring the partner minus search and interviewing process. 
        Two or more departments have to coordinate effort to avoid one bearing 
        an undue burden. Other real campus problems discussed included lack of 
        space and funds. Another issue concerned the ACD Manual.. It was developed 
        piecemeal and is difficult to read and interpret. By next year CAPS will 
        need a committee to work on the ACD Manual and write a report. The post-tenure 
        status remains on hold. One issue to study is the sick-leave issue, especially 
        for APs on a nine-month appointment. Faculty who have twenty years and 
        are ready to retire have accrued sick leave, but new faculty do not accrue. 
        The health benefits and the budget crisis were the last issues discussed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The CAPS members decided to 
        meet on December 5, 2001 in Gila 214.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meeting adjourned.<br>
