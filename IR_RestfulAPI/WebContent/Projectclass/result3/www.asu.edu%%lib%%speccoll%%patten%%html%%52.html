?&nbsp;&nbsp; This work is a later edition, which has been expanded and
updated to include information on the "fighting cock and the art of angling."&nbsp;
The author has maintained the basic format of the earlier version (See
PAT-51), but has eliminated the listing of sources, and has changed the
participants in the various conversations so that book one is a dialogue
between Rigo and Cono on Earable-ground and Tillage.&nbsp; Book two is
a conversation now between just three participants, Thrasybulus, Marius,
and Julia, on the subject of Gardens, Orchards, and Woods.&nbsp; Hipoconus,
Euphorbus, Hedio, and Eumaeus remain as the
<BR>participants in the third book's conversation on the Feeding, Breeding,
and Curing of Cattell.&nbsp; Finally, book four becomes simply a dialogue
between Pullarius and Mellisseus on the subject of Poultrie, Fowle, Fish,
and Bees.&nbsp; The author has indicated any new additions to this edition
with symbols in the marginal notes, making it easy for a continuing reader
to discover the new information.
