Human Resources (HR) and the tax unit of Financial Services are available to assist departments in deciding whether a payee qualifies as an independent contractor.<p>ASU infrequently enters into short-term consulting agreements with individuals who are incoming employees with a start date typically six months or less in the future, or separating employees who typically are finishing up a project or otherwise assisting in the transition to a new hire. Since these engagements are established as transitional positions to facilitate the appropriate payment of wages to either exiting or entering staff, the job title is strictly a temporary one for which no waiver of employment is required.  These are not faculty appointments. For tax withholding and reporting purposes, these individuals will be paid through the ASU payroll system under the Consultant (job class code 091427, Service Professional) or Senior Consultant (job class code 091000, Administrative) job classification. These appointments must be supported by a written agreement and will not be benefits eligible, but are covered by workman's compensation.<p>Any exception to this policy requires approval of the associate vice president for finance and treasurer, or associate director for tax, and may necessitate a review by external tax counsel, with the requesting department being responsible for the external legal fees. <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Nominal Payments</b></font><p>Payments for &#036;100 or less coded to a services expenditure code (object 7310) or to participant stipend (7400 20) can be processed without the Consultant/Independent Contractor Determination Checklist. The <a href="finforms.html">Request for Taxpayer Identification and Certification form (Substitute W-9 Form)</a> is required as backup documentation for the vendor entry (VE) document. If related expenses are being reimbursed, original receipt(s) totaling the expense reimbursement amount also need to be attached. If the payment for services or participant stipend exceeds &#036;100 per recipient, or if any recipient is expected to receive multiple payments that will exceed &#036;100 in the calendar year, all applicable forms need to be completed and attached to the payment request. <p>The nominal payment rule does not apply to payments made to foreign visitors. See <a href="index.html#425">FIN 425</a> for additional information on payments to nonresident aliens.<p><img src="finhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height=2><center><font size=+2><b>Background</b></font></center><img src="finhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height=2><p>An independent contractor is broadly defined as an individual or organization contracted to perform a particular service whereby the person who does the work exercises a greater degree of control and direction than does ASU over the manner in which the job is done. Individuals performing services for ASU under conditions whereby ASU exercises a greater degree of control and direction are treated as employees for tax withholding and reporting purposes. Independent contractors are issued IRS Form 1099-MISC reporting the amount paid for services.<p>For tax reporting purposes, an independent contractor may not designate his or her fee to be paid to a charitable organization. Payment for services must be made to the individual or organization contracting to provide the service.<p><img src="finhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height=2><center><font size=+2><b>Policy</b></font></center><img src="finhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height=2><p>Justification for procurement of services from lecturers, consultants, and other independent contractors is covered in the <i>Purchasing and Business Services Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i><a href="../pur/pur402-01.html" target="NEW">PUR 402&#150;01</a>, &#147;Personal/Professional Services,&#148; whereby requirements vary for the following categories:<p><ol><li>services costing &#036;10,000 or less</li><p><li>services costing more than &#036;10,000 but less than &#036;35,000</li><p><li>services costing &#036;35,000 or more<p>and</li><p><li>construction related services.</li></ol><p>In addition, in accordance with university policy and <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> &#167;&#167; 38&#150;501 to 38&#150;511 (Conflict of Interest of Officers and Employees), neither the org manager, nor anyone else participating in the award decision, nor a relative may benefit financially from or be a recipient of any outside services order or related payment.

Prior approval is not required for the groups of people listed in item number 1 under &#147;<a href="#Documentation">Documentation</a>.&#148; <p>The approval process includes completion of the Employee/Independent Contractor Determination Checklist by the proposed service provider and the department, and then review of this information by the tax services unit.  Additional information may be required in order to make an appropriate determination. If employment treatment is indicated, the department will be referred to Human Resources for assistance in the hiring process. Refer to the <i>Staff Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i><a href="../spp/spp210.html" target="NEW">SPP 210</a>, &#147;Consultants/Independent Contractors,&#148; for additional guidance.  <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Request for Taxpayer Identification & Certification Form</b></font><p>All individuals, partnerships, and corporations receiving independent contractor payment(s) greater than &#036;100 in a calendar year must have a <a href="finforms.html">Request for Taxpayer Identification & Certification form (Substitute W-9 Form)</a> on file with the university before payment will be made. Departments can review the Advantage Vendor (VEN2) table to determine if a Substitute W-9 Form is already on file with ASU for that vendor. If the Substitute W-9 Form has been previously completed by the vendor, the &#147;Tax Country&#148; field of the VEN2 table will have an eight-digit entry indicating the country of residence and the month and year filed, e.g., US052004.  If the &#147;Tax Country&#148; field is blank, the vendor must complete a  Substitute W-9 Form before payment can be made. The department should send the Substitute W-9 Form directly to Financial Services (mail code 5812, fax 480/965&#150;2625) for entry on the VEN2 table and should also attach a copy of the Substitute W-9 Form to the PV.<p>If the &#147;Tax Country&#148; field of the VEN2 table, or the newly filed Substitute W-9 Form, indicates that the vendor is a U.S. citizen, corporation, or partnership, no further action is required.  If the vendor is other than a U.S. citizen, corporation, or partnership, Payables and Reimbursements will forward the payment request to the tax services unit to identify additional documentation needed to make payment.  For example, nonresident alien individuals are required to complete an <a href="finforms.html">Alien Data Collection Form</a> and will be subject to back-up withholding unless eligible to claim exemption from withholding by filing IRS Form 8233.  Nonresident alien corporations and partnerships also may be subject to back-up withholding.  See <a href="fin425-04.html">FIN 425&#150;04</a>, &#147;Nonresident Alien Independent Contractors,&#148; for more information on making payments to nonresident aliens.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Departmental Professional Services Order Form</b></font><p>For services greater than &#036;100 but less than or equal to &#036;10,000, a <a href="finforms.html">Departmental Professional Services Order</a> must be attached to a completed PV.

If the professional fee portion is paid separately (e.g., installments, subsequent PVs submitted), the original professional services payment PV document number should be referenced for expense reimbursement.

If a lecturer or consultant takes a side trip for another engagement, ASU will divide the transportation cost with the other institution proportionally.  If the side trip is personal, the lecturer or consultant should assume a proportionate share of the airfare.</td></tr><tr><td valign=TOP>Mileage</td><td valign=TOP>Mileage incurred by a lecturer or consultant to travel by personal vehicle from home to the airport and back home is paid at the current mileage rate allowed by the Arizona State Department of Administration (see the <a href="travel.html">Financial Services Travel Page</a> for the current rate).  Mileage reimbursement is in lieu of reimbursement for actual gas receipts.  A lecturer or consultant may also claim reimbursement for mileage if a personal vehicle is used for transportation to Tempe; however, the reimbursement can be no higher than air coach fare to Phoenix or mileage by the most direct route, based on least cost to the university.</td></tr><tr><td valign=TOP>Lodging and food</td><td valign=TOP>Room charges as single occupant rates are paid.  Receipts for hotel charges must be provided.  Meals are reimbursed at actual cost.  Receipts are required for meals exceeding &#036;29.50 per day. Consultants should not claim reimbursement for meals provided at no cost.<p>Total meal and lodging expenses should not exceed allowed rates for Maricopa County. (See the <a href="travel.html">Financial Services Travel Page</a> for the current lodging and per diem rates.) Charges in excess of those allowed under ASU travel policies will require a written justification and may, at the discretion of Financial Services, require dean, provost, vice provost, or vice president approval.</td></tr><tr><td valign=TOP>In-town transportation</td><td valign=TOP>Transportation costs such as charges for airport limousines and taxicabs are paid if hotel courtesy shuttle service is not available.  If costs exceed &#036;25, original receipts must be attached.</td></tr></table><p><hr noshade><font color="#FFFFFF"><a name="endtable2">endtable2</a></font><p>Lecturers and consultants should pay for expenses from personal funds and then request reimbursement on a Guest Lecturers, Consultants, and Other Independent Contractors Reimbursement Form.  A lecturer or consultant who charges his or her costs to a credit card usually receives ASU&#146;s reimbursement before payment on the credit card is due if the engagement is of a short duration. Payments in excess of the standard amounts listed above must be authorized by the hosting department and may, at the discretion of Financial Services, require approval of the area&#146;s provost/vice provost/vice president.<p><b>Prepaid Airline Tickets</b><p>Lecturers and consultants may make their own airline reservations, pay for their tickets, and then request reimbursement from the university. Departments may also use one of the university&#146;s contracted travel agencies for prepaid travel of university guests. (See the <a href="travel.html">Financial Services Travel Page</a> for a listing of contracted travel agencies.) To purchase a prepaid airline ticket, the university department must process an internal purchase order (PO), using object code 7310 13, documented expense reimbursements. Before the airline ticket can be issued, the internal ASU PO number must be furnished to the contracted travel agency. Since the traveler is not an ASU employee (i.e., interviewee or consultant), the department will need to complete the Pre-Paid Airfare for Non-ASU Travelers form. Copies of the form should be maintained by the department for audit availability. The dollar amount of the prepaid airline ticket should not be included on the guest&#146;s expense reimbursement claim. If the lecture or consulting arrangement is canceled, it is the department&#146;s responsibility to make sure that the prepaid ticket is canceled and the money refunded.<p><img src="finhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height=2><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="finhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height=2><p>For information on prohibiting staff or their relatives from deriving monetary or proprietary benefit from professional services rendered to the university, see the <i>Academic Affairs Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i><a href="../acd/acd204-08.html" target="NEW">ACD 204&#150;08</a>, &#147;Conflict of Interest.&#148;<p>For information on defining personal/professional services and in selecting the appropriate contracting mechanism, see the <i>Purchasing and Business Services Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i><a href="../pur/pur402-01.html" target="NEW">PUR 402&#150;01</a>, &#147;Personal/Professional Services.&#148;<p>For information on the use of and payment to consultants, lecturers, and other professionals on sponsored projects, see the <i>Research and Sponsored Projects Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i><a href="../rsp/rsp503-03.html" target="NEW">RSP 503&#150;03</a>, &#147;Consultants, Lecturers, and Other Professional Services for Sponsored Projects.&#148;<p>For information on defining a process for determining whether an employee-employer relationship exists or whether a consultant/independent contractor relationship exists in order for the university to properly comply with state and federal laws, see the <i>Staff Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i><a href="../spp/spp210.html" target="NEW">SPP 210</a>, &#147;Consultants/Independent Contractors.&#148;<p><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">FIN</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | FIN&#160;manual&#160;<a href="fin001.html">contact</a> | Financial&#160;Services&#160;Web&#160;<a href="comptrollers.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center></body></html>
