      <h2>Revolutionary choreographer Yvonne Rainer joins forces with ASU for
        pioneering project and dance concert </h2>
      <p>The Department of Dance in the Herberger College of Fine
        Arts at Arizona State University pioneers a new digital classroom in
        a remarkable collaboration with modern dance great Yvonne Rainer. The
        result will change how dance can be taught and has the potential to advance
        scholarship across disciplines.</p>
      <p>For this pilot project, Rainer is setting her historic work "Chair/Pillow,"
        which defined new territory in dance when it premiered in 1969, on ASU
        dance students and Valley high school students. However, digital classroom
        technology will extend the reach of the project. Using an interactive
        Web site that progresses traditional Web-based curricula through inclusion
        of telematics, students and teachers anywhere can share experiences with
        the choreographer, notator, re-stager and performers in real time.</p>
      <p>(When data communicates between systems and devices - when telecommunications
        and computing combine - that's telematics.)</p>
      <p>Dance faculty Mila Parrish and Kathy Lindholm Lane head up the ambitious
        project and have produced the Web site. The project began with a grant
        funded by the Herberger College of Fine Arts in July 2002 and is slated
        for completion in June 2003. "Chair/Pillow" will premiere in the Valley
        as part of the dance concert Graduate Showings on April 8 and 10.</p>
      <p>More on the Project </p>
      <p>The Web site is titled Interactive Gateway and this first project with
        Rainer is called "Happenings: Yvonne Rainer and the Postmodern Movement." </p>
      <p>The Web site features social, historical and artistic links as part
        of the online high school curriculum. Edited, digitized movies of artist
        and participant interviews supply the source material and are facilitated
        through telematic communication. The result is a complex, multi-layered
        and dynamic resource for teachers and students everywhere.</p>
      <p>The site can be found at &lt;http://artswork.asu.edu/ig/index.htm&gt; </p>
      <p>Professors of dance Mila Parrish and Kathy Lindholm Lane are uniquely
        qualified to collaborate on a project of this scope. As a curriculum
        designer, Lane is known for uniting diverse populations to forge community
        partnerships in dance and is a leader in arts education advocacy. Parrish
        is internationally recognized for her work in dance documentation and
        interactive CD-ROM development and a pioneer in the fusion of technology
        and movement education.</p>
      <p>Lane says the student dancers have a unique opportunity with this project.
        "They are collaborating to learn about Rainer, the postmodern movement
        in the arts, and the social and historical environment of the sixties
        and improvise together in preparation for learning and performing this
        work," Lane says.</p>
      <p>"They are identifying Rainer's movement style and her importance to
        the field. "Chair/Pillow" will be analyzed, providing the students with
        insight into the intricacies of the artistic, historical and social influences
        involved in its creation."</p>
      <p>Parrish adds that assessment and documentation of the project have been
        occurring throughout the process. It has the capacity to revolutionize
        how not only dance, but also many disciplines, are taught.</p>
      <p>"Journals, participant observation, videotapes of rehearsals and focus
        groups with the teens and university students are included in this evaluation,"
        Parrish says. "The online curriculum and instructional resource material
        and experiences available from this research will be a unique gateway
        for understanding and advancing dialogue in the arts."</p>
      <p>A Herberger College of Fine Arts Research and Creative Activity grant
        made this project possible. The college's Department of Dance, Institute
        for Studies in the Arts, Instructional Technology and Artswork have all
        contributed to its success. </p>
      <p>More on the Concert </p>
      <p>"Chair/Pillow" premiered in 1969 as part of the offerings at New York's
        historic Judson Church Theatre, which Rainer founded. The piece represents
        the aesthetic shift occurring during the 1960s in dance during which,
        to paraphrase critic and dance writer Sally Banes, any body danced anywhere
        doing any movement, using any method.</p>
      <p>After seeing a performance of "Chair/Pillow" in 1969, New York Times
        dance critic Allen Hughes said, "All sorts of zany things happen in their
        efforts to push away the barriers they find impeding the process of dance.
        we are not talking about quality of product. What we are talking about
        is the unleashing of ideas." </p>
      <p>"Chair/Pillow" is part of the modern dance concert Graduate Showings,
        which runs April 8 and 10, 2003, at 7:30 p.m. in Dance Studio Theatre,
        in the Physical Education Building East Room 132. Tickets are $10 for
        general admission and $5 for students. For tickets or more information,
        the public may call 480-965-6447.</p>
      <p>Graduate Showings is a modern dance event comprised of 18 pieces choreographed
        by the department's outstanding graduate students - and Rainer's piece.
        Rainer's "Chair/Pillow" is the only piece that will be performed both
        nights; the remaining 17 pieces are split over two nights.</p>
      <p>Part of our Scholarship Series, all proceeds from these concerts go
        toward funding and awarding scholarship money to undergraduate and graduate
        students.</p>

        diverse environment where students develop as scholars, educators and
        artists through participation in innovative programs, residencies, performances
        and partnerships.</p>
      <p>The department is nationally ranked in the top 10 by Dance Teacher Now
        magazine. Its graduate program is ranked fifth and its undergraduate
        program is ranked ninth. The ARCO Performance Arts College Guide calls
        the department one of the "most highly recommended programs" in the country.</p>
