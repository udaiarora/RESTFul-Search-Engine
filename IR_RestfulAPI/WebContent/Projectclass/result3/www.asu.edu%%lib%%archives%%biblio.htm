<h1 align="center">Navajo Bibliography<br> for Beginners</h1>
<h2 align="center"><a href="labriola.htm">Labriola Center</a></h2>
<br>
<h3 align="center">Rodgerick Begay, 1996</h3>
<div align="center"><img src=birdline.gif></div>
<p>This bibliography is composed of books on the Din&eacute; tribe, and is an attempt

 to extend Dr. Peter Iverson's Navajo Bibliography, which

was published in 1976 by Indiana University Press.  Selections made for

 this bibliography are intended to introduce students to the Din&eacute 

and cover Navajo tribal government, arts and crafts, ceremonies, legends,

 languages, Code Talkers, education, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>

Readers should be aware that there often is a translation problem between

 Navajo and English languages.  Therefore, authors who

attempt to describe any aspects of the Navajo culture, philosophy, 

and way of life, should be looked upon from a critical standpoint.

  For example, there is no Navajo "religion" but there is a practice of

 religious ceremonies.  There are no words in the English language to

describe Navajo "religion" but it is the closest translation equivalent. 

 I want to stress that Navajo creation stories are considered real to

the Navajo people, and students should be aware that there are many

 versions of them.</p>
<br>
<p>

The bibliography was written for an Internship in American Indian 

Justice Studies Certificate Program under the direction of Dr. James

Riding In, Asst. Professor, Justice Studies, and Patricia Etter, Curator

 of the Labriola National American Indian Data Center at Arizona

State University.  I hope that Navajo students and those not familiar

 with the tribe will also benefit from this bibliography.</p>

artists were able to make these available by making subtle changes in design and color without violating religious taboos.  The book
