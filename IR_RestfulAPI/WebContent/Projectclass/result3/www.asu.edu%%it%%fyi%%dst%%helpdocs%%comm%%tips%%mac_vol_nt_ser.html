MAC Volume and NT Problems
</center></h2>
<p>		
I'd like to thank all who offered suggestions to the solution of my
problem with MAC users not being able to see their files on an NT server.
Problem began with NT 3.51;  I loaded the latest patches and went
through the workaround offered with Q147909 - to no avail.
I upgraded the server to NT 4.0 (service patch 3 was supposed to
automatically take care of the problem - it didn't).
BUT, upon going through the workaround mentioned above, the problem was
taken care of after step two.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Stop services for Macintosh.  
<li>From a DOS prompt type Dir &gt; D:"macshare:AFP_IdIndex  (if macshare is 
the directory name). 
<li>Restart services for Macintosh.
</ol>
<p>
Works for me!!
