<br>
<p>The new Labriola web site appears to be of
interest to many.  In addition to hundreds of
visits to the site, we have received a number of
e-mail inquiries for reference assistance.  We
plan very soon to include some photographs
and several more publications but are always
happy  to hear from readers who might have
suggestions about the  site.

<a name=FIRSTYR><h2>First Year Comp - For Native
Americans Only</h2></a>

At the beginning of each semester, G. Lynn
Nelson, Associate Professor of English at
Arizona State University, brings his students to
the Labriola Center for an orientation to the
library and introduction to the variety of
material available to help them with their
assignments.

<p>
This is not a typical English class, however.
Nelson has designed a unique program
exclusively for Native  Americans.  He calls it
the "Rainbow Section."  According to a recent
article in ASU's student newspaper, <i>State
Press</i> (March 24, 1997), Nelson not only
teaches his students how to write, but how to
write from the heart.   Students are
encouraged to "share their feelings, memories
and experiences.  They often conduct a feather 
circle, a tribal tradition in which people sit in a 
circle and pass a feather.  The student who has
the feather reads from a paper he or she has
written during the week."  Nelson added that  
"the only rule is that you must speak from the
heart."

<p>The students have published some of their
work in <i>The Heart's Vision</i> and <i>Words from
the Feather Circle</i>, which are available in the Labriola
Center.<br>

<a name=LANTERN><h2>Labriola Receives Lantern Slide
Collection</h2></a>
Sometime during the 1960s, the University of
California at Berkeley transferred some 15,000
3&frac14; x 3&frac14; glass lantern slides to the
Anthropology Department at ASU (UCB
retained  2 x 2 copies of these slides).  ASUs
Anthropology Department has transferred the
glass slides to the Labriola Center, where they
will be readily available to researchers.

<br><p>Here is a treasure trove of material.  The
subject matter is broad and covers almost
every subject including archaeology, fossil
man, cultural and physical anthropology,
language and writing, technology, and more. 
North and South America are represented as
are Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Europe.

<br><p>These are photographs of plates, illustrations,
and photographs, many of which are contained
in rare books and journals.  For example,

Alfred Kroeber's sketches of Arapaho artifacts
recovered during the 1899 Morris Jessup
Expedition are represented as published in the
1902 <i>Bulletin of the American Museum of
Natural History</i>.  
<br><p>
In addition to the Plains Tribes, there is a wide
variety of material from the various culture
areas in the United States.  The archaeology of
Peru is represented; material from Easter
Island; the tombs of Egypt; paleolithic
material from Europe; and house interiors
from Polynesia to name just a few.
<br><p>
The material is itemized in catalogs and will be
available to researchers during the fall
semester.

<a name=WASSAJA><h2>Wassaja History & Language
Retention Program at ASU</h2></a>
The goal of this two-year program, which is
funded by the Fort McDowell Mohave-Apache,
Community, is to produce a video history of
the tribe.   James RidingIn, Professor of
Justice Studies at ASU, is Project Director,
and graduate student, Lisa Dyea, is Research
Assistant.  Professors  Laura Tohe (English)
and Peter Iverson (History) are serving as
consultants.
<br>
<p>
The Fort McDowell Reservation is in Central
Arizona, about 23 miles north of Phoenix.  It
was created by executive order on September
15, 1903 and named after General Irwin
McDowell.  Residents of Fort McDowell are
descendants of Apache, Mohave, and Yavapai
Indians who were assigned to the Military
Reservation at the end of the Indian wars of
the second half of the 19th century.
<br>
<p>
Renowned Yavapai physician and surgeon,
Carlos Montezuma, was born near the
reservation in 1867.   Wassaja, as he was
known then, was captured by Pima Indians
when he was five years old and  sold to a
traveling photographer, Carlos Gentile.  
<br>
<p>
Gentile encouraged education and   
Montezuma proved to be a bright student
earning a B.S. degree from the University of
Illinois and medical degree from Northwestern
University.
<br>
<p>
Montezuma was a strong proponent for Native 
American independence from reservations and
assimilation into mainstream culture.   He
twice declined offers to become BIA Director,
and instead, argued for its dissolution.  A
leading spokesman for Indian rights, he
founded the journal, <i>Wassaja</i> to address the
issues.  In later years, he became ill and
returned to Fort McDowell Reservation, where
he died on January 31, 1923.
<br>
<p>
A number of students will be researching in
both the Labriola and Arizona collections. 
They will be studying the Carlos Montezuma
Papers, which are at ASU, researching  the
boarding school experience, economic
development, the gaming industry, Indian-white relations, and past and current history of
the tribe.  They will additionally conduct oral
interviews of members of the community.
<br>
<p>
Students participating in the project are: Troy
Lomay; Kris Radke; Michelle Little; Cliff
Canky; Elton Naswood; Annabell Bowen; Ann
Hendricks; and Brian Preston.

<a name=AUTHORS><h2>Native American Authors

The introduction to the website notes that the
bibliography was created for the Internet
Public Library by five graduate students in the
University of Michigan's SI 726 class.  The
students researched close to 400 authors, 700
books, and 200 URls, and contacted some 100
Native American authors and members of the
Native American community for input and
guidance.
<br>
<p>
The information may be accessed by browsing
author name, book title, or tribe.  Author
pages list tribe and works, and many have
links to web pages that focus on the author. 
Each tribe also has a page with links, and each
book has a page with bibliographic data.  The 
site offers an annotated bibliography of print
and web sources that will help anyone
interested in learning more about Native
American Authors.

<a name=GENEAL><h2>Genealogy Resources in the
Labriola Center</h2></a>
Patrons frequently call or come to the Labriola
Center and ask: "How does a Native American
become a member of a Tribe?"
<br>
<p>
We start by telling our patron that the
individual must meet membership
requirements laid down by the tribe or
through adoption by the tribal governing body
according to rules established by the tribe. 
The amount of Indian blood needed varies
with the tribe.  It ranges from a trace to as
much as one-half.
<br>
<p>
The Labriola Center has a number of books to
assist in this endeavor.  In many cases, it can
provide copies of forms required by various
tribes.  It can also supply mailing addresses
and phone numbers.
<br>
<p>
Very often, individuals are simply interested in
researching American Indian ancestry without
regard to tribal enrollment.  As a general rule,
these persons doing a genealogical search will
begin their research the same way others do. 
The National Archives and Records
Administration recommends: 1) Gathering as
much information as possible from relatives; 2)
obtaining birth, marriage, and death
certificates from appropriate state or county
vital records offices; and 3) begin census
research with the 1920 census and work
backwards (Taken from <i>The Record</i>, Vol.3
May 1997).
<br>
<p>
The Labriola Center can supply copies of <i>The
Record</i> article which lists and discusses the
kinds of material that might be found in the
National Archives to assist genealogists.  In
addition, the following books from the
Labriola Center collections will be helpful:

Morningstar (Denver, CO: Arrowstar), 1993

<a name=DAVIS><h2>Davis Produces American Indian
Gaming Bibliography</h2></a>
Nick Davis, Justice Studies student, wrote
<a href=gaming.htm><i>Bibliography of Historical and Contemporary
American Indian Gaming</i></a> to fulfill
requirements for an internship under Dr.
James Riding In, Assistant Professor of
American Indian Justice Studies.  Patricia
Etter directed and supervised the Bibliography
during the spring semester.
<br>
<p>
The bibliography can be accessed on the
Labriola website.  In addition to listing a
number of monographs dealing with the topic,
Davis included a variety of online indexes
to help the researcher locate journals and
periodicals such as <i>Ethnic Newswatch</i> and
<i>Uncover</i>.  He also included a helpful list of
encyclopedias, bibliographies, and directories,
listed some indexes to government
publications, and finally, reported on a number
of internet connections to websites dealing with
gaming.  The bibliography is available in hard
copy from the Center or can be downloaded to
disc.

<a name=LANGUAGE><h2>Native Language Preservation</h2></a>
There has been an increasing interest among
many American Indian Nations in native
language retention.  The Labriola Center has
been making an effort to collect both current
and historic material on all languages and, in
many cases,  the Center may be one of few
libraries holding the material.  Following are
