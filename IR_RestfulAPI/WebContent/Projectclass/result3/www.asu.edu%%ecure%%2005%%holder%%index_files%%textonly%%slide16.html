        <p>Next we began to categorize our questions, and because we were exploring the idea that individuals act as their own records manager or archivist in managing their own digital desktop, we linked our questions to basic archival functions. </p>
        <p>Then we identified primary questions (those we definitely wanted to cover) and secondary questions (which were often answered when primary questions were answered, and if not, were asked if we had time). In the interests of time today, IÂ?fm only going to go over the primary questions in each category, but I may refer to some of the secondary questions at other points in my talk.</p>
