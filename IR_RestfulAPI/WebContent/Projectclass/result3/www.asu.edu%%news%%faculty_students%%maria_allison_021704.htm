      <h2>Graduate Studies evolving with Allison in top position </h2>
      <p>Professor Maria T. Allison has been appointed vice provost and dean of Graduate Studies, effective March 15. </p>
      <p>Allison will become the Graduate College's top administrator, replacing Bianca L. Bernstein. Last spring, Bernstein accepted a director's position with the National Science Foundation. Since then, Allison has served as interim dean. </p>
      <p>Milton Glick, executive vice president and provost, said, "Dr. Allison brings to this position current and previous experience as interim dean of the Graduate College in addition to excellent academic credentials and leadership skills that will continue the mission of the college. </p>
      <p>"I have been impressed with her vision for the Graduate College in its role of facilitating, mentoring and offering quality assurance. This is a view that is also shared by a variety of faculty I have consulted. President Crow and I are confident that this appointment will further ASU's commitment to excellence in graduate education and are delighted Dr. Allison has accepted this appointment," Glick said. </p>
      <p>Allison said she is pleased to accept the appointment, especially during this exciting time at ASU. </p>
      <p>"Under the leadership of President Crow, and with the strong support of Provost Glick and the other academic leaders at the university, I believe support for graduate education can and will become a centerpiece of ASU," she said. </p>
      <p>Allison views the essential roles of the Graduate College as partnering with faculty, students, and university leadership to foster and support high quality graduate programs and shaping competitive financial support packages to recruit and retain a bright and diverse graduate student body. </p>
      <p>Allison already has made significant strides during the last eight months as interim dean. Under her leadership, the Graduate College has reshaped its processes, policies and procedures. The college has streamlined many of its operations and enhanced service capacity, improved admissions processing, reshaped its goals and initiatives related to financial support, worked to incorporate technology at every level to improve processing for students and departments, and significantly revised the approach to academic program reviews. In addition, with the backing of the Graduate Council, the college currently is evaluating many long-standing policies and procedures to ensure their relevance today. </p>
      <p>"We still have much to accomplish, but I believe that with the hard work and support of our incredible staff we have set an important trajectory for the future," Allison said. </p>
      <p>Before Bernstein's departure and stepping into the interim post, Allison was the Graduate College's associate dean for academic programs for two years. </p>
      <p>Allison has been with ASU since 1984, when she joined the faculty in the Department of Recreation Management and Tourism in the College of Public Programs. She earned her Ph.D. at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. </p>
