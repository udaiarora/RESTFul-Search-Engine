SAS Companion for the Microsoft Windows Environment, Version 8
</H1><P>
Take advantage of the powerful combination of SAS software and             Microsoft Windows!  This documentation describes the operating-system
dependent features of the SAS System for the Microsoft Windows NT, Windows 98, and Windows 95 environments.  You will learn how to configure and
customize your SAS session to accommodate the way you like to work, to     manage SAS libraries and output using the enhanced SAS interface, and
to share SAS data with other people on your network using SAS software     with "groupware." A reference section provides complete descriptions of
all features of the SAS System that are specific to the Windows            environment. This documentation is intended for SAS users who have had
some experience with SAS software and the Windows operating                environment.  System managers might also want to read this
documentation to understand how SAS software works under Microsoft         Windows.
