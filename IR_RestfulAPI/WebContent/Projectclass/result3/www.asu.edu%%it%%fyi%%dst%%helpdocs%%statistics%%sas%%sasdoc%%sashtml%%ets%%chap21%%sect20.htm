<H2>Historical Development of X-11  </H2>
<P>This section briefly describes the
historical development of the standard
X-11 seasonal adjustment method and the later
development of the X-11-ARIMA method.
Most of the following discussion is based on a
comprehensive article by Bell and Hillmer (1984),
which describes the history of X-11 and the
justification of using seasonal adjustment
methods, such as X-11, given the current
availability of time series software. For
further discussions on statistical problems
associated with the X-11 method, refer to
Ghysels (1990).
<P>Seasonal adjustment methods began development in
the 1920s and 1930s before there were suitable
analytic models available and before electronic
computing devices were developed.
The lack of any suitable model
led to methods that worked the same for any series,
that is, methods that were not model-based
and that could be applied to any series. Experience
with economic series had shown that a given
mathematical form could adequately represent
a time series only for a fixed length;
as more data was added, the
model became inadequate. This suggested an
approach using moving averages.
<P>The basic method was to break up an economic
time series into long-term trend, long-term
cyclical movements, seasonal movements,
and irregular fluctuations.
<P>Early investigators found that it was
not possible to uniquely decompose the trend and
cycle components. Thus, these two were grouped
together; the resulting component is usually
referred to as the &#34;trend cycle component.&#34;
<P>It was also found that estimating
seasonal components in the presence of trend produced
biased estimates of the seasonal components, but, at
the same time, estimating trend in the presence of
seasonality was difficult. This eventually lead
to the iterative approach used in the X-11 method.
<P>Two other problems were encountered by early
investigators. First, some economic series
appears to have changing or evolving seasonality.
Secondly, moving averages were very sensitive
to extreme values.
The estimation method used in the X-11 method
allows for evolving seasonal components.
For the second problem, the X-11 method uses
repeated adjustment of extreme values.
<P>All of these problems encountered in the early
investigation of seasonal adjustment methods
suggested the use of moving averages in estimating
components. Even with the use of moving averages
instead of a model-based method, massive amounts
of hand calculations were required. Only a small
number of series could be adjusted, and little
experimentation could be done to evaluate
variations on the method.
<P>With the advent of electronic computing in the 1950s,
work on seasonal adjustment methods proceeded rapidly.
These methods still used the framework previously described;
variants of these basic methods could
now be easily tested against a large number of series.
<P>Much of the work was done by Julian Shiskin and others
at the U.S. Bureau of the Census beginning in 1954 and culminated
after a number of variants into the
<I>X-11 Variant of the Census Method II Seasonal
Adjustment Program</I>, which PROC X11 implements.
<P>References for this work during this period include
Shiskin and Eisenpress (1957), Shiskin (1958),
and Marris (1960).
The authoritative documentation for the X-11 Variant
is in U.S. Bureau of the Census (1967).
This document is not equivalent to a program
specification; however the FORTRAN code implementing
the X-11 Variant is in the public domain.
A less detailed description of the X-11 Variant
is given in U.S. Bureau of the Census (1969).
<P><H3><I>Development of the X-11-ARIMA Method</I></H3>
The X-11 method uses symmetric moving
averages in estimating the various components.
At the end of the series, however, these symmetric
weights cannot be applied. Either asymmetric
weights have to be used, or some method of
extending the series must be found.
<P>While various methods of extending a series
have been proposed, the most important method
to date has been the X-11-ARIMA method developed
at Statistics Canada. This method uses
Box-Jenkins ARIMA models to extend the series.
<P>The Time Series Research and Analysis
Division of Statistic Canada investigated
174 Canadian economic series and found
five ARIMA models out of twelve that fit
the majority of series well and reduced
revisions for the most recent months.
References giving details of various
aspects of the X-11-ARIMA methodology
include Dagum (1980, 1982a, 1982b, 1983, 1988),
Laniel (1985), Lothian and Morry (1978a),
and Huot,Chui, Higginson, and Gait (1986).
<P><H3><I>Differences between X11ARIMA/88 and PROC X11</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxx110103">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxx110102">&#13;</A>The original implementation of the X-11-ARIMA method
was by Statistics Canada in 1980 (Dagum, 1980;
X11ARIMA/80), with later changes and enhancements
made in 1988 (Dagum, 1988; X11ARIMA/88).
The calculations performed by PROC X11 differ
from those in X11ARIMA/88, which will result
in differences in the final component estimates
provided by these implementations.
<P>There are three areas where Statistic Canada
made changes to the original X-11 seasonal
adjustment method in developing X11ARIMA/80
(refer to Monsell, 1984). These are (a)
selection of extreme values, (b) replacement
of extreme values, and (c) generation of seasonal
and trend cycle weights.
<P>These changes have not been implemented in
the current version of PROC X11. Thus
the procedure produces identical results
with previous versions of PROC X11 in the absence
of an ARIMA statement.
<P>Additional differences can result from the ARIMA
estimation. X11ARIMA/88 uses Conditional Least
Squares (CLS), while CLS,  Unconditional Least Squares
(ULS) and Maximum Likelihood (ML)
are all available in PROC X11
by using the METHOD= option on the ARIMA statement.
Generally, parameters estimates
will differ for the different methods.
