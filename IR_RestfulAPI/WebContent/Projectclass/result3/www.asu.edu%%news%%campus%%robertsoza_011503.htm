      <h2>Crow announces Alumni Association leadership change </h2>
      <p>Robert Soza, assistant vice president of Student Affairs and Dean of 
        Students, has been appointed Interim Executive Director of the ASU Alumni 
        Association, it was announced January 15, 2003, by ASU President Michael 
        M. Crow and Vice President for Public Affairs Virgil Renzulli.</p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/bobsoza_011503.jpg" alt="Robert Soza" width="180" height="267" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="left">Soza, 
        who received a bachelor and masters degree from the ASU College of Education, 
        will serve as Executive Director while a national search is conducted 
        for a successor to Susan Dolbert, who will be taking on other advancement 
        responsibilities at ASU. Dolbert also will conclude the negotiation of 
        several important business contracts for the Alumni Association. Dolbert 
        has expressed a desire to return to student affairs but is also considering 
        an offer to take a key fund-raising post at ASU. </p>
      <p>"On the foundation that Susan has helped build, ASU will move forward 
        with the intent of building an alumni program that not only ranks at the 
        top of the Pac 10, but that is second to none on a national level," said 
        President Crow. "I thank Susan for her years of outstanding effort on 
        behalf of our alumni and look forward to working with her as she continues 
        to apply her considerable skills and energy to the advancement of ASU." 
      </p>
      <p>Even while the search for a successor begins, the planning process for 
        the future of the Alumni Association is beginning on several levels. Working 
        with the alumni volunteer leadership, Soza will spearhead the development 
        of a strategic plan for enhancing the university's alumni relations office 
        and effort. Goals include:</p>
      <p>. Increasing the number of alumni who are actively involved with the 
        university; </p>
      <p>. Improving the coordination among the Alumni Association, the school 
        alumni offices and the various alumni clubs. </p>
      <p>. Increasing both the total amount of alumni giving to the university 
        and the number of individual alumni contributors. </p>
      <p>. Developing ways of working more closely with Development and Intercollegiate 
        Athletics on activities and other efforts involving alumni.</p>
      <p>. Strengthening existing alumni traditions and developing new ones. </p>
      <p>A search committee is being formed that will include a number of prominent 
        alumni including current Alumni Association Chairman Martin Shultz, Alumni 
        Association Chairman-elect R. J. Machulies; immediate past Chairman Nicolette 
        Lemmon, and Donald Isaacson.</p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/susandolbert_011503.jpg" width="144" height="221" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right">Dolbert 
        earned a bachelor's degree in political science at ASU in 1974, a master's 
        degree in communication in 1980, and a doctorate in public administration 
        in 1994. Prior to becoming executive director of the Alumni Association, 
        she worked in ASU's College of Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences and 
        later served as Director of Undergraduate Admissions.</p>
      <p>"Among their accomplishments," said Vice President Renzulli, "Susan, 
        her staff and our dedicated volunteers have achieved the restoration of 
        Old Main, the expansion of the Student Alumni Association from 30 members 
        to 3,622 this year, and the revitalization of the association's chapters 
        program. I thank Susan for a her hard work and wish her well in her new 
        endeavors."<br>
