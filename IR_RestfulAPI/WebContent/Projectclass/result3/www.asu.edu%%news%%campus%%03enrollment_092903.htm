      <h2>Enrollment booming at ASU campuses</h2>
      <p>        Enrollment continues to climb at ASU, with a record 57,543 students enrolled
          on all three campuses this fall, including the largest class of freshmen
          in history. This represents a 3.7 percent increase over last year's
      55,491.</p>
      <p>All three campuses registered a jump, despite a tuition increase
            that went into effect at Arizona's state universities. Total enrollment
            at
        the Tempe campus is 48,901, up 3.3 percent.</p>
      <p>ASU East boomed almost 14
          percent, to 3,551. The East campus is bursting at the seams and has
        just launched construction of its first new building
        since it opened in 1996, a student union.</p>
      <p>ASU West grew 7 percent, to
          7,105. Formerly an upper-division campus, the West campus began enrolling
          freshmen two years ago and this fall
        welcomed 509 freshmen and 734 sophomores, 30 percent more than last year.</p>
      <p>"An
          ASU education is a terrific value, and students recognize this," says
          Milton Glick, executive vice president and provost. "Even with this
          year's tuition increase, ASU tuition is still among the lowest 10 states
        in the nation.</p>
      <p>"We also have increased the amount of financial aid available,
          to make sure students who need help to attend ASU can get the assistance
          they
          need. We've doubled the number of scholarships for first-generation
        or low-income Arizona students, and increased other types of financial
        aid."</p>
      <p>Main
          campus enrolled 7,126 first-time freshmen, an extraordinary increase
          of nearly 800 over last year and almost twice the number of freshmen
          enrolled 10 years ago. <br>
        In the last 12 years ASU has added stronger freshman support services
          such as the FYE program, added more class sections and residence hall
          spaces, and focused more on recruiting top students right out of high
        school.</p>
      <p>"The growing reputation of ASU helps us tremendously in recruiting
          the best students," says Tim Desch, director of undergraduate admissions.
          "We've also been able to enroll more freshmen because we've built up
          great relationships with Arizona high school counselors over the last
          few years. Students who enroll here as freshmen get a fuller university
        experience."</p>
      <p>Growth at ASU East was led by high-demand programs such as
          business, education and computer technology, and by nationally attractive
          specialty
          programs like professional golf management and aeronautical management
        technology, says David Schwalm, vice provost.</p>
      <p>Elaine Maimon, provost at
          ASU West, says full-time enrollment at West has increased 77 percent
          in the last seven years, and the growth in the
        sophomore class is a particularly good sign.</p>
      <p>"It shows last year's freshmen
          were pleased with their first-year experience at ASU West and have
        returned in record numbers," she says. "Not only
          is ASU West continuing to experience robust enrollment growth, but
        the percentage of students taking a full class load is at its highest
        level
        ever."</p>
      <p>More students are attending school full-time on all three campuses.
          A record 69 percent are enrolled full-time, up from 62.9 percent in
        1996, which should lead to a higher graduation rate. Undergraduates now
        make
          up almost 80 percent of enrollment, compared to less than 75 percent
        seven years ago.</p>
