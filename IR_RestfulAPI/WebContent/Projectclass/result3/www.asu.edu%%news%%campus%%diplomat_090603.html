      <h2> College Gets Resident Diplomat to Guide Students</h2>
      <p> Though students hope that a university education will lead them to interesting 
        and fulfilling jobs, few imagine that it might open the door to something 
        as exotic and exciting as a career in international affairs.<br>
        <br>
        This year, thanks to a program sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, 
        ASU students will have access to Ambassador Sharon P. Wilkinson who will 
        share her experiences as a career diplomat and give guidance to anyone 
        interested in a life in the foreign service.<br>
        <br>
        Ambassador Wilkinson, who was U.S. Ambassador to Burkina Faso and to Mozambique 
        during the Clinton and Bush administrations, will be in official residence 
        at ASU&#146;s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences during the 2003-2004 
        academic year. She will be counseling and recruiting students for a wide 
        variety of career opportunities in the State Department as well as guest 
        lecturing in a variety of departments. She will also be available to speak 
        to interested groups in the community about foreign service life.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;I am delighted to be here as the first Diplomat in Residence at 
        ASU. The Foreign Service is an exciting, challenging, dynamic career option 
        whose members come from all over the United States and from a surprising 
        array of backgrounds, disciplines and special skill areas. ASU promises 
        to be a rich source of candidates and I am very much looking forward to 
        meeting the students and professors who will work with me to make that 
        happen.&#148; <br>
        <br>
        &#147;We had to work really hard to get her assigned here,&#148; said 
        Academic Associate Barbara Colby, who is coordinating the residency. &#147;The 
        Department of State only assigns 16 Diplomats in Residence nationally, 
        and she&#146;s one of the top placements. We got her here because we really 
        think the Department of State has much to offer Liberal Arts and Sciences 
        students and we had quality candidates to offer them.&#148; <br>
        The ambassador was educated at Brown University and the University of 
        Chicago. She speaks Portuguese, Spanish and French.<br>
        <br>
        Ambassador Wilkinson is a Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, 
        Class of Minister Counselor and has held numerous foreign posts. She began 
        her career as Vice Consul in Sao Paulo, Brazil. She was then assigned 
        as Consul in Accra, Ghana. Returning to Washington, she served as program 
        officer for Africa in the Bureau of Cultural Affairs, staff assistant 
        to the Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs, desk officer for 
        Portugal, and management analyst for the Office of Management Operations. 
        She also spent one year as director of the Face-To-Face Program at the 
        Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Next, she was assigned as 
        Deputy Principal Officer in Tijuana, Mexico. She returned to Washington 
        to direct the Office of Diplomatic and Public Liaison in the Bureau of 
        Consular Affairs, followed by an assignment as Consul General in Curacao. 
        She participated as a member of the 35th Senior Seminar Class before departing 
        for Lisbon, where she served as Charge d&#146;Affairs before completing 
        her tour as Deputy Chief of Mission. In 1995, President Clinton nominated 
        her as the U.S. Ambassador to Burkina Faso. In 2000, he nominated her 
        as Ambassador to the Republic of Mozambique. <br>
        <br>
        &#147;We think that this is a real opportunity for our students,&#148; 
        said Dan Bivona, Associate Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. 
        &#147;Ambassador Wilkinson&#146;s extensive experiences in foreign affairs 
        and her history of serving all over the globe will be a major assets for 
        our students to take advantage of. The State Department is looking for 
        bright and talented individuals interested in representing our country 
        abroad and in other kinds of service, and her presence here will open 
        a real door to those careers.&#148;</p>
