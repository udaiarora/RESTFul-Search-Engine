      <h2>Investments help build interdisciplinary research powerhouse</h2>
      <p>        Selected investments in research areas such as urban ecology have helped
          elevate ASU as one of the leading institutions in studying the impact
          of humans on the environment.</p>
      <p>The university, through work primarily in
          the Center for Environmental Studies as well as other small groups
        throughout campus, has long been
          recognized for its leading research in urban environments. But with
        the support of a targeted research investment, the effort was taken to
        a
          global scale this summer with the launch of the Consortium for the
        Study of Rapidly Urbanizing Regions. </p>
      <p>The new entity draws together projects
          such as the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research project,
          ASU's satellite-based remote sensing
          studies of urban environments, extensive outreach programs and initiatives
          to help decision makers understand the long-term implication of urban
          policies. Taken individually, the programs represent university strengths,
          but as a whole provide new ways to look at important urban ecological
          issues on a global scale.</p>
      <p>The effort serves as a powerful example of the
          university's plans to target its research investments to long-range
        visionary interdisciplinary
          initiatives with a lasting impact for society as a whole. The use-inspired
          initiatives are being developed with an eye toward creating a competitive
          niche for the university. </p>
      <p>"Investing our resources wisely is one of the
          most important things we can do as a university," Crow says. "To maximize
          this investment we must
          build endeavors that will impact the world around us and help us generate
          a return on that investment for future endeavors. We are not taking
        a narrow view, but are trying to create solutions across departmental
        and
          disciplinary boundaries."</p>
      <p>Since July 2002 more than $18 million in seed
          funding from several sources - primarily Proposition 301 along with
        a fraction of the indirect costs
          from grants awarded to ASU researchers - have been invested through
        the Office of the Vice President for Research and Economic Affairs. This
          initial portfolio of investments has engaged a broad spectrum of scholars
          in the ASU academy including those in the areas of religion and conflict;
          international digital libraries; health and disability policy; science
          and technology in the law; the human dynamics of homeland security;
        arts
          and engineering; computer and information sciences; and wireless integrated
          nanotechnologies. </p>
      <p>Other university efforts that have been launched using
          a variety of private funding sources and major gifts include ASU's
        Pan American Initiative
          to build international ties, community nursing clinics from the College
          of Nursing, the Virginia G. Piper Center for Creative Writing funded
          by the Virginia G. Piper Charitable Trust and the Stardust Center for
          Affordable Homes and the Family.</p>
      <p>Coupled with initiatives in biosciences
          and life sciences and engineering, all of these efforts are part of
        an overall aggressive plan by the university
          to triple the research capacity of the university over the next five
          years. </p>
      <p>Greg Raupp, ASU associate vice president for research, says the
          widespread effort is based on six key principles. The initiatives must
          be driven
          by a long range, visionary and compelling research agenda; differentiate
          the university from the competition; provide use-inspired solutions
        with a societal benefit; be well conceived with specific timelines and
        milestones;
          be interdisciplinary in nature; and provide a high return on the university's
          investment. </p>
      <p>"Ultimately we want to transcend the disciplines, to create
          a fusion of disciplines," says Raupp. "We want to come up with new
        ways of doing
          things, new ways of research and new solutions to problems that in
        our current way of thinking we cannot even comprehend. We are seeking
        ideas
          that will have a positive impact on our community, on our society and
          our quality of life broadly. That is a driving force behind all that
          we are doing."</p>
