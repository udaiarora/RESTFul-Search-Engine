<p><em>?My Spirit Poem? </em></p>
<p><em>My spirit loves to run,<br>
</em><em>  It loves to prance, it loves to race,<br>
</em><em>and it loves to pull carrots from gardens.<br>
</em><em>It loves its vegetables, carrots, apples and bananas.<br>
</em><em>My spirit doesn't care about the weather.<br>
</em><em>Its dream is to fly up in the clouds like Pegasus.<br>
</em><em>My spirit is a horse. </em></p>
<p>Kiana Leandra Campbell, who wrote ?My Spirit Poem,? is just finishing fifth grade at Mobile Elementary School in Maricopa. </p>
<p>And now she's a published author. </p>
<p>Her work appears in the fifth edition of <em>22 Across, A Review of Young Writers, </em> published annually by ASU's Young Writers Program (YWP), housed in the Office of Youth Preparation. </p>
<p>The review, published as a professionally produced journal, contains editor-selected poetry and prose written by students in fourth through 12th grade who have participated in YWP programs and partner programs. </p>
<p>Each 160-page review contains work by more than 100 young writers, selected from all the work done in the 20 to 30 classrooms participating in the program. </p>
<p>The editors are Chad Unrein, director of the Young Writers Program, and Sean Nevin, the assistant director. </p>
<p>?At the conclusion of each residency, each class compiles a chapbook of their work,? Nevin says. ?YWP teaching artists then submit exemplary student work from those chapbooks to <em>22 Across </em> editors. </p>
<p>?Editors begin reviewing the entire body of work in October, with final selections made in late November. Design and layout is completed by mid-December, and the final proof is sent to print in late December for a press run of 1,500. The finished product is ready for distribution in February.? </p>
<p>Choosing the work is a difficult ? but rewarding ? task for Unrein and Nevin. They want to feature the best work, but the premise of the YWP programs is to celebrate all the students' writing. </p>
<p>?We specifically do not want to get into the business of a seventh-grader worrying about his or her writing being ?accepted' or ?rejected,' so students do not submit their work directly to us,? Nevin says. ?This is, in fact, the opposite of what we do. We are careful not to confuse the value of a student's writing with its inclusion in <em>22 Across: A Review of Young Writers.? </em></p>
<p>This issue of <em>22 Across </em> has three special sections, giving a more worldly flair to the journal. </p>
<p>One special section features poetry by students at the Inter-American Academy in Guyaquil, Ecudador, written when YWP teachers had their first international residency. </p>
<p>Another special section contains poetry by students in New York, written through the Community-World Project, and the third special section is poetry by fourth- and fifth-grade students at Valley View Elementary School in the Roosevelt School District. </p>
<p>The Valley View students came to the Tempe campus for a multidisciplinary workshop and tour of campus. After they visited the ASU Art Museum with YWP instructor Kriste Peoples, who also is a museum docent, they were asked to respond to portraits in the museum's ?Faces? exhibit. </p>
<p>Each year, as the journal is in production, the students wait eagerly for it to appear. </p>
<p>Kiana, who wrote her poem in a summer class taught by Katie Cortese, said she was very excited when her mother, Tiffany, showed her <em>22 Across </em> with her work in it. </p>
<p>?I went and told all my friends,? she says. </p>
<p>And the Campbell family has bought six copies to pass out to family members. </p>
<p><em>?22 Across </em> serves as an affirmation that what students write, think, and create about their own lives is worthwhile; that their perspectives are worthy of literature and of an audience beyond the classroom,? Nevin says. ?When students see their work published in <em>22 Across, </em> it is an empowering moment for them as well as their peers, teachers and families. They realize that, if presented well, their lives are literature ? and they can tell their own stories.? </p>
<p>YWP partners with ASU's Creative Writing Program, with Nevin providing training for MFA students to go into classrooms through his ENG 584 class. </p>
<p>Each new issue of <em>22 Across </em> is featured at national writing and educational conferences and given free of charge to contributors, families, partners, educators and arts administrators throughout the country, Nevin says. </p>
<p>Because it's bound like a journal, <em>22 Across </em> is meant to last. Students can keep their books forever, and teachers can use it in classrooms to illustrate other young writers' work. </p>
<p>And what does <em>22 Across </em> mean? </p>
<p>Unrein and the first two YWP teachers, Tayari Jones and Irena Praitis, came up with the name when they produced the first issue, Nevin says. </p>
<p>Twenty-two was the number of writers in the inaugural edition, and ?across? loosely refers to the journey ?across? life that the young writers were embarked upon. </p>
