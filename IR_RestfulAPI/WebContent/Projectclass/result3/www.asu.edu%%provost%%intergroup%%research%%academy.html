	    <h1>Diversification in the Academy</h1>
		<p>&quot;Diversification in the Academy&quot; is a 3-year study funded by the Ford Foundation that examines institutional interpretations of two recent Supreme Court decisions, Grutter vs. Bollinger, and Gratz vs. Bollinger (2003). The cases focused on the use of race in admissions in higher education. In a double-edged pronouncement, the court both expounded on the merits of a diverse student body, referring to this goal as a &#8216;national compelling interest,&#8217; while simultaneously establishing circumscribed boundaries within which such a goal can be achieved. These decisions are expected to lead to changes in the ways that colleges and universities recruit and retain students.</p>
		<p>However, it is unknown how institutions will navigate the tension that appears to stem from the need to be responsive to legal mandates versus the need to be responsive to demographic changes in the education pipeline. One possibility is that they will avoid the use of race and&#047;or ethnicity as primary factors for consideration in the admissions process. Accordingly, a tempering of efforts aimed at achieving inclusive learning environments would diminish diversification on college campuses. An alternative possibility is that interpretations might redirect attention towards the development of narrowly tailored interventions in the service of pursuing the &#8216;national compelling interest.&#8217; In this case, the needs of the public and the reality of the demographic pipeline could result in greater diversification of the academy. Further, just as in past court decisions, the recent cases might produce changes beyond student admissions patterns and extend to the recruitment and retention of a diverse faculty. The present study focuses on this latter component. What is the status of faculty of color in research-intensive institutions? What are the diversification practices and policies of institutions of higher education? What is the expected impact of the two Supreme Court cases on diversification of faculty?</p>
		<p>Our approach involves collecting survey and interview data from 20 top research-intensive public institutions across the country. We have selected for participation universities that produce the greatest number of Ph.D.'s and that are currently more, rather than less, diverse in their student populations. In order to assess past, current, and anticipated diversification practices and the impact of Gratz &amp; Grutter on these practices, we interview the provost, the general counsel, and the primary affirmative action officer at each school. To address the experience of faculty of color, we are also conducting web surveys from faculty members and conducting focus groups at select institutions from women faculty of colorâ??the least represented ethnic&#047;racial demographic group on campus.</p>
		<p>The goals of the project are to:</p>
		<ol class="outside">
		  <li>identify diversification practices and policies on university campuses</li>
		  <li>assess interpretations of the Supreme Court cases and corresponding reactions</li>
		  <li>identify best practices that promote success in the recruitment and retention of faculty of color</li>
		  <li>disseminate useful handbooks&#047;tools that both fulfill the diversity missions of institutions and uphold the parameters of the legal decisions</li>
		</ol>
