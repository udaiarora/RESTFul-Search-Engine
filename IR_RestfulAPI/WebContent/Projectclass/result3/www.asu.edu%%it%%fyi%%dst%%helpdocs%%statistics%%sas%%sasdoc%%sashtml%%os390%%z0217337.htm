<P><A name="z0551777">&#13;As
you use the SAS System under OS/390, you might encounter many different kinds
of problems. Problems might occur within the context of your SAS program,
or they might be with some component of the operating environment or with
computer resources rather than with the SAS System. For example, problems
might be related to job control language or to a TSO command.</A>

<P><A name="z0551778">&#13;  If a problem is detected by the operating environment, you get
messages from the operating environment in the job log or on the terminal
screen (rather than in the SAS log).  In this case, you might need to consult
an appropriate IBM manual or your on-site systems staff to determine what
the problem is and how to solve it.</A>
<P>Most error messages indicate which part of the operating
environment is detecting the problem.  Here are some of the most common message
groups, along with the operating environment component or utility that issues
them:

<P><A name="z0551795">&#13; Several
resources are available to help you if you determine
that your problem is within the SAS System. These resources are discussed
in the following sections.</A>
<BR><H3>Examining the SAS Log</H3>


<P>The primary source of information for solving problems
that occur within the SAS System is the SAS log.  The log lists the SAS source
statements along with notes about each step, warning messages, and error messages.
Errors are flagged in the code, and a numbered error message is printed in
the log.  It is often easy to find the incorrect step or statement just by
glancing at the SAS log.

<P><A name="z0551805">&#13; 
 Extensive help is available
through the SAS online help facility. To obtain host-specific help, execute
the PMENU command as necessary to display SAS menus, then select</A>

<BR><H3><A name="z0648634">Using User-Defined Help</A></H3>


<P><A name="z1097027">&#13;Your
site may provide user-defined help that provides site-specific information
via the standard SAS help browser. To access user-defined help via the
SAS help browser, you need to allocate a user-defined help library at SAS
invocation.</A>
<P>The user-defined help library contains help information
in the form of one or more <B>itemstores</B>, which utilize a file format
that allows SAS to treat the itemstore as a file system within a file. Each
itemstore can contain directories, subdirectories, and individual help topics.
For information on loading user-defined help into itemstores, refer to <A href="z0529833.htm">ITEMS</A>.
<P>Help for the SAS System is
contained in itemstores.
SAS automatically allocates libraries for SAS System help at SAS invocation.
To invoke SAS so that it recognizes user-defined help, follow these steps:
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>In an autoexec file, allocate the SAS library
that will contain the user-defined itemstore(s) using the LIBNAME statement.
For example, if the libref is to be MYHELP and the itemstore is named APPL.HELP.DATA,
the LIBNAME statement in the SAS invocation would be 



<PRE>libname myhelp 'appl.help.data' disp=shr;</PRE>
<P>See <A href="z-custom.htm#zutoexec">Autoexec Files</A>
and <A href="zlibname.htm">LIBNAME</A>
for details.<P>

<LI>Concatenate your itemstore(s) to the SAS System
help itemstore named by the HELPLOC= system option at SAS invocation. For
example, if the libref for your user-defined help was MYHELP, and if the itemstore
in the libref was named PRGAHELP, then the HELPLOC= specification in the SAS
invocation would be as follows: 



<PRE>helploc='myhelp.prgahelp'</PRE>
<P>See 



<B>SAS Language Reference: Dictionary</B> for details on the HELPLOC= system option.<P>
</OL>

<P>User-defined help cannot be added to the SAS System
help itemstore because the SAS help library is available for read access only
for most users.
<P>After SAS has been invoked so that it can recognize
user-defined help, you can access that help with the standard SAS help browser
by issuing the HELP command and specifying the appropriate universal resource
locator (URL). For example, if the help topic that you wish to display is
named DIRAHLP1.HTM, and if that help topic is contained in an itemstore directory
named PRGADIRA, the HELP command would be as follows:



<PRE>help helploc://prgadira/dirahlp1.htm</PRE>
<P>See the next section for information on developing user-defined
help for the SAS help browser.
<BR><H3>Developing User-Defined Help</H3>


<P><A name="z1097037">&#13;You
can develop help for your site or for your SAS programs that can be displayed
in the standard SAS help browser. To ensure that your the user-defined help
will be displayed as it is written, use only the subset of tags from HTML
that are supported on the SAS help browser. Help information in tags that
are not supported by the SAS help browser may be ignored by the SAS help browser.</A>
<P>The following table describes the HTML tags supported
by the SAS help browser. In short, the TABLE tag is the only frequently used
tag that is not supported at this time. To add tables to your help, use the
PRE tag and format the text manually using blank spaces, vertical bars, dashes,
and underscores as needed.

see any reference for HTML Version 3.2.

<BR><H3>Using the SAS Documentation CD-ROM</H3>


<P><A name="z0551797">&#13;The CD-ROM that is supplied with SAS software contains most of
the documentation for base SAS, including 



<B>SAS Language Reference: Dictionary</B> and other titles. If you
encounter a problem that cannot be solved based on the information provided
in the SAS log or in SAS online help, load the CD-ROM disk into a CD-ROM reader
and browse through the contents of the books contained therein.</A>
<BR><H3>DATA Step Debugger</H3>


<P><A name="z0551806">&#13;
 
The DATA step debugger is an interactive tool that helps you find logic errors,
and sometimes data errors, in SAS DATA steps. By issuing commands, you can
execute DATA step statements one by one or in groups, pausing at any point
to display the resulting variable values in a window. You can also bypass
the execution of one or more statements. For further information on the DATA
step debugger, see the 



<B>SAS Language Reference: Dictionary</B>.</A>
<BR><H3>Using SAS Statements, Procedures, and System Options to Identify Problems</H3>


<P><A name="z0551808">&#13; If you are having a problem with the logic of your program,
there might be no error messages or warning messages to help you. You might
not get the results or output that you expect. Using PUT statements to write
messages to the SAS log or to dump the values of all or some of your variables
might help. Using PUT statements enables you to follow the flow of the problem
and to see what is going on at strategic places in your program.</A>
<P>Some problems may be data related; these can be difficult
to trace. Notes that appear in the SAS log following the step that reads and
manipulates the data might be very helpful. These notes provide information
such as the number of variables and observations that were created. You can
also use the CONTENTS and PRINT procedures to look at the data definitions
as SAS recorded them or to actually look at all or parts of the data in question.
<P>SAS system options can also assist with problem resolution. Refer to
the 



<B>SAS Language Reference: Dictionary</B> for details on the following system options and others that affect
problem resolution:
