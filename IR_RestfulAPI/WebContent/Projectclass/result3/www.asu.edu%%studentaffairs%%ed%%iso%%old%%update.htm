<p><strong>F-1 STUDENTS</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="f1A"></a>A. THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU TRAVEL for F-1 students</strong></p>
<p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp; When traveling within the US , you may be asked by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to show your immigration documents (I-20, passport). Be sure you have your documents with you and keep them in a safe place at all times.</p>
<p>II. If you are traveling outside the US ,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#149; Please check your I-20 for a valid travel signature by a Designated School Official from the International Student Office. &nbsp;S ignatures are valid for 1 year from the date of last signature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the signature will be expired on the date that you return to the US , bring your I-20 to the ISO as soon as possible to obtain a travel signature. Please allow 7 working days for processing.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; DOCUMENTS to carry when you return to the US : Valid F-1 visa, ASU I-20 with valid travel signature, Passport valid 6 months into the future, Enrolment verification and unofficial transcript (request from the REGISTRAR, SSV #144).</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you plan to travel to a country other than your own, you should contact the Consulate of that country to find out if you need a visa. You can access it through the State Government website <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/">http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/ </a> and follow to the list of Foreign Consulates in the U.S.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Automatic visa revalidation: Citizens of some countries who are in the US with expired F-1 visa will be able to return to the US after travel to Mexico, Canada and the neighboring islands/US territories under the following conditions: visit is not more than 30 days and the purpose is pleasure or vacation only, maintained full-time status at all times, has I-20 endorsed for travel within a year.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are planning to renew your expired student visa in your home country you must apply early and expect delays. </p>
<p>DOCUMENTS for visa renewal purposes: ASU I-20 with valid travel signature, Passport, valid 6 months into the future, Financial guarantee (i.e., current semester TA/RA letter, bank statement obtained within the last 6 months), Enrolment verification and unofficial transcript (request from the REGISTRAR, SSV #144). </p>
<p>Consult individual embassy websites for periodic updates on country-specific visa processing. Lists of US Embassies abroad can be accessed through this website <a href="http://usembassy.state.gov/">http://usembassy.state.gov/</a></p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Entry and Exit requirements in the US-Visit Program: US-VISIT is part of a continuum of security measures that begins overseas and continues through a visitor's arrival in and departure from the United States . For more information, visit the US-VISIT Program website <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xtrvlsec/programs/content_multi_image_0006.shtm">http://www.dhs.gov/xtrvlsec/programs/content_multi_image_0006.shtm </a></p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Students subject to SPECIAL REGISTRATION should remember all entry and exit requirements to avoid delays. For additional information or specific questions on special registration, go to the USICE website link <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/specialregistration/index.htm">http://www.ice.gov/pi/specialregistration/index.htm </a> or contact USCIS National Customer Service Center 1-800-375-5283.</p>
<p>For further travel related inquiries, send an email to <a href="mailto:ISOeadvisor@asu.edu">ISOeadvisor@asu.edu</a></p>

<p><strong><a name="f1B"></a>B. SEVIS COMPLIANCE Information for&nbsp;CONTINUING STUDENTS for F-1 students </strong></p>
<p>F-1 students who are getting close to the expiration date listed on their I-20 must file a request for an extension at the ISO/International Student Services or ISS for West Campus Students before your immigration document expires. Failure to do so will cause loss of F-1 status.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; OPT students who did not complete as reported on the completion of coursework form or any other reason must report to the ISO/ISS prior to the completion date for appropriate advisement. Failure to do so will cause loss of F-1 status and consequently, loss of the OPT benefit.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Must maintain full-time status at all times. AUDIT GRADES are not counted and only 3 ONLINE CREDITS can be counted towards full-time enrollment. </p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; January 5, 2007 - final day to request PERMISSION from the ISO/ISS to concurrently enroll at a local community college in the Sp 2007 semester.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; January 19 -&nbsp;final day to submit immigration approved exception to full course of study documents to ISO/ISS (i.e., PROOF of concurrent enrollment, final semester, medical etc.)</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; January 22 -&nbsp;date that SEVIS record will be terminated for students not full time as of January 21 - published late registration &amp; drop/add deadline. No exceptions!</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who have made any change to their academic programs, (i.e. switched degree options, major change) must report to the ISO/ISS for immigration advisement as soon as possible. The impact of the change may cause you to lose your F-1 status.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anytime you move, update address information with ASU Interactive Online Services within 10 days. Use your home in Tempe/Phoenix area as your LOCAL address and your home country residence as PERMANENT address. Do not list PO boxes.&nbsp; Failure to do so will cause loss of student status.</p>
<p>Important Note: The processing time at the ISO/ISS for any document/form signature request is 7-10 full working days. Other requests may take more time so please plan accordingly.</p>
<p>For further information, send an email to <a href="mailto:ISOeadvisor@asu.edu">ISOeadvisor@asu.edu </a></p>

<p><strong><a name="f1C"></a>C. INFORMATION FOR GRADUATING STUDENTS&nbsp;for F-1 students </strong></p>
<p>Students completing their program this Fall 2006 semester who want to apply for the Optional Practical Training (OPT) benefit must apply prior to their completion date to get the full 12 months of OPT. Deadline to submit OPT application to the ISO is 3 weeks prior to completion date. Failure to meet the deadlines will result in, without exception, the loss of your OPT benefit.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Students who do not complete their program as reported on the completion of coursework form or any other reason must report to the ISO prior to the completion date for appropriate advisement. Failure to do so will cause loss of F-1 status and consequently, loss of the OPT benefit. </p>
<p>Upon completion of studies, F-1 students must be in one of the following situations: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Must have already applied for OPT.</li>
  <li> Admitted to a new program at ASU or other institution. If you intend to enter another degree program here at ASU, you must come to the ISO to request an I-20 reflecting the new program. If you transfer to some other institution, you must contact the ISO for SEVIS transfer process information. </li>
  <li>Applied for change to another status. If you have received a Notice of Action from USCIS regarding a change of your immigration status, please contact the ISO immediately to get your record updated in SEVIS. If NOT in any of the above situations, students must depart the USA within 60 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>After completion of studies, you are not allowed to continue to work on campus as a student. Any employment as a student after degree completion is considered unauthorized and will jeopardize your immigration status.</p>
<ul><li>Graduating students are advised to keep their immigration documents indefinitely.

<p>JUMP-START YOUR CAREER PLANNING AND JOB SEARCH! <br>
  <br>
  ISO highly recommends that all international students who are planning to complete an internship or find employment in the United States, meet with Career Services to get assistance and discuss special requirements and aspects of the job search to be aware of. <br>
  <br>
  Like any other aspect of life, planning for a career and searching for a job are influenced by culture. It influences the way we network, write resumes, interview and even how we conduct ourselves around possible employers. You will find that there is a lot of incomplete or conflicting information in books or on websites regarding these topics. <br>
  <br>
  In an effort to provide better service to international students in the areas of career advisement and job search, the International Student Office is partnering with ASU Career Services and will offer Career Advisement with Linda Nassen, Career Services Specialist Senior. Linda will be available for appointments and walk-ins at the ISO. During her sessions you will have the opportunity to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get handouts regarding choosing majors, job search, resume writing and workshops.</li>
  <li>Briefly address non-personal career/job search questions in a non-private environment.</li>
  <li>Recommend additional courses of action and refer you to Career Services personnel for follow-up and discussion of personal career/job search questions. </li>
  <li>Provide information about additional career advisement/ job search workshops and events hosted by Career Services. <br></li></ul>
              <p>Appointments are available on Monday mornings between 10 a.m. and 12 noon. To schedule a time, call the ISO at 480-965-7451. <br>
              <br>
    Don&rsquo;t wait any longer! Start planning today!</p>

  -Periodic reporting to SEVIS occurs for the following events: dropping below full-time without ISO authorization, personal biographical information changes, address information changes, degree level and program changes.</p>
<p>5. An international student visa administration fee of $25 will be billed to the account of F-1 and J-1 students who were admitted from Fall semester 2003 onwards. The fee is applied to student accounts EACH semester around 30-45 days after classes begin to cover administrative costs associated with SEVIS compliance and reporting. You may pay at the Cashier's Office or by using On-line services. <br>
  - Students who will not be billed for the $25 fee<br>
  a. any continuing student admitted prior to Fall semester 2003   UNLESS you are readmitted or changing to a new degree program. <br>
  b. J-1 degree-seeking students sponsored by IIE, LASPAU and USAID.</p>
<p>B. ENROLLMENT ADVISORY</p>
<p>1. Students must be registered full-time at all times. Full-time is 12 credit hrs for undergraduates/ 9 credit hrs, graduates or 6 credit hrs with an assistantship (unless the department or college requires more).</p>
<p>2. No more than 3 credit hrs from any online/distance learning course may be applied towards the full-time requirement each semester.</p>
<p>3. AUDIT grades are not counted towards full-time enrollment.</p>
<p>4. Exception to the full-course of study will be given to students for the following reasons: last semester, dissertation/research or thesis hours, concurrent enrollment at a local community college, USCIS recognized case of academic difficulties, serious medical problems and personal issues that prevent academic success. Doing poorly in a course is not an approved reason to be less than full time. Please take advantage of academic support services such as the Learning Resource Center at: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/vpsa/lrc/" target="_blank">http://www.asu.edu/vpsa/lrc/</a> and the Writing Center at: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/duas/wcenter/" target="_blank">http://www.asu.edu/duas/wcenter/</a> to ensure your success. </p>
<p>5. Students must submit the COMPLETION OF COURSEWORK FORM or other appropriate form to receive ISO approval for exceptions to the full-course-of-study requirement BEFORE the start of each semester and PRIOR to dropping below full-time for any reason. </p>
<p>IMPORTANT! <br>
  Students not enrolled in a full course of study without prior ISO authorization or withdrawing from class/es without contacting the ISO will be placed on administrative hold to prevent future registration at ASU and the SEVIS record will be TERMINATED.</p>
<p>C. OTHER MATTERS/Maintaining Status</p>
<p>1. Check the validity dates of your I-20/DS-2019 and Passports. Apply for an I-20/DS-2019 extension within 60 days before the expiration date. An expired I-20/DS-2019 will result in the loss of your status. Contact the ISO for extension application details. </p>
<p>2. Passports must be valid at least 6 months into the future. Contact your respective country embassy within the US for passport renewal processes.</p>
<p>3. If you have changed majors or degree options within your program i.e. MS to MCS or pursuing another/higher degree this Spring 2006 semester, please send an email to <a href="mailto:isoeadvisor@asu.edu">isoeadvisor@asu.edu</a> so we can verify if the change has affected your status and/or if you need to request for an I-20 update.</p>
<p>4. Students who have pre-approved insurance coverage through their government or official sponsor must request, obtain and submit an insurance waiver to the Tuition Payment office every semester by two weeks after classes start to avoid paying the ASU insurance. </p>
<p>5. Students completing their program this spring semester who want to apply for the Optional Practical Training (OPT) benefit must apply at least 90 days prior to the completion date to get the full 12 months of OPT. Deadline to apply for OPT is 3 weeks prior to completion date to the ISO. The OPT application must be received by the USICS before COMPLETION of degree program. Failure to meet the deadline will result in the loss of your OPT benefit.</p>
<p>6. Students who are currently on OPT must pay attention to the I-20 expiration date. If degree is not completed by the expiration date of the I-20, you must contact ISO for further advisement. Failure to do so will cause termination of your SEVIS record.</p>
<p>7. Anytime you move, update your address information on ASU Interactive Online Services within 10 days at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/sos/" target="_blank">http://www.asu.edu/sos/</a>. Use your home in Tempe/Phoenix area as your LOCAL address and your home country residence as PERMANENT address. Students on OPT must also remember to keep their contact information current. </p>
<p>8. Travel Advisory can be found at this ISO webpage. Check your I-20/DS-2019 for valid travel endorsement before your scheduled trip to avoid delays. <a href="http://www.asu.edu/studentlife/Prog&Services/ISO/reminders.html" target="_blank">http://www.asu.edu/studentlife/Prog&amp;Services/ISO/reminders.html</a></p>
<p>9. Students subject to SPECIAL REGISTRATION should remember all entry and exit requirements to avoid delays. For additional information or specific questions on special registration, go to the USICE website link <a href="http://www.ice.gov/graphics/specialregistration/WalkawayMaterial.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.ice.gov/graphics/specialregistration/WalkawayMaterial.pdf</a> or contact USCIS National Customer Service Center 1-800-375-5283.</p>
<p>D. ISO MATTERS<br>
  1. If you need any immigration related information or advisement it is highly recommended that you email <a href="mailto:isoeadvisor@asu.edu">isoeadvisor@asu.edu</a> first before making an appointment. Some matters may be resolved via email. You will be directed to meet an advisor if necessary.</p>
<p>2. There is no need to make an appointment to see an ISO advisor if you are applying for an I-20 extension, application for a new I-20 when pursuing another/higher degree, dependent I-20/DS-2019, OPT, CPT and Academic Training. You may either pick-up a hand-out/instructions at the ISO or email <a href="mailto:isoeadvisor@asu.edu">isoeadvisor@asu.edu</a> to request hand-out/instructions through email.</p>
<p>3. The processing time at the ISO for an I-20 signature, letter of certification or other routine document is 5-7 full working days. Other document requests and transactions may require more time. Please plan accordingly.</p>
<p>4. Please remember to always check your ASU email account to watch for future immigration updates and programming announcements from the ISO. </p>
<p>We look forward to a successful semester and wish you all a happy Spring semester!</p>
