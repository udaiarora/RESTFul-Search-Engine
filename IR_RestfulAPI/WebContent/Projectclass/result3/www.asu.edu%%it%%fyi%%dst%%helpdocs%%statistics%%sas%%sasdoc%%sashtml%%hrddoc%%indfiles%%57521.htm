Discrete or count data arise in experiments where the outcomes are         countable and classified into unique, non-overlapping categories. This
book describes the statistical models for evaluating such data. It         provides an introduction for graduate students and a concise review for
practitioners. The book provides the first in-depth coverage of a number   of topics, including the negative multinormal distribution, the many
forms of hypergeometric distribution, and coordinate-free models. A        detailed treatment of the issues of sample size and power are given in
terms of exact inference and asymptotic, non-central chi-squared           approximations. Throughout the text, the author interweaves standard
statistical software, particularly SAS, with practical examples and        current theory.
