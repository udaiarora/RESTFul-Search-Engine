<BR><H3>Windows NT Security Considerations</H3>


<P>Windows NT is a secure operating
system, requiring that you supply a valid user name and password in order
to log on. When you connect with the DECnet access method, you supply this
information by including Access Control Information (ACI).
<P>When connecting to a remote system, you can supply ACI information explicitly
with the REMOTE= option. However, doing so requires that you either type your
user name and password each time you connect or that you enter permanently
your user name and password into the SAS program.
<P>If proxy access is enabled on both the local and the remote nodes, and
the user name is valid on both systems, DECnet uses your user name for the
default ACI. Any connection you make logs you onto the remote system with
the same user name that you used to log on to the local system.
<P>If proxy access is not enabled, or you want to connect to the remote
system as a different user, you must supply ACI with the value of the REMOTE=
option.
<P>You also can configure a remote Windows NT system to supply a user name
for connection requests that do not contain ACI. It is possible to force a
system to not send ACI. However, it is more likely that you will receive a
connection request without ACI from a Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows 32s
system.
<P>See <A href="#z1mote">Specifying the Remote Host Name</A>
for instructions about defining a default user name on Windows NT. The user
name must be valid on the Windows NT system on which it is defined. 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining a default user name for incoming requests can compromise security.
Because anyone can connect using the default id, it should not be a privileged
user name, and it should be allowed to have access to sensitive data.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<BR><H3>Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 32s Security Considerations</H3>


<P>Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows
32s are not secure operating systems. Because it has no concept of user name,
DECnet cannot use a user name as the default ACI. You can supply ACI in the
REMOTE= option just as you can with Windows NT.
<P>However, the Pathworks software for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows
32s allows you to enter a default user name and password for each remote node
that you want to connect to. The Network Control Program (NCP) node database
contains the node definitions for remote nodes. The NCP DEFINE NODE command
lets you associate a user name and a password for each node. This user name
and password must be valid on the node for which it is defined.
<P>If you do not supply ACI when you connect to a remote system, the DECnet
access method uses the default ACI that is stored in the NCP node database.
If no default ACI is defined for the node, then no ACI is sent. The remote
system must then be configured to supply a default incoming user name; otherwise,
the connection will fail.
<P>You declare the host name, user name, and password of the remote host
at the local host by using the following syntax:  



<PRE>DEFINE NODE <I>node-address</I> NAME <I>node-name</I> 
       USER <I>access-information</I>
       PASSWORD <I>access-information</I></PRE>
<P>Example:  



<PRE>DEFINE NODE 1.300 NAME RMTHOST USER bass 
       PASSWORD time2go</PRE>
<P>See your Pathworks documentation for more information about defining
a Windows 95, a Windows 98, or a Windows 32s default user name.
<P>To connect to a Windows 95, a Windows 98, or a Windows 32s remote host,
supply the host name as the value for the REMOTE= option. 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining
a default ACI for a remote node can compromise security. Because anyone using
the Windows 95, the Windows 98, or the Windows 32s system can get access to
that user name on the remote node, the default user name should not be a privileged
id, and it should not be allowed to have access to sensitive data. To permit
access to such data, SAS should prompt the user for a user name and a password
each time the user tries to connect to the remote node.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">Specifying the DECnet Communications Access Method</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>You must specify the DECnet communications access
method to make a remote host connection. Use the following syntax:  



<PRE>OPTIONS COMAMID=<I>access-method-id</I>;</PRE>
<P>where COMAMID is an acronym for Communications Access Method Identification. <B>access-method-id</B> identifies the method used by the local host to communicate
with the remote host. DECnet (an acronym for the Digital Equipment Corporation
Networking architecture) is an example of <B>access-method-id</B>.
<P>Example:  



<PRE>options comamid=decnet;</PRE>
<P>Alternatively, you may specify this option at a SAS invocation or in
a SAS configuration file.
<P><TABLE width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<TR valign="bottom"><TD><HR></TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5"><A name="z1mote">Specifying the Remote Host Name</A></FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>To
make a connection from
a Windows local host to a remote host, use the following syntax:



<PRE>OPTIONS REMOTE=<I>ACI-information</I>;</PRE>
<P>where <B>ACI-information</B> is represented as: 



<PRE><I>nodename</I>"<I>username password</I>"::
        |"? ?"::
        |"<I>username</I> ?"::
        |"? <I>password</I>"::</PRE>
<P>If proxy access is enabled on the DECnet network, specify only the remote
node name. Ask your network administrator if proxy access is enabled on the
DECnet network.  Proxy access precludes a need for you to assign your user
name and password to the ACI. Otherwise, include the user name and password
information in the ACI. Use one or two question marks, (?) or (??), to request
that the local host be prompted for either user name or password or both. 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a password is not required for an account, you may omit the password
from the ACI.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<P>The remote host name and the two question marks signify a request for
the local host to prompt for user name and password. Because the specification
of ACI (host name, user name, and password) is not a valid SAS name, you must
assign the ACI to a macro variable.
<P>Instead of hard-coding user name and password values, you may use prompting
as a security aid.
<P>Here are some examples of specifying ACI and using secure user names
and passwords.
<P>Example 1:  



<PRE>%let rmthost=monarch"? ?";
options remote=rmthost;</PRE>
<P>The remote host name is MONARCH, and the two question marks signify
a request for the local host be to prompted for both a user name and a password.
Because the specification of ACI (host name, user name, and password) is not
a valid SAS name, you must assign the ACI to a macro variable, such as RMTHOST,
as shown in the first line. Then, use the SAS macro variable to define the
remote host, as shown in the second line.
<P>Example 2:  



<PRE>%let rmthost=monarch"bass time2go"::;
options remote=rmthost;</PRE>
<P>This example is similar to the preceding example, except that the ACI
contains a literal user name and password instead of two question marks (??),
which specify a prompt for a user name and a password.
<P>Example 3:  



<PRE>c:> set rmthost=monarch"bass time2go"</PRE>
<P>This example is entered in a DOS window. The first line shows how to
assign the remote host MONARCH the user name BASS, and the password TIME2GO
to the variable RMTHOST.
<P>Example 4:  



<PRE>options remote=monarch::;</PRE>
<P>Because proxy access is assumed, only the host name MONARCH is needed.
<P>Alternatively, you may specify this option at a SAS invocation or in
a SAS configuration file.

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">Signing On to the Remote Host</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>To
complete your sign on to
the remote host, enter the SIGNON statement, as follows:  



<PRE>signon;</PRE>
<P>
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign-on script files are not needed on a Windows local host
with the DECnet access method because DECnet connects to a spawner that runs
on the remote host.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<P>Although no errors are produced if you specify a script file, you do
waste processing time. If you defined the RLINK fileref before establishing
a connection, when you sign on, SAS/CONNECT processes
and loads the script file that is identified by the fileref, but the DECnet
access method will ignore the script.
<P>If you do not want to omit the RLINK fileref but you want to avoid wasting
processing time, use the  NOSCRIPT  option in the SIGNON and SIGNOFF statements,
shown as follows:  



<PRE>signon noscript;
.
.
.
signoff noscript;</PRE>

<P>The following example
illustrates the
statements that you specify in a Windows local host SAS session to connect
to a remote host by using the DECnet access method.  



<PRE>%let rmthost=rhost"bass time2go"::;
options comamid=decnet remote=rmthost;
signon;</PRE>
<P>A macro variable is used to assign the remote host name RHOST, the user
name BASS, and the password TIME2GO to the alias RMTHOST. The OPTIONS statement
specifies the DECnet access method and the macro variable RMTHOST as the remote
host. The SIGNON statement performs the sign-on process.

<P>As a Windows
NT security feature, DECnet prohibits users from accessing remote network
drives from a remote session on a Windows NT remote host. This feature was
inherited by SAS/CONNECT when it uses
the DECNET access method on the Windows NT platform. This restriction may
be addressed in a future release of Windows NT or Pathworks. If you need to
access a network file, then copy the file to a local drive and access it there.
For more information, see the Microsoft Development Library and the Windows
NT Knowledge Base articles # Q124184, Q132679, and Q122702.

<P>You must invoke the PC spawner program on the Windows NT, the Windows
95, and Windows 98 remote host to enable local hosts to connect to it. The
spawner program resides on a remote host and listens for SAS/CONNECT client
requests for connection to the remote host. After the spawner program receives
a request, it invokes the remote SAS session.
<P>For Windows NT only, setting the -SECURITY option in the PC spawner
invocation command secures the spawner.
<P>The spawner then verifies the user name and the password that are assigned
to the ACI.
<P>See <A href="z0117582.htm">PC Spawner Program</A>
for information about starting the spawner on the remote host.

<P>Although sign-on script

at the remote host.
<P>It is recommended that you set these options: 
<DL>
<DT>NO$SYNTAXCHECK</DT>
<DD>allows the continuation of statement processing at the remote
host regardless of syntax error conditions.
<P>This option is valid as part of a configuration file, at a SAS invocation,
or in an OPTIONS statement.<P></DD>

<DT>NOTERMINAL</DT>
<DD>specifies whether a terminal is attached at SAS invocation.
If NOTERMINAL is specified, requestor windows are not displayed.
<P>Set NOTERMINAL at the remote host so that no terminal is associated
with the remote session.  NOTERMINAL   prevents SAS from displaying error
messages and dialog boxes on the remote host, which requires user intervention.
<P>This option is valid as part of a configuration file or at a SAS invocation.
<P>See <B>SAS
Language Reference: Dictionary</B> for details about this option.<P></DD>

<DT>NOXWAIT</DT>
<DD>
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applies to a Windows remote host only.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<P>specifies whether you have to type EXIT at the DOS prompt before the
DOS shell closes. Set NOXWAIT at the remote host to prevent SAS from displaying
a dialog box on the remote host. Such a display requires that you explicitly
type EXIT at the remote host and gives the appearance that the REMOTE SUBMIT
command is hung.
<P>This option is valid as part of a configuration file, at a SAS invocation,
or in an OPTIONS statement.
<P>See <B>SAS Language Reference: Dictionary</B> for details about this option.<P></DD>

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">Remote Host Example</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>In order to allow a
local host to connect
to a Windows remote host, a PC spawner program must be invoked from the remote
host. The spawner program is invoked with the DECnet access method by using



<PRE>\sas\connect\sasexe\spawner  -comamid decnet -file spawnsas.bat;</PRE>
<P>The SPAWNSAS.BAT file is used to set the configuration on the PC. The
SPAWNSAS.BAT file content is



<PRE>@echo off
sas -config config.sas %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8</PRE>
<P>The following example illustrates the configuration file entries for
a Windows remote host:
