      <h2>Psychology professor makes learning fun, both in, outside class</h2>
      <p>There's magic going on in the weekly lab meetings of
          ASU Psychology Professor Steven Neuberg and his student research assistants.
          What else would
            explain two dozen students giving up their Friday afternoons to hang
      with their professor and talk about research? </p>
      <p>Some students show up
            week after week, even after they're no longer enrolled in his lab
        for research credit, just to hear what he has to say.</p>
      <p>For this
          magic trick - and for cultivating his students' development both in
        and outside the classroom - Neuberg has been chosen an ASU Featured
          Faculty. The award program was begun this fall by Co-Curricular Programs
          to recognize and celebrate the contributions of faculty in enhancing
          student learning outside of class.<br>
        The office received more than 40 nominations from students for the
          award, and Neuberg was selected the first honoree by a panel of students.
          Three
          faculty members will be chosen each semester, and will receive an honorarium
          and be highlighted in programs throughout the year.</p>
      <p>"Dr. Neuberg provides
          all of his students with the personal level of education and attention
          that one would find at a college 50 times smaller
          than ASU," says Jenessa Shapiro, psychology graduate teaching assistant
          who nominated him. "As a student, it is clear that you matter to him.
          He encourages all students to meet and interact with him. He is a fantastic
          teacher, adviser and mentor."</p>
      <p>Neuberg, who joined the ASU faculty in 1988,
          teaches courses in undergraduate social psychology and honors social
          psychology, and graduate seminars
          in social psychology, prejudice and relationships. This semester he
        also is an Interdisciplinary Faculty Fellow in anthropology.</p>
      <p>His two-hour Friday
          afternoon lab meetings are legendary for being interesting, interactive
          and regular-as-clockwork, even when he's on sabbatical. The
          chairs are filled with about 20 undergraduates and a handful of graduate
          students.</p>
      <p>"Dr. Neuberg uses the meetings to develop new theories, talk
          about issues relevant to social psychology and the lab's perspective,
          present data,
          and discuss results, all of which expose the undergraduates to true
        science, not just data entry," says Shapiro. "He is extremely dedicated
        to incorporating
          learning wherever possible."</p>
      <p>Neuberg says he finds teaching social psychology "great fun," especially
        since students get to ask questions that are of great interest to them
        and learn to answer them using the tools of science.</p>
      <p>"The best parts of
          teaching often occur within the context of doing research, frequently
          in one-on-one mentoring relationships, where one can see with
          each meeting a student's intellectual growth," he says.</p>
      <p>According to Linda
          Sullivan, executive coordinator of Co-Curricular Programs, they instituted
          the Featured Faculty awards this year because of the
          overwhelming student response to the spring Last Lecture Series, in
        which students nominate their favorite lecturers.</p>
      <p>"Faculty have a lasting impact
          on students, and this is a chance for students to reflect on that,"
        says Sullivan. "So many students are eager
          to nominate their professors, we decided it would be good to honor
        faculty all year long, and for other ways they excel other than lectures."</p>
