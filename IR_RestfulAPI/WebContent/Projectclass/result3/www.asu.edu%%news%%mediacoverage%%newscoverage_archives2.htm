            <p><span style="">An idea was born before the ASU-LSU football game to create a fund to help college students displaced by Hurricane Katrina continue their educations. Sen John McCain and the presidents of the two universities announced the student relief fund, which was the brainchild of <b>President Michael Crow</b>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to raise a lot of money; we&rsquo;re going to make things happen,&rdquo; Crow says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to make as significant a contribution as we can.&rdquo; <i>Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, Houston Chronicle, Newsday</i>, <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Kansas City Star</i>, Sept. 10.<br>

            <p> The stigma of divorce is waning, as not only celebrities change partners but half of all those who marry. &ldquo;Many people in their 20s have what we now call starter marriages, find they aren&rsquo;t compatible, then marry someone else,&rdquo; says gerontologist <strong>Kathleen Waldron</strong>. &ldquo;Many times they bring the same mistakes and issues into another marriage.&rdquo; <em>Delaware</em><em> News Journal</em>, Aug. 22.</p>

            <p> The jury selection process still includes peremptory challenges, a controversial practice in which lawyers can reject a jury candidate without giving a reason. Lawyers think it allows them to eliminate biased jurors. &ldquo;Lawyers are afraid to give up a tool that makes them feel better,&rdquo; says law professor <strong>Michael Saks</strong>. &ldquo;And they have enough influence over the rules that they are going to keep things the way they are.&rdquo; <em>Dallas</em><em> Morning News.</em> Aug. 22.</p>

            <p> Ten years ago biologists transplanted eight female panthers from Texas to south Florida , in an attempt to reverse the effects of inbreeding in Florida panthers. An analysis concludes the risky experiment paid off and that hybrid cats are surviving better, but the methodology of the analysis is controversial. &ldquo;I would have much more confidence if the people who had collected the data had made the conclusion,&rdquo; says population geneticist <strong>Phil Hedrick</strong>. <em>Science</em>, Aug. 19.</p>

            <p> Illegal coral mining may have intensified the destruction caused by the December tsunami in Sri Lanka , an ASU engineering professor found. Intact coral reefs in other areas blocked the wall of water and deflected it to man-made holes in the reefs, where it reached greater heights and force. &ldquo;Mining for coral is a cottage industry,&rdquo; says <strong>Harinda Joseph Fernando</strong>. &ldquo;They put dynamite and blow them up to get coral and fish.&rdquo; <em>The Guardian (</em><em>UK</em><em>), </em><em>Honolulu</em><em> Star Bulletin</em> and <em>Taipei</em><em> Times</em>, Aug. 17.</p>

            <p> Parents who skip meals and spend too much time in front of the TV may be increasing the risk that their children will become obese later in life, an ASU study shows. Children who grow up in families with bad eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are 33 percent more likely to become obese. &ldquo;Our research suggests prevention must begin at home,&rdquo; says <strong>Ashley Fenzl Crossman</strong>, graduate teaching assistant in sociology. <em>Toronto</em><em> Globe and Mail</em>, Aug. 15 and <em>Atlanta</em><em> Journal Constitution </em>and <em>Forbes</em>, Aug. 17.</p>

            <p> Japan &rsquo;s invasion of China 60 years ago has left an ongoing tension between the countries. China &rsquo;s enduring sense of grievance, inflamed by rising nationalism in Japan , remains the biggest obstacle to a stable, long-term relationship between the two countries. &ldquo;If you had asked me 15 years ago, I would have said they were working through this,&rdquo; says historian <strong>Stephen MacKinnon</strong>. &ldquo;Part of the problem is this muscular nationalism, particularly among the young.&rdquo; <em>International Herald Tribune</em>, Aug. 15.</p>

            <p> The personal savings rate for Americans dropped to zero percent in June, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean they aren&rsquo;t increasing net worth. Economists say America remains one of the best places to create wealth. &ldquo;The savings rate falling to zero isn&rsquo;t of great concern,&rdquo; says economist <strong>Stephen Happel</strong>. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t reflect increases in the value of homes or the appreciation of stocks.&rdquo; <em>Chicago</em><em> Sun-Times</em>, Aug. 14.</p>

            <p><strong>Future Mars mission may bring home more than rocks</strong></p>
            <p> In the next Mars exploration, most scientists consider bringing Mars samples back to Earth a priority, since the rocks will help sort out the planet&rsquo;s complicated geological history. Bringing samples home will be difficult and expensive, but NASA&rsquo;s long-term plan to send astronauts to Mars dictates the need for more knowledge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be surprised if we didn&rsquo;t have sample return as a precursor to humans for safety reasons,&rdquo; says planetary scientist <strong>Ron Greeley. </strong><em>Nature</em>, Aug. 3. </p>
