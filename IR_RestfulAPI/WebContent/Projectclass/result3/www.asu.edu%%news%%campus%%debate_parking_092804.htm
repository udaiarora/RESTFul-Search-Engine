      <h2><B>Presidential debate update: Temporary parking plan in place</B> </h2>
      <P>With debate day less than three weeks away, ASU plans to shift some employees and students who park in lots affected by the event at Gammage Auditorium to other parking facilities on campus. </P>
      <P>About 2,500 of the more than 17,000 employee, visitor and non-resident student parking spaces on the Tempe campus will be affected. With a goal of minimum disruption to classes and traffic, ASU DPS and Parking &amp; Transit Services encourage students, staff, residents and local businesses to be patient and flexible during debate week as some plans may change and some temporary road closures to accommodate motorcades are expected. </P>
      <P>According to City of Tempe transit authorities, Apache Blvd. will be closed from College Avenue to 10<SUP>th</SUP> Street Tuesday, October 12 until Thursday, October 14. Gammage Parkway and Forest Avenue will also be closed Tuesday, October 12 until Thursday, October 14.</P>
      <P>Carpooling and ride sharing are two ways to get to work and school to lessen traffic congestion and demands on parking facilities around campus. For more information on carpools, contact ASU Parking &amp; Transit&rsquo;s Travel Reduction at 480 965-1072. Contact Valley Metro for information about ride sharing and other options at: <A

target=_BLANK>http://www.valleymetro.org/Rideshare3/index.html</A></FONT></U>.</P>
      <P>Thousands of media will converge on ASU to cover the debate but journalists will not be parking on campus. Instead, a continuous loop of shuttles will move them to and from the Media Filing Center outside Gammage Auditorium. </P>
      <P>Students, employees and visitors should continue to watch for traffic and parking updates via the ASU website and the local media, as plans are subject to change.</P>
