End of agenda.</p>

<h3><a name="overview"></a>OVERVIEW</h3>

<ol>
 <li>August: School Drive: We collected over 250 items, filling 8-10 bags.  Daphne Gill-Barber and Bob Taskey (CSTF) chaired.</li>
 <li>September: Membership Barbeque: 81 people came to the barbeque and became LSA members.</li>
 <li>October: International Pot Luck: this was the first time we had this event. It was well attended and had many positive comments.</li>
 <li>November: Thanksgiving Food Drive: Bob Taskey chaired this event. All libraries participated, including Law, Architecture, and Music. We collected 2 heaping shopping carts full of food for local Food Banks.</li>
 <li>December: White Elephant/Bake Sale: an LSA fundraiser enjoyed by all. Only one person brought baked goods (Sheila) so perhaps next year that portion of the event could be eliminated.</li>
 <li>January: Holiday Pizza Party: Many came to have the excellent Lorenzo's (formerly Mama's) Pizza and salad.</li>
 <li>February: 2nd Annual Chili Cookoff: We had 6 entries, 2 more than last year. Linnea Caldeen, Milly Kowalski, Debbie Faulkner, Anali Perry, Henry Stevens, Sheila Brushes competed. Milly Kowalski was the winner by popular vote. The event was well-attended.</li>
 <li>March: Just Desserts: Dessert potluck. This was the first time we had this event. 25 people attended. Turnout was somewhat low due to a library scheduling conflict that could not be avoided. Also, some people stayed away due to Lent. The attending guests seemed to really enjoy it, though.</li>
 <li>April: Here Comes the Sun Salad Potluck: this is always a popular event. 45 people attended.</li>
 <li>May: Spring Social: this year we had a Mexican Fiesta. We had 10 retirees attend, and many staff. Comments on the decorations and great food!</li>
 <li>Special events: 
  <ol>
	<li>Logo Contest: chaired by Bob Taskey. The winner of the contest by popular vote was Jaime Jones. Other designers who entered the contest were Linnea Caldeen, Debbie Flitner, and Patrick Patterson.</li>
  <li>Shirt sales: shirts sold with new LSA logo. Jodie Milam and Lee Marie Oliver chaired this committee.</li>
  <li>Brown Bag Travelogue Series: Program Committee chair: Marilyn Wurzberger. Speakers were Beverly Schlee, Christopher Miller, and Linda Cravens.</li>

<p>Tom said the Spring Social is always the most expensive event spending $675.00 this year. Also LSA had to replace stolen items from the closet which became expensive. </p>

<h3><a name="suggestions"></a>SUGGESTIONS FOR NEXT YEAR</h3>

<p>Sheila then opened up the floor for questions, comments, complaints etc: </p>
<ul>
<li>Some comments were about changing the white elephant sale from December to Spring Break.</li>
<li>The brown bag travelogues are very enjoyable and popular.  </li>
<li>Some members had problems with the logo contest voting and on line shirt ordering, some had suggestions to help in the future. </li>
<li><a name="blog"></a>A lengthy discussion followed on the LSA blog and its purpose. Does the membership want a blog? Is or can it be useful? Some didn't know we had a blog. Most people agreed it was not well publicized and it should be moved to the LSA web page. Jonathan Moore offered to take over the updating and possible expanding of the blog and getting it moved.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sheila announced that Rayleen Myers has resigned from the board and that we have a completely new board to take the reins.</p>

<p>Since the slate of board members for the new year are unopposed Carl Cross a member brought a motion from the floor which he read and the membership voted to pass it unanimously:</p>
        <blockquote><p>I move that the slate of unopposed officers of the LSA as presented by the outgoing Board be approved by acclamation, being there are no further nominations.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a name="intro"></a>INTRODUCE THE NEW PRESIDENT!</h3>
