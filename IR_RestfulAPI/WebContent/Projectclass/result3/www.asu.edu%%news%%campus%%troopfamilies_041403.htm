      <h2>Call of duty - ASU families appreciate support for their troops</h2>
      <p>        Mary Sikora, office specialist with Parking &amp; Transit Services, is
        not happy her son, Robert McLaughlin will be spending his 24th birthday
        in Iraq, so far away from his family. But, even in the midst of her frustration,
        she is happy to fly an American flag outside her home.</p>
      <p>Like many other
          ASU employees with loved ones serving in Iraq, Sikora says she feels
          it is very important to support our troops.</p>
      <p>"I don't agree
          with President Bush sending in the troops without more United Nations
          countries' approvals and/or more positive results from
          the inspections," she says. "But, I have displayed a huge American
        flag at my apartment in support of my country."</p>
      <p>McLaughlin, a senior airman
          in the Air Force, recently e-mailed his mother. The birthday presents
          he requested were a few Arizona T-shirts and a
          new toiletry bag.</p>
      <p>"I'm having fun sending several packages to him for
          his birthday," Sikora says. "The more mail, the merrier for him. I'm
          sure he'll have
            a great
            birthday with his unit - they're very close."</p>
      <p>Jane Laux, a program coordinator,
          senior with the College of Engineering, is very proud of her son and
          is determined to stay optimistic.</p>
      <p>Richard
          Laux, 21, is a lance corporal in the Marines, currently working as
        a communications specialist with the 2nd Battalion involved in fighting
          in and around Nasiriyah, Iraq. </p>
      <p>"Words cannot begin to express the pride
          that we all feel being his family," Laux says. "We now are looking
        forward to the day when their job is complete
          in Iraq and they are all safely returned to us."</p>
      <p>Laux says she has enjoyed
          seeing American flags and the return of yellow ribbons.<br>
        "Hanging yellow ribbons is a sign of support for our troops," Laux
          says. "Believe me, the families appreciate the support. As the days
          go on,
          this is getting much harder for us."</p>
      <p>Cecilia Contreras, an administrative
          associate for ASU's College of Public Programs, says she remembers
        how her nephew, Jason Carranza, used to
          love playing with airplanes as a child.</p>
      <p>"He always knew what he wanted,"
          Contreras says. "He wanted to go into the Navy and learn to fly a plane."</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Carranza, now 27, achieved
          his lifelong goal and is currently a Navy pilot stationed aboard the
          U.S.S. Bunker Hill.</p>
      <p>Contreras describes
          her nephew as "a great kid, very loving and close with his family"
        and says it has been difficult not to worry about him
          during this trying time.<br>
        "We have been keeping up with the news," she says. "It is very stressful,
          but I find myself especially listening and watching when they mention
          a helicopter or plane down." </p>
      <p>Demetria Elms, library assistant senior,
          has been sending positive thoughts to her 20-year-old brother Daniel
          Bratton, who is a corporal in the 1st
          Marine Expeditionary Force, 7th Regiment.</p>
      <p>"I have great confidence in
          my brother's abilities and know that he will do his best," she says.
          "I know that he is highly trained and will do
          his job well." </p>
      <p>Elms hopes everyone will support the troops, even if they
          disapprove of the war itself.</p>
      <p>"My husband and I are constantly praying not only for
          him, but for other friends that we have over there."</p>
      <p>ASU employees who have a loved one serving
          in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and wish to share their story, can e-mail
          Ina Zajac at (izajac@asu.edu).</p>
      <p>Zajac,
        with Media Relations &amp; Public Information, can be reached
        at (480) 965-8145 or (izajac@asu.edu).<br>
