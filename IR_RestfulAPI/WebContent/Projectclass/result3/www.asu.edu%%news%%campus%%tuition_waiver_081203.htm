      <h2>Enhanced tuition waiver benefit increases semester credit hours</h2>
      <p>        The tuition waiver, a favorite benefit among ASU employees, just got
          even better.<br>
        Beginning this fall, ASU benefits eligible employees and their spouses
        can take advantage of enhanced tuition waiver benefits. For $25 per student,
        they can take up to nine credit hours - up from six credits - during
        the fall and spring semesters. During the summer, the tuition waiver
        credit limit will remain at 3 credit hours per summer session. </p>
      <p>The change
          is the result of the Arizona Board of Regents' recent approval of several
          adjustments proposed by ASU President Michael Crow to ABOR
          Policy 6-902: Qualified Tuition Reduction Program and ASU SPP 505:Employee
          Reduced In-State Tuition. <br>
        Thomas Walker, program coordinator, senior, for Intergroup Relations,
          and president of ASU Main's Classified Staff Council (CSC) says the
          tuition enhancement is great news for employees.</p>
      <p>"The waiver expansion
          has been on the council's agenda, in fact on the tri-university councils'
          agenda, for a couple of years," Walker
            says.
            "Dr. Crow took up the cause as a way to help reward employees, since
            widespread raises weren't possible. Along with scattered salary adjustments
            and ASU's absorption of some insurance increases this year, the CSC
            appreciates this big step in better supporting ASU's hardworking
        staff and other
            employees."</p>
      <p>Human Resources Assistant Director Christine Cervantes
          says these changes to the tuition waiver benefit will assist a great
          deal of
              ASU employees
              and their families.<br>
        "There was a concerted effort in all of these changes to ensure
              that they support the culture envisioned by the university's Changing
              Directions," Cervantes says. "These desired changes further enable
              employees and
              their families to continue to develop their education and at the
              same time,
              employees will add value to the organization." </p>
      <p>Classified staff members
          who have been laid off, and who meet the eligibility criteria, may
        continue to utilize the tuition waiver benefits for up
          to 12 months. The tuition waiver benefit will be provided for 12 months
          from the effective date of the layoff and will extend to the affiliated
          participants (laid-off employee, spouse, dependent children). </p>
      <p>Provisions
          also have been made to extend tuition waivers to severely disabled
        combat survivors or to the children and spouses of a service
          member from Arizona killed in the line of duty during a federal or
        state emergency declared by the president of the United States or governor
          of Arizona. </p>
      <p>Cervantes says spouses and children of employees whose jobs
          are terminated due to long-term disability also may continue to participate
          in the tuition
          waiver program. In order to receive this benefit the terminated employee
          must have at least five years of continuous service immediately preceding
          termination and be receiving long-term disability benefits.</p>
      <p>"I think the
          most important thing about these enhancements is that it's a win-win
          for everyone; it meets both the needs of the employees and
          ASU," Cervantes says. These enhancements support the university's goal
          of building a world-class university. Our new tuition waiver benefits
          will absolutely contribute to this success." </p>
