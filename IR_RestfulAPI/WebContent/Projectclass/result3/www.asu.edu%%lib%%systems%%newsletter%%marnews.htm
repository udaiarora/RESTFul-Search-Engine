LIST's Newsletter<br>
March, 2003

</center>
<br>
This month LIST has made some noteworthy changes to public workstations, highlighted below. Please direct any questions about these changes to Steve Tanner or Mike Sawitzke.
<p><br>

<h3>
Public Workstation Improvements</h3>

<b>Power Saving</b><br>
LIST has made an improvement on the settings of public workstations (only) to allow the screen to sleep and force the hard drives to spin down when idle. This is similar to the way public workstations had functioned prior to the Windows 2000 upgrade a year or so back, but there are two items that may cause questions from patrons.  
<p>
First, after a reboot, users will see a dialog box about the system settings being updated. This will only happen once. Second, the ASU Libraries Computer Use Policy dialog box will no longer be continuously displayed.  Instead, the computer will display the traditional "Press Ctrl-Alt-Del to Login" box.  When the user presses Ctrl-Alt-Del, then the ASU Libraries Computer Use Policy will appear, and the user clicks 'Ok' to log in.  
<p>
This change was required for energy conservation. It will save the University up to $20,000 a year in electricity costs, and even more in equipment replacement costs!
<p>
<b>Screen Resolution</b><br>
The display resolution on public workstation monitors is now 1024 x 768. The new setting improves the usability of the library?s web pages by allowing more information to fit on the screen (users don?t have to scroll as much to get to what they?re looking for).
<p>
<b>Terminals Established for Chinese, Japanese and Korean Character Input</b><br>
Workstations 1055 and 1056 on the upper concourse now support IME (Input Method Editor) input. This allows users to input Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters using a standard keyboard. An additional staff terminal behind the reference desk is also able to accept this input. After the workstations have been tested by library staff who speak these languages, signs will be placed next to them to let patrons know this new feature is now available. 

<p><br>

<h3>New Database Available</h3>
A new database has been put online: <a href=http://www.asu.edu/lib/top-menus/new.html>http://www.asu.edu/lib/top-menus/new.html</a>. 
<p>
<b>Conference Board Research Database (1995+)</b><br>
Conference Board Research Database is a searchable database of full-text research reports on the latest issues in business management and US and global economics. Proprietary, nonbiased research includes studies of F500 companies on business trends, leadership decisions, performance excellence, corporate governance, HR, productivity, CRM and more. Full-text coverage from 1995 to date. Economics material includes topline U.S. and global economic indicators and analysis and forecasts of regional, national, and international economic conditions.
