<U>Rationale and Objectives</U><P>

The importance of the social and behavioral sciences is evident in both the increasing number of scientific inquiries into human behavior and the amount of attention paid to those inquiries.  In both private and public sectors people rely on social scient
ific findings to assess the social consequences of large-scale economic, technological, scientific, and cultural changes.<P>

Social scientists' observations about human behavior and their unique perspectives on human events make an important contribution to civic dialogue.  Today, those insights are particularly crucial due to the growing economic and political interdependence 
among nations.<P>

Courses proposed for General Studies designation in the Social and Behavioral Sciences area must demonstrate emphases on:  (1) social scientific theories and principles, (2) the methods used to acquire knowledge about cultural or social events and process
es, and (3) the impact of social scientific understanding on the world.<P>
