<font size=+1><b><a name="Limitations on Special Class Fees and Deposits">Limitations on Special Class Fees and Deposits</a></b></font>

<p>
Under Board of Regents&#146; policy, special class fees and deposits may be imposed only for expenses necessary for the successful completion of course objectives.  Such necessary fees and deposits are limited to charges for:

<p>
<ol>
<li>off-campus field trip expenses</li>

<p>
<li>specialized use of equipment or facilities</li>

<p>
<li>private instruction and models</li>

<p>
<li>expendable materials</li>

<p>
<li>technology expenses

<p>
and</li>

<p>
<li>refundable deposits on equipment.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A master listing of approved class fees and deposits appears in each semester&#146;s/session&#146;s schedule of classes.  Footnotes in the course listings indicate classes requiring fees or deposits.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Requesting Approval of New Fees and Deposits</b></font>

<p>
New class fees and deposits must be approved by the executive vice president and provost of the university.  <a href="acd002.html#department" target="New">Departments</a> must submit written requests for approval on the <a href="provost_forms.html" target="NEW">Request for Special Class Fees and Deposits</a> form (under Academic Forms).

<p>
The Board of Regents must approve any new class fee or deposit totaling more than &#036;50, any increases in current class fees and deposits that will raise the new fee to more than &#036;50, combined lecture/laboratory fees totaling more than &#036;50 if concurrent registration in lecture and laboratory is required, and any requests for new fees and deposits for charges other than those listed above under &#147;<a href="#Limitations on Special Class Fees and Deposits">Limitations on Special Class Fees and Deposits</a>.&#148;

<p>
Requests for new fees or deposits must include:

<p>
<ol>
<li>a complete justification of the need for the fee or deposit</li>

<p>
<li>the specific intended use of the funds to be collected</li>

<p>
<li>the prefix and number of the course to which the fee will be applied</li>

<p>
<li>the semesters/sessions that the course is offered</li>

<p>
<li>the dollar amount of the proposed fee, and the basis for proposing that amount

<p>
and</li>

<p>
<li>the local departmental agency/org where revenues and related expenses will be recorded.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Requests for approval of new fees and deposits must be submitted three months before the first day of early registration for the semester/session for which the fee or deposit is needed.  

<p>
Deadlines for approval of special class fees and deposits are:

<p>
<ol>
<li type="1">fall courses&#151;December 15</li>

<p>
<li>spring courses&#151;August 1</li>

<p>
<li>summer courses&#151;October 1</li>
</ol>

Once approved, the fee or deposit is charged <a href="acd002.html#student" target="New">students</a> until the department requests that it be changed or cancelled, or until a sunset review by the ASU at Tempe campus Class Fee Sunset Review Committee determines the fee to be no longer justified.

<p>
<table>
<tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>Requests approved after the first day of early registration for a semester/session will not apply until the next semester/session that the course is offered.</td></tr>

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Collection of New Fees and Deposits</b></font>

<p>
Special class fees and deposits are billed and collected in the same fashion as other registration and tuition fees, except in those situations when the fee must be paid directly to an off-campus operator of an instructional <a href="acd002.html#facility" target="New">facility</a>.  In no case should on-site payments be made to the course instructor.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Refunds of Fees and Deposits</b></font>

<p>
<b>Fee Refunds</b>

<p>
ASU automatically refunds fees to students for classes that are dropped. Additionally, fees are automatically refunded for withdrawals processed prior to the first day of class. For withdrawals processed on or after the first day of class, departments may, at their discretion, refund fees directly from departmental accounts.

<p>
<b>Deposit Refunds</b>

<p>
Revenues from the collection of fees and deposits, along with reports listing students who have paid deposits, are distributed to local departmental accounts.  The department is responsible for maintaining accurate records of student deposits and making appropriate refunds at the end of the semester/session.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Review of Established Course Fees</b></font>

<p>
Appointed by the executive vice president and provost of the university, the ASU at Tempe campus Class Fee Sunset Review Committee systematically examines all previously approved course fees.

<p>
The review committee examines fees for fit with Board of Regents&#146; fee policy criteria and recommends their continuation, modification, or elimination.
