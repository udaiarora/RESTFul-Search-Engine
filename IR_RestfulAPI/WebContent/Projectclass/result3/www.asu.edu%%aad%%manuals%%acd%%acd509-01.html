The <a href="acd002.html#facultymember" target="New">faculty</a> ombudsperson, the president of the Academic Senate, the chair of the Classified Staff Council, and the president of Associated Students of ASU (ASASU) also serve as <i>ex officio</i> members of the committee.<p><b>Selection/Appointment of Members</b><p>Except for <i>ex officio</i> members, members of the committee are nominated by the campus units represented and appointed by the <a href="acd002.html#president" target="New">president</a>.<p><b>Chair</b><p> The committee chair is appointed by the president.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Services Provided by the Committee</b></font><p>Committee members provide information and, if needed, an informal means of problem resolution to individual <a href="acd002.html#employees" target="New">employees</a>, <a href="acd002.html#student" target="New">students</a>, and members of the public who have problems working with the university or who are involved in disputes.

The ombudsperson will mediate, conciliate, and coordinate communication activities between the disputing parties and others related to the complaint, if the parties agree voluntarily to the ombudsperson&#146;s involvement.  The purpose of this process is to air the complaint and resolve it to the satisfaction of both parties without resorting to formal hearings.<p>If the complaint alleges illegal discrimination, including <a href="acd002.html#sexualharassment" target="New">sexual harassment</a>, the ombudsperson will immediately refer the <a href="acd002.html#complainant" target="New">complainant</a> to the Office of Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action (EO/AA Office) for appropriate action.

The complainant may then follow the applicable grievance procedure if he or she wants to pursue the grievance. <p>If mediation has been completed and the grievant disagrees with the ombudsperson&#146;s determination, the grievant may initiate the formal grievance procedure within 30 days of receipt of an ombudsperson&#146;s report, if the matter is grievable.<p>If the matter proceeds to a formal hearing, the ombudsperson shall not disclose any matter discussed during mediation proceedings. All information received by the ombudsperson during the mediation process will be confidential and records created or received will not be released by the ombudsperson. Ombudspersons shall not testify or provide statements about cases in which they were involved to grievance or other committees or hearing boards.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>The Ombudsperson&#146;s Report</b></font><p>Whether or not mediation is successful, the mediation process culminates in a written report prepared by the ombudsperson and sent to the parties within 10 days after the mediation process has ended.
