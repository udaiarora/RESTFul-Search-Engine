     The Labriola Center, located on the
second level of Hayden Library, is a research
collection containing information on Native
American/Alaska Native tribes.  The Center's
staff can help students locate information
through the use of computer databases, the
Internet, and CD-ROM.  The collection brings
together current and historic information on tribal
government, culture, religion and world view,
social life, customs, tribal history, and
information on individuals from the United
States, Canada, and Sonora, Mexico.

Apache Reservation, "A Kid's Place in Phoenix,"
the Town of Guadalupe, and the San Carlos

25 through February 6 in the 1907 Archives
Gallery at Arizona State University.

The photographs were taken by children
ages eight through fourteen who participated in
the Walter Cronkite School Documentary Photo

     Workshop participants began with "one-use" cameras and soon graduated to 35mm
cameras, according to Frank Hoy, workshop
instructor.  In summer 1997, they moved into the
"computer future" using digital cameras and
designing personal Web pages.  The first
workshops documented the buildings and
landmarks of each neighborhood.  Later, the
focus shifted to family portraits.  "The talent of
our photographers blossomed in the 'Portrait of
My Family' workshop," Hoy said.  "Family
members patiently allowed themselves to be
photographed almost everywhere and, as a result,
each photographer has a unique family
documentary only he or she could produce, as
well as a record for future generations."  <i>Judith

     The City of Phoenix Parks, Recreation,
and Library Department is planning to restore
three buildings from the Phoenix Indian School
era: the cafeteria (1902); the music building
(1922); and the Memorial Hall.  Various Arizona
tribes are working together on the creation of  a
ten-acre Native American garden.  A tourism
center is part of the final plan and will be
responsible for organizing activities such as
powwows.  There will also be an office that will
organize tours to Arizona reservations.

 The Phoenix Indian School property,     
located on the north side of Indian School Road between 
Central Avenue and 3rd Street,
will ultimately be
turned into a seventy-five acre park featuring
flowers, trees, a lagoon, and a number of
memorials.  The Phoenix Indian School was
founded in 1891 with the goal of preparing Native
American children for assimilation. Thousands of
boys and girls attended the school over the next
hundred years. In 1990, the federal government
closed the school due to declining enrollment.

<a name=HEALTH><h2>Native American Health History
Database Available on the Internet</h2></a>

     The University of New Mexico's Health
Sciences Center Library has created a database of
3,300 published articles and books about Native
American health history.  The earliest citation
comes from a monograph published in 1672. 
The end date of the database is December 1965,
the year before the National Library of Medicine
began computerizing titles.
<br><p>
     The library has photocopied all of the
articles on archival paper.  Master copies are kept
in a climate-controlled building, thus ensuring
preservation in print form.  Researchers are free
to request copies of articles of interest for $6.00
per article up to 50 pages.  The books cannot be
made available but the citation should be of
assistance in locating volumes elsewhere.
<br><p>
     The database is located at:

<a name=TRIBALARCHIVES><h2>Tribal Archives Workshop Given 
at Ak-Chin </h2></a>

              <br><p>By Richard Pearce-Moses, Heard Museum

 <br><p>    <i>ConservatioNews</i>, July 1997 - On May
21-21 Ak-Chin Him-Dak Eco-Museum hosted
thirty representatives from nineteen tribes at a
workshop, "Planning a Tribal Archive." 
Participants came from twelve states, some as
distant as Connecticut and Washington.  The
workshop was organized by Alyce Sadongie and
Susan Secakuku of the National Museum of the
American Indian at the Smithsonian Institution
and taught by Jody Beaulieu of the Red Lake
Bank of Chippewa Indians and Richard Pearce-Moses of the Heard Museum, with assistance
from Carol Lopez of the Ak-Chin Tribe.  The
majority of participants were new to the field. 
For 
some the workshop was the first training they
had in archives or records management.  Often
they had related experience in museums or
cultural preservation programs, but had not
worked extensively with records.  Likewise,
many of the programs they represented were
relatively new.
<br><p>
     The program touched on all aspects of
archives, from field collecting and acquisition,
through arrangement and description,
preservation and disaster planning, and reference. 
Condensing such an enormous amount of
information into a two-day workshop often
meant that participants got little more than a
"heads up" on key points, but the instructors
emphasized basic concepts and techniques that
would give the participants a good foundation
and enable them to develop their archival
programs incrementally.
<br><p>
     Beaulieu and Lopez gave case histories
of how they developed archival programs for
their tribes.  These case studies made real the
problems, challenges, and successes the
participants would be facing.  Pearce-Moses
covered the Euro-American traditions of
archives, with Beaulieu, Lopez, and the other
participants discussing where that tradition
needed some modification to work effectively in
a tribal archive.
<br><p>
     Many tribal governments are just now
beginning an archival program to protect and
preserve their institutional records of self-government.  The Euro-American records
management model adapts well to these
institutional records.  Some tribal archivists
recounted the same problems Euro-American
corporate and government archivists face,
including officials who take their records with
them, offices that won't transfer valuable records
to the archives for safe-keeping, and councils that
want to scan everything into a computer for
"rapid retrieval and preservation."
<br><p>
     But Native American archives differ
from Euro-American archives in a number of
interesting ways.  Often some of the most
important records are held by another repository, 
such as the federal government, or are in private
hands.  Tribal archives, especially when starting
up, emphasize collecting private papers and
acquiring convenience copies of records held by
other repositories.  Many times a tribe's
collective memory has been passed down
through an oral tradition rather than written
records.  As a result the tribe seeks to ensure that
its heritage is preserved by emphasizing oral
history and language preservation programs. 
Similarly, many important records are three-dimensional objects rather than textual
documents; historical events may be recorded in
a pipe or drum, for example. 
<br><p>
     Respect for Native American religion
and ceremonies raised a number of concerns. 
Native archivists are concerned about access to
initiate or esoteric knowledge documented in
their holdings.  Such information should be seen
only by certain tribal members, yet that
information has often been misappropriated in
the past.  As an integral part of a cultural
preservation program, Native American
archivists embody tribes' desire to have more
control over how their cultural traditions and
identities are used by individuals outside the tribe. 
The participants discussed how they could work
with their tribal councils to legitimately and
ethically control use of culturally sensitive
materials.
<br><p>
     The participants got a break from two
days of hard work when Ak-Chin hosted a
traditional dinner on the first night and the Heard
Museum held a reception for participants to close
the workshop.  The workshop was sponsored and
organized by the Training Department of the
National Museum of the American Indian,
Smithsonian Institution. Through its programs,
the Training department seeks to establish a vital
link to the Native community for the purpose of
on-going consultation and collaboration, which
reflects the mission of the museum.
