              <p class="storyhead">ASU-LSU game to benefit hurricane relief efforts; Tickets still available </p>
              <p>Ongoing relief efforts for the victims of Hurricane Katrina have forced Saturday&rsquo;s ASU-Louisiana State University football game to be moved to Sun Devil Stadium. Ticket proceeds from the game will go to relief efforts in the area. As of late Friday afternoon, tickets were still available at <a href="http://www.thesundevils.com">www.thesundevils.com</a>. </p>

                      <p>We are approaching our goal of selling out the stadium for the ASU/LSU game tomorrow at 6:15 p.m. but tickets still remain. <br>
<br>
I have been heartened by the tremendous support from the university community and want to encourage, once again, every single member of the faculty, staff and student body to support the hurricane victims by attending the game.<br>
<br>
You can purchase tickets online <a href="http://www.thesundevils.com">www.thesundevils.com</a>  or at the ticket office at Sun Devil Stadium until 8 p.m. today, and from 9 a.m. until halftime of the game tomorrow. Those who have already purchased tickets are encouraged to pick them up as soon as possible to avoid long lines at the game. <br>
<br>
I look forward to seeing you Saturday night to welcome the LSU Tigers and their fans to Sun Devil Stadium.<br>
<br>
Go Devils!<br>
<br>

              <p>The LSU campus in Baton Rouge &ndash; particularly its athletic venues &ndash; has played a central role in medical services during the relief efforts. Those activities, as well as other factors resulting from the aftermath of the hurricane, have created logistical problems for the football game, which was scheduled for Saturday in Tiger Stadium.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;There are considerable logistical issues that either affect the execution of a football game, or detract from providing recovery services in this time of need,&rdquo; says Sean O&rsquo;Keefe, LSU&rsquo;s chancellor. &ldquo;We have collected as much information as possible and deliberated this issue carefully over the weekend, but the myriad of details and questions that remain unresolved dictate this move.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The game will be televised on ESPN, but kickoff time still is being determined. Tickets are being offered to season ticket holders Tuesday. Tickets to the game are availble for the public online at <a href="http://www.thesundevils.com/">www.thesundevils.com</a>.</p>
              <p>In cooperation with LSU and the City of Tempe who will co-host the game, ASU officials have announced that proceeds from the game will be donated to hurricane relief efforts. A sold-out game could raise an estimated $1 million.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We feel it is most important that, beyond any staging costs, that every bit of the money raised at this event will go toward the relief effort, along with additional fundraising that we will be doing throughout the business community and the community in general,&rdquo; says Christine Wilkinson, ASU vice president and secretary of the university. &ldquo;Vice President for Athletics Lisa Love and her staff are ready to lead both of those efforts. We seek everyone&rsquo;s help, and we need your help. Come to the game, and bring your family and friends. It will be a great game &ndash; and a super fundraiser.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Tom Collins, senior associate athletic director, visited Baton Rouge with a group from ASU Sunday. Although in many respects the community appears unscathed, he says the signs of stress were evident.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Baton Rouge, when you drive through it, it looks normal,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They have been under a lot of stress, and you can tell that they have been up for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>He says the ASU contingent was concerned about housing for the team and fans if the game was played in Baton Rouge &ndash; and from taking resources that are being used for those involved in the relief efforts.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It was clear to LSU officials by the end of our visit that we had some legitimate concerns,&rdquo; Collins says. &ldquo;Again, the hotel issue was the major one. It was the first place we went when we got there. They had evacuees there, and the governor has issued orders that neither evacuees or people working with the recovery effort can be displaced from their hotels. We didn&rsquo;t feel it was fair to all the people that were in there &ndash; the evacuees or all the people working to restore the power.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>With the game now in Tempe, ASU officials are securing travel arrangements for the LSU team and pep band. The Fiesta Bowl Organization is organizing lodging for the team and has agreed to cover the team&rsquo;s food and other expenses.</p>
              <p>ASU athletic officials are quickly working to prepare Sun Devil Stadium for the game. Among the preparations, ASU officials will have to:</p>
              <p>&bull; Print more than 70,000 tickets.</p>
              <p>&bull; Prepare the field.</p>
              <p>&bull; Arrange concessions.</p>
              <p>&bull; Gather the regular stadium game-day staff and get them in place for the game.</p>
              <p>This is the second time in a few years that ASU has had to quickly turn around Sun Devil Stadium for a game affected by a natural disaster. In 2003, the stadium had 24 hours to prepare for a National Football League game after fires in San Diego forced the Chargers to move their game here.<img src="../feature_sm_images/Katrina-17.jpg" width="288" height="142" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></p>
              <p>&ldquo;In 2003, we had 24 hours&rsquo; notice to turn around a Monday Night NFL football game &ndash; and we did that without a hitch,&rdquo; says Mike Chismar, ASU&rsquo;s associate athletic director for operations and facilities. &ldquo;We are going to move forward to get in touch with more than 1,200 people who work at the games to make sure that they will be at their posts for Saturday&rsquo;s game, but we will get it done &ndash; and we&rsquo;re looking forward to it.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The game had been scheduled to be part of a home-and-home series, with LSU as the host site this year and ASU as the home team in 2008. Because of the unusual nature of the situation, the schools have agreed that Saturday&rsquo;s game will not count as one of the games. A future game will be scheduled for ASU to play in Baton Rouge.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This football game has become an event where the whole community can get involved to help and raise money,&rdquo; Collins says. &ldquo;It would be our hope to net somewhere in excess of $1 million to give to the relief fund. We do have to help LSU to get out here now for the game, and we consider that part of the costs, but we are hoping to fill the stadium and get that kind of money for the fund.&rdquo;</p>
