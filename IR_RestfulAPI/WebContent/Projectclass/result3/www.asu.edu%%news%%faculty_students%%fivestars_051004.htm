      <h2>President Crow shines light on five new 'rising stars' </h2>
      <p>Five newly-tenured faculty members who are setting a standard of excellence for the entire university have been named by President Michael Crow as exemplars of the finest teacher-scholars at ASU. They are "rising stars" whose focused talent and hard work are evident in everything they do. </p>
      <p>They range from a groundbreaking bioengineer who is helping epilepsy sufferers to an adventuresome theatre professor documenting indigenous Mayan theatrical troupes. All have distinguished themselves in a short time as outstanding teachers and producers of high quality research and service. </p>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/Ferran-Garcia-Pichel-2.jpg" width="216" height="151" align="right">Since coming to ASU in 2000, Microbiologist Ferran Garcia-Pichel has brought his expertise in microbial ecology to bear on Southwestern desert systems, engaging students in his study of "desert crusts" in Arizona and Mexico and introducing them to the field of "geomicrobiology." He already has a very active, well-funded research program under way. </p>
      <p>"He is also a versatile, talented and enthusiastic teacher," says Jean Schmidt, School of Life Sciences (SOLS) professor. "Geomicrobiology is of interest to students in both life sciences and geology, and people studying Mars and other space explorations, since microbes are the most likely form of life to be found on other planets." </p>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/Ian-Gould.jpg" width="180" height="298" align="left">Ian Gould joined the ASU Chemistry and Biochemistry Department in 1998 after spending 12 years at the research laboratories of Eastman Kodak, where he developed a worldwide reputation for his research into the interaction of light and matter. His studies helped uncover the basic chemical principles underlying photography, photosynthetic solar energy harvesting and other important processes. </p>
      <p>"During his short time at ASU, Professor Gould has not only continued his work through research grants but has demonstrated exceptional prowess in undergraduate education," says Robert Blankenship, department chair, noting that Gould has won several teaching awards. "This extremely high level of achievement in both research and teaching is exceptional for one just beginning his academic career." </p>
      <p>Gould also established a K-12 program mobilizing ASU chemistry students and local teachers to help children appreciate the wonders of nature and started an annual Arizona Undergraduate Research Symposium. Because of his extraordinary achievements, he also has been promoted from assistant to full professor. </p>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/Exemplar-Tamara.jpg" width="216" height="145" align="right">Tamara Underiner, associate professor of theatre who came to ASU in 2001, already has developed a high profile at national and international conferences for her work in Latin American performance studies. She has just published a book that is the first full-length study in English of contemporary theatre in Mayan Mexico. </p>
      <p>"This topic has particular relevance because in the wake of the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas , Mexico in 1994, indigenous theatrical troupes have been an important force for the articulation of Mayan cultural identity," says Margaret Knapp, interim department chair. "Professor Underiner has done extensive on-site research under sometimes difficult conditions to produce an important work. She also is a fine teacher and mentor of undergraduate and graduate students." </p>
      <p>Bioengineering Professor Leon Iasemidis, who joined the faculty in 2000, was among the first in the world to accurately predict epileptic seizures before they take place, using new mathematical models. He holds the first U.S. patent for the new forecasting ability and hopes to put his warning system into an implantable computer chip that will send out an alarm signal from the patient's brain, giving doctors enough time to intervene with drugs. </p>
      <p>"Leon Iasemidis's work is a model for faculty performance in the Fulton School of Engineering," said Eric Guilbeau, department chair. "He is leading his field in research and at the same time providing excellent classroom instruction to undergraduate and graduate students." </p>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/Ann-Kinzig-photo.jpg" width="216" height="162" align="left">Biologist Ann Kinzig is carving out a niche in theoretical ecology and the emerging interdisciplinary field exploring the dynamics of human-dominated ecosystems. </p>
      <p>Her major projects include study of the influence of socioeconomic factors on urban ecology, including analysis of neighborhood park systems in Phoenix . </p>
      <p>"This research springs from Kinzig's sense of responsibility to help balance humanity's need to maintain critical environmental functions while also improving quality of life for its less privileged members, including those to come," says Jane Maienschein, Regents Professor in SOLS. </p>
      <p>Though Kinzig arrived at ASU in 1998, her first year was actually spent at the White House, where she helped shape environmental policy as an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow in the Office of Science and Technology Policy. </p>
      <p>These exemplary faculty have received an extra salary increase in addition to the promotion adjustment. </p>
