HELP RLIST

FUNCTION
          5740-XXH  (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 1987

      The RLIST command is used to display information for resources in
      a specified class.

      Listed below are the checks performed to determine if you have
      sufficient authority to list the resource.  If any check is
      passed, then you are authorized.  The rules apply to each
      resource as it is processed.
          - You have the SPECIAL or AUDITOR attribute, or
          - You are the owner of the resource, or
          - You have group-SPECIAL or group-AUDITOR authority and
            the resource is owned by the group or by a user owned by
            the group, or
          - You are authorized to the resource with at least READ
            authority, or
          - Your current connect group is authorized to the resource
            with at least READ authority, or
          - The universal access to the resource is at least READ.

      To use the AUTHUSER operand, the authorization checking is
      performed as above, except that ALTER authority is required
      instead of READ.  However, for generic names, only the first two
      checks are performed.

      To use the GLOBALAUDIT option, the AUDITOR attribute or
      group-AUDITOR authority is required.

      If the RESGROUP operand is specified, only those resource group
      names to which you have sufficient authority are listed.  You are
      authorized to list a resource group name if one of the following
      conditions is true:
        (1) you are authorized to the resource(s) indicated by the
            second positional operand according to the rules listed
            above except that ALTER authority is required instead of
            READ.
        (2) you are authorized to the resource group according to the
            rules listed above.

OPERANDS
  class-name
      Specifies the class to which the resources to be listed belong

  profile-name... | *
      Specifies the name of one or more resources to be listed.  An *
      indicates a request for information for all resources currently
      defined to the specified class that you are authorized to list.

  GENERIC
      Specifies that only generic resource names will be listed.  This
      operand is ignored if generic command processing is inactive.

  NOGENERIC
      Specifies  only discrete resource names will be listed.  This
      operand is ignored if generic command processing is inactive.

  STATISTICS
      The number of times the resource has been accessed under each
      access level (ALTER, CONTROL, UPDATE, READ) will be listed in
      addition to other information the user is authorized to list.

  HISTORY
      The dates when the resource was defined to RACF, was last
      referenced and was last changed (except for TERMINAL class) are
      displayed in addition to other information the user is
      authorized to list.

  AUTHUSER
      A list of all users and groups authorized to the resource
      (including each one's access and access count) is listed in
      addition to other information the user is authorized to list.

  RESGROUP
      A list of all resource group names, to which the resource(s)
      indicated by the second positional operand belong, is displayed.
      This operand applies only to those resource classes which are
      not resource groups and for which resource groups can exist.

  TVTOC
      Specifies that the TVTOC is to be displayed for a tape volume
      profile.

  ALL
      Displays all possible information for the resource as described
      in the STATISTICS, HISTORY, AUTHUSER, RESGROUP, and TVTOC
      operands.

  ICH13001I NOT AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE RLIST

            Explanation:  You are not defined to RACF and cannot issue
            the RLIST command, or RACF is not active.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH13002I NOT AUTHORIZED TO LIST entity-name

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to list
            the indicated entity-name.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            entity name in the list.

  ICH13003I entity-name NOT FOUND

            Explanation:  The indicated entity name was not found in
            the RACF data base.

  ICH13004I NOTHING TO LIST

            Explanation:  You specified * for entity name and either
            there are no entities in that class or you do not have
            sufficient authority to list any of them.

  ICH13005I RESGROUP DOES NOT APPLY TO class-name CLASS ENTITIES:
            OPERAND IGNORED

            Explanation:  The RLIST command user specified the
            RESGROUP operand and the specified class is a class for
            which resource groups are not allowed.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the operand.  Command
            processing continues with the next operand.
