      <h2>ASU mourns passing of namesake, friend</h2>
      <p>        Civic leader, philanthropist and longtime lover of the arts Katherine
          K. "Kax" Herberger, in whose honor ASU's College of Fine Arts is named,
      died April 19 after suffering a stroke. She was 91.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Herberger's
            landmark $12 million gift to ASU in 2000, at the time the largest
        single personal gift given to the university, ensured that
          programs in art, dance, music and theater would thrive at ASU for generations
          to come. It also reflected her longtime commitment to education and
        her belief in the importance of the arts as nourishment for the mind
        and
          soul. Her endowed gift is funding scholarships and fellowships for
        students, research and creative activity by students and faculty, visiting
        artists
          and a variety of community partnerships in the arts and education.<br>
        J. Robert Wills, dean of The Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine
          Arts, will remember Mrs. Herberger equally for "the gift of name" and,
          in turn,
        spirit. </p>
      <p>"Kax Herberger represented all that is important to the arts
          and philanthropy in the Valley, the state and the nation," Wills said.
          "We were privileged
          to receive the most valuable gift she could give - the gift of name.
          It has enabled her distinct and profound personal vision and her generosity
        of spirit to be carved into the history and culture of our college."</p>
      <p>Prior
          to making her landmark gift to the college, Mrs. Herberger championed
          the support and growth of the College of Fine Arts and encouraged its
          community outreach programs, funding an endowment which established
        ArtsWork: The Kax Herberger Center for Children and the Arts.</p>
      <p>Though the arts were
          her passion, Mrs. Herberger's long tradition of giving her time and
        financial support to ASU extended to many other areas
          within the university. She and her husband, Robert, who died in 1999
          at the age of 94, and their children, have made more than 100 financial
          contributions to ASU, benefiting scholarship programs and the colleges
          of fine arts, business, public programs and architecture and environmental
        design.</p>
      <p>Over the years, Mrs. Herberger also served in a number of capacities
          at ASU. She was a member of the ASU Library Associates, the ASU Campaign
          for Leadership, the College of Fine Arts Dean's Council and the ASU
        Foundation Board, where she was the first woman to chair the organization.
        She received
        an honorary doctorate from ASU in 1987.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Herberger once described
          the motivation for the family's generosity and civic involvement in
        the elegant, matter-of-fact style for which
          she was known: "We give because it is the right thing to do. I feel
        good knowing that my gifts of time and money are making a difference
        in the
        community, and hopefully shaping spiritual and moral values." </p>
      <p>The Herbergers
          made their fortune in retail and real estate. Robert Herberger owned
          a department store chain in Minnesota, the state from which both
          he and Mrs. Herberger hailed. In Arizona, where the couple moved in
        1949, he succeeded in real estate.</p>
      <p>Upon arriving in the Valley, Mrs. Herberger
          quickly immersed herself in the affairs of a young Phoenix community,
          launching a lifelong pattern
        of civic commitment that has become a Herberger family hallmark. </p>
      <p>An art
          major at the University of Minnesota and an accomplished violinist,
        painter and sculptress, she was drawn like a magnet to the Valley arts
          scene. Mrs. Herberger was involved almost everywhere, notably in the
          Phoenix Symphony, the Phoenix Art Museum, the Town of Paradise Valley
          Arts Commission, Scottsdale Artists School, The New School for the
        Arts,
          the Heard Museum, the Phoenix Chamber Music Society and COMPAS. Her
        lifelong devotion to the arts, which her husband shared, also led to
        the establishment
          of a premier performing arts center in downtown Phoenix, the Herberger
        Theater Center.</p>
      <p>The college will remember Katherine K. Herberger at several
          events in the coming months. The May 4 public performance of "The Brahms
          Requiem"
          by the University Symphony Orchestra and the combined ASU Choirs will
          be dedicated to her memory. The free performance will be held at 2:30
        p.m. in Gammage Auditorium. No tickets are required.</p>
