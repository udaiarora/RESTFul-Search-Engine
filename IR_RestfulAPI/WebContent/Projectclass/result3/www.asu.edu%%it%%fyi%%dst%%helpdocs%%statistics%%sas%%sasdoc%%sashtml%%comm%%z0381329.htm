Beginning with Version
7, the TELNET access method is not supported. However, information about TELNET
is included here for Version 6 users.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"></DD></DL>

<P>For TELNET, the WAITFOR statement in the
script looks for all possibilities. If no condition is met, the number of
seconds that are specified to wait should be less than the amount of time
that is allowed by the connection itself before it drops because there is
no activity. If the WAITFOR statement is not set properly, the following message
will appears during an asynchronous SIGNON:  



<PRE>ERROR:  Read Error</PRE>
<P>For TELNET, if the SIGNON appears to hang during a SIGNON, change the
EOPCHAR in the SIGNON script to LF.  The default EOPCHAR is CR. CR is not
recognized by some remote systems.
<P>For TCP/IP, SAS/CONNECT may be unable to connect to the TCP/IP port.
The following system message appears:  



<PRE>connection refused</PRE>
<P>The connection may fail at SIGNON for the following reasons: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>The remote side is not listening.<P>

<LI>The maximum number of connections has
been reached.<P>
</UL>

<P>A SIGNON from SAS for Windows, Release 6.08 may fail with the following
message in a File Error dialog box:  



<PRE>Cannot find WSOCKETS.DLL</PRE>
<P>There are two reasons for this failure.  The first and most common reason
is that the DOS PATH statement does not contain the directory where the Microsoft
LAN Manager V2.1+ TCP/IP product is installed.
<P>The second common reason for failure is that the WSOCKETS.DLL module
is not in the C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG subdirectory (assuming C:\LANMAN.DOS is
the parent directory where the Microsoft LAN Manager V2.1+ is installed).
This file must be present for the SIGNON to be successful.
<P>A SIGNON from SAS for Windows, Release 6.10, 6.11, and 6.12 may fail
with the following message in a File Error dialog box:  



<PRE>Cannot find WLIBSOCK.DLL</PRE>
<P>This failure often occurs if WLIBSOCK.DLL is not located in a subdirectory
of the Novell LAN Workplace directory defined by the EXCELAN variable. For
the Novell LAN Workplace for DOS, Release V4.0 the subdirectory is BIN40.
For the Novell LAN Workplace for DOS, Release V4.1, the subdirectory is BIN.
<P>With SAS for Windows, Release 6.08 and the Novell LAN Workplace for
DOS, the following error is generated during a TCP SIGNON if the EXCELAN variable
is not found:  



<PRE>Cannot find WSOCKETS.DLL</PRE>
<P>This variable EXCELAN should be set in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
To verify that it has been set, type SET at your DOS prompt. EXCELAN should
be one of the variables listed, and it should point to your XLN directory
if you are running the Novell LAN Workplace for MS-DOS V4.0, or to the NET
directory if you are running the Novell LAN Workplace for MS-DOS V4.1. XLN
and NET are the default directory names and may have been changed during the
installation of the software. An example of the SET statement is  



<PRE>SET EXCELAN=C:\NET</PRE>
<P>The variable EXCELAN is required by SAS/CONNECT to
be set for all release levels of the Novell LAN Workplace for DOS.

<P>The TCP/IP access method used by SAS/SHARE sometimes issues generalized
messages to identify problems.  This section describes some of the most frequently
encountered messages.  



<PRE>ERROR: Communication request rejected by partner: 
security verification failure</PRE>
<P>An unauthorized client tried to connect to a secure server.  



<PRE>No TCP service <I>server-id</I> on this host.</PRE>
<P>The service that was specified in the SERVERID= option is not one of
the SAS/SHARE TCP/IP service names that are defined in the TCP/IP services
file.  



<PRE>Cannot locate TCP host '<I>node</I>'.</PRE>
<P>The TCP/IP software is probably not running on the server's node. The
node that was specified in a two-level name is not known to the TCP/IP software,
or the TCP/IP software is not running on the user's node.  



<PRE>Cannot bind TCP socket.   
System message is 'address already in use'.</PRE>
<P>Another server that has the same name is already running on this node,
or another TCP/IP application is using the predefined port numbers that the
TCP/IP access method is trying to use.  If another server that has the same
name is running, choose one of the other predefined server names.  If there
is no other server running that has the same name, there may be a conflict
with another software package. Contact the SAS Software Representative at
your site for assistance in resolving the problem.  



<PRE>Cannot connect to TCP socket.   
System message is 'connection refused'.</PRE>
<P>The server that was specified by the SERVER= option cannot be located
on the specified node.
