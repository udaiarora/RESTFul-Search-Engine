<h3><b>Annual Report 2000</b></h3>
<P>

<P>
The Committee on Academic Professional Status (CAPS) considered the following topics during
the 1999/2000 year.
<P>
At the request of members of one department, CAPS discussed the issue of continuing versus
non-continuing status of academic professional positions and how to convert a position from
non-continuing to continuing.  Those interested were advised to carefully study the procedures in
the ACD Manual.  Any change in a position to continuing status must be initiated by the
immediate supervisor, and approved by the Dean and the Provost.  On a related matter, we
discussed the issue of academic associates who are academic professionals with non-continuing
status.  Some academic associates are classified staff and some are academic professionals. 
According to Walter Harris, these academic associates have a relationship to academic
professionals similar to that of faculty associates to faculty.  CAPS was approached by a
representative from the Council of Academic Advisors (CAA) about some of their concerns and
the possibility of being represented by CAPS since they are not eligible to be represented by the
Classified Staff Council.  Tom Keating discussed the matter with Walter Harris.  Tom later met
with the steering committee of CAA.  The Council asked if CAPS was willing to support
academic associates having voting rights in electing members to CAPS.  According to the bylaws
of CAPS, up to one position can be held by an academic professional with year-to-year
appointment who otherwise meets the requirements.  However, this group does not receive the
form from Academic Senate to volunteer for committee appointments.  Since the Academic
Senate sends out the ballot, we recommended that they contact Darby Shaw.  An academic
associate was elected to CAPS for the coming year.  CAPS discussed and Tom Keating relayed to
the Academic Senate CAPS position that everyone said to be represented by CAPS has a right to
vote in the election of members of CAPS.
<P> 
There was one joint meeting of CAPS and PACAPS in September 1999 to discuss common
interests.  There was a suggestion that a distribution list for APs be established to improve
communication.  Such a list was set up by IT for Microsoft Outlook but it has not been used to
send a message to all academic professionals yet.
<P>
CAPS reviewed the bylaws of various colleges for the provisions made for academic professionals
in college governance.  The colleges now seem to conform to ASU policy.
<P>
There was a discussion and a recommendation that CAPS offer a workshop to help academic
professionals who are going up for promotion and continuing appointment - mainly on the
preparation of a packet.  Such a workshop is still in the development stages.
