<b><i> Instructions for downloading the Adobe Acrobat Reader:
</i></b><p><br>
The Adobe Acrobat Reader allows you to view, navigate and print
PDF (Portable Document Format) files across many different platforms.
Documents in the PDF can be displayed and printed from any computer - 
Macintosh, Windows, DOS or UNIX - regardless of the fonts or software 
programs used to create the original.<p>       

Follow these steps to successfully install your Acrobat Reader.<br><br>

<img src = "images/orangeball.gif"> Go to Adobe's Reader page by clicking 
on the link given above. <br><br>
<img src = "images/orangeball.gif"> Select the version of Reader you will 
need for your platform (Macintosh, Windows, DOS or Unix) from the 
"Released Software" list <b>(NOT the Beta version).</b> <br><br>
<img src = "images/orangeball.gif"> Check the system requirements -
processor (386, 486, Pentium), version of the operating system, and the 
amount of RAM required for installation.

the system requirements, click on "Download." Select the language with 
which you are most comfortable.

<br><br>
<img src = "images/orangeball.gif"> You will now be prompted to select the
location where you want Acrobat Reader saved.  By default it will be 
saved on your C drive.  If you wish you can create a separate directory 
or folder and save it in that location. <br><br>  

<img src = "images/orangeball.gif"> When you are done, click on "Save."  
Saving Reader to your disk may take anywhere from a few to 10 minutes, 
depending on network traffic. <br><br>
The name of the folder in which Reader is saved is Acroread and the 
executable file is Acroread.exe.<br><br>

The next step is to type PDF in the space provided for "File
Extensions."<br><br>
