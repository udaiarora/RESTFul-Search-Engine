      <h2>Researchers close in on secret life of DNA</h2>
      <p>Z-DNA, a long-known but still mysterious alternate configuration of DNA, 
        is involved in cellular defenses against viral attack, according to the 
        results of a series of experiments linking Z-DNA binding proteins with 
        lethality in pox viruses.</p>
      <p>The research appears to point toward important answers to the unsolved 
        puzzle of how this alternate form of DNA functions and may lead to the 
        development of anti-viral compounds that are effective against smallpox, 
        one of the deadliest of human diseases.</p>
      <p>A report on the research by two teams of scientists from the Massachusetts 
        Institute of Technology and ASU was published in the May 19 Online Early 
        Edition of the Publication of the National Academy of Sciences. &#147;A 
        role for Z-DNA binding in vaccinia virus athogenesis,&#148; is written 
        by Yang-Gyun Kim, Ky Lowenhaupt and Alexander Rich from MIT and Maneesha 
        Muralinath, Teresa Brandt, Matthew Pearcy, Kevin Hauns and Bertram L. 
        Jacobs from ASU.</p>
      <p>Z-DNA, discovered by MIT&#146;s Rich in 1979, is an alternate zig-zag-shaped 
        form (or &#147;conformation&#148;) that DNA sometimes assumes instead 
        of the familiar double helix conformation (known as B-DNA). Certain sequences 
        of DNA in the normal B conformation will &#147;flip&#148; into the less 
        stable Z form, apparently in response to genes being transcribed immediately 
        &#147;downstream&#148; on the molecule&#146;s sequence. Coiled to the 
        left instead of to the right, the Z-DNA conformation is a significantly 
        different arrangement of the molecule, but the functional role of this 
        major difference has remained largely unclear.</p>
      <p>In the report, the researchers find clear evidence that a critical pox 
        virus protein &#150; one known to be necessary for the virus to disable 
        animal cell defenses &#150; works by binding to Z-DNA and apparently interfering 
        in its operation.</p>
      <p>The researchers aimed a variety of experiments toward understanding the 
        functionality of vaccinia virus protein E3L, a protein previous experiments 
        have shown to be produced by vaccinia in order to cause disease, and that 
        can also be disabled by modifying the protein&#146;s active site.</p>
      <p>Noting the similarity of E3L&#146;s active site to a site on a protein 
        known as ADAR1 that has been proven to bind to Z-DNA, the researchers 
        first replaced the active site in E3L with the ADAR1 site and found that 
        viruses containing this modified protein were still lethal.</p>
      <p>Next, the team mutated the modified protein and found that mutations 
        that affected the active site and the protein&#146;s ability to bind to 
        Z-DNA in the test tube diminished the virus&#146;s lethality, much as 
        mutations to E3L&#146;s active site had earlier been proved to disable 
        the virus. They also found that non-lethal forms of the virus containing 
        a similar protein that does not bind with Z-DNA could be made lethal by 
        mutating the protein to make its active site capable of Z-DNA binding.</p>
      <p>&#147;We have very good evidence now that in order for vaccinia virus 
        to kill a mouse, it has to have a Z-DNA binding protein,&#148; said Jacobs. 
        &#147;This is how E3L works.&#148;</p>
      <p>Specifically how Z-DNA binding affects mouse cells defenses against viruses 
        still remains to be seen, said Jacobs, but the current experiments&#146; 
        results point to a way to find out.</p>
      <p>&#147;The fact that we&#146;ve got a Z-DNA binding protein that&#146;s 
        critical for whether a virus kills an animal or not, gives us tools to 
        start asking what is Z-DNA really doing,&#148; said Jacobs. </p>
      <p>A potential by-product of the research is the development of new anti-viral 
        drugs that could be effective against smallpox. Smallpox is very similar 
        to the vaccinia virus (live vaccinia virus is the key component in smallpox 
        vaccine) and smallpox contains a gene that is essentially the same as 
        the gene that produces the Z-DNA binding E3L protein. From the group&#146;s 
        understanding of the similarities between E3L and ADAR1, Jacobs believes 
        that a molecule could be designed that would block the Z-DNA binding site 
        of E3L and thus disable the disease-causing capabilities of both vaccinia 
        and smallpox.</p>
      <p>&#147;Dr. Rich has solved the crystal structure for this Z-DNA binding 
        domain from ADAR1, so we know what it looks like,&#148; Jacobs said. &#147;We 
        think that the Z-DNA binding domains on the viral proteins are similar 
        to this, so we can potentially make a small molecule that will fit into 
        this binding site on the viral protein. This would keep the viral protein 
        from binding to Z-DNA, and this thus prevent smallpox from causing disease.&#148;</p>
