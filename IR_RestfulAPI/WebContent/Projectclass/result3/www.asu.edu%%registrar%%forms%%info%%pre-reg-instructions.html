<b><h3>Pre-Registration Instructions</h3></b> </center>
<br>

Pre-registration  is your first opportunity to register and provides the 
best chance for you to get the classes you want.
<p> Pre-registration is available for Fall and Spring semesters only. Before submitting 
  your pre-registration request, check your eligibility to register at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/interactive">http://www.asu.edu/interactive</a> and obtain advising if required. <strong>PRE-REGISTRATION 
  REQUESTS WILL BE REJECTED AND NO CLASSES SCHEDULED FOR STUDENTS WITH THE ADVISING 
  REQUIREMENT WHO DO NOT OBTAIN ADVISING BEFORE PRE-REGISTERING.</strong>
<p> During the pre-registration period, which lasts for approximately seven days, 
  you can submit your request for classes using the <a href=http://cgi.asu.edu/registrar/cgi-bin/interactive.cgi>Registrar's 
  Interactive Web Site</a> or you can turn in your completed pre-registration 
  form at your department or at any Registrar Site. If your department does not 
  require you to turn your pre-registration form in to their office, and if you 
  are unable to submit your request on the web, you can fax your form to the Office 
  of the Registrar at (480)965-7722. When filling out the form, use a reasonably 
  thick black marker that will transmit successfully via fax; pencil or fine line 
  pens often are not legible on fax transmissions. Faxed pre-reg requests will 
  be accepted only during the actual pre-registration period, so it is important 
  that, if you fax on the last day of the pre-registration period, you be mindful 
  of any time differences.
<p> Schedule/Billing Statements will <strong>not</strong> be mailed. You can access 
  your Schedule/Billing Statement on the interactive website. 
  Students who pre-register have two days to revise their schedule before other 
  students can register. These two days are called "Priority Drop/Add". You can 
  drop or add classes to your schedule using ASU Interactive  or in-person beginning with 
  the priority drop/add period through the first week of classes.
<p>

You can access a list of classes with seats still available on the Web at
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/registrar/schedule">
http://www.asu.edu/registrar/schedule</a>. After selecting the search type, select  Class Status Open, the  semester desired, course location and course prefix and number from the drop down boxes.
<p>

You may choose to audit a course in which case you attend and participate 
in the class but do not earn credit or a grade.  Obtain instructor's approval to audit 
prior to registering and paying fees.<p>
