      <h2>2002 was another banner year for Greater Phoenix resale market </h2>
      <p>The Greater Phoenix resale home market managed to set a new record with 
        62,625 sales in 2002, despite a struggling economy and declining consumer 
        confidence, according to data released today by the Arizona Real Estate 
        Center.</p>
      <p>The figure exceeded last year's recorded sales total (61,155) by 2.4 
        percent. In comparison, there were 55,370 sales recorded in 2000 and 56,365 
        in 1999. </p>
      <p>The townhouse/condominium housing sector also set a new record with 13,300 
        recorded sales, compared to the previous record of 12,670 sales in 2001.</p>
      <p>There are four basic motivations that drive homebuyers, according to 
        Jay Butler, director of the center at ASU. "There is the need for housing, 
        especially for new residents; the desire to own, not rent; the dream to 
        improve current housing; and/or to invest in housing as rentals or second 
        homes. The low interest rates have facilitated the ability of people to 
        satisfy these motivations."</p>
      <p>The key to the performance of the 2003 market will hinge on three critical 
        factors, according to Butler:<br>
        <br>
        1. Job growth: Will the economic recovery continue to strengthen, especially 
        in creating new jobs that will draw people to the area?</p>
      <p>2. Mortgage rates: How high or how low? Although low mortgage rates have 
        been very important in sustaining the market, they need not remain at 
        current levels because affordability can be maintained with interest rates 
        at 8 percent.</p>
      <p>3. World events: What will be the impact of future world events on the 
        U.S. economy and the consumer psyche?</p>
      <p> Among the highlights of the Greater Phoenix resale market in 2002:</p>

        record, the median home price rose 6.5 percent, from $136,000 in 2001
