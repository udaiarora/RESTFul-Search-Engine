                  <strong>Recalls</strong>
                  <p> Items which are checked out may be requested by other borrowers at any time.&nbsp; All items are subject to recall.&nbsp; This policy applies all year long: breaks, sabbaticals, vacations, etc.&nbsp; You will be notified of any recalls.&nbsp; Recall of an item may shorten the original loan period. Items not returned by the Recall Due Date will be assessed a $10.00 fee and a replacement charge for each item.&nbsp; Only the replacement charge will be cancelled when the item is returned. Recall late fines are strictly enforced. <br>

                  <p> Items may be renewed as often as necessary unless recalled by another borrower.&nbsp; Items recalled by another borrower cannot be renewed. Renewals may be done at any ASU Library by bringing the items to Circulation.&nbsp; Renewals may also be processed over the phone (965- 2595) or over the Internet on the <a href="https://library.lib.asu.edu/patroninfo/"><b>Library Network. </b></a><br>
  Community Card borrowers may make up to two (2) renewals for each item.&nbsp; Certain items, e.g., reserve, videos, are not renewable.&nbsp; Refer to the <a

                  <strong>Requesting West Campus Materials</strong>
                  <p> If the item is at the West campus, fill out a circulation request card and submit it to the Circulation Desk or request the item through the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib"><b>Library Online Catalog</b></a>.&nbsp; Most items that are on the shelves are delivered to the Tempe campus within two business days.&nbsp; Requests for videos can be made at the Circulation desk and requests for journal articles are made through Interlibrary Loan (ILL).&nbsp; Most materials from the West campus circulate for standard loan periods. <br>
                  </p>

                  <strong>Proxy Cards</strong>
                  <p> ASU faculty, staff, or students may authorize another person as a "proxy" to use their ASU ID for all library transactions.&nbsp; This allows the Proxy to use your ASU ID to check out library materials in your name.&nbsp; Proxies may be Teaching Assistants, spouses, family members, etc.&nbsp; Forms are available at any library Circulation desk.</p>
                 <br>
                  <p> A Proxy Card will be issued.&nbsp; For security purposes, the card will be sent to you, not to your Proxy. At the time of checkout, the proxy must present both the Proxy Card and his/her own photo ID. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;                  </p>
                  <strong>Community Cards</strong>
                  <p> The University Libraries are open to all users.&nbsp; An individual not affiliated with ASU who is an Arizona resident and meets certain age requirements, may borrow library items by purchasing a Community Card. Community Cards must be purchased at Hayden Library.&nbsp; There is a non-refundable annual fee of $100.00 for the basic community card.&nbsp; Borrowing privileges are not transferable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Refer to the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/access/comm.html"><b>Community Card Loan Policy</b></a> for more information. <br>
