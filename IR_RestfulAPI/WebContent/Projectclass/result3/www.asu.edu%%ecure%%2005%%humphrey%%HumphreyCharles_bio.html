<h4>Presentation Abstract</h4>
<p>Two national consultations have been conducted in Canada over the past four years that focus on preserving and providing access to 
research data.  The initial study was conducted on behalf of the National Archivist of Canada and the Social Sciences and Humanities 
Research Council.  The findings from this investigation demonstrated the need to preserve research data and outlined institutional 
models to implement a data archiving mandate.  The second consultation was coordinated by Canada\'s National Research Council on behalf 
of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation.  This investigation has led to a series of recommendations for government, the granting councils, the research community 
and universities.  This presentation will review the research findings of these two consultations and discuss possible directions given 
this new knowledge.</p>
