The AP Task Force was comprised of individuals               from various AP categories and faculty from ASU East, Main and West               (see Task Force Roster at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/provost/ap/">www.asu.edu/provost/ap/</a>).               The Task Force received its charge from the Office of the Provost               (see Charge at www.asu.edu/provost/ap/).</p>            <p> Specifically, the committee was to:</p>            <p>1) clarify the distinctions between continuing status and tenure               and make recommendations about the appointment options for academic               professionals;</p>            <p>2) delineate the range of performance expectations for academic               professionals and clarify the criteria for appointments to continuing               status and probationary versus year-to-year tracks;</p>            <p>3) recommend specific ways in which ASU could improve its policies               and procedures governing review for promotion and continuing status;</p>            <p>4) recommend ways in which ASU could create an all-university Promotion               and Continuing Status review process; and,<br>              <br>              5) make other recommendations about academic professional status.</p>            <h2><br>              <strong>Introduction</strong></h2>            <p>Academic professionals at Arizona State University typically hold               an advanced degree and have acquired a high level of expertise.               They actively engage in activities that significantly impact the               institution&#8217;s tripartite mission: education; the creation               and dissemination of knowledge; and external embeddedness.</p>            <p>Academic professionals support the mission of the University through               the application of their specialized training, skill, and knowledge.               Through professional contributions that expand the knowledge base               in their disciplines, APs enhance the reputation of the University.               Whereas some academic professionals engage in classroom teaching,               generally the position descriptions of academic professionals emphasize               other responsibilities. The range of position categories for academic               professionals has proliferated over time such that a simple definition               is difficult to pinpoint. For example, some of the diverse position               titles include: Librarian, Administrative Professional, Research               Professional, Fine Arts Specialist, Museum Professional, Archivist,               Academic Associate, Research Scientist, and Research Engineer. (See               Appendix D for a complete list of AP titles) Additionally, academic               professionals increase the university&#8217;s functionality by fulfilling               myriad service roles within the university, the community, and professional               organizations.</p>            <p>Because the academic professional employment category is so diverse,               over time its clarity has become convoluted. On one hand, it has               provided hiring flexibility that has helped move ASU closer to its               goals in some areas. On the other hand, due to the broad range of               positions aggregated into the category, the category has lost focus               and is not broadly understood. Historically, provisions of the category               have been misunderstood. In some cases, management decisions may               not have been well informed; and in other cases, benign neglect               has proliferated misuse of the employment category. One goal of               this Task Force is to provide information that clarifies understanding               of the AP category. Another goal is to make strong recommendations               regarding appointment and evaluation options so that the mission               of the University is better served through its APs.</p>            <p><br>              <strong>Guiding Principles for Determining Academic Professional               Status and Rank</strong></p>            <p>The Task Force articulated and was guided by the following principles:</p>            <ol>              <li>That ASU should recruit and retain the best qualified individual                 for the position.</li>              <li>That ASU should recognize that continuity and stability are                 important features of conducting institutional research, instructional                 programs, and institutional mission.</li>              <li>That ASU should strive to stay competitive with peer institutions                 and the business community and respond appropriately to market                 forces.</li>              <li>That ASU should anticipate the lifecycle of a project/program,                 and identify expertise required during the lifecycle.</li>              <li>That ASU&#8217;s tripartite mission should guide the recruitment                 of academic professionals, just as it does for faculty ranks.</li>              <li>That ASU should offer options that the best academic professional                 candidates view as attractive for their career progression.<br>              </li>            </ol>            <p><strong>Charge #1: Clarify the distinctions between continuing               status and tenure, conduct research on employment options for individuals               with positions similar to our AP positions at peer institutions,               and make recommendations about the appointment options for AP&#8217;s               at ASU (e.g., do we need to create the option for multiple year               appointments; do we have a strong rationale for appointments with               continuing status?).</strong></p>            <p><strong>Distinguishing Between Continuing Status and Tenure</strong></p>            <p>The Arizona Board of Regents (&#8220;ABOR&#8221;) is the governing               body for the three state universities in Arizona. ABOR policy defines               tenure as an employment status awarded to faculty members by the               president on the basis of demonstrated excellence in teaching, research               and service. Once received, tenure creates a legitimate claim of               entitlement to continued employment, unless the tenured faculty               member resigns, retires or is subject to release or dismissal by               the university. ABOR policy defines continuing status as an employment               status that, once awarded to academic professionals by the president,               creates an expectation that the president will renew employment               for successive appointment periods, unless the academic professional               retires, resigns, or is subject to release or dismissal by the university.<br>              Arizona Board of Regents policy 6-201, Conditions of Faculty Service;<br>              Arizona Board of Regents policy 6-301, Conditions of Professional               Service</p>            <p>ABOR&#8217;s distinctions between the definitions are:<br>              1) A stated standard of excellence in the criteria of teaching,               research and service is required for tenure; a standard of excellence               is required for continuing status as well, although the criteria               and performance categories are not stated in ABOR policy for continuing               status. However, university policies require academic professionals               to meet the standard of excellence in the categories of performance,               professional development/contribution and service to receive continuing               status. The continuing status review must be based on unit-developed               criteria and proceed through the same multi-level peer-review process               that is akin to the tenure review process.</p>            <p> 2) Tenure creates an entitlement or legal, contractual right to               continued employment for faculty, absent the stated bases for severance.               Continuing status creates an expectation of renewal for successive               periods, which is not equivalent to an entitlement and is not synonymous               with permanent employment. ABOR policy provides the same rights               and requires the same due process procedures for tenured faculty               and continuing status academic professionals prior to termination               for cause or release for reorganization. Although by definition,               tenure creates a stronger right, once tenure or continuing status               is awarded, the deprivation of either status requires similar treatment,               protections, cause, and process.</p>            <p>Generally, courts have addressed tenure as the means to assure               academic freedom, which is the freedom needed by the institution               to pursue its educational goals without undue intervention by government               and the freedom required by faculty to pursue their research goals               and teaching activities without undue interference or censorship               by the institution. The American Association of University Professors               (&#8220;AAUP&#8221;) discusses tenure as a means to two ends, to               assure the faculty member&#8217;s freedom in teaching, research               and extracurricular activities and to provide sufficient economic               security to make the professions attractive to competent individuals.               ABOR&#8217;s academic freedom policy applies to faculty and academic               professionals who teach or conduct research. ASU&#8217;s academic               freedom policy applies to faculty and academic professionals.</p>            <p>The Task Force supports continuing status for academic professionals               and recognizes the need for consistent standards, criteria and review               process with appointment options, including year-to-year, multiple-year               and continuing status contracts.</p>            <p><br>              <strong>Peer Institution Research on Position Classifications Similar               to ASU Academic Professional Positions</strong></p>            <p>A sub-group of the Academic Professional Task Force conducted a               series of informal surveys of ASU peer institutions to determine               the employment status of individuals with job responsibilities similar               to those performed by ASU academic professionals. The surveys were               conducted by telephone interview, e-mail, and visits to peer institution               web-sites. </p>            <p>The surveyed ASU academic professional job titles fall into one               of four general categories: Information &amp; Materials Management,               Research, Pedagogy, and Support. Due to a wide variation in position               nomenclature and distribution of responsibilities among ASU peer               institutions, it was difficult to identify one-to-one job title               equivalencies. However, in the majority of cases, our peer institutions               provide a category of academic appointment in addition to faculty               and classified staff. </p>            <p></p>            <p><strong>Peer Data: Information &amp; Materials Management Positions</strong></p>            <p>Within the Information &amp; Materials Management category, Librarians               comprise the largest single group of academic professionals. Librarians               hold faculty status (with eligibility for tenure) among ten of ASU&#8217;s               fifteen peer institutions, while librarians at the remaining five               peer institutions hold an academic appointment similar to ASU&#8217;s               academic professionals. Academic status at these peer institutions               often includes many of the same rights and privileges as experienced               by ASU academic professionals, including the equivalent of continuing               appointment, eligibility for sabbatical leave, academic senate representation,               and the protections of intellectual and academic freedom policies.               (<a href="#appendices">See Appendix A for Library peer data and               Appendix B for peer information on Museum Professionals</a>)</p>            <p></p>            <p><strong>Peer Data: Research Positions</strong> </p>            <p>The Research category includes Research Scientist, Research Engineer,               Research Administrator, Research Professional and Research Technologist.               Most of the Research Scientist/Engineer positions fall under the               categories of professional or academic staff and have year-to-year,               multi-year or continuing appointments. Many institutions did not               have Research Scientist/Engineer equivalent positions. Most of the               Research Professional positions fall under the categories of professional               or classified staff and have year-to-year, multi-year or continuing               appointments. Most of the Research Technologist positions fall under               the categories of professional or classified staff and have year-to-year,               multi-year or continuing appointments. The data on the Research               Administrator position is very weak because most of the people contacted               at peer institutions were uncertain about identifying similar positions               in their institution.</p>            <p>It is clear from this survey that the functions performed by research               based academic professionals can be achieved with many models. However,               the difficulty in comparing jobs across peer institutions makes               it difficult to obtain a high quality comprehensive data set. Consequently               we are not able to determine which model may be the most effective               for research based APs. (See <a href="#appendices">Appendix C</a>)             </p>            <p><strong>Peer Data: Pedagogy Positions</strong></p>            <p>APs in this category include Administrative Professionals, Clinical               Professionals, Fine Arts Specialists, and Instructional Professionals.               While the number of positions ranges across university units, most               are in the College of Law. To assess the status of instructional               and clinical professionals, the existing data on clinical programs               in United States law schools was evaluated and an informal inquiry               among some of the country&#8217;s top legal clinical educators was               conducted. Unfortunately, the national data on legal clinical educators               is sketchy and inconclusive. However, anecdotal data, including               accounts from experienced, nationally-respected clinical educators               indicates that schools offering tenure track status and the faculty               culture engendered by a unified system have an extraordinary hiring               advantage over schools with non-tenure track positions. The survey               data strongly suggest that in order to attract and retain excellent               candidates for open positions, ASU must preserve the employment               stability offered to APs in pedagogical positions. (See <a href="#appendices">Appendix               D</a> for a list of position titles at ASU within the Academic Professional               category, including Pedagogy) </p>            <p><strong>Peer Data: Academic Support Positions</strong></p>            <p>Seven ASU peer institutions were surveyed. At all seven peer institutions,               academic advisors are either faculty or another form of academic               appointment. In addition to year-to-year appointments, three of               the peer institutions offer an optional &quot;career status&quot;               for non-faculty academic/professional appointments. Faculty positions               offer tenure-track appointments, academic senate representation,               sabbatical leave, and the protections of academic freedom. (See               <a href="#appendices">Appendix E</a>)</p>            <p><strong>Task Force Recommendations for AP Employment Options</strong></p>            <p>The Task Force recommends maintaining the options for probationary/continuing               status and year-to-year appointments. In addition, we recommend               establishing an additional option for academic professional appointments               beyond continuing status and year-to-year. We recommend a multiple               year appointment option, with the additional option of a rolling               appointment period. We think having these three options will allow               greater flexibility in hiring the caliber of expertise needed over               time. The improved stability of employment offered by a multi-year               appointment provides an incentive commensurate with the level of               expertise and enhances our ability to compete in the marketplace.               The task force developed a matrix of guidelines to be considered               when hiring an AP on a continuing status track, a multiple-year               track, and a year-to-year track. (See <a href="#appendices">Appendix               F</a>) </p>            <p><br>              <strong>Charge #2: Delineate the range of performance expectations               for Academic Professionals, and clarify the criteria for appointments               to continuing status and probationary versus year-to-year tracks.               </strong></p>            <p>The Task Force has delineated the criteria for establishing <strong>probationary/continuing               status</strong>, <strong>multiple year</strong>, and <strong>year-to-year</strong>               academic professional appointments below. In all cases it is critical               that the department/unit fully articulate the type of academic work               to be done; the criteria for appointment; the written position description               and performance expectations; the evaluation and review process;               and, the salary range. It is also recognized that updating of the               position description is likely to occur over time, reflecting evolution               in unit goals and priorities. (See <a href="#appendices">Appendix               F</a>)</p>            <p><strong>Criteria for Making Academic Professional Appointments</strong></p>            <p><strong>Probationary/Continuing Status Appointments</strong></p>            <p>Probationary/continuing status appointments are generally made               for the following reasons:</p>            <ol>              <li>the need for high level or unique, critical expertise, along                 with the need for long-term institutional commitment to ensure                 continuity; <strong>and</strong></li>              <li>prevailing market forces require the kind of sustained stability                 of employment continuing status offers; <strong>and</strong></li>              <li>an expectation exists that the academic professional will participate,                 long-term, in advancing the mission of the university and/or discipline                 through his/her academic expertise, with position effectiveness,                 professional contributions and institutional and professional                 service.</li>            </ol>            <p>The department/unit guidelines articulate individual and unit standards               for continuing status review, as well as the post-continuing status               review process. Excellence in position effectiveness, professional               contributions, and service are expectations and are benchmarks by               which the quality of contributions for academic professionals who               seek or hold continuing status or who hold multi-year contracts               can be measured. There is an obligation for a continuing source               of funding when hiring an AP into a probationary/continuing status               position. There is no term limit for an employee with continuing               status.</p>            <p><strong>Multiple Year Appointments with the Possibility of Rolling               Appointment Periods</strong></p>            <p>Multiple-year appointments are generally made for one or more of               the following reasons:</p>            <ol>              <li> to provide appropriate expertise and unit support that is more                 than one year in duration; or</li>              <li> to provide appropriate expertise for a grant/contract funded                 project; or</li>              <li> to provide department/unit with flexibility within market forces;                 or</li>              <li> to enhance national recruitment efforts.</li>            </ol>            <p><strong>Year-to-Year Appointments</strong></p>            <p>Year-to-year appointments generally are made for one or more of               the following reasons:</p>            <ol>              <li>to address a short-term academic need; or</li>              <li>to assume responsibility for a limited activity; or</li>              <li>to provide department/unit flexibility.</li>            </ol>            <p></p>            <p><strong>Charge #3: Identify, evaluate, and recommend specific ways               in which ASU can improve its policies and procedures governing review               for promotion and continuing status; include suggestions for better               documentation of P&amp;CS cases.

Guidelines at each administrative level articulate               the make-up of the peer review committee, with the following stipulations:</p>            <ul>              <li>Peer review committees must consist of at least three members.</li>              <li>Below the university level evaluation, all members of peer review                 committees and all administrative reviewers must be from within                 ASU.</li>              <li>Guidelines and procedures for establishing peer review committees                 must be developed and approved by appropriate governance processes                 within each unit. </li>            </ul>            <p>Ideally, peer review committees consist of academic professionals,               on continuing appointment, from within the same administrative structure.               In those units with few academic professionals, however, unit guidelines               may allow for greater flexibility in the configuration of peer review               committees. Such units may allow peer review committees to include               individuals from other units, or from other employment categories.</p>            <p><strong>Review Process Standards for APs Seeking to Achieve Continuing               Status</strong></p>            <p>The Task Force recommends that all departments/units be required               to establish a documented process for AP probationary and continuing               appointment reviews. These documents should be reviewed by the appropriate               college on a regular basis. We recommend that there be broad dissemination               to all university departments/units regarding the documentation               required for an AP position. Departments/units should be aware of               the documentation requirements prior to hiring an AP. When making               multi-year appointments, the criteria for renewing (rolling) must               be pre-determined. The criteria for performance and review/continuance               must be shared and made clear to any category of AP hired, at the               time of the hire. Standards by which an academic professional is               evaluated for continuing status include position effectiveness,               professional contributions, and service.</p>            <p><strong>Position Effectiveness</strong></p>            <p>Each academic professional will have position expectations dependent               upon the unit&#8217;s mission, stature, and goals. Excellence is               achieved in the context of the department/unit in which the academic               professional works. Standards for performance include:</p>            <ol>              <li>Effective and continuous accomplishments which relate to the                 missions of the department/unit and university;</li>              <li>Effective accommodation of change in the position or environment                 in which the individual has worked during the period under review;</li>              <li>Contributions to organizational goals and objectives;</li>              <li>Innovation and creativity in professional practices;</li>              <li>Continuing growth in one&#8217;s position and professional expertise;</li>              <li>Application of professional standards and practices; and</li>              <li>Knowledge and application of professional standards, guidelines                 and protocols.</li>            </ol>            <p>Each academic professional&#8217;s expected contribution to the               mission and goals of the department/unit and university is specifically               defined in the individual position description. An academic professional               is effective in her/his position when s/he sustains and enhances               these mission and goals.</p>            <p><strong>Professional Contributions</strong></p>            <p>Professional contributions of an academic professional are those               activities associated with the dissemination of the results of his/her               creative activity and professional expertise. Such activities include               publication in appropriate journals; presentations at scholarly               meetings; efforts to transfer techniques and practices resulting               from creative activity at ASU to other institutions; organization               of conferences or other scholarly meetings; providing consultations               and evaluations drawing on the person&#8217;s expertise; and research,               teaching, leadership, management or administration roles within               the individual&#8217;s specialty beyond those stated in the position               description for the individual.</p>            <p>The individual&#8217;s role in these activities is important in               evaluating these contributions. The individual&#8217;s contributions               should be more than simple participation and more than a collection               of random efforts. The contributions should reflect an active, directed               pursuit of goals that impact and advance the practice and scholarship               with the individual&#8217;s field.</p>            <p><strong>Institutional and Professional Service</strong></p>            <p>Academic professionals with continuing or probationary appointments               are to actively <br>              serve the institution, the profession, and the community. Service               of academic professionals is characterized by the application of               subject knowledge and professional expertise beyond the scope of               assigned responsibilities.</p>            <p>Service includes such activities as unit search committees, roles               in shared governance, contributions to campus committees, and/or               similar activities within professional organizations. Service may               also include community activities that draw upon professional expertise               or subject knowledge and/or advance the University by meeting the               needs of the greater public. Unit guidelines outline the elements               contained within each of these three criteria (in units with only               one or a few AP&#8217;s, these may be incorporated into the position               description). Guidelines include indicators for evaluating performance.</p>            <p><strong>Review Letters</strong></p>            <p>The purpose of letters of review is to contextualize the APs professional               contributions, both within the university and within the professional               discipline. Letters both internal and external to ASU should be               solicited; the percentage of external letters is proportionate to               the professional contributions area of the AP&#8217;s position description.               Unit guidelines determine this proportionality; however, at a minimum,               three letters must be external to ASU.</p>            <p>Academic units, in consultation with the college, have primary               responsibility to procure letters from external experts to evaluate               the candidate&#8217;s accomplishments. The unit should procure no               fewer than four and no more than ten letters for use in all levels               of each promotion and continuing status review. Relevant information               about the candidate the unit, the criteria for promotion and continuing               status, and the continuing status procedures should be sent to outside               experts for use in their reviews. For the internal process, the               unit should carefully explain and document each reviewer&#8217;s               expertise and relevance for the case. Candidates will be asked to               suggest reviewers, but the administration of the unit has the ultimate               responsibility for identifying a selection of strong reviewers.               In consultation with the unit, the dean of the candidate&#8217;s               college/ approves the choice of outside reviewers. In instances               when a candidate believes that there may be conflicts of interest               with or unreasonable biases by certain persons, the candidate may               provide a written list of people s/he believes should be excluded               from consideration for review letters.</p>            <p>The procedures articulated in ASU&#8217;s ACD Manual regarding               the review process for probationary/continuing status appointed               APs seeking promotion should continue to be followed.</p>            <p><br>              <strong>Charge #4: Review and recommend ways in which ASU can create               an all-university Promotion and Continuing Status review process.               These recommendations should include attention to differences between               the current ACD manuals (i.e., ACD and ACDW) and how these might               be brought into alignment.</strong></p>            <p>We recommend establishing an All-University Promotion and Continuing               Status Review Committee.
