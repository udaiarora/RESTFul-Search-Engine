              Economic Benefits from Investment in University Based Research, 
              Development and Education</strong></a> (PDF file)<br>
              This paper examines universities, particularly major research universities, 
              as institutions engaged in integrated research, development<br>
              and education (RD&amp;E) activities. In surveying a range of literatures, 
              this paper identifies and characterizes the variety of channels<br>
              by which these institutions impact the regions in which they reside 
              and the strategies that may be employed to develop and exploit these 
              channels for regional economic development. </P>

              in Arizona&#8217;s Future</strong></a><strong><br>
              </strong>This briefing packet provides some background for Arizona 
              State University&#8217;s plans to enhance research capacity. Research 
              capacity has been pinpointed as the single most critical factor 
              in shaping regional economic success and, as United States Federal 
              Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has argued, investment in university 
              research structure is a key to building economic resiliency. </P>

              Board of Regents</a> (ABOR) policy initiative designed to build 
              a stronger state university system that is better positioned to 
              benefit the citizens of Arizona and make significant contributions 
              to the social, economic, and cultural viability of the state.</P>

                    &#8220;As we begin a new chapter in the history of this institution, 
                    I would like to look beyond its current success. I would like 
                    to talk to you about transformation, and the further evolution 
                    of the American research university&#8212;what I want to call 
                    the new American university&#8212;and why Arizona State University 
                    is uniquely positioned to become such an institution...&#8221;</P>
