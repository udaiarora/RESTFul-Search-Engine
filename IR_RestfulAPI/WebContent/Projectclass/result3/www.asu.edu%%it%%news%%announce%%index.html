			<strong>ASU Sets 180 Day Password Limit</strong><br />
			Increased concern for the safety of university data, personal information, and identity management has caused ASU to request more frequent replacement of ASURITE passwords. A 180-day time limit on ASURITE passwords has been set as a computing system standard for all ASU campuses. Faculty, staff and students are asked to act promptly to replace outdated passwords by using the Password Changer program (<a href="http://asu.edu/changepassword/">asu.edu/changepassword</a>).</p> 

<p>After Spring Break 2006, systems will check for last password change date.  Logins will be redirected to the Password Changer before services can be accessed. Some of the services that require ASURITE UserID login are myASU portal and ASU Interactive, Blackboard, EMMA, and WebAuth verified Web pages.</p> 

<p>In choosing new passwords/passphrases, customers are reminded to â??mix it up 4 waysâ?? They should create non-word combinations that are difficult to guess and use 8 to 14 characters from at least three of the following four groups: upper case letters, lower case letters, special characters, and numbers. The Password Changer will automatically verify whether the password meets the system criteria.</p> 

<p>For questions about the change, contact the <a href="http://asu.edu/helpdesk/">IT Help Desk</a> at 480-965-6500 or <a href="http://www.asu.edu/askit/">www.asu.edu/askit</a>.</p>

		<strong>Wireless Access Goes Campus-wide With Guest Access</strong><br />
Campus-wide wireless networking implementation is ongoing, with the next phase to be completed in February. All ASU campus locations (Tempe, West, Polytechnic) will have a new wireless network SSID (asupublic). This new ID will provide access for guests and ASU users. The new process does not require the MAC address registration that is currently in place but systems are checked once each day when they come on the wireless network for vulnerabilities. Guest users will be provided with Internet access. ASU users will have access to ASU resources and the Internet. Both usersâ?? types will be able to use VPN.  Select the wireless configuration as the asupublic network, then open a Web browser to log in. For questions contact the IT Help Desk at (480) 965-6500. More information is available at the <a href="http://asu.edu/wireless/">ASU Wireless Web page</a>. </p>

			<strong>IT Classrooms &amp; Sites Phasing Out Certain Software</strong><br />
The IT Computing Sites &amp; Classrooms are planning the removal of several Windows software packages after the Spring 2006 semester.  These removals are due to either very low usage of these programs or they are non-supported versions of the software. Faculty may send comments, questions or concerns to <a href="maito:ntsm@asu.edu">ntsm@asu.edu</a>. <strong>Please respond by Mar. 1, 2006</strong>. The following is a list of the software to be phased out and replacement or alternatives that are available.</p>

			<strong>ECG 150 To Close Permanently</strong><br />
It has been determined that the ECG 150 computing site has been and continues to be under-utilized and therefore it will be permanently decommissioned at close of business on Wednesday, December 14, 2005.  Projections based on usage monitoring show the remaining IT Computing Sites (BAC 16, CPCOM 102, COOR 150 and GWC 185) can absorb ECG 150 usage patterns without having a negative impact.   The closure of ECG 150 will allow Information Technology to direct its improvement efforts to these sites and provide the necessary space for emerging projects.  Customers are asked to plan on using one of the other four computing sites after Fall Semester 2005.</p>

			<strong>Incoming Mail Delivery Delayed</strong><br />
During the week of Monday, September 29, 2005, some e-mail originating from outside of <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> and destined for ASU users was delayed.  The exact amount of time a message was delayed depended on when the message was originally sent and where the message was sent from.  During that time period, some servers attempting to deliver e-mail to ASU were temporarily unable to do so, but kept trying to deliver the e-mail according to a schedule defined at those servers. Consequently, a  backlog of e-mail destined for ASU built up on servers across the Internet.</p>

<p>The problems experienced by the servers sending e-mail were due to capacity issues on ASUâ??s Post Office servers. Information Technology addressed the situation by increasing capacity on the existing servers and adding more machines to the bank of Post Office servers.  This immediately allowed more traffic to flow through the Post Office infrastructure, however due to the backlog previously created, e-mail delivery times did not return to normal right away.   Once the backlog subsided, e-mail delivery returned to normal.</p>

			    <strong>Retirement Of Old Research&#47;<abbr title="statistics">Stats</abbr> Cluster Imminent</strong><br />
				As previously announced, current generation Red Hat Linux systems were made available as replacement systems for the <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>-provided <acronym title="Advanced Interactive Executive">AIX</acronym> Unix RESEARCH cluster. September month-end was also suggested as a retirement date for the old RESEARCH cluster.</p>

<p>As a reminder, a few years ago the STATS cluster was merged with the RESEARCH cluster onto AIX Unix platforms. These AIX platforms have since become outdated and have been replaced with new systems running Red Hat Linux. Concurrent with the upgrade, the combined cluster has again been split into separate RESEARCH and STATS clusters.</p>

<p>The new RESEARCH cluster is accessed by secure shelling to research.asu.edu; the new STATS cluster is accessed by secure shelling to stats.asu.edu; and the old RESEARCH&#47;STATS cluster is accessed by secure shelling to research3.asu.edu, research4.asu.edu, or research5.asu.edu.</p>

<p>IT desires to retire the old RESEARCH&#47;STATS cluster (research3, research4, or research5) if it is no longer needed. If anyone still needs to use the old cluster, please contact James Carvalho (<a href="mailto:jjc@asu.edu">jjc@asu.edu</a>, 480-965-0027), Dale Wutz (<a href="mailto:dale.wutz@asu.edu">dale.wutz@asu.edu</a>, 480-965-2761), or Eldon Norton (<a href="mailto:eldon.norton@asu.edu">eldon.norton@asu.edu</a>, 480-965-5617).</p>

Strong passwords are a minimum of 8 characters long, and include one character from any three of the following: upper case letters, lower case letters, numerals, and special characters. A change of password at least every six months is recommended and will eventually become a system requirement. For assistance or questions, contact the IT Help Desk at (480) 965-6500 or <a href="http://www.asu.edu/askit/">www.asu.edu/askit</a>.</p>

			<strong>Wireless Users Have New Login</strong><br />
			Beginning Jan. 9 campus wireless users will see a new logon process when connecting to ASU's computing network in 
			selected areas of Tempe Campus. The computer owner will open a Web browser and complete an automatic safety scan before being connected to the network. A MAC address registration will not be needed for connection. Guest users will have access limited to selected VPN service, and HTTP and HTTPS Web browsing. This is a pilot program for the rollout of university-wide wireless Internet coverage. Areas on campus still covered by existing wireless access will continue to be accessible only with computers with registered MAC addresses. Signage will be posted in the locations where the pilot program is underway: the current indoor and outdoor wireless areas for the Memorial Union, Hayden Library, W.P. Carey School of Business (BA/BAC), and Administration A and B. Contact the IT Help Desk with questions at 480.965.6500.</p>

                <strong>Academic Scheduling Joins IT </strong><br />
  			ASUâ??s Academic Scheduling office, formerly in Facilities Management, has joined IT. The office has been renamed University Classroom Scheduling. It joins Classroom Support as the second unit within the Office of Classroom Management, which is the new name for Student Computing Services. The change is expected to enhance service by combining the efforts of two groups that have been working together for some time. The University Classroom Scheduling staff now reports to Manager Sarah Hughes (CTC). They will be moving to their new offices in the Computing Commons building in early 2005.</p>

                  <strong>Sasser Worm & Microsoft Security Patches</strong><br />
                  This weekend a new virus/worm was released onto the Internet 
                  called Sasser. This worm does not require an email to be sent 
                  nor opened on the target machine to infect. The only requirement 
                  for infection is that the target machine does not have the latest 
                  Microsoft patches installed. The worm does not have a harmful 
                  payload but will require significant time to remove.</p>
