                  <p align="left">Strategic Planning will begin in January. Jack and Suzanne Pfister will facilitate. Sherrie will send out a SWOT analysis to the library and she requests that it be returned by January 6<sup>th</sup> as an attachment to email.

                  <p align="left">In response to a question about further budget cuts, the Dean noted that the special session of the state legislature dealt with the first half of the current budget situation and will now deal with the second half of the shortfall.</p>
                  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">Linda Shackle reported that a student inquired about the library being open 24 hours. He indicated that he thought that money had been made available for this purpose. It was unclear what source of funds the student was referring to. Sherrie responded that frequently students request that the library be open 24 hours and that it would cost $100,000-$200,000 to keep Hayden and Noble library open without reference services.</p>

                  <div align="left">
                    <h3>Research and Professional Development Committee &ndash; Lucy Lyons </h3>
                  </div>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p align="left" class="MsoNormal">Lucy reported on the status of the Research Funds: 1) the first deadline has passed and one application was received and awarded, 2) two-thirds of the funds remain and 3) the second deadline is January 10, 2003. All librarians are encouraged to apply for this funding.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="MsoNormal">Lucy also reported on the Travel Funds. About $900 has been returned and anyone who has not yet applied was encouraged to do so. There was $54,000 provided for travel this year and $54,013 was distributed to approximately 55 people for 77 trips. </p>
                    <p align="left" class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">The RPCD assigned different maximum amounts of funding to classified staff than that given to academic professionals, a move praised by the Executive Committee and the Dean. The RPDC considered a number of aspects when determining the allocation of funding, including: (1) the greater pressure on AP&rsquo;s than on classified staff to engage in professional development; (2) the greater number of AP travel requests than classified staff requests; and (3) the greater number of requests per AP.&nbsp; The average librarian request is almost twice as high as the average staff request. It was noted that all the&nbsp; variables together have resulted in higher out of pocket expenses for each incidence of travel by an AP. In FY03, even though the staff allocations will be less than professional staff allocations, the average out-of-pocket expense for classified staff will be less than half of the expense of academic professionals. The final consideration in creating differential allocations (4) is the need to justify travel expenditures in times of a tight university budget.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p align="left" class="MsoBodyText">The committee is developing a manual of written procedures to provide some guidance for future decisions regarding the distribution of travel funds. In addition, the committee is proposing new forms, one for academic professionals, and one for classified staff. The university is in a difficult financial situation and accountability is important in order to defend the provision of travel funds. The new form is designed to assist academic professionals in describing the need for travel. The form is the same as the current form except that it includes wording from the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook to assist the applicant in describing the reason for travel. The form for the classified staff also includes the wording from the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook to assist the applicant in describing the reason for travel. In addition, it contains a provision for the supervisor&rsquo;s signature and a statement of support from the supervisor of the applicant. This enhanced application form will assist the RPCD in deciding if the travel is for professional development or if it is for job training, since funding for job training is provided from a different source. </p>
                    <p align="left" class="MsoNormal">The forms and the relevant language changes in the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook will be presented under new business.</p>

                  <h2>VI. New Business </h2>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>                  The following changes to the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook were proposed. These will be voted on at the next Librarians&rsquo; Council meeting.

                                      <blockquote>                      Revision to Librarians&rsquo; Handbook G.1.2: Supplementary EvaluationThis change removes &ldquo;Instruction&rdquo; from the Supplementary Evaluations. Sherrie asked if this means that there would be no evaluation for instruction. Scott responded that comments regarding instruction would be given to the Primary Evaluator. Scott also stated that MSEs for instruction haven&rsquo;t been done since there ceased to be a separate Instruction Department. In addition, when Librarians&rsquo; Council previously discussed the MSEs, there was much support for eliminating the MSE for Instruction and to revisit the MSE for Collection Development. Today&rsquo;s treatment separates the MSE for Instruction from the MSE for Collection Development. </blockquote>

                        <p align="left" class="Section1">There was further discussion on the need and benefit of professional development for both librarians and classified staff, and the importance of writing a compelling argument on the application form. A number of members commented on the need for professional development by both beginning librarians and more experienced librarians. Betsy Redman pointed out the need to continue to support professional development for all levels, even for those not yet on committees. She also gave examples of classified staff who need to attend the conferences in their areas. There was more discussion on the funding of these activities. It was pointed out the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook does not discuss what professional development is for classified staff and only mentions classified staff at all with regard to funding for travel. In addition, activities that are job training can be funded by administrative funds. Sherrie stated that if an activity is job related the applicant could request administrative funds. Also, if the RPDC finds that they cannot fund a given person in a given year, as long as there are not too many, there is another source of funding. </p>
