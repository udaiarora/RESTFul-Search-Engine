<h3><center>Compiling uni-REXX scripts</center></h3>

<p>A uni-REXX script (program) may be compiled into either intermediate 
code or binary executable code. The compiler automatically sets the 
execute permission on the output file.</p>

<p>If the script is not compiled, the uni-REXX interpreter (rxx) 
compiles the script into intermediate code and then interprets 
(executes) the intermediate code.</p>

<p>If the script is already compiled into intermediate code then rxx 
immediately begins execution of the intermediate code, i.e., the compile 
phase is bypassed. REXX scripts which are going to executed often, 
especially those which are large, are appropriate for compilation into 
intermediate code. Note: rxx must be available at execution time.</p>

<p>If the script is already compiled into binary executable code, rxx is 
not required at execution time. The two primary advantages are 1) the 
compiled script can be run on systems which do not have uni-REXX and 2) 
the compiled script does not "use up" a license on systems which do have 
uni-REXX installed. The disadvantage is a substantially larger file 
since signficant portions of the interpreter are included in each binary 
executable. Note: A binary executable can run only on another platform 
similar to that on which it was compiled; e.g., if the binary executable 
is compiled on an HP system, it can be executed on another HP system but 
not on an SGI system.</p>

<p>Either of the following commands can be used to compile a REXX 
program. The first compiles into intermediate code; the second compiles 
into binary executable code.</p>

<blockquote><code>
rxc filename[.extension]<br>
rxc -m filename[.extension]
</code></blockquote>

<p>If the extension is omitted, ".rex" is assumed. Source programs 
<em>must</em> have extensions. The output of rxc is a file named 
"filename" without the extension.</p>

<p>To create a binary executable, the environment variable 
<em>REXXLIB</em> must be defined at compile time. The value of the 
envirionment variable must be the directory containing the uni-REXX 
archive library, "librx.a". The compiler locates the library through the 
environment variable; therefore, REXXLIB must be defined before issuing 
the "rxc -m" command.</p>

<p>The following illustrates setting of the environment variable in the 
Korn shell; the archive library is assumed to be in the directory 
"/usr/local/lib".</p>

<blockquote><code>
export REXXLIB=/usr/local/lib
</code></blockquote>
