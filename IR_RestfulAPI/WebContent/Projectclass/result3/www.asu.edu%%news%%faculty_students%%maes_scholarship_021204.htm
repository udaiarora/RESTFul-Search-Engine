      <h2>ASU students win MAES scholarships at 2003 international symposium </h2>
      <p>Like many high school juniors and seniors, Joel Polanco was not quite sure what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. Now, as a graduate student in industrial engineering in ASU's Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, he credits the Society of Mexican American Engineers and Scientists (MAES) outreach programs for giving him direction. </p>
      <p>When he was a senior in high school in his home town of El Paso, Texas, Polanco says, "the MAES program came to my high school with interesting science projects, it opened my eyes to engineering and all that I could accomplish through it." </p>
      <p>Now, Polanco isn't just a successful graduate student, he is also a student leader, co-founding the ASU MAES student chapter in 2002 and representing ASU in the MAES' 2003 International Symposium and Career Fair held in Phoenix last October. </p>
      <p>Polanco and three other Fulton School of Engineering students were recognized at the MAES symposium with scholarships ranging from $1,000 to $3,000. The other students recognized include Jose Benavides, a junior in electrical engineering and current president of the student chapter; Adrianna Valle, a junior in civil engineering; and Brenda Flores, a junior in biology in society. </p>
      <p>All are part of ASU's MAES student chapter on campus. Polanco was honored with the highest distinction the society bestows upon students, the Padrino (mentor) Scholarship, which includes a mentor from a professional chapter to encourage and lead Polanco. </p>
      <p>This was the first year the students attended the symposium as an organized chapter. They formed the chapter at ASU in the spring of 2002 after attending and being inspired by the 2002 symposium. It was their leadership that encouraged a professional chapter to develop in Phoenix as well. The student chapter already has approximately 20 members who actively participate in local community service and K-12 outreach programs. </p>
      <p>One of those programs is the Science Extravaganza, which is currently being planned for the spring semester. The program consists of MAES members preparing hands-on science and engineering activities for high school students, and teaching and encouraging them in those fields. </p>
      <p>This is the same type of outreach program that encouraged Polanco to pursue an engineering degree. "It's programs like these that tell minority kids they can go to college, they can study science, and that it is an option for them. It definitely helped me choose the right path for myself," says Polanco. </p>
      <p>The symposium was the first to be held in Phoenix and included five days of events at the Phoenix Civic Plaza. "It was so exciting to be given recognition for our work and to be hosting the symposium," says Benavides. "It was wonderful to have such great representation at the event in Phoenix." </p>
