      <h2>Fulton excels on football field, in life</h2>
      <p>On the field, starting Sun Devil
          wide receiver Skyler Fulton is known for making big plays. Off the
        field, this ASU senior majoring
              in elementary
          education is known for making a difference.</p>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/fulton_120803.jpg" width="288" height="195" align="right">"I feel good about what I
          accomplish in football," Fulton says. "But I am even more proud of
        things that I am able to accomplish away from
          sports." </p>
      <p>Fulton stays busy with team practices, meetings, games, classes,
          homework, tests and student teaching. And he still finds time for babysitting
          three
          days a week.<br>
        Even with his hectic schedule, Fulton still maintains at 3.32 grade-point
          average. For the second year in a row, Fulton has been awarded a spot
          on the Pacific-10 All-Academic Football Team. </p>
      <p>When it comes to success,
          whether academic, athletic or in his personal life, he says it's all
          about maintaining priorities and working hard.
          Fulton learned these values from his parents while growing up in Olympia,
          Wash. </p>
      <p>"Without the many positive influences in my life I wouldn't be
          here today," Fulton says. "I want to be a positive influence in the
        lives of young
          people." <br>
        Fulton says he was raised to appreciate the importance of friends,
          family and community. </p>
      <p>"My parents taught my brothers and I that life is about
          how you treat other people," Fulton says. "As long as you are honest
          with yourself
          and others everything else will take care of itself."</p>
      <p>He grew up excelling
          in both baseball and football, but says his parents taught him to be
          well rounded and to give by working with others. Fulton
          says he considers teaching the ultimate chance to give back. </p>
      <p>"I want
          to help kids believe that they are worth something and that they can
          be something, even if nobody in their family, or that they know,
          ever has," he says. "Teaching provides a chance to give kids confidence.
          It's important to be something positive in their lives."</p>
      <p>He is currently
          in the third block of the education program, and is preparing to student
          teach this spring at Webster Elementary School in a second
          grade classroom.</p>
      <p>"I am really looking forward to it," he says. "I really
          just enjoy spending time with the kids. After ASU I plan on playing
        ball for a while, but
          I also plan on teaching and coaching. It is going to be in my future
          for sure." </p>
      <p>His favorite teaching assignment is babysitting a cute little
          one-year-old named Malik, who is the son of Fulton's good friend, Sun
          Devil Defensive
          End Jimmy Verdon and his wife Fran.</p>
      <p>Fulton describes little Malik as "awesome"
          and says babysitting him is a total blast.<br>
        "Malik is such a happy baby, it is just a joy to watch him," Fulton
          says. "His parents Fran and Jimmy are great parents and they do a great
          job
          too. I am just glad that they let me be a part of their family."</p>
      <p>Fulton
          says that in order to have time to accomplish all the goals important
          to him, he has had to become sort of a time management expert.</p>
      <p>"I try
          to plan my days and get my school work done at the beginning of each
          week so toward the end I can begin to focus more on football," he
          says. "I don't really go out that much, but I hang out with my friends
          when I don't have homework or I'm not tired. I guess its just having
          your priorities straight."</p>
