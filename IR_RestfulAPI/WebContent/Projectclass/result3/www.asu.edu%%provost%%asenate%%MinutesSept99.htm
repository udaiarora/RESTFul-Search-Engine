<p><b>3.A. Senate President's Report </b>(David Burstein)<b>.</b>



<p>Senate President Burstein: Thank you all for finding this room. We hope



to be able to schedule our meetings in the Law College for spring, but



for the time being we will meet in this room (JWSCB 210).



<p>Welcome back to the semester. Several items are on our plate for the



semester. One is the implementation of the new intellectual property policy



that the Board of Regents passed. We are in the final stages of getting



the implementation of that policy into shape to present to the Academic



Senate for approval. While we cannot change the Regent's Intellectual Policy



itself, we can act as a Senate in terms of how we implement this policy



at our University. Since this is a policy that will effect all three campuses,



its implementation will have to be approved by the senates on all three



campuses.



<p>The Board of Regents wants us to look into what is called student-centered



or learner-centered education. At the Board of Regents meeting on September



23 at ASU, ASU will present on this issue. UofA and NAU have already presented



their views.



<p>The Board of Regents has taken on this year as one of its charges to



communicate better with the public in general and with the legislature



in particular.



<p>ASU's budget for this year, and next year, is basically flat. If we



are going to progress as a university, that will have to change. One of



the things I believe we will have to change is how the population as a



whole, and the legislature in particular, view the work of the faculty



and of the university in terms of our importance to the health of the state.



One of the things we can do to achieve that is to organize legislative



coffees where we can meet with our legislators. A number of you have already



given us your name, rank and social security number, so we can contact



you for the coffees as they are scheduled in your district. I would appreciate



it if you as senators would be sure to email us, if you have not already



done so, that information. In your faculty meetings, please emphasize this



to the faculty in your departments and in your schools. At the coffees,



which I attended last year, they (the legislators) got tired of seeing



the same faces. The more faculty, staff, and students that attend a coffee



held in their voting district, the better our message will get across to



those legislators to whom your vote counts.



<p>I distributed to each of you a special edition of the <i>Academic Senate



Newsletter</i>, which contains the results of interviews with the deans,



which I did as President-elect. I learned a lot about the university that



has helped me both as President-elect and as President. I would challenge



each of you to read about a dean, not of your college. I hope that you



will enjoy reading them as much as I enjoyed doing the interviews.



<p><b>3.B University Provost's Report </b>(Milton Glick).



<p>Provost Glick: Let me reinforce what David has said. I think the interviews



with the deans were extraordinarily rich, and they are well worth your



reading. It is a credit to David and to his predecessors who began this



process.



<p>Senate President Burstein mentioned the budget being flat. In fact,



we are filling holes right now, comparing our projected enrollment with



our actual enrollment. As some of you know, our graduate students are down



about 400 in number which means that undergraduates are up in number, or



we would be in an even bigger hole than we are.



<p>I would like to use my time before you this year in a different manner,



and try to spend 10-15 minutes exploring some particular issues in depth



that you may be interested in hearing about. I encourage you, if you feel



that I ought to be discussing an item with the Senate, that you send me



an email about it (<u>glick@asu.edu)</u>. That would be very helpful.



<p>Two weeks ago, I spent an hour or so with our new faculty; it is always



wonderful to meet with them when they are new to the university. They are



invigorated, they have new jobs, and we are reminded of the opportunities



as well that we have here to offer them. The last two years have been the



biggest hiring years in a decade at ASU. The next two years will not be



like this. Therefore, we should rejoice in this year, in making sure that



these faculty succeed.



<p>A word about our new student body. In 1992, we were down to 2800 freshmen



and we were becoming a transfer campus. We had 12,000 seniors at that time.



We made a strategic decision then to be the kind of university we believed



the state needed, and we wanted as well, to allow the campus culture to



evolve. We had 5,000 freshmen last year; President Coor then reset that



target to 6,000, and we will probably have 5,600 freshmen this year. More



important than numbers are the diversity and quality of that class. Regents



scholars (the top 5% of our Arizona high school classes) in 1980 were at



480, and this year we expect 850. The next 10% (from 5% - 15%) were at



450 five years ago, and today we are at 781. I hope you all had the opportunity



to read about our National Merit Scholars recently - ten years ago we had



6 in the freshmen class, 5 years ago we had 30, last year we had 49, this



year we have 139. That will place us in the top ten universities in the



country, and if we look at only public schools, we are in the top five



or six. I believe that this has implication for all students, because students



learn from students and, when you get a strong core, everything gets better.



Faculty treat students better when they have high expectation of their



abilities. At the same time, it puts the pressure on us as administrators



and faculty, because with a larger freshmen class, and more National Merit



and other high achievers, our ability to deliver what we promised is important.



We know we have to make sure that what we told the students they would



receive, they get.



<p>There will be a number of issues on the table this year. Last year with



the Senate's help we passed the new streamlining policy, which we believe,



will help students progress through the curriculum. It will be harder to



implement the policy than it was to pass on it. Every department of every



college will be looking through its curriculum and making decisions. Secondly,



with the Academic Senate's help, we intend to review and revise the campus



promotion and tenure policy this year, to make sure our policy is consistent



with our rhetoric. We have not done a serious revision of the promotion



and tenure policy for a decade. It is time and it is also right in line



with our effort to tell our story better (what we do and how we can be



more valuable to the state), particularly the story about research and



what it does for the state and society. We will also be looking currently



at our new Center for Teaching and Learning (which was the Faculty Development



Center). We have put Duane Roen in charge for one year, with the major



charge being to him to tell us what this program really ought to do--because



it is hard to recruit to the program when you don't know what it is.



<p>At the Regents level, there will be considerable dialogue going on about



geography in the state. As you may know, presently with the exception of



a few programs, such as graduate education, ASU's geographic territory



is the Valley of the Sun. NAU has been concerned about this for several



years, and I think that UofA now will also.



<p>I have asked a group to work on an Information Technology Certificate



or Concentration, not a Computer Science Degree, but a mechanism by which



students from across the campus can get four or five courses as a package;



it would make them more marketable, whatever their degree is.



<p>Last year we emphasized that in order to become the kind of university



we want to be, we need to leverage our funding through external grants.



We want to build grants that are multi-investigator, multi-department grants.



We have had some real success stories this year. The College of Education



under the leadership of Jim Middleton from Math and Science Ed., along



with faculty in Liberal Arts and Sciences and Engineering, has just received



a grant from the Department of Education of about 17 million dollars, to



work with the rest of the state in improving K-12 education in math and



science. That puts a big obligation on us, but it also is a great opportunity



to improve the success of students in the public schools, which is essential



to the future of this state and nation. The PRISM group just received a



2.5 million-dollar grant in the area of computer graphics. I was impressed



that the National Science Foundation this year brought on line a new competition



(grant) in integrative biology and bio-diversity. There were seven major



grants given across the country; two were awarded at ASU. That represents



a long history of excellence in policy in the environmental sciences here,



and to see that become mature is very exciting.



<p>Some of you may know that the Whittaker Foundation has funded a major



grant to our bioengineering unit which is part of Chem, Bio and Materials



Engineering, to create a Department of Bioengineering.



<p>I was also quite enthused with a recent article in the <i>New York Times</i>.



Half of the front page of the technology section was given up to a break-through



discovery by John Spence and colleagues, which could open an entire new



approach to dealing with molecular science.



<p>We will also be starting an Ethics Center whose purpose will be to create



ethics across the curriculum. We will find people in a variety of disciplines



and professions to hire that would make sure no matter what degree students



get at ASU, integrated into their courses will be ethics as an important



part of everyday life and every profession. You will see more of these



types of endeavors in the future. It is a tribute to the quality of our



faculty and the efforts they put forward, and our staff and students as



well. Even in the down budget years, which shouldn't have happened given



the prosperity within the state, we all need to take pride in what our



faculty, staff, and students have done, and figure out how we can tell



that story better, so that we can continue to grow as an institution of



quality. I appreciate your efforts that are represented here today.



<p>Senator O'Grady: Is it true that the sick leave policy has been approved?



<p>Provost Glick: Yes. This was important. We reported our progress at



every Senate meeting last year. The question was then: since our new state



sick leave policy says that you may cash in, up to a certain amount, half



of any accrued sickleave, and since faculty here had not accrued sickleave,



our faculty would have been denied a benefit that all other faculty and



all other employees of the state would have. It took a great deal of effort



on many people's parts, but in the end, a debt of gratitude went to the



Attorney General's Office because there had been some question as to whether



we could legally back-accrue sick leave hours. The Attorney General issued



a ruling that the Board of Regents did have the right to make the decision



to back-credit sick leave based on a formula which looked at how much sick



leave someone at NAU or UofA would have accrued during the same period



of time. So, we were able to deliver to our present retirees of last year,



and our future retirees, a benefit that could have been lost to them. You



should soon begin to see accrued sick leave on your paycheck stub.



<p>We put in a new scheduling system whose purpose was to utilize classroom



space more efficiently, as part of a Board of Regents mandate. We now we



are using our classrooms more efficiently. We do not know that we are using



them more effectively. I have asked that we be in contact with every single



department and find out what problems there were, so we can avoid doing



damage to effectiveness by seeking efficiency, because efficiency w/o effectiveness



is clearly a bad bargain. So, if you hear horror stories give them to David



Techau, or send them directly to Walter Harris, who Scheduling reports



to, or me, so we can make sure that we alleviate problems in the future.



<p>Senator Thieme: Faculty in my department now have to walk across campus,



and many people are inconvenienced in this way.



<p>Provost Glick: We have to understand and balance things, classroom utilization



against the problems of having to go all the way across campus when you



may have special materials that you need to teach. We need to understand



that better. I can't promise that we will solve all the inconvenience that



you have now, but I can promise that the complaints will be taken very



seriously, and we will try to improve on them. If there are other issues



that senators would like to discuss, please send them to me in an email.



<p>Senate President Burstein: In terms of the sick leave hours, I will



point out that on your paycheck this semester, in one of the upper boxes,



the number of hours you were accredited for sick leave appears. If you



did not notice it the first time, look for that next time. The formula



was .93 of what UofA and NAU averaged.



<p>Provost Glick: It is something like .9 times the gross number of days



you would accrue, because when we looked at NAU and UofA that was roughly



the translation. If you had more than fifteen hundred hours, your payout,



if you retire, will be at .5 for half of those hours, up to a cap of $30,000.



If you had between 1,000 and 1,500 hours, it is something like .4, up to



a cap of $30,000.



<p>Question: At how much per hour?



<p>Provost Glick: Whatever your retirement pay is. It is really a generous



benefit and it would have been unfortunate if our faculty lost it just



because in 1974, it was decided that we would not have accrued sick leave



hours for faculty.



<p>Senate President Burstein: What it means for any retiring faculty with



a reasonable salary at retirement and over 1,000 hours in sick leave--based



on a cap of $30,000--you would get $10,000 per year, from which they take



out the usual deductions.



<p>Provost Glick: If some of you are approaching retirement, you may well



be interested in more specific details, and I would urge you to talk to



Bob Frazier in the Office of Human Resources, who is extraordinarily knowledgeable



about state retirement.



<p>Senator Jacob: It might be a good idea to have a more detailed, general



publication put out to the faculty in that department.



<p>Senate President Burstein: We will not have it in the current newsletter,



but we will try to have it in the next one. I think that is a good suggestion.



<p><b>3.C ASASU President's Report </b>(Wyatt Smith for Jenny Holsman).



<p>First, thank you very much for wanting to hear about what student government



is doing. I would like to highlight a few activities that we are doing



this year. The first is the Teacher Evaluation Program. That is something



that is vital to us to complete this year. We have hired a new director



for that program, Jennifer Walker. This week we will be hiring two assistants



to help her. We plan to include 300 courses this semester, and in the spring



semester there will be 700 classes evaluated. One hundred to two hundred



of those will be general studies courses. Along with that, a computer program



will be written so students can go online and check it out. It will be



written with the data from the surveys taken in the classes. It will be



user-friendly for all students to access.



<p>We will have a Meet the Legislators night on October 20, from 7:00 p.m.



to 9:00 p.m. All the state representatives and the senators are invited



as well as the Arizona congressional delegation, the Secretary of State,



the Governor and her staff, the Tempe City Council, and all faculty and



staff are welcome to attend. That will be a good opportunity to interact



with legislators, especially the students and the legislators, as they



will lobby them later for tuition purposes.



<p>We would also like to invite the legislators back in the spring to participate



in a shadow day, where they can come onto campus and shadow a student and



see our student representatives making decisions about how the amount of



money allocated for our budget is redistributed for student programs.



<p>This weekend is the annual ASASU Retreat, which is an opportunity for



all the staff in the business office, as well as the elected and appointed



officers and volunteers to get together and formulate goals for this year.



Then we will be coming back to campus for the Faculty/Staff appreciation



day activities. I want to thank you all beforehand for the work that you



will be doing. We will be helping at the picnic on Saturday.



<p>A new program that Jenny Holsman developed, is the ASU Internship Program.



This program is different from the ASASU volunteer program in that it gives



students opportunities to have an experience in student government; they



will be paired with a mentor who is currently serving in this capacity.



For example, next year, if that same student runs for office they will



already know what is required of that position. The interviews for those



internships will be held in the near future.



<p>I want to speak to you a little about what ASASU stands for, what the



executive officers felt the direction of ASASU should be for this year.



It has three components: 1) student voice 2) student involvement and 3)



student programs. One of the ways to work on this is to talk to the students.



The officers have established Mall hours on Tuesday and Wednesday every



week, from 11:00 - 1:00 p.m. in order to talk to students and hear their



concerns.



<p>We will also be doing surveys about once every six weeks to see what



services students use at ASASU and to learn what things we can improve



on. We conducted a survey last semester and received good feedback from



that.



<p>Jenny would like to have several focused forums in which she, Dr. Coor



or Provost Glick will participate with the students. They will have an



open discussion with students about what is going good at the university



and



what they feel needs to be improved.



<p>Senator Kopta: Where is the Meet the Legislators night being held?



<p>ASASU Representative Smith: More than likely it will be held in the



Memorial Union. I am not sure right now. It will be from 7:00 - 9:00 p.m.



We can announce that information via email, or at the next Academic Senate



meeting.



<p>Senator G. Smith: The Faculty Evaluations Program had a problem last



year with funding. What is the status of that now?



<p>ASASU Representative Smith: I do not know specifically. I will talk



to Jenny and get back to you.



<p>Senate President Burstein: Despite what the agenda would say, I am not



two people. Senate President-elect Johnson, do you have a report at this



time?



<p><b>3.D Senate President-Elect's report </b>( Doug Johnson).



<p>Senate President-elect Johnson: Wyatt just told you about many good



things going on around campus, and I would encourage each of you to find



something you can do to make it even better. One of the things you can



do is attend the legislative coffees. There is a real decision to make.



If you attend, and they (the legislators) meet you, are you going to like



you back? That may be a tough question. Find something that you can do,



and make it work.



<p>Senator Kopta: I have just moved to the area and do not know my district



number yet. How do you find out when the coffees will be held and where



your district is?



<p>Senate President Burstein: We will make sure everyone in the university



will know when the coffees are scheduled--check your email, check the Senate's



Newsletter, check the ASU Insight, check the State Press.



<p>Senator Landers: Maybe part of the question was how do faculty find



out what voting district they live in.



<p>A Senator: It is on the web at azleg.com/congress/map/gov, I am not



sure exactly what the URL address is.



<p>Senator Landers: The Senate Office used to do that for people last year.



Is there a more convenient way to find that out that information?



<p>Senate President Burstein: Let me look into that and get back to you.



<p>Senator Brown: If you contact the Alumni Office, they will let you know.



<p><b>3.E ASU West Senate President's Report </b>(Jane Carey).



<p>Greetings from the West Campus. We are working on several issues, and



we have had a Senate meeting along with our Assembly Breakfast. This year



in April, we will have an NCA focus visit. They will be looking at two



general issues, one is that when they came last time and accredited us,



we had been planning and planning and they said let us do something. Now



they are coming back to see if we have started to implement our strategic



planning. A lot of that concerns an identity issue. It is probably clear



to most of you here what the ASU identity is, a Research I campus, but



we like to think at West that we are "something" within a research environment.



We are trying to find out what the role of research means according to



our mission, since we are a little more community-service based. We are



going to talk about identity, hopefully in a way that will complement what



is going with NCA visit, and the rest of the campuses.



<p>It is always an issue that we show how our students are learning. We



do not have control in our upper division over our freshman and sophomore



students, so we are trying to figure out a way without doing an assessment



pre-test for every student. Not to keep them from coming in, but to have



them succeed once they are at West. It is not a cheap question, because



if you do identify needs for students, then we are going to have to figure



out how to meet those needs.



<p>We are also looking at the ABOR student-centered learning issue and



are having dialogue about that.



<p>We have not looked at our campus level promotion and tenure document



for awhile. We have a new strategic plan. This year we will review the



campus mission document, then having done a minimalist mission document



for the campus already, as we intended to do, we will refine it even more.



Next year then we will begin work on the tenure and promotion document.



<p>We are starting a series of dialogues in the senate this year to encourage



people to be excited about the senate. We are primarily professional programs



with a lot of community based service. We are trying to figure out how



to take values from community based service and translate that into scholarship,



and it is scholarship--what kind of rewards can be added to that so that



it will translate into something people desire to continue doing.



<p>We are beginning to expand our Masters offerings. We have permission



to plan two new programs; Integrative Studies and Communication Studies,



and we are implementing a Masters in Administration of Justice Studies.



<p>The ABOR meeting will be at the West Campus in January, and I would



encourage any of you who wish to attend to visit our campus.



<p>Senate President Burstein: East Campus Senate President rep Andy Jackson



is not with us today. Andy will represent Donald Kelley, who has had a



scheduling conflict with our meeting times.



<p>I will report that I have made it my job this year to go to the West



and to the East Senate and Executive Committee meetings. I have already



attended to the East Executive Committee and Assembly meetings. It is interesting



seeing the campus grow. It is very different when you have a faculty of



60 instead of a faculty of 1460.



<p><b>4. Open Forum.</b>



<p>Senator Landers said that he has a request for more information and



will email Dr. Glick about his issue.



<p>Senate President Burstein: This is the time under the agenda that you



bring up any issue of relevance to the faculty and the academic professionals.



I would encourage all of you at this time to go back to your departmental



meetings and learn what is of concern to them. If we in the Senate leadership



should know about these issues, then I would like you as senators to inform



me of them as soon as possible via email. I would appreciate getting telephone



calls too on what you think is relevant to life on this campus. On our



campus, we have the good fortune to have a good working relationship with



our administrators.



<p>Senator Burgess: Since this is the case, I then would like to ask for



higher pay and lower workloads!



<p>Senate President Burstein: My words to you then are: higher pay, legislative



coffees, get to know your legislators. They determine our pay. By the way,



the current raise we can get is 2% on average, no more than 4% for any



individual. Not just this year, but also next year. It does not take place



until April 1 either, each year. In terms of workload, I think we do not



broach that topic this year. The legislature came very close to legislating



12 hours for all of us--another reason we have to make it known what our



university does.



<p>Senator Jacob: While I was listening to all these reports, I was processing



the dean's reports. Dean Krahenbuhl at the end of his interview raises



an issue that I think should be raised here, it is a long-range issue but



it is extremely important. I think I would like to know from administration



how we are planning for some of the long-range problems that we face, in



addition to the year to year budget things. Let me paraphrase for you from



Dean Krahenbuhl's interview, "The thing that could knock us off course



is the fact that the state has lost its capacity to generate revenue during



difficult revenue times. Tax cuts can be made with majority votes but tax



increases have to be achieved with the super-majority vote." He goes on



to say, "I don't believe that economic cycles are a thing of the past.



Eventually there will be a downturn and when that downturn comes, I do



not know how the State of Arizona is going to generate the revenues necessary



to support its universities. Adequate funding for existing programs is



my biggest worry about the next five years."



<p>Senate President Burstein: I probably could not agree more with what



Gary said. I do know that the administration is working on those points



to remedy this situation.



<p>Senator Jacob: What then are our long range working plans to avoid these



problems.



<p>Provost Glick: I think what Dean Krahenbuhl says is true. The legislature



has taken several billion dollars out of the tax pool, and they have done



it at a time of the greatest economic boom in history in the state. When



the economy goes go down, it cannot get that money back without a vote



of the super-majority. I think all of us should be concerned about that.



I will quote one of regents and say, "If you want to change the legislature,



change the legislators." We elect them; we should elect the best ones to



plan the future of this state. Second, this could be a wonderful opportunity.



The Governor has indicated that she will be appointing a blue ribbon committee



next month to look at higher education. It will include the three presidents



and the regents, some of the presidents and the members of the community



college boards and some private citizens. I believe that we have to take



seriously the opportunity that the special commission gives us, to talk



about what the future economy of this state really is going to be. Is it



going to be a high value economy, that creates high paid jobs, or is it



going to be a downturn. How do we create a long-term economy and a long-term



equality of life at the same time? You cannot decide how important a university



is unless you know what the state wants to be. Third, there have been a



number of groups that have come together, a group formed by GPL (such as



the old Phoenix forty), formed by the Tucson Thirty and formed by GPEC,



the greater Phoenix Economic Council, and members of the Regents to really



talk to the legislature about the critical role higher education must play



to have this state prosper in the next century. That is an ongoing effort,



which is starting to pick up speed. These various groups are starting to



join hands, but it will not happen easily and it will not happen without



our efforts, and it may not happen at all. The issue is not how does the



state treat its university, but rather what does the state want to be.



Depending on what the state wants to be, it requires a greater investment



first in K-12 and then in higher education. It is no longer an economy



in which you can quit high school in the 11th grade and then go to work



for General Motors and make 25 dollars an hour and have a middle class



life. More and more, it is going to take not necessarily a degree but it



is going to take advanced, higher education to have a prosperous economy.



It will also take those things that we can do, that make the quality of



life as good as the economy. We have to look at our role in developing



the Jeffersonian-educated citizen who not only makes a living but makes



a life as well.



<p>Senator Jacob: There is nothing that you have said that I cannot agree



with. Perhaps though, Senator Brown can show me if I am wrong, but having



observed the growth of Arizona politics for the last decade, it seems to



me that a super-majority power within our legislature probably represent



districts where there a voting majority who would not vote for anyone who



would raise taxes under any circumstances. The value of the universities



in the state's economy is the last thing on their mind. That we would all



have to work for McDonalds would not be a concern to them!



<p>Provost Glick: We sell the fact that the state has a moral obligation



to support our youth. I think there is a sales job to be done on the fact



that if the whole society is not hot healthy, then parts of the society



will not be healthy. It is interesting when the U.S. population was surveyed



on what they thought the average tuition was in a public university, they



thought it was $9,000 per year. Really at ASU, it is $3,000. In spite of



that, when asked what is a good buy--higher education was higher than health,



higher than groceries, higher than most things. Somehow, they thought it



was a good buy, even at those prices. We have to do a better job of telling



that story!



<p>Senator Solis: I would like to underline what a good job has been done



by our spokespersons to the Regents, our administration. I especially would



like to commend our Senate leadership and other groups for their marvelous



work in turning around our Regents to the extent that John Munger began



talking about "us." I would appreciate hearing from our administration



and our leaders about what more we can do to educate our Board of Regents



and our legislators.



<p>Provost Glick: May I suggest (to David Burstein) that we take a part



of a meeting or a whole meeting to discuss what we do in administration?



The fact is that five letters to a legislator is a landslide. The ASU Alumni



coffees have the largest attendance in the state, but too often the legislator



looks around and does not see one member of his or her district. There



may be forty or fifty people there, but none are registered voters that



can elect that legislator. I still think we still have a ways to go in



planning those events. We can bring in some of our institutional advancement



types to the senate and they can lay out a plan, but meanwhile keep in



mind that every student that is treated badly is a loss to the university.



When they study why people think so much more of Lexus than they do Toyota,



it is not that there are fewer complaints about Lexus than Toyota; it is



that Lexus dealers respond when Toyota dealers hang up on the phone. Day



by day, we can and should treat our students, as we would want to be treated.



However, that alone will not solve the problem. I do not have any magical



solutions.



<p>Senate President Burstein: The sad fact is that you, as well as all



the people in each of your departments, are going to have to become more



politically aware. Without a heightened political awareness on the part



of everyone, we do not have much choice about what happens at the legislature.



With it, we stand a chance to affect what the legislators do. We must face



that harsh reality.



<p><b>5. Unfinished Business. </b>There is no unfinished business.



<p><b>6. New Business/Reports from Senate Committees</b>.



<p><b>6.A Executive Committee</b> (David Burstein).



<p><b>6.B</b> <b>Committee on Committees</b> (Brent Brown).



<p>We are going to be sending out the annual <i>Academic Preference Survey</i>



soon to all faculty and academic professionals. We are doing it a bit different



this year. At the next Senate meeting, we will distribute a separate form



to solicit your preference for service on Senate standing committees. We



encourage you to let your colleagues know of this opportunity to participate.



<p><b>6.C</b> <b>Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee</b> (Jack Fouquette).



No report.



<p><b>6.D Personnel Committee</b> (Kathleen McCoy). No report.



<p><b>6.E</b> <b>Student-Faculty Policy Committee</b> (Michael Mayer).



No report.



<p>West Senate President Carey: We are just working with a report now from



our Student Issues Committee that recommends that every student not be



required to have a computer. We are looking at what this means and how



we will provide for the students who do not have a computer because they



cannot afford one.



<p>Senator Mayer: Although we are making some progress with ASASU on the



teacher evaluation program, we are having a problem with the implementation



of that program. The effort on this project seems to kind of wax and wane,



depending upon whom is in office.



<p><b>6.F</b> <b>University Services Committee</b> (Betty Craft). No report.



<p><b>7. Adjournment.</b>



<p>Senate President Burstein: There being no further business, I will entertain



a motion to adjourn. So moved. Seconded. The meeting was adjourned at 4:25



p.m.
