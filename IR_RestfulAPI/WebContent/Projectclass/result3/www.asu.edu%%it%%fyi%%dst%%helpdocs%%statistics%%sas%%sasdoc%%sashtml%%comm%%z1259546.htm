<P>
<IMG border="0" align="bottom" src="./images/01313945.gif" alt="[IMAGE]">Version
8 offers a new method to provide user identification to a SAS/CONNECT remote
host and a SAS/SHARE server by means of the USER= and PASSWORD= options in
the  SIGNON or RSUBMIT statements in SAS/CONNECT  and in the LIBNAME, Remote
SQL Pass-Thru (RSPT), or PROC OPERATE statements in SAS/SHARE.
<P>These security options can be set on any Version 8  local host accessing
a remote host that runs any version of SAS. The USER= and PASSWORD= options
to these statements are recommended and take precedence over the applicable
security option, which varies by host and access method. SAS/CONNECT and SAS/SHARE
security options are APPCSEC, APPC_SECURE, TCPSEC, and SASUSER and SASPASS. 
<P>If a Version 7 security option remains set on the local host, the Version
8 specification of USER= and PASSWORD= in a SAS/CONNECT statement overrides
the previously set security option on the local host.  For example, the Version
8 USER= and PASSWORD= options in the SIGNON statement will override the TCPSEC=
_PROMPT_ option set on a local host for a non-scripted sign on to a spawner.
<P>If a Version 8 local host does not set USER= and PASSWORD= options,
the communications access method or host security option would remain in effect.
If both the USER= and PASSWORD= options and a security option are specified,
then the USER= and PASSWORD= options would take precedence.
<P>Syntax and definitions are:
<P>
<TABLE cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2">
<TR valign="top"><TD>
<B>USER</B> | <B>USERNAME</B> | <B>USERID</B>
|
<B>UID</B>= <I>username</I> | _PROMPT_
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<TABLE cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2">
<TR valign="top"><TD>
<B>PASSWORD</B> | <B>PASSWD</B> | <B>PASS</B> | <B>PWD</B> | <B>PW</B>= <I>password</I> |
_PROMPT_
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>Specifying these options allows local hosts whose usernames and passwords
have been verified to access the remote host.
<P><B>Username</B> is a valid userid on the remote host being accessed.
On Windows NT only, the username can also include the domain name, which locates
the specified username in a domain.
<P><B>Password</B> is a valid password on the remote host being accessed.
<P>Supplying a userid and password by using the USER= and
PASSWORD= options
is more secure than assigning them by means of a security option (such as
TCPSEC), which can be inadvertently publicized in a configuration file or
in a log.
<P>_PROMPT_ specifies that the SAS System prompts for <B>userid</B>
and <B>password</B>. Hardcoding a username and password value to the
USER= and PASSWORD= options limits the assignment to a single user whereas
prompting permits any user to supply a username and password that are valid.
Specifying only USER=_PROMPT_  implies that the SAS System will prompt for
both a username and a password. 
<P>The values supplied for the USER= and PASSWORD= options are valid for
the duration of the remote host connection. Subsequent local host connections
to the same remote host or to a different remote host require you to specify
these options again. By contrast, as an example, the values assigned to TCPSEC
in a local host configuration file endure for subsequent connections to the
same remote host and to different remote hosts.
<P>Here is a Version 8 example for SAS/CONNECT:



<PRE>signon user=joeblack password=born2run; </PRE>
<P>Here is a Version 8 example for SAS/SHARE:
<PRE>libname test 'prog2 a' user=joeblue password='2muchfun' server=share1;</PRE>
<P>As a security precaution, PASSWORD= field entries echoed in the local
host log are replaced with Xs. See the naming conventions identified in the <B>SAS/SHARE User's Guide</B>
for guidelines on quoted passwords.
<P>If _PROMPT_ is specified, when presented with the prompt for <B>password</B> during a remote host connection, the value entered would not
be displayed on the screen.
