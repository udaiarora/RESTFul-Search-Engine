<h1 class="storyhead">Student: Laos visit like trip back in time</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>Sone Sithonnorath's father was a Laotian refugee who came to the United States in 1976, in the first influx of people to escape from the country as it was taken over by Communist leaders. Her mother is an American of European ancestry. </p>
<p>Sithonnorath had been interested in her Lao heritage, and when she learned about the new Sage Family Southeast Asian Studies Scholarship last year, she jumped at the chance to apply. </p>
<p>She was chosen as the first recipient of the $2,000 grant, and she spent last summer making her first visit to Laos. </p>
<p>For Sithonnorath, it was like a trip back in time ? and to another world far different from the United States, where everyone has a car, television, computer and cellular telephone. </p>
<p>?There was a lot of turmoil,? she says. ?The kids really want to go to school, but there are not a lot of opportunities. The things available to me are so excessive.? </p>
<p>In preparation for the trip, Sithonnorath's Lao relatives in Iowa called family members in Laos to let them know she would be arriving for the summer. </p>
<p>She visited her grandmother in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, where her aunts' homes encircled the grandmother's house. She also went to her father's village, Ban Sikhay, where she visited his stepfather. </p>
<p>?I saw the house that my dad built for his mom,? she says. </p>
<p>The Lao people ?work all the time,? Sithonnorath says. Her aunts baked and cooked every morning, then took the food out to sell on a pushcart. </p>
<p>Sithonnorath, a plant biology major who also is studying for a certificate in Southeast Asian Studies, said she did not speak Lao well enough to have extensive conversations with her relatives and others she met in Laos. </p>
<p>But she now has three semesters of language study completed, and she is eager to return to Laos, perhaps to work on research in plant biology. </p>
<p>William Sage, an ASU political science graduate who established the Sage Family Southeast Asian Studies Scholarship two years ago, said he hopes the student recipients will develop an appreciation for the Laotian people, cultures and history, ?much like I have over the last 36 years.? </p>
<p>?When I received my degree, I was enrolled in the Latin America area studies program,? he says. ?My hope was to go to Latin America and work. But when I graduated in 1968, nothing was open in Latin America.? </p>
<p>Instead, he went to Laos in 1969 without even knowing the language. </p>
<p>?I figured that someday I'd come back to Latin America ,? he says. ?I never did.? </p>
<p>In Laos, he worked for the Agency for International Development, building new schools and putting Lao youth into Ministry of Education training programs in preparation for teaching in rural areas of northwest Laos. </p>
<p>When he returned to the United States in 1975, he began working with Lao refugees in California. </p>
<p>?It was challenging, but fun,? he says. </p>
<p>In 1982, Sage went to work for Church World Service (CWS), serving on the Trauma Response Team until his retirement in 2000. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., he returned to CWS as a consultant, coordinating the Interfaith Trauma Response Team's response to the attacks on the World Trade Center. </p>
<p>Since 1995, Sage has been returning to Laos about once a year, and the country still ?tugs at my heart,? he says. </p>
<p>?It's a country that's isolated,? he says. ?You can't get any news from it. It's wedged between powerful neighbors. The people are gentle, hospitable and friendly. You can't help liking them.? </p>
<p>Sage says he decided to create the scholarship for several reasons. </p>
<p>?I love ASU,? he says. ?I had a great experience there. My experience really prepared me for the greater world, and I wanted to give something back.? </p>
<p>The Sage Family scholarship also is a tribute to Sage's parents, Lloyd G. and Twyla M. Sage, ?who gave me the opportunity of going to ASU,? he says. </p>
<p>Sage received the Founders Day Alumni Achievement Award in spring 2001, and he hopes that, by offering a scholarship, he will set an example for other alumni to make an investment in ASU students. </p>
<p>He comes to ASU about once a year from his home in New York to meet the scholarship recipients and talk to students about Laos and the economic and educational issues in Southeast Asia . </p>
<p>He also keeps tabs on the students as they travel in Laos. </p>
<p>Sithonnorath says Sage did more than just write a check for her trip expenses. </p>
<p>?He was incredible,? she says. ?He gave me addresses of people at the National University of Laos to contact, and checked in with me periodically. He was a mentor. Many thanks to him.?</p>
