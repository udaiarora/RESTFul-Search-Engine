<h1 class="storyhead">Biodesign Institute at ASU named magazine's Lab of Year </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>The Biodesign Institute at ASU has been named 2006 Laboratory of the Year by <em>R&amp;D Magazine. </em> The award recognizes innovative laboratory design that creates a superior working environment and supports research excellence. The annual competition includes industrial, government and academic laboratories across the U.S. and abroad. </p>
<p align="left">Considered the leading international design competition for research laboratories, the <em>R&amp;D Magazine </em> Laboratory of the Year award is presented for new laboratory construction completed during the prior year. </p>
<p align="left"><img src="images/bioodesign.jpg" width="293" height="185" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Winning projects must be laboratories where the research performed is enhanced by the facility surroundings, where the tenants work in a safe and productive environment, where walking into the facility is an uplifting experience, and where the facility enhances the client's ability to recruit top researchers. </p>
<p align="left">"The design of the Biodesign Institute exemplifies the lab of the future, able to respond to the demands and opportunities of a changing world," says ASU President Michael M. Crow. "Like today's American university, these laboratories must be dynamic." </p>
<p>Adds George Poste, director of the Biodesign Institute and <em>R&amp;D Magazine's </em> 2004 Scientist of the Year: "We are especially proud of this award because it speaks to the quality of ASU's new research facilities and its role in enhancing Arizona's competitiveness in the biosciences." </p>
<p>The Biodesign Institute headed up a strong field in this year's competition, according to Tim Studt, editor-in-chief of <em>R&amp;D Magazine. </em></p>
<p>"The vote for the Biodesign Institute as Laboratory of the Year was unanimous on the first round, which happens only rarely," Studt says. "The other laboratories that were entered were very good in their own right, but the Biodesign Institute was just an overwhelmingly strong candidate." </p>
<p>ASU's Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building 2 also was recognized by <em>R&amp;D Magazine, </em> receiving a "High Honors" designation. </p>
<p>"These two structures go beyond the simple equation of adding bricks and mortar," Crow says. "By creating research facilities that enhance intellectual fusion, we are attracting world-class talent to ASU, and will accelerate discoveries that address some of the most pressing challenges to human health and society." </p>
<p>"These new award-winning laboratories are resources not only for ASU, but for the state of Arizona as well,"says Jonathan Fink, ASU's vice president of research and economic affairs. "ISTB 2 and the Biodesign B building are the result of Arizona's investment in research facilities through the Research Infrastructure Bill." </p>
<p><img src="images/biodesign_atrium.jpg" width="220" height="323" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">The Biodesign Institute is Arizona's largest single investment in research infrastructure. It is master-planned as four interconnected buildings that can be constructed in phases. The first two buildings are complete, comprising 350,000 square feet. The facility design was a collaboration between the Atlanta office of Lord, Aeck &amp; Sargent Architecture and the Phoenix office of Gould Evans. The general contractors were Sundt Construction Inc./DPR Construction Inc., A Joint Venture. </p>
<p>"I believe a key to our success was engaging the Biodesign Institute's researchers in planning the lab space," says Larry Lord, who is Lord, Aeck &amp; Sargent's principal and director of the firm's Science Studio. "The institute's approach to bioscience research is groundbreaking, so the design also needed to break new ground. We relied heavily on one another, and explored some new directions that have really worked well." </p>
<p>One of the innovative aspects of the facility design is a central atrium that is the "spine" of the facility, stretching 450 feet down the length of the institute - about the length of one-and-a-half football fields - which allows natural light to flow into all four levels of the facility. </p>
<p>"The idea of the atrium was bold for a university, where space is at a premium," says Barbara Hendricks, project manager, Gould Evans. "But it was championed by the institute's associate director, Michael Mobley, based on their goal of creating collaboration and a heightened sense of community. It has exceeded expectations, becoming a key gathering space for the researchers and offering spectacular lines of sight throughout the facility that are extremely energizing," Hendricks says. </p>
<p>Transparency and open space is a hallmark of the institute. Though it houses a dozen separate research centers, there are few walls between the labs, and an extensive use of glass creates a visual connection between the labs, offices and atrium. The lab benches are on wheels, with all utilities and data lines accessed through the ceilings. This enables maximum "plug and play" flexibility. Some distinct features of the labs include special construction techniques to reduce vibration and electromagnetic interference that could negatively impact sensitive equipment settings. </p>
<p>Specific judging criteria for the awards include site plans; traffic flow; flow of materials; plant operation; aesthetics; working conditions; suitability for type of research performed; lab design; office design/location; furnishings; study and meeting facilities; opportunities for collaboration and idea exchange; energy efficiency; cost to build; and cost to operate. Criteria considered essential include safety for lab and office personnel; hazard control; and access for people with disabilities. </p>
<p><em>R&amp;D Magazine </em> is distributed to more than 80,000 scientists and engineers in industrial, academic and government research and development. The awards also are supported by the Scientific Equipment and Furniture Association. </p>
