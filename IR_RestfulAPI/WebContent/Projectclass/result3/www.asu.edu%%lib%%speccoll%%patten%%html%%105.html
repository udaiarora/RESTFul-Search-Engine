The appendix to vol. 2 consists of 12 essays by other
 writers, including H. Bock and L. Fuchs.  The piece
 by Fuchs is his first published botanical writing.--Cf.
 Johnston, S. Cleveland herbal coll. p. 39.  Vol. 3
 edited by Michael Herr.  Illustrations by Hans Weiditz.
  Vol. 1, 2nd ed.; vol. 2, 1st ed.; vol. 3, 2nd (?) ed.
  Errors in pagination throughout.  Includes 238 (?)
 woodcuts of plants.  References:  Johnston, S. H.
 Cleveland coll. 42; Hunt 30.  Includes indexes.
  Illustrations, initials, etc. in vols. 1 and 2
 and hand-colored. This work by Brunfels, with detailed,
 exquisite illustrations by Hans Weiditz, offers the
 first original work in botany.
 Its importance rests less in its text than
 in its elegant woodcut illustrations.  Most were
 drawn accurately from actual botanical speciments
 by Hans Weiditz, one of the best German illustrators
 of the period.  Johann Schott, the publisher, insisted
 that Weiditz prepare watercolor studies prior to carving
 his woodblocks because they could be used by the
 illuminators who would later hand-color the printed
 illustrations.  Some of these watercolors have been
 preserved in the library of Bern University.
  The compiler of the text was Otto Brunfels,
 a pastor and naturalist, and the town physician
 at Bern.  The text was published as illustrations
 were completed; Brunfels had no opportunity to
 organize the work according to any botanical system.
  At one point he apologizes for including a picture
 of the pasque-flower, now known as an anemone,
 because he lacked both a Latin name and medicinal
 use for it.  This may give some indication that he
 did not have control over the book's content.
  The herbal is arranged alphabetically and emphasizes
 the illustrations more than written descriptions,
 since Schott believed that good illustrations sell the book.
  Scholarship was not his primary goal.  Botanists credit
 Brunfels as the prime motivator of Hieronymous Bock.
  Because of Brunfels' urging, Bock completed his herbal.
  Bock's work was more truly scientific than Brunfels'
 and is considered one of the pillars upon which later
 botanical study rests.
