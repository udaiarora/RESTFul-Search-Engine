      <h2>Computer measures political mudslinging 
      </h2>
      <p>ASU researchers have developed an impartial judge to keep score of the mudslinging in this year&rsquo;s presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>Professors Steve Corman and Kevin Dooley are using a computer to analyze the language in the news releases, speeches and Web logs put out by the campaigns of President Bush and his challenger, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. By looking on a daily basis for nasty comments that the software identifies through sophisticated language analysis, their computer generates the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.crawdadtech.com/campaign"> Crawdad Mud Meter</a>&rdquo; &ndash; and also tracks how many themes the campaigns are generating. The meter, which started collecting data June 25, can be found at the following Web site: (www.asu.edu/feature/campaign).</p>
      <p>The purpose of the meter, a.k.a. the &ldquo;Crawdad Campaign Tracking Dashboard,&rdquo; is to give researchers, analysts and citizens a real-time, dynamic, nonpartisan analysis of the messages coming from the Bush and Kerry camps.</p>
      <p>The measuring tool, which caught the attention of <em>The New York Times</em> in its Sept. 12 issue, is an outgrowth of work done by advanced text analysis firm Crawdad Technologies, LLC. The two ASU professors founded the company in 2002.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Looking at the graphs for mud and focus in August, you see that Bush seemed to pick particular issues and hammer Kerry on them,&rdquo; says Corman, a professor in the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication. &ldquo;Meanwhile, Kerry was less focused and still catching up to Bush in the mud-throwing.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>That observation roughly correlates with the conventional human wisdom about Kerry&rsquo;s troubles last month.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The concept of developing a campaign tracking dashboard stemmed from our business planning,&rdquo; says Dooley, a professor of supply chain management in the W. P. Carey School of Business. &ldquo;Dashboards represent a product opportunity that is a strong match between market demand and our core competencies. We decided to target it at the campaign communications because it is a news source everyone can relate to and finds interest in. We developed it as a technology demonstration for a partner, and decided to make it available to the public.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Because the dashboard provides an objective, unbiased view of campaign communications that no human system could replicate, it is useful for anyone who is interested in and trying to interpret the ebbs and flows of the campaign: political analysts, media providers, researchers, interested citizens &ndash; and, we hope, the political parties themselves.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Dooley has suggestions on how the average person might read the information presented on the dashboard to understand it better:</p>
      <p>&bull; Examine the levels of mud, focus, intensity and tone, plus their two-week trends, and compare those levels to specific events that have happened over the last two weeks.</p>
      <p>&bull; Examine the important words. What are the topics they suggest are at the top of the discussion?</p>
      <p>&bull; Examine the image nets. How are the candidates framing each other, and themselves? What are the images being presented?</p>
      <p>The company is making the campaign dashboard available for free through the whole campaign season.</p>
      <p>Dooley says he believes the information dashboard has applications far beyond the presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The technology behind the dashboard can be aimed at any topic, person or organization, and so it has applications to areas like marketing, business intelligence, operations and public relations.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Media output is so enormous in volume that we need unbiased &lsquo;readers&rsquo; who can help us track the sense of the texts, when we don&rsquo;t have time to read it all. The dashboard gives us a control valve at the end of the information firehose.&rdquo;</p>
