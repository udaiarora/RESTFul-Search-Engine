The 2nd ed. was used by Linnaeus.  This landmark work classifies 6,000 species of

 plants.  Caspar Bauhin grouped them by a combination of characters, so that grasses,

 mints, legumes, etc. are classed together.  Most previous herbals simply listed

 plants alphabetically by name.  He also provided more standardized names for plants,

 with usually one to four descriptive words.  Linnaeus followed Bauhin in providing

 standardized nomenclature for plants.  Many list Bauhin's works as the last of the

 herbals, since all works following it split into works on medicine or floras of specific

 areas.  The <i>Pinax</i> is also valuable in providing reference from the name of a plant

 found in many previous herbals to his own name for the plant.

Nearly twenty years younger than his brother Johann, Caspar Bauhin was

 a delicate, slow-developing child.  It was reported that he was five years old before

 he could speak plainly.  Despite early handicaps, he became a professor of anatomy,

 botany, and medicine.  Inspired by his brother, he tried to master everything known

 about systematic botany.  In his early travels he observed and collected widely and

 met botanists all over Europe.  He formed a herbarium of 4,000 plants including species

 from remote countries.  The collection is still preserved in the Univeristy of Basle.

  He produced new editions of Mattioli's <i>Commentarii</i> and of the herbal of <i>Tabernaemontanus</i>.

  <i>Pinax</i> [meaning chart or register], which is considered his main work, contains a

 complete concordance to the names of over 6,000 species and helped to lay a foundation

 for the study of modern botany.  Linnaeus, after receiving a copy of Bauhin's work,

 used it constantly, adding 3,000 "determinations" [i.e. the fixation of the nature

 of morphological differentiations] to the margins.
