  <h2>ECUADOR: The Amazon and the Andes Field School</h2>
	<h3>Program Description</h3>

<p>This program takes place during the ASU Winter and Summer intercessions in an Amazonian Quichua community located on the banks of the Napo River, with shorter stays during the Summer Program in Andean communities near Otavalo and Salasaca. Students (which include undergraduates, graduates, and K-12 school teachers and community college professors) attend classes daily and live within the Quichua speaking communities that they study. To date, over 200 students from various U.S. institutions of higher education have participated in the Field School where they receive introduction to elementary and advanced Quichua language and culture. Beginning courses in Shuar or Waorani, two other indigenous languages of the Ecuadorian Amazon, are available as well. Several alumni of the Field School have returned in following years for additional linguistic and cultural immersion.</p>

<p>Spoken by eleven million people in five countries straddling the Andes from Colombia to Argentina, Quichua is perhaps the most important of the indigenous American languages. Nonetheless, despite the accessibility of Quichua at many universities throughout the United States, very few Americans have fluency in Quichua, because most students require immersion in an environment where Quichua is the common language, so as to understand the cultural context of the language, in order to gain fluency. The Quichua Language and Culture Program is unique then because it places students in rural communities where Quichua is the predominant language, communities specifically selected because they possess an environment where distinctive cultural immersion will complement the language acquisition of the students. The knowledge that the program faculty have concerning these areas, as well as the relationships that the faculty have built with the host communities thereby afford participants a more comprehensive and personal learning experience.</p>

<p>The program objectives include:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Providing intensive instruction in Quichua through immersion in the language for both the beginner and the advanced student so that they:
		<ol>
         <li>Become conversant in Quichua as quickly as possible and thereafter rapidly increase language competence in contexts of practical use,</li>
         <li>Learn how Quichua works as a cultural field of meaning different from Spanish or other European languages, and</li>
         <li>Understand the social meaning of speaking Quichua in a country where Spanish is the dominant language and culture;</li>
		 </ol></li>
  <li>Providing instruction in Quichua cultural patterns, particularly family and social life, through first-hand knowledge of the religious, social customs, and nuances gained through linguistic and cultural immersion;</li>
  <li>Introducing basic ethnographic research methods used to learn about other cultures (participant observation and interviewing) and their application;</li>
   <li>Instruction in research methods and assistance in developing and implementing a research project for those students wishing to pursue their own research interests; and </li>
   <li>Providing K-12 and community college educators with a greater understanding of the Quichua people and their culture so that they can share these experiences with their students upon their return to the classroom.</li>
   </ol>
   

<p>Students can receive up to seven units of semester credit per Summer Session and three units of semester credit per Winter Session. Summer participants must enroll in one language course and at least one credit of non-language course work per session. Winter participants may enroll in any class of their choosing. Students may audit courses (no credit) or take them for a regular grade. Students taking classes on the audit option are required to attend class and complete most course assignments.</p>

<p>In the past, students have used our program as a springboard to develop research projects of their own interest which they later carry out in other Quichua communities. The faculty will assist the students in developing a personal research program on a wide variety of local topics and activities. Previous projects have included research on: Quichua Christianity, ayahuasca shamanism, traditional healing practices, Quichua music, intercultural communication, ethnic identity, ethnobiology, environmental issues, and bilingual education.</p>
