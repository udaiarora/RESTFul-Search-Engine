<a name=WEB><h2>Labriola's New Web Site</h2></a>

Now that the Labriola Center is on the Web, we are able to provide 
wider access to information about the Center and links to 
its publications, including Native American Languages, this 
newsletter, <a href=films.htm>Microform Publications</a> on Native Americans,
<a href=biblio.htm>Navajo Bibliography for Beginners</a>, and more.
 We will also include finding guides for our manuscript
holdings.   Future plans call for adding photographs of the Labriola Center and its activities and supplying 
links to a number of Native American web sites . Visitors to the site will be able to send e-mail inquiries to
the Center.
<p>
Labriola recommends  the American Indian Library 
Association Home Page, produced by its
President, Lisa A Mitten.  It includes current information provided by 
the various Indian Nations, directories, links to library collections
 and resource centers, and more.  The address is:

<a name=PROGRAMS><h2>American Indian Programs at ASU - Update</h2></a>
During the fall semester, a record 915 American Indian students registered at ASU.  As a result, plans were
initiated for developing an Indian Studies program at the University.  The program will offer courses on
U.S. government policy and law as they apply to tribes, as well as on the language, literature, and history of
American Indians.
<p>
In addition, Associate Professor, Rebecca Tsosie has been named executive director of the Indian Legal
Program, a nationally recognized program that recruits and provides support services for Indian students in
the College of Law.
<p>
Octaviana Trujillo is the new interim director of the Center for Indian Education, replacing Karen Swisher,
who accepted a position at the Haskell Indian Nation University in Lawrence, Kansas.  The Center conducts
research on Indian education and provides teacher training and administrative leadership to tribal
communities and schools (Abstracted from ASUInsight 10/25/96).

<a name=FIRST><h2>First Americans' Firsts</h2></a>
A number of people have inquired about publication of the above reference work.  Orders can be sent to
Gale Research, Multicultural Dept., 835 Penobscot Bldg., 645 Griswald Street, Detroit, Michigan, 48226.  
The book will be available in 1997; a price has not yet been announced.
<p>
In the meantime, authors Ancita Benally and Kathy Kingfisher continue to add interesting "firsts" to the
expanding list.  For example, they learned that the Cherokee started the first
co-educational public school system in 1839 in the world. They discovered that the prehistoric Hohokam of
Arizona created the first etching process on shell, which pre-dated the European technique, and more.  The
book promises to  be an important and interesting addition to library collections.

<a name=CDROM><h2>CD-ROM Products Make Information Searching Fun</h2></a>
<i>The American Indian, Multi-Media Encyclopedia</i> (Facts on File, Ind., 1995).  The update version, 2.0 for

challenges the conventional interpretation
of this period, which holds
 that the Indians offered weak resistance to the miners.
