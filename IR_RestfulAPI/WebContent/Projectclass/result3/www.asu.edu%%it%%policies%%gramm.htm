			<h2>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</h2>
			
			<p><strong>Interim Information Security Plan</strong></p>     
			
		
				<p>This Information Security Plan (&#147;Plan&#148;) describes Arizona 
				State University&#146;s safeguards to protect information and data 
				in compliance (&#147;Protected Information&#148;) with the Financial 
				Services Modernization Act of 1999, also known as the Gramm Leach 
				Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 6801. These safeguards are provided 
				to:</p>
					<ul> 
				  	  <li> Ensure the security and confidentiality of Protected Information;</li>
					  <li> Protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security 
						or integrity of such information; and</li>
					  <li> Protect against unauthorized access to or use of Protected 
						Information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience 
						to any customer. </li>
					</ul>
		
			
				<p>This Information Security Plan also provides for mechanisms to:</p>
					<ul>
					  <li> Identify and assess the risks that may threaten Protected Information 
						maintained by Arizona State University;</li>
					  <li> Develop written policies and procedures to manage and control 
						these risks;</li>
					  <li> Implement and review the plan; and</li>
					  <li> Adjust the plan to reflect changes in technology, the sensitivity 
						of covered data and information and internal or external threats 
						to information security.</li>
					</ul>
				
		
				 
			<strong>Identification and Assessment of Risks to Customer Information</strong> 
			             
		
				<p>Arizona State University recognizes that it has both internal and 
				external risks. These risks include, but are
				not limited to:</p>
					 <ul>
					  <li> Unauthorized access of Protected Information by someone other 
						than the owner of the covered data and information</li>
					  <li> Compromised system security as a result of system access by 
						an unauthorized person</li>
					  <li> Interception of data during transmission</li>
					  <li> Loss of data integrity</li>
					  <li> Physical loss of data in a disaster</li>
					  <li> Errors introduced into the system</li>
					  <li> Corruption of data or systems</li>
					  <li> Unauthorized access of covered data and information by employees</li>
					  <li> Unauthorized requests for covered data and information</li>
					  <li> Unauthorized access through hardcopy files or reports</li>
					  <li> Unauthorized transfer of covered data and information through 
						third parties</li>
					</ul>
			   
		
			  
				<p>Arizona State University recognizes that this may not be a complete 
				list of the risks associated with the protection of Protected Information. 
				Since technology growth is not static, new risks are created regularly. 
				Accordingly, the Information Technology Department and the Office 
				of Student Affairs will actively participate with and seek advice 
				from an advisory committee made up of university representatives 
				for identification of new risks.</p>
			 
				<p>Arizona State University believes current safeguards used by the 
				Information Technology Department are reasonable and, in light of 
				current risk assessments are sufficient to provide security and 
				confidentiality to Protected Information maintained by the University.</p>
				 
		
			<p><strong>Information Security Plan Coordinators</strong> </p>
			
				<p>The University CIO and the Vice President for Student Affairs, 
				in consultation with an advisory committee, have been appointed 
				as the coordinators of this Plan. They are responsible for assessing 
				the risks associated with unauthorized transfers of covered data 
				and information and implementing procedures to 
				minimize those risks to Arizona State University. </p>
				
		
			<p><strong>Design and Implementation of Safeguards Program</strong></p> 
		
				  <h3>Employee Management and Training</h3>
				  <p>During employee orientation, each new employee in departments 
					that handle Protected Information will receive proper training 
					on the importance of confidentiality of Protected Information.</p>
	
				  <h3>Physical Security</h3>
				  <p>Arizona State University has addressed the physical security 
					of Protected Information by limiting access to only those employees 
					who have a business reason to know such information.</p>
	
				  <h3>Information Systems</h3>
				  <p>Arizona State University has policies governing the use of electronic 
					resources and firewall and wireless policies. Arizona State University 
					will take reasonable and appropriate steps consistent with current 
					technological developments to make sure that all Protected Information 
					is secure and to safeguard the integrity of records in storage 
					and transmission. Arizona State University will develop a plan 
					to ensure that all electronic Protected Information is encrypted 
					in transit.</p> 
		
				
			<p><strong>Selection of Appropriate Service Providers</strong></p>
			 
				<p>Due to the specialized expertise needed to design, implement, and service new 
				technologies, vendors may be needed to provide resources that Arizona 
				State University determines not to provide on its own. In the process 
				of choosing a service provider that will maintain or regularly access 
				Protected Information, the evaluation process shall include the 
				ability of the service provider to safeguard Protected Information.</p>
			 
				<p>Contracts with service providers may include the following provisions:</p>
					<ul>
					  <li> A stipulation that the Protected Information will be held in 
						strict confidence and accessed only for the explicit business 
						purpose of the contract;</li>
					  <li> An assurance from the contract partner that the partner will 
						protect the Protected Information it receives.</li>
					</ul>
		
				
			<p><strong>Continuing Evaluation and Adjustment</strong></p>
			 
				<p>This Information Security Plan will be subject to periodic review 
				and adjustment, especially when due to the constantly changing technology 
				and evolving risks.</p>
			
				<p>The Coordinators, in consultation with the Office of General Counsel, 
				will review the standards set forth in this policy and recommend 
				updates and revisions as necessary. It may be necessary to adjust 
				the plan to reflect changes in technology, the sensitivity of student/customer 
				data and internal or external threats to information security.</p>
