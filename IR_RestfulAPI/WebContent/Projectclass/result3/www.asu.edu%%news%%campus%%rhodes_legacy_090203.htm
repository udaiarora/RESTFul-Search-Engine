      <h2>Rhodes legacy lives on at ASU through Honors College chair, congressional
        papers</h2>
      <p>        <img src="../faculty_students/facstudents_images/Rhodes%202.jpg" alt="John J. Rhodes Jr." width="180" height="242" align="right">Members of the ASU community this week are remembering the legacy of
        longtime Arizona congressman John J. Rhodes Jr. who died from cancer
      Aug. 24 at his home in Mesa.</p>
      <p>Rhodes, the first Arizona Republican elected
          to the House, served in Congress for 30 years, rising to the post of
          House Minority Leader. He
          is perhaps best known for his role in President Richard Nixon's resignation
          in 1974 after the Watergate scandal. Rhodes, a longtime Nixon supporter,
          along with Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater and another senator, went
          to the White House to convince Nixon he would not survive an impeachment
        vote. Nixon resigned two days later.</p>
      <p>Among his many water-related interests
          in the state, Rhodes was one of the key congressional advocates of
        federal funding for the Central Arizona
        Project (CAP), bringing Colorado River water to central Arizona.</p>
      <p>At ASU,
          the most visible legacy is that of the John J. Rhodes Chair in Public
          Policy and American Institutions and the annual Rhodes Lecture
        in the Barrett Honors College. </p>
      <p>"John Rhodes' exemplary career and commitment
          to public service are a guiding light that will continue to shine and
          impact ASU students for
          many generations to come," says Mark Jacobs, dean of the Barrett Honors
          College at ASU. "The Rhodes chair will continue to represent the civic
        values to which John Rhodes' career was dedicated."</p>
      <p>The endowment allows
          the college to introduce the examination of public policy and American
          citizenship, as well as discussion of the country's
        place in the world culture, into the Honors College curriculum. </p>
      <p>Jacobs
          says it also allows the college to annually add a nationally known
        faculty member that might not otherwise come to ASU. Since its establishment
          in 1998, the Rhodes chair has been held by former Secretary of State
          and statesman Henry Kissinger, former U.S. Senator Alan Simpson, scientist
          and Pulitzer Prize winner Jonathan Weiner, renowned Native American
        scholar
        Donald Fixico and noted biographer Jean Strouse.</p>
      <p>Once on campus, the chairholder
          interacts closely with the students, through both a special lecture
        class and other presentations, including
          the annual Rhodes Lecture, which is open to the public. With the chairholder
          being at ASU throughout much of a semester, it also provides opportunities
        for interactions with faculty members throughout ASU.</p>
      <p>"There aren't that
          many endowed visiting chairs of this nature at any institution," says
          Jacobs. "To have one of this magnitude at the Honors
          College is tremendous. It really allows our students to delve into
        the topic, in a way they wouldn't otherwise be able to."</p>
      <p>While the endowed
          chair and lecture offer opportunities to future generations of students,
          a collection in the University Libraries Arizona Collection
        offers an extensive look at Rhodes' past work.</p>
      <p>ASU Archivist Rob Spindler
          says the John J. Rhodes collection, housed in Hayden Library, is the
          university's second-largest political collection
          next to that of Senator Carl Hayden. Four hundred boxes and more than
          2,000 photographs encompass Rhodes' entire career, including extensive
          material on his Arizona water-issue work and political leadership,
        including Watergate. </p>
      <p>The collection also includes material related to Rhodes' run
          for Arizona governor in 1988. The campaign was part of a recall effort
          against Even
        Mecham, but was cancelled when Mecham was impeached.</p>
      <p>"It is an important
          collection," says Spindler. "It is used by scholars here at the university,
          throughout the state and really throughout the
        country."</p>
      <p>Spindler says the Arizona Collection staff were recently working
          with Rhodes on a new project, a collection of essays by Rhodes on a
        variety of current topics to be published on the Internet this fall.
        The essays
          cover relevant topics such as water issues, alternative energy sources
          and foreign and Middle East policy. Spindler says a Rhodes' essay on
        his recollections of the Watergate scandal also will be republished.</p>
      <p>"It
          is a very enlightening and relevant collection of essays," says Spindler.
          "We should have it available this fall; unfortunately it will have
        to be published posthumously." </p>
