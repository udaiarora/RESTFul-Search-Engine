The release shall indicate the employee&#146;s ability to return to regular or <A HREF="spp002.html#alternate duty">alternate duty assignment</A>.  If alternate duty is indicated, the physician and/or psychiatrist shall specify the work restrictions and the duration (dates) restriction(s) apply.<P> <A HREF="spp002.html#department">Departments</A> may elect to have an employee examined by a designated physician when the employee has been away from work for an extended period of time due to an injury or illness, or the employee is being released to work with medical restrictions, and clarification is needed.  The department will provide the physician with the tasks the employee will be expected to perform.  The examination will be coordinated through the State of Arizona Department of Administration (ADOA), Risk Management Section, when the employee has an ongoing Worker&#146;s Compensation claim or coordinated through the department (at the department&#146;s expense) when it is classified as an injury/illness which is not work related.<P>If the department designated physician releases an employee to work with medical restrictions, the physician shall notify the ADOA, Risk Management Section (if work related), and the department that the employee is being returned to alternate duty and specifically identify the restrictions.  An employee released with no restrictions shall report to work.<P>An employee released with restrictions shall report immediately to his or her department supervisor with appropriate documentation completed by the physician, specifying the work restrictions and the duration (dates) of the restriction(s).<P>Departments shall assign the employee to an alternate duty assignment if an appropriate assignment is available, and instruct the employee where and when to report for work.  If the employee is returning from a work related injury/illness, Human Resources (HR) will immediately notify the ADOA, Risk Management Section, by phone to effectuate changes in industrial claim payments.<P>Departments will provide alternate duty assignments as appropriate work is available.  These assignments need not be identified in advance, but will be determined by the need of the department.<P>Length of time for alternate duty assignment shall be for a maximum of up to six months.  There is no minimum length of time for alternate duty assignment.<P>The length of time a probationary employee is on alternate duty assignment will not be counted toward the completion of the six-month probationary period. <P>If no alternate duty assignment is available in the employee&#146;s department with the work restrictions stipulated by the physician, or the alternate duty assignment has ended, the employee will be placed in the appropriate leave status.<P>While temporarily assigned to the alternate duty assignment program, the employee will be paid at his or her regular base pay.<P>Salary increases shall be in accordance <A HREF="spp403-08.html">SPP 403-08</A>, &#147;Salary Adjustments.&#148;<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Placement of <A HREF="spp002.html#perm disability">Permanently Disabled</A> Employees</B></FONT><P>At the end of six months, if an employee is determined to be unable to return to his or her regular position, the department is responsible for bringing this determination to the attention of HR and ASU&#146;s Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) coordinator in the Office of Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action (see the <I>Academic Affairs Policies and Procedures Manual,</I> at <A HREF="../acd/acd405.html" TARGET="NEW">ACD 405</A>, &#147;Americans with Disabilities&#148;).<P>&#160;<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><HR><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">SPP</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | SPP&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="spp001.html">contact</A> | Human&#160;Resources&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="hr.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
