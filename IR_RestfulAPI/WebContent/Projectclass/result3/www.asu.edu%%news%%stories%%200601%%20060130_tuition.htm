<h1 class="storyhead">ASU recommends tuition investments to improve student success and access</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p><em><strong>Increases cover inflation at two campuses, inflation and special needs at the third</strong></em></p>
<p>In its ongoing efforts to improve student success and access, ASU has recommended resident undergraduate tuition increases at two of its campuses to cover inflationary costs. At its third campus, financial conditions require the university to request a modest tuition increment above inflation.</p>
<p>Using the Higher Education Price Index (HEPI), which measures the increased cost of providing the same mix of academic goods and services from one year to the next, ASU has recommended resident undergraduate tuition increases at its West and Polytechnic campuses of 3.5 percent, or $149, to cover the inflationary costs of providing the academic programs and services at the schools on those campuses.</p>
<p>Gov. Janet Napolitano&rsquo;s fiscal year 2007 budget proposal and the Legislature&rsquo;s recognition of enrollment growth funding as a crucial element of ASU&rsquo;s budget are critical factors in the university&rsquo;s ability to limit tuition increases at the West and Polytechnic campuses to inflation. These factors also contribute to the university&rsquo;s decision to recommend for its schools in Tempe a 5 percent resident undergraduate tuition increase above the 3.5 percent inflationary index, bringing the total to 8.5 percent, or $366.</p>
<p>The schools at the Tempe campus offer a mix of academic programs that are more costly to create and maintain. Because these programs have been seriously underfunded for more than 15 years, they require additional investment to bring them to the appropriate funding levels.</p>
<p>The long-term intent is to have predictable future tuition increases by holding them, when possible, to the HEPI inflationary increase.</p>
<p>Resident graduate tuition would increase by 8.5 percent, or $464. The base non-resident undergraduate and graduate rates would increase by $750 and $786 respectively, and non-resident students who were given a one-year tuition-increase moratorium last year will pay the full non-resident rate.</p>
<p>In recent years, tuition increases have funded the initiatives that have led to improved student retention and graduation rates, and that also have helped improve student access to the university. In addition, enhanced educational programs and services have resulted in large and sustained enrollment increases at ASU.</p>
<p>The tuition recommendations, subject to the approval of the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR), were made after meetings with elected student leaders on all ASU campuses and after several student town halls. As they were last year, students have been consulted for their recommendations for specific uses of the additional tuition revenue.</p>
<p>ASU is committed to student success and to supporting Arizona families from a wide range of income levels. As in past years, tuition increases will be used to improve academic programs and services that enhance student success, and to increase financial aid. </p>
<p>Student financial aid provided by ASU through its own resources, already a multimillion-dollar effort, would increase by $10 million under this recommendation. Other uses of tuition increases in recent years have been to hire new faculty, improve library services, enhance security, launch important new academic programs, and buy new lab and computer equipment. </p>
<p>As a result of ABOR&rsquo;s redesign of the state university system, ASU is committed to expanding to meet the population growth in Arizona and the increased demand for a university education. Enrollment at ASU has increased from just over 50,000 students in 2000 to more than 61,000 in 2005. In this academic year alone, ASU had a 5 percent enrollment increase. The combined enrollment at all three state universities increased by a net of 3,300 students this year. Of that number, 3,100 came to ASU.</p>
<p>The 2005 ASU freshman class, at 8,476 students (a 9.7 percent increase from fall 2004), was the largest, most qualified and most diverse in the university&rsquo;s history. Sixteen percent of all new freshmen ranked in the top 5 percent of their high school graduating class, and 28 percent of all entering freshmen ranked in the top 10 percent of their high school graduating class. </p>
<p>In addition, ASU enrolled 5,395 new transfer students this year, the majority of them coming from the Maricopa Community College District.</p>
<p>A college education is the best investment families can make in the futures of their children. In 2002, the difference in average lifetime earnings for a college graduate over a high school graduate was estimated at $2.2 million. A university education not only is a great investment, but in Arizona it remains relatively inexpensive. Tuition in the state university system still ranks in the bottom third of major public universities.</p>
<p>Tuition hearings are scheduled to take place from 5 &ndash; 7 p.m., Feb. 27, at the following locations:</p>
<p>&bull; Tempe campus, Alumni Lounge, Memorial Union.</p>
<p>&bull; Polytechnic campus, Ballroom B, Student Union.</p>
<p>&bull; West campus, Sands 125.</p>
<p>&bull; Downtown Center, room C213.</p>
