      <h2><strong>Student Production begins new season with the sensual classic, 
        Salome </strong> </h2>
      <p> Student Production in the Herberger College of Fine Arts at ASU presents 
        Salome, Oscar Wilde's adaptation of the biblical account of John the Baptist's 
        beheading at the request of Herod's stepdaughter Salome. Salome looks 
        at mankind's insatiable desire and passion for what it cannot have and 
        shows the lengths that will be taken to obtain what is forbidden.</p>
      <p>Student Production is a student-driven organization within the department 
        of theatre that is committed to providing opportunity, resources, and 
        support to ASU students who are ready for the challenge of bringing their 
        artistic vision to life.</p>
      <p>WHEN: February 23-25, 2003</p>
      <p>WHERE: The Student Laboratory Theatre at the Prism, 851 E. Tyler Street 
        in the Ritter Building on the ASU campus (northwest corner of Terrace 
        and Rural, just south of University Drive). </p>
      <p>TICKETS: $3 available at the door only</p>
      <p>INFORMATION, TICKETS: 480-727-7877; student_production@hotmail.com</p>
      <p>In today's fast-paced American society, people are constantly enticed 
        with many different choices and are told that every desire is within reach. 
        The demand of instant gratification is an expectation that society cannot 
        live without. But what happens when that desire is left ungratified? Oscar 
        Wilde's classic story Salome examines what happens when fantasy and passion 
        cross the line into obsession.</p>
      <p>Wilde's retelling of the biblical account of John the Baptist's beheading 
        is told through Salome, the princess of Judea and stepdaughter to King 
        Herod. Salome, who knew the power she possessed over men, was used to 
        being able to have whatever she desired. She felt she had everything she 
        wanted until she met the prophet Jokannan, who denied her advances. This 
        one man she couldn't have quickly became a dangerous obsession to Salome 
        that eventually led to her madness and her pursuit to stop at nothing 
        until she got what she wanted. Through Salome, audiences observe the dark 
        side to human nature and find out what happens when desires are left unsatisfied.</p>
      <p>Director Ally Jenson has been intrigued by this examination of desire 
        and obsession dealt with in Salome since her first time reading it and 
        has worked to bring this classic play to life. She feels this is an important 
        piece in today's world and wants to show that the character of Salome 
        is comparable to many aspects of people of today. "This play has the power 
        to move people, and that is my ultimate goal as a director, to move people 
        in a way that causes them to look inside themselves and answer honestly 
        about what they see.&quot;</p>
      <p>Salome is the first show of the Student Production Spring 2003 Season. 
        This season includes a wide array of performance pieces and of classic 
        and contemporary writings that range from the classic story Salome to 
        the contemporary new writings of Neil Labute. Salome will be followed 
        by the original dance piece Blush: Memoirs of a Show Girl on March 9-11.<br>
