FUNCTION
          5740-XXH  (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 1987

     The RALTER command is used to change an existing profile for one
     or more named resources in a specified class.

    The checks listed below are performed for each resource to
    determine if you have sufficient authority to perform the
    operation.  When any condition is true, you have sufficient
    authority.
         - You have the SPECIAL attribute, or
         - You have the group-SPECIAL attribute and the profile is
           owned by the group or by a user owned by the group, or
         - You have the AUDITOR attribute or group-AUDITOR authority
           over the resource, or
         - You are the owner of the resource, or
     (for discrete names only)
         - You are authorized to the resource with ALTER authority, or
         - You are not explicitly authorized to the resource, but your
           current connect group is authorized to the resource with
           ALTER authority, or
         - Neither you nor your current connect group is explicitly
           authorized to the resource, but the universal access to the
           resource is ALTER.

     If the ADDVOL operand is specified, you must be authorized to
     define resources in the TAPEVOL class or have the SPECIAL
     attribute.

     If the GLOBALAUDIT operand is specified, you must have the
     AUDITOR attribute or group-AUDITOR authority over the resource.
     Having the AUDITOR attribute alone is sufficient authority if
     only the GLOBALAUDIT operand is specified.

     If the ADDMEM operand is specified, you must have sufficient
     authority to the member resource. If the member resource is not
     RACF protected, you must be authorized to define resources in
     the member resource class. If the member resource is RACF
     protected, you must have ALTER authority to, be the owner of,
     or have group-SPECIAL authority over the resource.

     If the class-name is given as GLOBAL then only one
     profile-name may be given, and it must be either data set or a
     NON-GROUP class defined in the class descriptor table.  In
     addition, if the ADDMEM or DELMEM operand is given and
     profile-name is given as data set, then the above authority
     rules are replaced by the following:
       (1) you have the SPECIAL attribute, or
       (2) the high-level qualifier of the member name is equal to
           your  userid.

     If you have group-SPECIAL authority in a group and ALTER
     authority to the global data set resource group, you can add or
     delete global data set names where the high-level qualifier is
     the group identifier, or is a userid owned by the group.

      added to the volume set to which the resource belongs.  If this
      operand is specified, only a single volume serial number can be
      specified as the profile name.

      This operand applies to the TAPEVOL class only, and is ignored
      for generic names.

  DELVOL(volume-serial...)
      Specifies the volume serial number(s) of tape volume(s) to be
      deleted from the volume set to which resource belongs.  If this
      operand is specified, only a single volume serial number can be

      This operand applies to the TAPEVOL class only, and is ignored
      for generic names.

  ADDMEM(member-name...)
      Specifies the resource name(s) to be added to the resource
      group(s) indicated by the second positional operand.  The member
      resource may be RACF protected, but need not be.  For members of
      resources in the global class, the member name may be followed
      by an access level ( /NONE, /READ, /UPDATE, /CONTROL, or
      /ALTER).  The default access level is /READ.

      This operand applies to resource group classes only.

  DELMEM(member-name...)

      profile in the SECDATA class.

  DELCATEGORY(category-name ...|*)
      Specifies one or more category names to be deleted from the
      profile.  If DELCATEGORY(*) is specified all category names will
      be deleted.  If DELCATEGORY is specified without any category
      names, all undefined category names will be deleted.

  SECLEVEL(seclevel-name)
      Specifies an installation-defined security level name.  The
      argument must be in the member list of the SECLEVEL profile in
      the SECDATA class.

                        mm is minutes (00-59).

  TIMEZONE(E | W hh.mm)
      Specifies the time zone location of a remote terminal so that
      time calculations for the WHEN parameter can be correctly
      handled by the system.  The location relative to the CPU is
      indicated by either E for east or W for west, with hh indicating
      hours.  Valid values are 0 thru 11.  For irregular timezones, mm
      indicates minutes in excess of whole hours.  Valid values are 0
      thru 59.

  NOTIMEZONE
      Specifies that the terminal is located in the same time zone as
      the CPU.

  ICH11001I NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPECIFY GLOBALAUDIT FOR entity-name;
            OPERAND IGNORED

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to
            specify the GLOBALAUDIT operand for the entity indicated
            in the message.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the operand.  Command
            processing continues with the next operand.

  ICH11002I AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE ONLY GLOBALAUDIT FOR entity-name;
            REMAINING OPERANDS IGNORED

            Explanation:  You have specified operands in addition to
            GLOBALAUDIT, but only for the indicated entity name, are
            you authorized to specify the GLOBALAUDIT operand.  RACF
            ignores all operands other than GLOBALAUDIT.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            operand.

  ICH11003I NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPECIFY OWNER FOR entity-name;
            OPERAND IGNORED

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to
            specify the OWNER operand for the indicated entity name.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the OWNER operand.  Command
            processing continues with the next operand.

  ICH11004I operand DOES NOT APPLY TO class-name CLASS ENTITIES;
            OPERAND IGNORED

            Explanation:  The indicated operand does not apply to the
            indicated class.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the operand.  Command
            processing continues with the next operand.

  ICH11005I LIST OF ENTITY NAMES SPECIFIED; operand OPERAND IGNORED

            Explanation:  You have specified an entity name list.
            Only a single entity name is allowed (1) when the ADDVOL
            or DELVOL operands are specified or (2) when the class
            name is specified as GLOBAL or SECDATA and the ADDMEM or
            DELMEM operands are specified.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the operand.  Command
            processing continues with the next operand.

  ICH11006I NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPECIFY ADDVOL; OPERAND IGNORED

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to
            specify the ADDVOL operand.

  ICH11007I entity-name CANNOT BE SPECIFIED IN DELVOL LIST;
            entity-name NOT DELETED

            Explanation:  The volume serial number indicated by
            entity-name was specified on the profile-name operand and
            the DELVOL operand.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the request to delete the
            entity name.  Command processing continues with the next
            volume serial number specified on the DELVOL operand.

  ICH11008I (seclevel-name | category-name) TO BE DELETED
            SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM ALL USER AND RESOURCE PROFILES

            Explanation:  A category or security level has been
            deleted from a profile in the SECDATA class. The security
            categories or security levels that correspond to the
            name(s) deleted should be deleted from all user and
            resource profiles or unexpected errors in RACF processing
            may occur.

  ICH11009I RACLISTED PROFILES FOR class-name WILL NOT REFLECT THE
            UPDATE(S) UNTIL A SETROPTS REFRESH IS ISSUED

            Explanation:  The profile class exists in common storage,
            but the profile updates will not become effective until
            the SETROPTS command is issued with the REFRESH operand.

  ICH11102I entity-name NOT DEFINED TO CLASS class-name

            Explanation:  The indicated entity name has not been
            previously defined to RACF in the indicated class.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            entity name.

  ICH11103I NOT AUTHORIZED TO ALTER entity-name

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to
            alter the indicated entity.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            entity name.

  ICH11104I volser NOT IN VOLUME SET OF entity-name; VOLUME
            NOT DELETED

            Explanation:  The indicated volume serial number (volser)
            specified on the DELVOL operand does not belong to the
            volume set of the indicated entity.

            System Action:  The volume serial number is not deleted.
            Command processing continues with the next operand.

  ICH11105I member-name ALREADY DEFINED TO GROUP entity-name

            Explanation:  The resource name specified on the ADDMEM
            operand is already a member of the resource group being
            altered.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            member name.

  ICH11106I volser ALREADY DEFINED TO CLASS TAPEVOL

            Explanation:  The volume serial number (volser) specified
            on the ADDVOL operand is already defined to RACF in the
            TAPEVOL class.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            operand.

  ICH11107I member-name NOT DEFINED TO GROUP entity-name

            Explanation:  The resource name specified on the DELMEM
            operand is not a member of the resource group being
            altered.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            member name.

  ICH11108I NOT AUTHORIZED TO ADD member-name

            Explanation:  The user of the RALTER command does not have
            sufficient authority to specify the indicated resource
            name on the ADDMEM operand.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            member name.

  ICH11111I SINGLEDS IGNORED.  VOLUME volser CONTAINS MORE
            THAN ONE DATA SET - xxxxx IGNORED

            Explanation:  The indicated volume already contains more
            than one entry in the TVTOC.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            operand.

  ICH11112I TVTOC IN USE. NOTVTOC IGNORED

            Explanation:  A TVTOC that  protects a tape data set
            already exists.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the NOTVTOC operand.  Command
            processing continues with the next operand.

  ICH11113I DELVOL volume PROCESSING IGNORED.  A TVTOC ENTRY
            EXISTS FOR A DATA SET ON THE VOLUME.

            Explanation:  The DELVOL operand was specified for a
            volume that has TVTOC entries for a tape data set(s) on
            the volume. The data set(s) must be deleted before the
            volume can be deleted.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            option.

  ICH11114I category ALREADY DEFINED TO profile-name

            Explanation:  The security category indicated in the
            message has already been defined in this profile.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the operand.  Command
            processing continues with the next operand.

  ICH11115I category NOT DEFINED TO profile-name

            Explanation:  The security category indicated in this
            message has not been defined to this profile.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the operand.  Command
            processing continues with the next operand.

  ICH11118I COMMAND PROCESSING TERMINATED.  NO (SECLEVELS | CATEGORIES)
            FOUND

            Explanation:  RACF could not validate the name you
            specified on the SECLEVEL or ADDCATEGORY keyword. This
            happened for one of two reasons:

            o   There is no SECLEVEL or CATEGORY profile.
            o   A profile is defined, but it doesn't contain any
                members.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH11201I NOT AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE RALTER

            Explanation:  You are not defined to RACF and cannot issue
            the RALTER command, or RACF is not active.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH11301I entity-name AND REMAINING ENTITIES NOT ALTERED

            Explanation:  The indicated entity-name and remaining
            entity names in the list were not altered because of one
            of the following:

            o   A RACF manager error occurred.  In this case, the
                message is preceded by a RACF manager error message
                explaining the error.

            o   A system error occurred while building in-storage
                profiles (via RACLIST) for the entity names specified
                by the ADDMEM operand or the member class associated
                with the specified class is currently inactive.

            o   A system error occurred while checking (via FRACHECK)
                the user's authority to the entities specified by the
                ADDMEM operand.

  ICH11302I VOLUME volser AND REMAINING VOLUMES NOT (ADDED/DELETED)

            Explanation:  The indicated volser and all remaining
            volumes in the ADDVOL/DELVOL list were not added to or
            deleted from a volume set because an error occurred in the
            RACF manager.  A RACF manager error message precedes this
            message and explains the error.

            System Action:  Other operands on the command have been
            processed.  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH11303I MEMBER member-name AND REMAINING MEMBERS NOT PROCESSED
            FOR ENTITY entity-name
