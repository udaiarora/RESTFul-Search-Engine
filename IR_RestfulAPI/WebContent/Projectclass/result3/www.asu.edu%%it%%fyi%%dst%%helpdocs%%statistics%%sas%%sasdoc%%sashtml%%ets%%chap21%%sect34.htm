<BR><BR><H3><I>Stable, Moving and Combined Seasonality Tests on the Final Unmodified SI Ratios (Table D8)</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxx110128">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxx110129">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxx110130">&#13;</A>Past releases of PROC X11 printed the
&#34;Stable Seasonality Test&#34; after Table D8. 
Two additional tests have been added and are
printed the just after the &#34;Stable Seasonality Test&#34;.
The motivation, interpretation, and statistical details
of all these tests are now given.
<BR><BR><H4><I>Motivation</I></H4>
<BR><BR>The seasonal component of this time series,
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>, is defined as the intrayear
variation that is repeated constantly (stable)
or in an evolving fashion from year to year (moving
seasonality).
<BR><BR>To determine if stable seasonality if present in a series, 
PROC X11 computes a one-way analysis of variance using the 
seasons (months or quarters) as the factor on 
the Final Unmodified SI Ratios (Table D8). This is
the appropriate table to use since the removal of the 
trend-cycle is equivalent to detrending. 
PROC X11 prints this test, labeled 
&#34;Stable Seasonality Test&#34; immediatley after the
Table D8. This test has not changed from previous releases.
<BR><BR>The X11 seasonal adjustment method allows for
slowing evolving seasonality. PROC X11 now computes
and prints a test for seasonality when it is evolving or 
moving. The test is a two-way analysis
of variance using months (or quarters) and years.
As in the &#34;Stable Seasonality Test&#34;, this analysis 
of variance is performed on
the Final Unmodified SI Ratios (Table D8).
PROC X11 prints this test, labeled 
&#34;Moving Seasonality Test&#34; after the
&#34;Stable Seasonality Test&#34;.
<BR><BR>The final new test that PROC X11 computes
is a combined or joint test of both 
stable and moving seasonality.
This test combines the two F-tests previously described,
along with the Kruskal-Wallis Chi-squared test 
for the stable seasonality to determine &#34;identifiable&#34; 
seasonality. This test, labeled &#34;Combined Test for the Presence 
of Identifiable Seasonality&#34;,
is printed after the &#34;Moving Seasonality Test&#34;.
<BR><BR><H4><I>Interpretation and Statistical Details</I></H4>
<BR><BR>The &#34;Stable Seasonality Test&#34; is a one-way
analysis of variance on the 
&#34;Final Unmodified SI Ratios&#34; with seasons
(months or quarters) as the factor.
<BR><BR>To determine if stable seasonality if present in a series, 
PROC X11 computes a one-way analysis of variance using the 
seasons (months or quarters) as the factor on 
the Final Unmodified SI Ratios (Table D8). This is
the appropriate table to use since the removal of the 
similar to detrending.
<BR><BR>A large F and small signifigance
level is evidence that a signifigant amount of variation in 
the SI-ratios is due to months or quarters, which in
turn is evidence of seasonality; the null 
hypothesis of no month/quarter effect is rejected.
<BR><BR>Conversely, a small F and large signifigance 
level (close to 1.0) is evidence that 
variation due to month or quarter could be due 
random error and the null hypothesis of no 
month/quarter effect is not rejected. The 
interpretation and utility of seasonal 
adjustment is problematical under such conditions.
<BR><BR>The F-test for moving seasonality is performed 
by a two-way analysis of variance. The two
factors are seasons (months or quarters) and
years. The years effect is tested separately;
the null hypothesis is no effect due to years
after accounting for variation due to months or quarters.)
<BR><BR>The signifigance level reported in both the
moving and stable seasonality test is only approximate.
Table D8, the Final Unmodified SI Ratios is
contructed from an averaging operation which 
induces a correlation 
in the residuals from which which the F-test is 
computed. Hence the computed F-statistic differs 
from an exact F; see Cleveland and Devlin, 1980 
for details.
<BR><BR>The test for identifiable seasonality is performed
by combining the F-tests for stable and moving 
seasonality, along with a Kruskal-Wallis test 
for stable seasonality. The description below is
based on Dagum, (1980); for further details, see
Lothian and Morry, 1978b.
<BR><BR>Let F<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>s</I></SUB></SPAN> and F<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>m</I></SUB></SPAN> denote the F-value for the
stable and moving seasonality tests respectively.
The combined test is performed as follows.
<BR><BR>1) If the null hypothesis in the moving seasonality tests is not 
rejected at the 0.10 % level (one thousandths percent),  
the seasonality is not identifiable.
<BR><BR>2) If the null hypothesis in 1) is rejected, but the 
moving seasonality null hypothesis is not rejected
at the 5.0% level, then compute the following quantities:
<BR><BR>
<DL CLASS="equation"><DD>
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>T<SUb>1</SUb></I> = [7/(<I>F</I><sub><I>m</I></sub> - <I>F</I><sub><I>s</I></sub>)],</SPAN>
</DL><BR>
<DL CLASS="equation"><DD>
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>T<SUb>2</SUb></I> = [(3<I>F</I><sub><I>m</I></sub>)/(<I>F</I><sub><I>s</I></sub>)].</SPAN>
</DL><BR>Let T denote the simple average of 
T<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> and T<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>:

<DL CLASS="equation"><DD>
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>T</I> = [((<I>T<SUb>1</SUb></I>+<I>T<SUb>2</SUb></I>))/2];</SPAN>
</DL><BR>if T <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/x11eq29.gif"
 ALT="{\ge}"> 1.0, the null hypothesis of identifiable
seasonality <I>not</I> present is accepted.
<BR><BR>3) If the moving seasonality f-test based on
F<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>M</I></SUB></SPAN> passes, but one of the two statistics
based on the T's fails, or the Kruskal-Wallis 
Chi-squared test fails at the 1% level, the
then PROC X11 prints &#34;Identifiable Seasonality
Probably Present&#34;
<BR><BR>4) If the F<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>S</I></SUB></SPAN>, F<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>M</I></SUB></SPAN> and the Kruskal-Wallis 
Chi-squared test pass, then the null hypothesis
(of identifiable seasonality <I>not</I> present
if rejected, and PROC X11 prints &#34;Identifiable 
Seasonality Present&#34;.
<BR><BR><H3><I>Tables Written to the OUT= data set</I></H3>
All tables that are time series can be written to the
OUT= data set. However, depending on the specified options
and statements, not all tables are computed. When a table is
not computed, but is requested in the OUTPUT statement, the
resulting variable has all missing values.
<BR><BR>For example, if the PMFACTOR= option is not specified,
table A2 is not computed, and requesting this table in
the OUTPUT statement results in the corresponding variable
having all missing
values.
<BR><BR>The trading-day regression results, tables B15
and C15, although not written to the OUT= data set,
can be written to an output data set; see the
&#34;OUTTDR=&#34; option for details.
<BR><BR><H3><I>Printed Output Generated by Sliding Spans Analysis</I></H3>
<H4><I>Table S 0.A</I></H4>
<BR><BR>Table S 0.A gives the variable name, the length and
number of spans, and the beginning and ending dates
of each span.
<BR><BR><H4><I>Table S 0.B</I></H4>
<BR><BR>Table S 0.B gives the summary of the two f-tests 
performed during the standard X11 seasonal adjustments 
for stable and moving seasonality on table D8, the
final SI ratios. These tests are described in 
&#34;Printed Output&#34; in the &#34;PROC X11&#34; chapter.
<BR><BR><H4><I>Table S 1.A</I></H4>
<BR><BR>Table S 1.A gives the range analysis of seasonal factors.
This includes the means for each month (or quarter) within
a span, the maximum percent difference across spans for
each month and the average. The minimum and maximum within
a span is also indicated.
<BR><BR>For example, for a monthly series and an analysis with four spans, 
the January row would contain a column for each span, with the
value representing the average seasonal factor (Table D10) over
all January calendar months occurring within the span. 
Beside each span column is a character column with either a MIN,
MAX or blank value, indicating which calendar month had the minimum
and maximum value over that span.

<P>The last numeric column of Table S 1.A is the average value over all spans
for each calendar month, with the minimum and maximum row flagged as
in the span columns.
<P><H4><I>Table S 1.B</I></H4>
<P>Table S 1.B gives a summary of range measures for each span. 
The first column, Range Means, is calculated by computing the
maximum and minimum over all months or quarters in a span,
the taking the difference. The next column is the range ratio means,
which is simply the ratio of the previously described maximum and 
minimum.
The next two columns are the minimum and maximum seasonal factors over
the entire span, while the range sf column is the difference of these.
Finally, the last column is the ratio of the Max SF and Min SF columns.
<P><H4><I>Breakdown Tables</I></H4>
<P>Table S 2.A.1 begins the breakdown analysis for the various 
series considered in the sliding spans analysis. The key concept 
here is the MPD described in the Introduction and in 
&#34;Computational Details&#34; above. For a month or
quarter that appears in two or more spans, the maximum percent
difference is computed and tested against a cutoff level. If it
exceeds this cutoff, it is counted as an instance of exceeding the
level. It is of interest to see if such instances fall disproportionately 
in certain months and years. Tables S 2.A.1 - S 6.A.3 display 
this breakdown for all series considered.
<P><H4><I>Table S 2.A.1</I></H4>
<P>Table S 2.A.1 gives the monthly (quarterly) breakdown for
the seasonal factors (table D10). The first column 
identifies the month or quarter. The next column is the
number of times the MPD for D10 exceeded 3.0%, 
followed by the total count. The last 
is the average maximum percentage difference for the corresponding
month or quarter.
<P><H4><I>Table S 2.A.2</I></H4>
<P>Table S 2.A.2 gives the same information as Table S 2.A.1, but
on a yearly basis.
<P><H4><I>Table S 2.A.3</I></H4>
<P>The description of Table S 2.A.3 requires
the definition of &#34;Sign Change&#34; and &#34;Turning Point&#34;.
<P>First, some motivation. Recall that for a highly stable
series, adding or deleting a small number of observations
should not affect the estimation of the various components 
of a seasonal adjustment procedure.
<P>Consider Table D10, the seasonal factors in a sliding spans
analysis that uses 4 spans. For a given observation t, 
looking across the 4 spans, we can easily pick out large 
differences if they occur. More subtle differences can
occur when estimates go from above to below (or vice versa)
a base level. In the case of multiplicative model, the
seasonal factors have a base level of 100.0. So it is
useful to enumerate those instances where both a large
change occurs (an MPD value exceeding 3.0%) and 
a change of sign
(with respect to the base) occur.
<P>Let B denote the base value (which in general
depends on the component being considered and the model type,
multiplicative or additive).
If, for span 1, S<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>(1) is below B
(i.e., S<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>(1)-B is negative) 
and for some subsequent span k, S<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>(k) is above B
(i.e., S<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>(k)-B is positive), then
an positive &#34;Change in Sign&#34; has occurred at observation t.
Similarly, if, for span 1, S<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>(1) is above B,
and for some subsequent span k, S<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>(k) is below B, then
a negative &#34;Change in Sign&#34; has occurred. Both cases,
positive or negative, constitute a 
&#34;Change in Sign&#34;; the actual direction indicated 
in tables S 7.A-S 7.E, which will be
described below.
<P>Another behavior of interest occurs when component estimates
increase then decrease (or vice versa) across spans for a
given observation. Using the example above, the seasonal
factors at observation t could first increase, then decrease
across the 4 spans. This behavior, combined with an MPD exceeding the 
level is of interest in questions of stability.
<P>Again, consider Table D10, the seasonal factors in a sliding spans
analysis that uses 4 spans. For a given observation t, 
(containing at least three spans), note the level of D10
for the first span. Continue across the spans until a difference
of 1.0% or greater occurs (or no more spans are left), 
noting whether the difference is up or down. 
If the difference is up, continue until a difference of 
1.0% or greater occurs downward (or no more spans are 
left). If such an up-down combination occurs, the observation
is counted as an up-down turning point. A similar description
occurs for a down-up turning point. Tables 
S 7.A-S 7.E, described below, show the occurrence
of turning points, indicating whether up-down or
down-up. Note that it requires at least three spans
to test for a turning point. Hence Tables S 2.A.3 -
S 6.A.3 show a reduced number in the &#34;Turning Point&#34;
row for the &#34;Total Tested&#34; column, and in Tables 
S 7.A - S 7.E, the turning points symbols can only occur
where three or more spans overlap.
<P>With these descriptions of sign change and turning point, we
now describe Table S 2.A.3. The first column gives the type or
category, the second gives the total number of observations
falling into the category, the third column gives the
total number tested, and the last column gives the percentage
for the number found in the category.
<P>The first category (row) of the table is for flagged observations,
i.e., those observations where the MPD exceeded the appropriate
cutoff level (3.0% is default for the seasonal factors.) 
The second category is for level changes, while
the third category is for turning points. 
The fourth category is for flagged sign changes, i.e.,
for those observations that are sign changes, how many
are also flagged. Note the total tested column for 
this category equals the number found for sign change,
reflecting the definition of the fourth category.
<P>The fifth column is for flagged turning points, 
i.e., for those observations that are turning points,
how many are also flagged.
<P>The footnote to Table S 2.A.3 gives the Census Bureau recommendation
for thresholds, as described in &#34;Computational Details&#34; earlier
in this section.
<P><H4><I>Table S 2.B</I></H4>
<P>Table S 2.B gives the histogram of flagged for seasonal factors
(Table D10) using the appropriate cutoff value (default 3.0%).
This table looks at the spread of the number of times the MPD
exceeded the  corresponding level. The range is
divided up into four intervals: 3.0%-4.0%, 4.0%-5.0%, 5.0%-6.0% and
greater than 6.0%. The first column shows the symbol used in
table S 7.A; the second column gives the range in interval
notation, and the last column gives the number found in the
corresponding interval. Note that the sum of the last column
should agree with the &#34;Number Found&#34; column of the &#34;Flagged
MPD&#34; row in Table S 2.A.3.
<P><H4><I>Table S 2.C</I></H4>
<P>Table S 2.C gives selected percentiles for the MPD for the
seasonal factors (Table D10).
<P><H4><I>Tables S 3.A.1 - S 3.A.3</I></H4>
<P>These table relate to the Trading Day Factors (Table C18),
and follow the same format as Tables S 2.A.1-S 2.A.3.
The only difference between these tables and S 2.A.1-S 2.A.3 
is the default cutoff value of 2.0% instead of the 3.0% used 
for the Seasonal Factors.
<P><H4><I>Tables S 3.B, S 3.C</I></H4>
<P>These tables, applied to the Trading Day Factors (Table C18),
are the same format as tables S 2.B - S 2.C. The default 
cutoff value is different, with corresponding differences in
the intervals in S 3.B.
<P><H4><I>Tables S 4.A.1 - S 4.A.3</I></H4>
<P>These table relate to the Seasonally Adjusted Series (Table D11),
and follow the same format as Tables S 2.A.1-S 2.A.3.
The same default cutoff value of 3.0% is used.
<P><H4><I>Tables S 4.B, S 4.C</I></H4>
<P>These tables, applied to the Seasonally Adjusted Series (Table D11)
are the same format as tables S 2.B - S 2.C.
<P><H4><I>Tables S 5.A.1 - S 5.A.3</I></H4>
<P>These table relate to the Month-to-Month (or 
Quarterly-to-Quarterly) differences in the 
Seasonally Adjusted Series,
and follow the same format as Tables S 2.A.1-S 2.A.3.
The same default cutoff value of 3.0% is used.
<P><H4><I>Tables S 5.B, S 5.C</I></H4>
<P>These tables, applied to the
 Month-to-Month (or Quarterly-to-Quarterly) differences in the 
Seasonally Adjusted Series,
are the same format as tables S 2.B - S 2.C. 
The same default cutoff value of 3.0% is used.
<P><H4><I>Tables S 6.A.1 - S 6.A.3</I></H4>
<P>These table relate to the
Year-to-Year differences in the 
Seasonally Adjusted Series,
and follow the same format as Tables S 2.A.1-S 2.A.3.
The same default cutoff value of 3.0% is used.
<P><H4><I>Tables S 6.B, S 6.C</I></H4>
<P>These tables, applied to the
 Year-to-Year differences in the 
Seasonally Adjusted Series,
are the same format as tables S 2.B - S 2.C. 
The same default cutoff value of 3.0% is used.
<P><H4><I>Table S 7.A</I></H4>
<P>Table S 7.A gives the entire listing of the 
Seasonal Factors (Table D10) for each span. 
The first column gives the date for each observation
included in the spans. Note that the dates do not
cover the entire original data set. Only those observations
included in one or more spans are listed.
<P>The next N columns (where N is the number of spans) 
are the individual spans starting at the
earliest span. The span columns are labeled by their beginning
and ending dates.
<P>Following the last span is the &#34;Sign Change&#34;
column. As explained in the description of Table S 2.A.3,
a sign change occurs at a given observation when the 
seasonal factor estimates go from above to below, or
below to above, a base level. For the seasonal factors,
100.0 is the base level for the multiplicative model,
0.0 for the additive model. A blank value indicates no
sign change, a &#34;U&#34; indicates a movement &#34;upwards&#34; from
the base level and a &#34;D&#34; indicates a movement &#34;downwards&#34; 
from the base level.
<P>The next column is the &#34;Turning Point&#34; column. 
As explained in the description of Table S 2.A.3,
a turning point occurs when there is an upward then
downward movement, or downward then upward movement of 
sufficient magnitude. A blank value indicates no
turning point, a &#34;U-D&#34; indicates a movement &#34;upwards then 
downwards&#34; and a &#34;D-U&#34; indicates a movement &#34;downwards then
upwards&#34;.
<P>The next column is the maximum percent difference (MPD). This quantity,
described in &#34;Computational Details&#34; above, is the main computation
for sliding spans analysis. A measure of how extreme the MPD value
is given in the last column, the &#34;Level of Excess&#34; column. The symbols
used and their meaning is described in Table S 2.A.3. If a given
observation has exceeded the cutoff, the level of excess column is blank.
<P><H4><I>Table S 7.B</I></H4>
<P>Table S 7.B gives the entire listing of the 
Trading Day Factors (Table C18) for each span. 
The format of this table is exactly like Table S 7.A.
<P><H4><I>Table S 7.C</I></H4>
<P>Table S 7.C gives the entire listing of the 
Seasonally Adjusted Data (Table D11) for each span. 
The format of this table is exactly like Table S 7.A 
except for the &#34;Sign Change&#34; column, which is not
printed. The Seasonally Adjusted Data has the same
units as the original data; there is no natural base
level as in the case of a percentage. Hence the 
sign change is not appropriate for D11.
<P><H4><I>Table S 7.D</I></H4>
<P>Table S 7.D gives the entire listing of the 
Month-to-Month (or Quarter-to-Quarter) Changes 
in Seasonally Adjusted Data for each span. 
The format of this table is exactly like Table S 7.A.
<P><H4><I>Table S 7.E</I></H4>
<P>Table S 7.E gives the entire listing of the 
Year-to-Year Changes 
in Seasonally Adjusted Data for each span. 
The format of this table is exactly like Table S 7.A.
<P><H3><I>Printed Output from the ARIMA Statement</I></H3>
The information printed by default for the
ARIMA model includes the parameter estimates, their
approximate standard errors, t ratios, and variances,
the standard deviation of the error term, and
the AIC and SBC statistics for the model.
In addition, a criteria summary for the chosen model is given
that shows the values for each of the
three test criteria and the corresponding critical values.
<P>If the PRINTALL option is specified, a summary of the
Nonlinear Estimation Optimization
and a table of Box-Ljung Statistics is also produced.
If the automatic model selection is used, this
information is printed for each of the five predefined
models. Lastly, a Model Selection Summary is printed,
showing the final model chosen.
