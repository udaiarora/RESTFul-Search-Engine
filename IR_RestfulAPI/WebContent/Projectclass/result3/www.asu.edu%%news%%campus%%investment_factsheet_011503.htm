      <h2>Arizona State University - Strategic Investments in people and programs 
      </h2>
      <p>Even in times of tight budgetary constraints, it is important to make 
        strategic investments in order to continue a trajectory of progress and 
        prepare the university for when the current financial crisis ends. </p>
      <p>ASU has worked diligently to provide salary equity and is investing to 
        retain its most competitive faculty, staff and administrators. In times 
        of fiscal crisis, when the institution might be viewed as vulnerable and 
        a target for raiding, it is critically important to protect top people. </p> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>More than $15M of internal resources were reallocated during FY95-FY01 
          into faculty and staff pay raises to address market issues and general 
          salary needs. This investment has not closed the market gap but has 
          allowed us to not fall further behind until recently. It is far more 
          expensive to respond to external offers for our best faculty than to 
          address issues pre-preemptively and it is far better managerially.</li>
        <li>Therefore, even in this fiscal crisis we have committed to address 
          the salaries of our critical faculty/administrators and to provide some 
          relief to our lowest paid staff, but we still must address the larger 
          problem of underpaid faculty and staff.</li>
        <li>We are also using the resources of the Capital Campaign, such as endowed 
          chairs and professorships to reward, retain, and recruit most competitive 
          faculty</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The university is moving to become an entrepreneurial institution, focusing 
        on the academic core of the university and enhancing ASU's competitive 
        position using Proposition 301 is a key funding source for initiatives 
        that will drive the future of the university and cannot be used for solving 
        budgetary shortfall.</p>
      <p>We have reorganized the Office of the President for integrated university 
        leadership and coordination, quality control, and rapid, efficient decision 
        making.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Some positions eliminated or phased out </li>
        <li>Expanded duties and areas of responsibility for several key administrators 
        </li>
        <li>National salary survey of comparable administrative positions completed 
          and salaries adjusted appropriately within market range</li>
        <li>Total cost for executive leadership of ASU remains about constant 
          over two-year period </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is a critical window in which the federal government is ramping 
        up its research investments in recognition that the economy will be driven 
        by research discoveries and innovation. Other states are investing in 
        their research capacity to position themselves competitively to leverage 
        research dollars into high value jobs. </p>
      <p>With the help of 301 revenue and other funds, we are making key investments 
        even while we must make difficult budget reductions and reallocations. 
        Some of these key selective investments are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> $30M during FY02 and FY03 of Proposition 301 funds invested in economic 
          drivers, such as biosciences, bioengineering, information science, materials 
          science, manufacturing, technology transfer and workforce development.</li>
        <li> During FY02 and 03, over $8M investment in strategic initiatives 
          from indirect cost and other state and local funds. A few examples of 
          these initiatives include in Religion and Conflict Resolution, K-12 
          teacher preparation and improvement, creative writing, the school of 
          life sciences, Law and Society, Prevention Center, and Environmental 
          Science</li>
      </ul>
