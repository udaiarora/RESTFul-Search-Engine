This task-oriented book will guide you step-by-step through the            fundamentals of the SAS macro facility.  Included are a generous amount
of illustrations, examples, and tips.  With this book you will handily     learn the following: advantages of macro programming, elements of the
macro facility (macro variables, macro programs, macro language), how to   write a macro program, macro programming techniques, tips on using the
macro facility, how the macro facility fits into the SAS System, and       interfaces between the macro facility and other components of the SAS
System. Beginning macro programmers will learn to write SAS macro programs quickly and efficiently.  More experienced macro programmers will find
this book useful to refresh their conceptual knowledge and expand on       their macro programming skills.  The book assumes some SAS programming
experience, including knowledge of how to write a DATA step and how to     use SAS procedures.
