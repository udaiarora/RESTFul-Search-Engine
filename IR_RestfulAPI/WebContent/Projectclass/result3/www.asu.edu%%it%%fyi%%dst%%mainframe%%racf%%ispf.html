    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">RACF via ISPF</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">RACF is used to perform functions
    such as altering the protection of a disk data set to allow other
    people READ access to the data set.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">ISPF option 9.R implements the
    various RACF functions as a series of menus (also called panels).
    Each panel presents several options and/or contains various input
    fields for which you supply values. This is the easiest method
    to work with RACF.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Most panels display a list of
    options, each identified by a letter or a number. To select one
    of the options, type on the command line the letter or number
    corresponding to the action you wish to perform and then press
    the ENTER key. If there are any input fields on the panel which
    require values, you should type appropriate values in the input
    fields before pressing the ENTER key. (Use the TAB key to move
    from one input field to another.)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Each type you select an option,
    another panel may be presented which offers additional options
    or input fields. For some options no additional panels are displayed.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On each panel, there are several
    keys which if pressed will cause an action to occur: ENTER, which
    has already been mentioned; PF1, the HELP key; PF3, the END key;
    and, PF4, the CANCEL key.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">PF1 can be pressed at any time
    to receive additional help regarding the particular panel being
    displayed.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">PF3 can be pressed from any panel
    to complete the processing associated with that panel and return
    to the previous screen. If the panel has any required input fields,
    it may be necessary to supply values in the input fields before
    pressing PF3.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">PF4 can be pressed from any panel
    to stop further processing associated with that panel and return
    to the previous screen.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">ENTER can be pressed from any
    panel to complete the processing associated with that panel;
    however, unlike PF3, a return to the previous screen will not
    be made (except in a few instances). Typically, pressing ENTER
    will cause the same screen to be redisplayed so you can perform
    more of the same function; or, if you selected an option, a subsequent
    panel will be displayed. (If you select an option but press a
    PF key instead of ENTER, the PF key will take precedence.)</FONT>&nbsp;</TD>
