Such ceramics are usually good ionic conductors for oxygen ions at elevated temperatures. A few studies have attempted to correlate the microstructures with ionic conductivity[l-4]. It was suggested that the grain boundaries play a role in depressing the ionic conductivity[l]. In their study, it was found that continuous "thick" boundary layers of secondary phases existed on the grain boundaries and blocked ion transport[l,3].  In the present studies, high resolution transmission electron microscopy has been used to investigate the microstructures of grain boundaries in zirconia doped with calcia (ZrO<sub>2</sub>+13%CaO) and ceria ceramics doped with calcia (CeO<sub>2</sub> + 10% CaO). The ceramics was made in our Solid State lonics Laboratory. Transport number measurements on zirconia samples showed that the transport number  from  = 10<sup>-17</sup> atm to  = 1 atm. Measurements showed that the transport number of the oxygen ions in ceria was small only when the  was very low between 600°C and l000°C. The CSZ was used in a galvanic cell |(CaO)ZrO<sub>2</sub>| = 1 (atm). The open circuit EMF values measured between 600°C and 1000°C agreed well with the calculated values[5]. The TEM ceramic samples were cut into 2.5 X 2.5 X 0.5(mm) discs, then dimpled and ion milled with argon ions. Pores of different sizes are located in the grains and grain boundaries. X-ray dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) has been used to identify the secondary phases and no continuous secondary phase boundary layers have been found on grain boundaries. There is little evidence that secondary phases are present on the grain boundary but small voids of about a few hundred angstroms may exist at the grain boundary. EDX has been used to examine the chemical compositions over a fairly large area. Little secondary phase in grains nor thick boundary layer on grain boundaries has been found. In previous studies by other authors on the microstructures of grain boundaries in CSZ[1,2] and ceria with CaO[3,4], it was suggested that the presence of continuous secondary phase boundary layer on grain boundaries might interrupt the ionic transport. However, for the ceramics used as electrolytes for SOFC, no continuous boundary layers should be present on grain boundaries. Then, in the absence of boundary layers the main blocking of ion transport may be the discontinuity of the crystal structures at grain boundaries because oxygen ion transport through the crystal lattices is the main transport process and the discontinuity of the crystal lattices at grain boundaries may interrupt the ion transport. Pores of different sizes usually exist in ceramic materials. No TEM evidence has been made convincing the effects of pores on ionic transport. It is suggested that the pores at grain boundaries will increase the discontinuity and reduce the ion transport through the grain boundaries.<p><i>Proc. 51st Annual Meeting of the Microscopy Society of America, G.
