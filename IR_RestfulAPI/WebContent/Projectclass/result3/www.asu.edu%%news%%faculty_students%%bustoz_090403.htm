      <h2>SUMS founder, math professor will be missed</h2>
      <p>        <img src="facstudents_images/Bustoz.jpg" alt="Joaquin Bustoz" width="180" height="252" align="right">Beloved colleague, educational leader and mathematician, Professor Joaquin
          Bustoz passed away Aug. 13, from complications of injuries suffered
        in an automobile accident on July 6. </p>
      <p>He was a national leader of efforts
            to encourage under-represented students to study advanced mathematics
            and science. In 1985 he founded the SUMS
          Institute (Strengthening Understanding of Math and Science.) SUMS enables
          talented students from inner city, rural and reservation high schools
          to enroll in rigorous ASU-credit courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry
          and biology.</p>
      <p>Professor Bustoz also initiated many projects to improve
          mathematics instruction in Arizona's reservation schools, obtaining
        funding from
          the National Science Foundation, the Eisenhower Foundation and the
        Arizona Board of Regents. Beginning in 1999 he directed ASU's NSF-funded
        MARC
          (Minority Access to Research Careers) Program. </p>
      <p>Professor Bustoz has been
          recognized by current and past U.S. presidents for his achievements.
          In 2003, President Bush recognized the SUMS Institute
          and in 1996 President Clinton awarded him with the Award for Excellence
          in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring. In 1990, he received
          the National Education Award from the American Association for the
        Advancement of Science.</p>
      <p>In addition to his efforts as mentor and administrator, Professor
          Bustoz pursued a successful career as an active member of the international
          mathematical research community. He published numerous papers in the
          field of classical analysis. His 1975 article "Jacobi polynomial sums
          and univalent Ceasaro means" in the Proceedings of the American Mathematical
          Society is widely cited in mathematics literature. </p>
      <p>In 2000, he helped
          organize a major research conference, the NATO Advanced Study Institute
          on Special Functions, held at ASU. Professor Bustoz collaborated
          frequently with mathematicians in Latin America, Portugal and Spain.
          He helped many Latin American graduate students come to the United
        States for advanced study. </p>
      <p>For contributions to mathematics in Columbia
          he received a special award from the Universidad Nacional de Columbia
          in 1991. In addition,
            Professor
            Bustoz served on advisory committees for the National Science Foundation
            and the Mathematical Association of America.</p>
      <p>Professor Bustoz kept students
          his first priority. He constantly reminded them that minorities can
        succeed at hard science and math. "I will work
          with you," he told discouraged students. He encouraged his students
        to return to their communities to make a contribution. By his own example,
          he showed them how to live a life of service.</p>
      <p>Professor Bustoz spent most
          of his life as a student and faculty member at Arizona State University.
          Born in Tempe Dec. 30, 1939, he attended
          Rural School, located on the northeast corner of Southern and Rural
        Road. At Tempe Union High School he was a member of the track team before
        graduating
          in 1957. As a youth, he worked in local agricultural fields. </p>
      <p>After obtaining
          bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics from ASU in 1961 and
        1963 respectively, he worked for the Navy in San Diego for
          a year before returning to ASU to complete his Ph.D. in mathematics
        in 1967. He taught at Ohio University, the University of Cincinnati and
          the Universidad Nacional de Columbia before returning to ASU in 1975.
          From 1982 to 1985 Professor Bustoz served as chair of the ASU Mathematics
          Department. In 1990 he received the Charles Wexler Award for Excellence
          in Teaching in the Mathematics Department. </p>
      <p>Donations in memory of Professor
          Bustoz may be sent to the Joaquin Bustoz Memorial Scholarship Fund,
        ASU Foundation, P.O. Box 5005, Tempe, AZ 85287-5005.</p>
