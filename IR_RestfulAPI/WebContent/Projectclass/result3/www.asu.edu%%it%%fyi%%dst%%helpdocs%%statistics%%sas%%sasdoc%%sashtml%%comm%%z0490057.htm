<P>Central to the SNA network is the SNA server, which is responsible for
performing connections between local and remote hosts on a local area network
(LAN). 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unqualified reference to Windows means all Windows platforms
- Windows NT, Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 32s.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>

<DT><B>Network Administrator</B></DT>
<DD>To set up an SNA network
perform the following tasks:
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>Install the SNA server.<P>

<LI>Configure the SNA server.<P>

<LI>Configure SNA
clients.<P>

<LI>Optionally configure Host Account Synchronization Service. For
details about installing this service, see <B>Microsoft SNA Server Getting
Started</B> and <B>Installing and Configuring Host Security Integration</B>. <P>
</OL>

<P>You install and configure the SNA server on a Windows NT computer, and
you configure SNA clients on any of three Windows platforms: Windows NT, Windows
32s, Windows 95, and Windows 98. After the SNA server and the SNA clients
are installed and configured, users of SAS/CONNECT and SAS/SHARE can
make connections transparently from their local hosts to the remote hosts
that they want by using the SNA server.<P></DD>

<P>It is assumed
that you already have
completed installation of the SNA server product. Before you can configure
the SNA server, verify that the following tasks have been completed. 
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>Install the appropriate drivers (for example, 802.2  Token  Ring,
Ethernet, or X.25).<P>

<LI>Select the appropriate networking protocols (for example, DLC
for LAN).<P>

<LI>Install the SNA Server link services.
<P>Link services define the protocol that is used between the SNA Server
software and the communications adapters installed in your computer (for example,
802.2 Token Ring, Ethernet, SDLC, or X.25).
<P>If the setup program detects more than one network operating system
on your computer, you must specify which systems you are using (for example,
Microsoft LAN Manager, Novell Netware, or both).<P>

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">Configuring the SNA Server</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>After you have
installed the SNA
server and link supports, use the SNA Server Administration Program (SNA Server
Admin) to perform the following tasks: 
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>Configure the server.<P>

<LI>Specify connections.<P>

<LI>Configure Logical Units (LU)
(local and remote).<P>

<LI>Define LU-to-LU pairs and modes.<P>
</OL>

<BR><H3><A name="z1nfig">Configuring the Server</A></H3>


<P>Configure the SNA server by specifying the local Network Name and Control
Point Name.
<BR><H3>Specifying the Connection Name</H3>


<P>Specify the connection name (for example, 802.2 Token Ring, SDLC, or
X.25) and other properties that are appropriate to your configuration.
<P>Connection properties are the software components of the SNA server
that communicate through the device driver to a particular communications
adapter.
<BR><H3>Configuring Logical Units</H3>


<P>Perform the
following steps
to configure the desired number of logical units: 
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>Configure the desired number of local logical units (LUs) to be
used.
<P>An LU may be dependent or independent.  An LU's ability to perform dependently
or independently in a SAS/CONNECT remote
host session is based on the communications software that your network uses.
<P>SAS/CONNECT can use either a
dependent or an independent LU. If you are using dependent LUs, you must have
one dependent LU defined for each concurrent remote session established by
the local session.  A single independent LU allows multiple concurrent SAS/CONNECT sessions.
<P>SAS/SHARE
requires an independent
LU.  When using Remote Library Services (RLS), SAS/CONNECT also
requires an independent LU.<P>

<LI>Configure the desired number of remote logical units (LUs) to
be used.
<P>You must define all remote LUs to the SNA Server because the Microsoft
SNA Server does not support end node (EN) Advanced Peer-to-Peer Networking
(APPN) capabilities. You must also define remote (or partner) LUs to connect
to a remote host with SAS/CONNECT or
to access a SAS/SHARE server.
<P>When defining a remote LU for an MVS remote host in a SAS/CONNECT session,
you must also account for the LU pooling capabilities of the remote MVS SAS
session so that appropriate surrogate LUs are defined to the SNA Server.
<P>Your options for defining remote LUs follow: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>If using the APPC access method, you may
assign a specific LU
to the APPC_SURROGATE_LUNAME variable. For information about the APPC_SURROGATE_LUNAME
variable, see <A href="z0381795.htm#zcconvar">SAS/CONNECT Only Options</A>.
In this case, you must define this remote LU to the SNA server.<P>

<LI>You may allow the remote OS/390 session to supply an LU from a
pool of LUs. Although you do not need to assign a value to APPC_SURROGATE_LUNAME,
you must define to the SNA server all possible MVS LU names that reside in
this surrogate LU pool.<P>

<LI>Instead of defining surrogate LUs to the SNA server, you may configure
the local LU to accept Implicit Incoming Remote LUs.<P>
</UL>
<P>
</OL>

<BR><H3>Defining LU-LU Pairs and Communications Mode Properties</H3>


<P>Define the local
LU-remote LU pairs, and specify the properties of the communications mode
to be used between each pair.
<P>If site-naming conventions permit, specify the mode name SASAPPC. The
APPC access method uses this mode name if the APPC_LU62MODE variable has not
been defined. See <A href="z0381795.htm#z2csec">SAS/CONNECT  and SAS/SHARE Options</A>
for information about setting APPC_LU62MODE.
<P>Specify the minimum contention-winner parameter, which is relevant for
SAS software because only contention-winner sessions are used for locally
initiated communication.
<P>Communication between SAS/CONNECT local
and remote hosts requires only one contention-winner session. However, this
limit affects the number of data sets that can be accessed concurrently by
means of the  SAS/CONNECT  Remote Library
Services or a SAS/SHARE server.
<P>When defining session limits, define enough sessions so that session
limits will never be reached. If session limits are reached, the next time
a user attempts to connect to a remote host with SAS/CONNECT or
a client host attempts to access a SAS/SHARE server,
the APPC layer will not return to the application layer until a session is
available. Although a lengthy wait may seem like an error condition (such
as no response from SAS or a loop), the underlying APPC layer is waiting for
a session to become available.
<P>You have completed the configuration of a Windows NT SNA server.

<P>This section highlights the general tasks that you perform to configure
an SNA client.  For complete details, see the <B>Microsoft SNA Server Installation

you must perform additional configuration tasks. 
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>Configure TPs (transaction programs) that can be invoked.
<P>You may execute a program named
TPSETUP.EXE, which was supplied by Microsoft

<DT>-LU <B>local-LU-alias</B></DT>
<DD>is the client's alias for the local-LU that you configured
at the SNA server. The assignment of a <B>local-LU-alias</B> to a specific
Windows NT, Windows 95, or Windows 98 client allows the SNA server to route
the incoming request for attachment (ATTACH) to the appropriate client computer
by alias name. The SNA server checks each client's configuration file for
its  <B>local-LU-alias</B>  to determine where to route the request.
If you are going to define SASTP62 and would like more than one remote window
host, you must specify the <B>local-LU-alias</B>.<P></DD>

two Version 7 (or later) sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<P>For Version 6.12 and earlier, you must still define a SASTP62 transaction
program at the host where a SAS/SHARE server
will be executing or where a remote SAS/CONNECT session
will be established.
