                School of Social and Family Dynamics (SSFD) is dedicated to enhancing
                the well-being of individuals, families, and social institutions
                through innovative transdisciplinary research, instructional
                excellence,
              and active community involvement. We strive to be a leader in transformative
                discovery; fusing basic and applied research; and translating
                scientific
              knowledge into solutions for pressing problems related to children,
                youth, families, and their social worlds.</em></p>
            <p>As we enter a new century and millennium, individuals, families, 
              societies, and entire populations are faced with fast-paced and 
              complex changes. Although change has always been part of human life, 
              the scope and speed of change has increased dramatically - and likely 
              will continue to do so. Technological, political, economic, health, 
              social, educational, and cultural forces interact in complex ways 
              to shape human and family life. Additionally, transformations in 
              families, schools, and neighborhoods that are caused by larger social 
              and cultural forces affect the people who comprise or reside in 
              them. The need to understand these changes and the processes that 
              underlie them has compelled institutions of higher learning to change 
              the way they conduct their business. As part of the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/president/newamericanuniversity/">New 
              American University</a>, the School of Social and Family Dynamics 
              in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Arizona State University 
              is designed to be a leader in addressing the most important issues 
              facing individuals as they cope with changes in their lives and 
              as they interact within their social environments - be they large 
              or small, near or distant, personal or impersonal.</p>
            <p>To accomplish these general goals, SSFD reflects a <strong>merger 
              of faculty</strong> from the <strong>former</strong> <strong>Department 
              of Family and Human Development</strong> and the <strong>Department 
              of Sociology</strong>. The Faculty of Family and Human Development 
              come to this nexus with knowledge and experience in many dimensions 
              of individual development and family systems and bring expertise 
              on the biological, psychological, social, cultural, and relational 
              aspects of human and family development throughout the life span. 
              The Faculty of Sociology come to this nexus with scholarly interests 
              and knowledge related to social institutions, health, and population 
              dynamics. Thus, at its core, SSFD faculty represent a body of science, 
              instruction, and service that strives to transcend traditional boundaries 
              and approaches to understanding the interfaces of human development, 
              family life, and the broader social context.</p>
            <p>The new School of Social and Family Dynamics is designed become 
              an organizational and operational center for organizing and supporting 
              bold and innovative thinking and encourage scholars and students 
              to think in novel and visionary ways to address issues related to 
              their areas of interest. As such, SSFD is viewed as an academic 
              unit that is defined by its enabling and facilitative capacities 
              rather than by disciplinary or content-driven boundaries. Consequently, 
              we are in a position to become an eminently powerful force and driver 
              for: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Contributing knowledge about human development, family dynamics, 
                populations, and social environments through interdisciplinary 
                basic and applied research and related scholarly activities;</li>
              <li> Promoting the welfare and health of individuals, families, 
                and social institutions from all cultural backgrounds;</li>
              <li>Preparing graduate students for leadership in research, teaching, 
                business, and outreach roles;</li>
              <li>Contributing to the development of undergraduate students who 
                will be well-prepared to pursue professional careers and graduate 
                education;</li>
              <li>Collaborating within and outside the University in fostering 
                an appreciation of the role that knowledge and science can play 
                in solving critical social problems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our intention is for SSFD to become a national and international 
              leader in changing the ways academic units ask questions, develop 
              and employ scientific methods and technologies, train and educate 
              students, and interact with the broader social community. Together 
              with faculty and program affiliates from across ASU (such as nursing, 
              speech and hearing, education, psychology, etc.) and the local community, 
              SSFD will become central to the transdisciplinary study and advancement 
              of the most important and valued aspects of human life - namely, 
              children, youth, families, cultures, and societies.<br>
