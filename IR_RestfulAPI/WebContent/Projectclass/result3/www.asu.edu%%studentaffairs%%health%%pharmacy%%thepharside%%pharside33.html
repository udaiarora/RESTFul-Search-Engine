				  <p><center><strong>Albuterol Inhalers: Going, going, GONE </strong></center></p>
				  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you have noticed that albuterol inhalers have been slowly increasing in price lately. For over 20 million Americans with asthma and again that many with COPD it&rsquo;s only going to get worse.
				  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the FDA gave its final ruling on albuterol metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) that use chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as propellants. Essentially, they will all be banned after December 31, 2008.
				  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling was in compliance with the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which, in turn, grew out of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer which met throughout the 1990&rsquo;s.
				  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Montreal Protocol has been around awhile, the FDA has delayed the ban on albuterol inhalers, by exempting them as &ldquo;essential use products.&rdquo; There are now 3 non-CFC albuterol inhalers on the market with more to follow. These new MDIs use hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) as a propellant. Other manufacturers are developing inhalers that do not use propellants. You may be familiar with some of these, most notably, the Diskus &reg; system used in Serevent and Advair inhalers.
				  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timeline presents many financial challenges for patients and payors. Prices on generic albuterol inhalers have already started to climb. Generic manufacturers are starting to exit this market and supplies are beginning to be limited, putting even more upward pressure on albuterol inhaler prices. Supplies of these inhalers manufactured before December 31, 2008 will be exhausted in early 2009. It looks like the first truly generic HFA inhaler will hit the market in 2010, so there will be no generic alternative throughout most of 2009 and into 2010.
				  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generic HFA inhalers will certainly cost more than currently available CFC containing inhalers. Even OTC Primatene will be affected by these rulings.
				<img src="images/issue33_002.gif" align="right">
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As patients with limited means are affected by this market turmoil, health officials expect to see an increase in asthma-related Emergency Department visits and hospitalizations. Most manufacturers of asthma products have pledged to increase sample distribution and ramp up patient assistance programs.
                <br>Asthma education will be more important than ever. Good control, with active patient participation, will be essential to patient care. One good side of this situation is that patents on some of the controller medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers will be expiring in the next few years.               
                <br><center><img src="images/issue33_001.gif"></center>
				<p><center><strong>Canadian Drugs? You Sure? </strong></center></p>
                <p>The FDA recently inspected close to 4,000 packages from &ldquo;Canadian&rdquo; internet pharmacies. Only 15% of the drugs were really from Canadian companies. The rest came from 27 different countries and 32 prescriptions contained counterfeit product.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Operation Bait and Switch&rdquo; checked arriving parcels at JFK, Miami International and Los Angeles International airports.</p>
                <p align="center"><strong> Sex Foods (part three) </strong></p>
                <p>It&rsquo;s time to bring this series of articles to a, um, climax. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it may not be strictly classified as a food, <strong>ice</strong>, deserves a mention for its utility as an erotic edible. Fans of Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke recall the &ldquo;ice&rdquo; scene from <em>Nine and &frac12; Weeks</em> with <img src="images/issue33_003.jpg" width="93" height="123" align="right">fondness, and many have &ldquo;tried this                   at home.&rdquo; The effect of cold on erectile tissue has thrilled many lovers throughout time. The cold provides a stimulating contrast to the heat of passion and has zero calories!</p>
                <p> <img src="images/issue33_004.jpg" width="63" height="81" align="left"> For many, the mere smell of <strong>licorice</strong> elicits lusty thoughts. The ancient Chinese used it as a medicine for respiratory ailments. It soon became apparent that it was particularly stimulating to women. Glycrrhizin, a component, is 50 times sweeter than sugar, and the roots contain phytoestrogens, making it a sweet and sexy plant.</p>
                <p><strong>Mustard</strong> has reputation for increasing sexual desire, perhaps by virtue (heh) of its irritating properties. I&rsquo;m talking about the real deal here, fresh ground mustard seed, not French&rsquo;s off the Safeway shelf. Fresh mustard paste was rubbed on the penis as a folk remedy for impotence! No wonder it goes so well on a hot dog! Even the Bible describes it as 'the greatest amongst herbs'.</p>
                <p><strong>Nutmeg</strong> was an arousing spice for ancient Arabs, Greeks and Romans. In India, the secret to a long lasting sexual act is to eat a half-boiled egg with nutmeg and honey an hour before sex. </p>
                <p>Most folks with love-making on their mind avoid <strong>onions</strong>, but <em> The Perfumed Garden</em>, an ancient Arabic guide to sex, tells of a busy guy who stayed erect for 30 days by eating onions daily, even during the acts! I am skeptical and remember to call your doctor if you have an erection that lasts more than four hours!</p>
                <p><strong>Oysters</strong> have been around since Neolithic times and 


                  <img src="images/issue33_005.jpg" width="120" height="80" align="right"> were one of man&rsquo;s first aphrodisiacs. When Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, sprang forth from the sea on an oyster shell and promptly gave birth to Eros, the word &quot;aphrodisiac&quot; was born, not to mention &ldquo;erotic.&rdquo; It is said that Casanova began his dinner by downing a dozen oysters. Roman emperors eagerly paid for oysters with gold. </p>
                <p>In fact, oysters were one of the first commodities &ldquo;worth their weight in gold.&rdquo; These sexy bivalves are rich in </p>
                <p>minerals, especially zinc, and have a sensual texture sliding down your throat. Perhaps part of the allure comes from the old adage &quot;If you can get a woman to eat a raw oyster, you can get her to do anything!&quot; Six oysters provide about 50 calories, so it is a low-cal treat.</p>
                <p>Zinc, so important for male potency, is also found in quantity in pi&#324;on or <strong>pine nuts.</strong> Pine nuts have been use to stimulate libidos since the Middle Ages. They are often used as a garnish on other aphrodisiac foods. They are, obviously, nuts, as well.</p>
                <p><strong>Pineapple </strong>has a reputation as a holistic treatment for impotence in cultures where it is native. It is rich in vitamin C and a spear of pineapple in a jigger of rum makes for a nice apr&egrave;s sex cocktail.</p>
                <p> <img src="images/issue33_007.jpg" width="71" height="108" align="left"> Both <strong>raspberries</strong> and <strong>strawberries</strong> (and of course Barry White) are all mentioned favorably in a variety of erotic literature. There are many references to these &ldquo;fruit nipples&rdquo; being used as erotic toys. They are soft, sweet, juicy, and very edible and may be applied to the body with tenderness or vigor as the occasion demands.</p>
                </td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top"><p>When <strong>tomatoes</strong> were first brought to the Old World from the New World they were thought to be the infamous &ldquo;forbidden fruit&rdquo; of the Garden of Eden. Some folks called them &ldquo;love apples&rdquo; and &ldquo;apples of paradise.&rdquo; They are juicy, tasty and healthful to eat. How you use them is only limited by your imagination.</p>
				<p>The Greeks and the Romans both considered <strong>truffles</strong> to be aphrodisiacal. These underground fungi are tracked down by trained dogs and sows. Most species release pheromones, some of which have been documented to illicit mating behaviors in pigs. They do provide a healthy dose of glutamic acid, which is an important excitatory neurotransmitter. But is it truly an aphrodisiac? Consider this quote from Tanith Tyrr, the Bay Gourmet, &ldquo;But then again, a fine dinner by candlelight, the sweet shaving of white truffles over a perfectly creamy risotto, a tender, blood-rare filet wrapped with wild boar bacon and drenched in black truffle cream, a glass of magnificent Bordeaux, and surely the atmosphere of romance might well accomplish what the chemical alone cannot. Even if the truffle has no aphrodisiacal properties in and of itself, it is still a dish for lovers.&rdquo;</p>
			  <p>The scent and taste of <strong>vanilla</strong> is pleasing to most of us and its folklore adds to its reputation as inspiration for sexual frolicking. It seems that the daughter of a Mexican fertility goddess lusted after a human youth but was unable to consummate her love since her divinity was an issue. It is said that she transformed herself into a vanilla plant in order to provide him with some pleasure and happiness. The Aztec ruler, Montezuma, enjoyed a drink called xocolatl, a beverage that combined chocolate, vanilla, and honey, all three of which have a sexy history.</p>
			  <p><strong>Whipped cream</strong> is a classic sexual food. It&rsquo;s available in convenient spray cans and a lover presented wearing only whipped cream can be explored and uncovered in extremely stimulating ways.</p>
			  <p> <img src="images/issue33_006.jpg" width="85" height="132" align="left"> Let&rsquo;s wrap this up with a nice glass of <strong>wine</strong>, shall we? Good wine, in moderation, is a delight to the senses and tends to lessen inhibitions. Wine drinking from navels is a favorite of some of the more notable sexual adventurers in history and literature. </p>
			  <p>I hope that you enjoyed this look at sexy foods and have a chance to try some in the kitchen or in the bedroom. Have some fun, don&rsquo;t overindulge, and always be considerate. I&rsquo;ll end with the words of the Reverend David Wilkerson, &ldquo;Love is not something you feel. Love is something you do.&rdquo;</p>
			  <p><center><strong>              <img src="images/issue33_008.jpg" width="108" height="108" align="left"> The Book Niche </strong></center></p>
			  Dr. Paul Offit&rsquo;s new book, The Cutter Incident follows the rocky road to the development of the polio vaccine. Work began in the 1930&rsquo;s and he tells of doctors injecting children with poorly inactivated virus, causing untold suffering and even deaths. In the early 50&rsquo;s Jonas Salk found a way to render the virus harmless but capable of eliciting an immune response.
              <p>More problems arose, however, when pharmaceutical companies tried to adapt his methods to large scale production. In 1955, one company, Cutter Labs of Berkeley sent out thousands of doses of vaccine that were contaminated with live virus. Thousands of children were infected, nearly 200 injured and at least 10 died. </p>
			  <p> The lawsuit that followed was one of Melvin Belli&rsquo;s first high profile cases. The case was notable from a jurisprudence standpoint in that the jury found Cutter had acted in good faith and had done nothing culpably wrong. The judge, however, instructed them to impose damages. And so began the concept of no-fault liability.</p>
			  <p><center><strong> Managed Health </strong> (In My Humble Opinion &ndash; IMHO)<strong></strong></center></p>
			  <p>As a pharmacist, I have been a health care provider for over 30 years. I've seen the dawning of the computer age in medicine and the blossoming of the alphabet soup that is known as Managed Care. Much progress has been made, but have we lost something along the way? Is it time to shift our focus and take the next step forward?</p>
			  <p>Managed care has now pared nearly every speck of &quot;fat&quot; from the system. We now see steady increases in premiums and co-pays so that insurers can continue to generate profits. There is nothing wrong with profit, but we have relegated sound medical care to a secondary position on the ladder of health care goals. Along the way we have lost sight of the tremendous value of truly maintaining health rather than reacting to illness or disease. It is my contention that Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) are misnamed to the point of absurdity. </p>
			  <p> <img src="images/issue33_009.jpg" width="120" height="102" align="left"> But we are a capitalist economy; monetary concerns, as a consequence, drive choices made in the delivery of health care. </p>
			  <p>There are plenty of organizations and people promoting healthy lifestyle choices, but there is a disconnect between those efforts and the goals of the insurers of our healthcare.</p>
			  I propose that it is time to vigorously encourage the principles of preventive care and wellness within the arena of insured health care. Let's move from managed care to managed health. Let's encourage people to be healthy, to eliminate risky health behaviors and make it economically feasible. Many managed care plans that I am familiar with do not do enough to encourage long-term or lifetime changes that benefit a person's health. Many plans are forced to cover oral contraceptives, few cover smoking cessation counseling and products, few cover weight management, some cover disease management, but the support is weak, at best. Very little is done to reward health maintenance. The current design of health care premiums results in healthy patients subsidizing the unhealthy. Too often, those with healthy lifestyles are paying for the care of folks that have made conscious decisions that lead to illness and higher health care
costs. We need to restructure the reimbursement system to reward healthy choices. The focus of insurers seems to be short-sighted and narrow, reactive rather than proactive. 
			  <p>We must find a way to encourage health care insurers to lose their shortsightedness and cover services that may not have immediate positive impact on an individual's health. The thinking by the insurers seems to be that they need not cover these proactive services since it is likely that someone else will insure the person benefiting from them by the time the results pay off. We should put mechanisms in place to change this perspective. We need flexible premiums that reward the healthy, creating a more equitable cost basis for the provision of health care. We need to give the power of medical care decisions back to physicians, to allow patients more control over their own health, to create a health care system that spends more capital on managing health. </p>
