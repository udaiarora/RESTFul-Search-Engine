Engineers are challenged with improving the quality of life for human kind, designing new innovative products, preparing for potential catastrophes, and providing society with technological leadership. The Department of Engineering provides a flexible, new generation engineering education that serves as a foundation for a variety of technical and professional careers in a rapidly changing world.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1808847"></a>Learning is approached through student-focused inquiry, through the investigation and solution of realistic engineering problems, and through frequent participation on interdisciplinary project teams. Learners are guided in the development of a strong foundation in modern engineering skills and in the ability to design, analyze, and build. The department is committed to mentoring students in learning, in the selection of career pathways, and in the transition to the professional world. Students graduating from the program have excellent engineering skills, global awareness, strong communication skills, good business skills, an understanding of entrepreneurship and the ability to continue life-long growth in their professional skills.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1808852"></a>The engineering program provides a unique learning environment with faculty who make learning and students a top priority and where students are actively involved in their own education. Realistic projects permeate the curriculum, providing extensive experience in teaming with learners from other disciplines and in communicating to diverse audiences. Classrooms are design studios. The environment and learning approach connects engineering, science, math, and technology to real-world problems and smoothes the transition to a professional career.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1808857"></a>The program structure is flexible and responsive to emerging engineering fields. The program integrates a broad knowledge base with study in multiple concentrations, providing both breadth and depth. This provides a greater flexibility in curricular and career pathways allowing for multidisciplinary experiences and novel combinations of expertise. Throughout the curriculum students learn to think critically, with a particular focus on how engineering addresses a variety of technical and societal problems.</p><p class="FM-B-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1808869"></a>DEGREE</p><p class="Body-4-above"><a name="pgfId-1808870"></a>The faculty in the Department of Engineering offer a BSE degree in Engineering. </p><p class="FM-B-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1808875"></a>ACCREDITATION</p><p class="Body-4-above"><a name="pgfId-1808876"></a>The program will seek accreditation through the Engineering Accreditation Council of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. (111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202, 410/347-7700) under the general engineering criteria applicable to all engineering degrees. The Accreditation Board requires that a program have graduates before accreditation can be granted. Typically, graduates from the year preceding accreditation are granted the status of having an accredited degree. </p><p class="FM-B-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1808882"></a><a name="marker-1817606"></a>ENGINEERING&#8212;BSE</p><p class="Body-4-above"><a name="pgfId-1808883"></a>The <a name="marker-1818053"></a>Engineering curriculum is a flexible engineering undergraduate curriculum. Flexibility is achieved through a primary and a secondary concentration, automatically making the degree multidisciplinary in nature. The primary concentration is selected from a range of engineering specializations. The secondary concentration is selected from another engineering specialization or from an area of interest outside the engineering field. In addition, the curriculum has nine semester hours of unrestricted electives. This flexibility in the curriculum allows students to take 45 to 66 semester hours of engineering course work in addition to zero to 27 semester hours in the secondary concentration.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1808888"></a>A minimum of 128 semester hours with a cumulative GPA of 2.00 is required for graduation. Students must complete First-Year Composition and the University General Studies requirements for Humanities, Social and Behavioral Science and the Global, Historical and Cultural diversity in the US awareness requirements and meet all other University degree requirements.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1808894"></a>It is recommended that a student seeking transfer admission to this program at a later date plan on taking MAT 270 and 271; PHY 121 and 122 and CHM 113 or 114 as part of their university general studies requirements. Engineering courses covered by the standard articulation agreements between the various Arizona universities and community colleges that are articulated as equivalent will be accepted as credit toward this degree. </p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1808904"></a>For more information and advising on courses, send e-mail to <a href="mailto:engr@asu.edu" class="URL">engr@asu.edu</a>, call (480) 727-2727, or access the Web site at <a href="http://www.poly.asu.edu/ctas/engineering" class="URL">www.poly.asu.edu/ctas/engineering</a>.</p><div class="courses"><a name="Course Header"></a><p class="Course-Header">Courses</p><p class="Course-Header"><a href="https://sec.was.asu.edu/coursedb/search/results.jsp?header=off&prefix=EGR&year=2007&term=1">ENGINEERING (EGR)</a></p></div><br><p class="Course-Omnibus-Insert"><a name="pgfId-2521936"></a><b class="Bold">Omnibus Courses.</b> For an explanation of courses offered but not specifically listed in this catalog, see <a href="class-of-courses.html#24093" class="XRef">Omnibus Courses</a>.</p><p class="Course-Omnibus-Insert"><a name="pgfId-2521945"></a><b class="Bold">Graduate-Level Courses.</b> For information about courses numbered from 500 to 799, see the Graduate Catalog, or access <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/catalogs" class="URL">www.asu.edu/aad/catalogs</a></em> on the Web.
