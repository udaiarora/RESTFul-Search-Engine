They are academic hearings, the purpose of which is to safeguard and protect not only the individual rights of the academic professional but also the integrity of the university.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Limitations on Disability Status</b></font><p>When an individual has been on <a href="acd002.html#disability" target="New">disability</a> status for more than 18 months, there is no assurance of reemployment with the university.  At this stage, the university may utilize the following procedures for termination.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Dismissal Process</b></font><p><b>Suspension</b><p>Suspension will be considered in the following cases:<p><ol><li>a continuing, probationary, or year-to-year academic professional may be suspended with pay pending an investigation into a case in which the <a href="acd002.html#president" target="New">president</a> determines that continued presence of the academic professional on a campus constitutes a substantial interference with the orderly functioning of the university or of a substantial area, unit, college, or department of the university<p>or</li><p><li>during the investigation if, in the judgment of the president, immediate harm to the academic professional or to others is threatened by continuance or if continued performance of duties would result in extreme harm to the academic/research program.</li></ol><p>Unless prohibited by law, any suspension shall be with pay.<p><b>Initial Dismissal Procedures</b><p>When reason arises to question the fitness of an academic professional who has continuing appointment or whose term of appointment has not expired, the appropriate administrative officers, as designated by the president on a case-by-case basis, should ordinarily discuss the matter with the academic professional in personal conference. The matter may be disposed of by mutual consent at this point.<p>If a settlement is not reached and the academic professional is recommended for suspension or dismissal, the president shall refer such recommendation to a conciliation committee.<p><b>Conciliation Procedures</b><p>This committee shall be a university ad hoc committee consisting of an academic professional <a href="acd002.html#ombudsperson" target="New">ombudsperson</a> appointed by the Committee on Academic Professional Status, one continuing academic professional appointed by the president, and one continuing academic professional appointed by the Committee on Academic Professional Status.  The purpose of the conciliation committee will be to recommend one of the following to the president:<p><ol><li>that conciliation is not possible and the process should proceed<p>or</li><p><li>that conciliation is possible as an alternative to dismissal, with an explanation of the terms of the conciliation.</li></ol><p>The committee shall meet on one or more occasions with only the academic professional and a representative of the administration, separately or together, at the option of the academic professional. The committee will report its findings, decisions, and sanctions, if any, and make a confidential recommendation to the president within 15 <a href="acd002.html#day">days</a> of the committee&#146;s appointment.<p>The president will notify the academic professional in writing of the conciliation committee&#146;s recommendation within five working days of receipt of the report.<p>If the committee recommends that conciliation is possible and both the academic professional and the president concur with the terms of conciliation, the action will be discontinued.<p><b>Formal Appeal Process</b><p>The formal appeal process commences if:<p><ol><li>the academic professional refuses or fails to accept the recommendation<p>or</li><p><li>if the president, after due consideration of the committee&#146;s recommendation, decides that the academic professional should be suspended or dismissed.</li></ol><p>A statement with reasonable specificity of the grounds proposed for the dismissal or suspension shall be formulated by the president or designee.  The appropriate dean or department chair shall provide the academic professional with a formal notice of dismissal or suspension, which shall include a statement of charges and notification of the right to a hearing.<p>Within 15 days after receipt of a notice of suspension or dismissal and statement of charges, the academic professional shall state in writing to the president whether a formal hearing on the charges is desired.  Failure to request a hearing within the 15-day period shall act as a waiver of any right by such academic professional to a due-process hearing before any committee at the university.<p>If requested, a hearing to determine whether the academic professional should be removed from the academic professional position on the grounds stated will be conducted by the Academic Professional Grievance Committee.<p><hr><font size=+1><b><i>Code of Conduct</i> Violations</b></font><p>Should it be decided by the president, at any stage, that allegations involve matters prohibited by the <i>Code of Conduct,</i> then the procedures delineated in that document prevail.<p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>For related information, see <a href="acd508-01.html">ACD 508&#150;01</a>, &#147;Nonreappointment.&#148;<p>For the complete <i>Code of Conduct,</i> see the <i>University Student Initiatives Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i><a href="../usi/usi104-01.html" target="NEW">USI 104&#150;01</a>, <i>&#147;Student Code of Conduct</i> and Student Disciplinary Procedures.&#148;<p>&#160;<p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
