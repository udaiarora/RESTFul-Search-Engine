This work describes the rare plants of Spain and Portugal.  Clusius' plant descriptions
 were the best for this time period, especially for their rich detail.  Printer Plantin
 supplied hundreds of beautiful woodcuts by Pieter van der Borcht used also for Lobelius'
 and Dodoens' works.  Carolus Clusius' work has been described as the source from which
 our modern knowledge of genera originated.  His botanical descriptions are still highly
 regarded.
<P>
Clusius was born in Arres, then a part of Flanders.  He suffered from ill health all
 his life, but nevertheless sustained an enormous capacity for work.  He was a pupil of the
 renowned teacher Rondelet who helped to instill a love of botany in Clusius.  During
 his lifetime Clusius travelled extensively, and wherever he went he formed friendships
 with men of learning.  He met Sir Francis Drake in England, and because of their
 friendship Drake brought back plants from the New World for him to study.  His mastery
 of many languages enabled him to read and translate the works of Dodoens, Orta, Acosta,
 and Monardes.  Clusius' herbal, which included more than 600 entries, was not limited
 to flowering plants.  He was one of the first to write about fungi and mushrooms; some
 believe he should be honored as the founder of mycology.  The woodcuts used in this work
 were part of a collection held by the publisher, Christopher Plantin.  Many of them were
 drawn by Pierre van der Borcht, one of the outstanding botanical artists of the 16th
 century.
<P>
Although most of the woodblocks were engraved specifically for this work, some were
 mistakenly used for Dodoens' herbal while Clusius' book was awaiting publication.
  Clusius, however, was not embittered by this, stating that "whatever friends possess
 ought to be freely shared."
 Clusius achieved recognition not only for his writings, but also for introducing the
 potato to Germany, Austria, France, and the Low Countries.  He was acclaimed as the
 founder of the popular "bulb culture" after introducing to the Netherlands the Ranunculus,
 Anemone, Iris, and Narcissus from the Mediterranean regions.  The Princess de Chimay
 called him the "father of all the beautiful gardens in the country."
