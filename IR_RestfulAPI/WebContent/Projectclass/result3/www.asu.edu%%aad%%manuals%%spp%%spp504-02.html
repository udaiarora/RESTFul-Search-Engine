If disability extends beyond 14 calendar days, workers&#146; compensation is paid from the date of disability.  Lost time of seven days or less may be charged against accrued sick or vacation leave.<P>An employee who is injured or becomes ill during the course of employment may seek medical attention from Campus Health Service or from any doctor or facility accepting workers&#146;  compensation. During the visit, the employee must fill out the employee portion of the Employee and Physicians Report of Injury form, which can be obtained from the physician.<P>The employee or  <A HREF="spp002.html#supervisor">supervisor</A> must report the illness or injury within 48 hours by calling 602/542&#150;WORK. It is the supervisor&#146;s responsibility to then complete an &#147;Employer&#146;s Report of Injury&#148; form. The completed form must be returned to Human Resources no later than five days after the occurrence. Failure of a supervisor to report claim within ten days of being notified of an injury by an employee can result in monetary fines levied by the State of Arizona Department of Administration, Risk Management Section, and payable by the employee&#146;s department.<p>Workers&#146; compensation will equal 66 2/3 percent of an employee&#146;s salary or wages up to the statutory maximum.  An employee must use accrued sick leave and may use accrued vacation leave with workers&#146; compensation benefits up to, but not to exceed, the full salary or wages.<p>Workers&#146; compensation provides survivor benefits to <A HREF="spp002.html#dependent children">dependents</A> of an employee whose death is caused by injuries during the performance of duties.  If death occurs as a result of an accident during the course of employment, the employee&#146;s department should contact Human Resources.<P><TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>Note:</TD><TD>Family leave (see <A HREF="spp705-02.html">SPP 705&#150;02</A>, &#147;Family Leave&#148;) is not an additional leave; rather, it is to be used concurrently with this policy.</TD></TR></TABLE><P>&#160;<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><HR><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">SPP</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | SPP&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="spp001.html">contact</A> | Human&#160;Resources&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="hr.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
