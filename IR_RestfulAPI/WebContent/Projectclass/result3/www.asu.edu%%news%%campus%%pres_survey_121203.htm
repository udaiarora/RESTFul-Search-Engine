      <h2>Survey shows strong support among employees for Crow's vision</h2>
      <p>Arizona State University faculty and staff are very familiar with the
        vision outlined by President Michael Crow, are confident in his ability
        to achieve the vision, and want more open discussions with him about
        the direction of the university.</p>
      <p>This and other pertinent information
          was obtained from an employee perception survey conducted by Bruce
        Merrill, director of The Media Research Program
          in the Walter Cronkite School of Mass Communication, for the ASU Office
          of Public Affairs.<br>
        According to the survey, some 83 percent of faculty and staff have
          a very or generally favorable opinion of Crow's vision. Only four percent
          of faculty, and zero staff, indicated a very unfavorable opinion of
          the
          vision. Nearly 92 percent of faculty and staff say they have heard
          or read something about Crow's vision, with 84 percent feeling very
          or somewhat
          familiar with the vision.</p>
      <p>"Rather than speculate about how President Crow's
          vision for ASU is being perceived among faculty and staff, we wanted
          sound data that could point
          out gaps in our communication efforts," says Nancy Neff, assistant
        vice president for Public Affairs. "No one expected the results to be
        so overwhelmingly
          positive. In fact, Dr. Merrill cautioned us from the outset that we
        would have to release the results of the survey even if they showed little
          support for President Crow and the vision."</p>
      <p>Merrill says, "There is always
          a risk that the results won't be what you want, but the value of this
          kind of research is that it allows you
          to determine what the entire faculty/staff family at ASU believes,
        instead of guessing or reacting to individuals."<br>
        Merrill, who has been doing surveys for 35 years, said when he describes
          polls he often uses the analogy of going to the doctor. "If you're
          ill, you need to get a good diagnosis and treat it," he said. "With
          a survey,
          the results might be bad, but if we have problems, we need to know
          what they are so they can be fixed."</p>
      <p>In this case, Merrill says he is surprised
          by the magnitude of the support Crow is receiving.</p>
      <p>"What makes these results even more impressive," says
          Merrill, "is that universities, by their very nature, are known for
        their slow adaptation
          to change and, in fact, haven't changed much over the past 1,000 years.</p>
      <p>"These
          results indicate ASU faculty and staff have embraced the need to change
          and feel confident in the direction the university is heading."</p>
      <p>Merrill
          says he is impressed that survey participants were able to cite key
        points of Crow's vision without being aided or prompted. The question
          was open-ended, asking those respondents who said they remembered key
        points or ideas of Crow's vision for ASU's future what points they remembered.</p>
      <p>Although
          the responses varied in order, six messages were recalled by faculty
          and staff:<br>
        . ASU needs to become more embedded in the community;<br>
        . Build a New American University, future oriented, global;<br>
        . Expand emphasis on research, bring in more research funding;<br>
        . Make ASU more financially self sufficient;<br>
        . Emphasize high-tech, especially biotechnology; and<br>
        . One university with distinctive satellite campuses.</p>
      <p>"The strength of
          asking open-ended questions is that people tell the interviewers in
        their own words what they remember or what is important
          to them," says Merrill.<br>
        In addition to gauging perception, the survey also provided information
          on where employees get most of their information about ASU. The number
          one information source is ASU Insight. Rounding out the top five are
          word of mouth; several forms of electronic communication, including
          the ASU Web site; professional meetings; and The Arizona Republic.</p>
      <p>The survey
          methodology was a random telephone sample of 300 full-time staff (150)
          and faculty (150) at ASU. The sampling frame for the survey
          was the 2003 - 04 Faculty/Staff Directory. Individuals were given the
          opportunity to answer the questions either in the privacy of their
      homes or in their offices at ASU.</p>
      <p>The survey and results are available
      online at (<a href="http://www.asu.edu/asunews/survey">www.asu.edu/asunews/survey</a>).</p>
