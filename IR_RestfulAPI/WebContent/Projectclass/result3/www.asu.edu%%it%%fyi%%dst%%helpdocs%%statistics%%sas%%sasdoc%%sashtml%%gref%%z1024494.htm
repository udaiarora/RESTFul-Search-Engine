<P><A name="z1081512">&#13; You can
bring SAS/GRAPH output to the Web in several ways:</A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>You can use SAS/GRAPH Web drivers to produce simple
Web pages (see <A href="z1024732.htm">Using SAS/GRAPH Web Drivers to Create Web Output</A>).
The Web drivers are the GIF, HTML, and WEBFRAME drivers. The GIF driver creates
GIF format files for your graphs, and you have to create the HTML files to
reference those graphs. The HTML and WEBFRAME drivers generate both the HTML
and GIF files for you and fully automate the process. All you have to do is
specify either the HTML or WEBFRAME device driver, and SAS/GRAPH does the
rest. If you specify the WEBFRAME driver, SAS/GRAPH generates thumbnail-size
graphs that you can click to see the full-size graph; no other approach to
generating Web output produces these thumbnail graphs. With the HTML and WEBFRAME
drivers, you can also create drill-down graphs that contain hot zones that
link to other output, such as another graph or a report (see  <A href="z1025181.htm">About Drill-down Graphs</A>).<P>

<LI>You can use the
Output Delivery System (ODS) to
gain more control over the Web pages that you produce (see <A href="z1024972.htm">Using the Output Delivery System (ODS) with SAS/GRAPH Software</A>). This approach can be
used with the GIF, JAVA, or ACTIVEX device drivers.
<P>When used with the GIF driver, ODS automatically generates the HTML
and GIF files needed to display the output. When used with the JAVA or ACTIVEX
drivers, ODS automatically generates the HTML file needed to display the graph,
which is defined within the HTML file.  (As discussed in <A href="z1224484.htm">Creating Java Applets and ActiveX Controls</A>, the JAVA and ACTIVEX
drivers can only be used with the  GCHART, GCONTOUR, GMAP, GPLOT, and G3D
procedures.)
<P>With ODS, you name the HTML files and have more influence over the content
and presentation of that output than you have with the SAS/GRAPH Web drivers.
For example, you can combine graphics and non-graphics output, and generate
a Table of Contents that automatically links to each piece of output. You
can also use SAS/GRAPH options with ODS to create drill-down graphs that contain
hot zones that link to other output, such as another graph or a report (see
 <A href="z1025181.htm">About Drill-down Graphs</A>).<P>

<LI>You can customize Web-page design for drill-down
graphs by creating your own HTML files to reference graphics output (see <A href="z1025994.htm">Customizing Web Pages for Drill-down Graphs</A>). This
approach is for users who have extensive HTML knowledge who want drill-down
graphs but who also want to design the Web pages. With this approach, you
use SAS/GRAPH procedure options and a SAS/GRAPH macro to create the image
map needed to implement drill-down graphs. Then you create the HTML files
and write the HTML tags needed to display the output, associate the image
map with that output, and resolve the image-map links.<P>

<LI>You can combine multiple graphs into a single
GIF image that displays the graphs at timed intervals, thus creating an animation
sequence (see <A href="z0762632.htm">Animating GIF Files (DEV=GIFANIM)</A>).
The output is a single GIF file, which you can then incorporate into a Web
page. This approach is for users who have experience in animation. You can
generate animated sequences of graphs to display in reports that are published
on the Web.<P>
