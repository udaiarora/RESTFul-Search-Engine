To this end, the universities shall operate within a board-approved salary adjustment plan that provides for rewarding <a href="acd002.html#employees" target="New">employees</a> in recognition of satisfactory and above satisfactory performance and provides for a process by which other salary adjustment considerations are resolved. Monies appropriated and identified by the legislature as funds to be used by the universities for salary adjustments shall be divided and distributed under guidelines applicable to two categories:  (1) adjustment funds; and (2) performance funds.<p><dl><dd><b>Adjustment Funds</b></dd><p><dd>In order to maintain an effective compensation plan on each of the campuses, the universities shall continually assess the need for these adjustments.  Such adjustments may include:<p><ol><li>market adjustments</li><p><li>equity adjustments<p>and</li><p><li>promotion and reclassification adjustments.</li></ol><p>Each university shall determine the amount of adjustment funds needed each year for each of the four employee groups and shall request that the Board of Regents set aside such an amount from the total funds made available by the legislature for salary adjustment purposes.</dd><p><dd><b>Performance Funds</b></dd><p><dd>Performance funds shall be distributed on the basis of an assessment of employee performance.  Employees who are judged to be performing satisfactorily may be granted adjustments based on the effects of inflation in addition to other considerations. University-approved formal performance evaluation plans administered at the departmental or other organizational unit level at each university shall provide the documentation for performance awards to employees in each of the four groups.<p>Decisions related to the distribution of faculty performance funds shall be made in accordance with university policies and procedures developed in consultation with the faculty and approved by the <a href="acd002.html#president" target="New">president</a>.  Such <a href="acd002.html#rule" target="New">rules</a> and procedures may provide for recognition of long-term faculty activities and outcomes.</dd></dl><p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Procedures</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>Funds appropriated to each university for salary adjustment purposes shall be allocated to each of the four employee groups (faculty, professional, administrative, classified) in proportion to their share of the salary base of that university.  Each university shall submit to the Board of Regents a plan for dividing the funds allocated to each of the four employee groups between adjustment funds and performance funds.  The Board of Regents shall authorize such division of funds for each of the four employee groups, recognizing that different circumstances and needs may lead to different proportions of adjustment funds and performance funds among the various employee groups and among the three universities. Unless an exception is approved by the Board of Regents, no funds allocated to an employee group (faculty, professional, administrative, classified) shall be used to enhance the salaries of employees outside of that employee group.  Any exception must be based on compensation-related factors and circumstances which justify an alternative distribution method.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Compensation Report</b></font><p>The president of each university shall submit a compensation report to the Board of Regents on or before September 15 of each year that includes the following:<p><ol><li>procedures used in the distribution of the adjustment funds and performance funds</li><p><li>number of faculty, professional, administrative, and classified employees  receiving various percentage increases (one percent, two percent, three percent, 10 percent, etc.) through the distribution of adjustment funds, by department or other organizational unit</li><p><li>number of faculty, professional, administrative, and classified employees receiving various percentage increases (one percent, two percent, three percent, 10 percent, etc.) through the distribution of performance funds, by department or other organizational unit<p>and</li><p><li>special compensation reports may be requested by the Board of Regents.</li></ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Review of Annual Salary Adjustments</b></font><p>An individual may request a review of his or her salary adjustment to the next-higher administrative level above the person who made the salary recommendation for a final decision.  There are no procedures for hearings unless a grievance is alleged as described below.  The request for a review of a salary adjustment must be made by a specific date published in the most current <i>University Bulletin</i> on salary adjustments.  The review must be completed within 30 working days after the request is received by the reviewer.  The purpose of this review is to check for clerical errors and/or inconsistencies between the amount of merit money awarded and an individual&#146;s ranking during the most recent annual review.<p>This annual period, which follows the announcement of forthcoming salary adjustments, is not intended as a time for <a href="acd002.html#facultymember" target="New">faculty members</a> to ask for market or equity adjustments.  The university does not have an obligation to make market or equity adjustments, but may make such adjustments at any time throughout the year when funds are available and it is in the best interests of the university to do so.  Failure to receive a market or equity adjustment is not appealable, except as outlined below.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Grievances of Failure to Follow University Policies and Procedures</b></font><p>An individual may grieve deviation from the board or university policy and procedures to the appropriate grievance committee.  Grievances based on discrimination are to be referred to the Office of Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action (EO/AA).<p><img src="acdhr.gif" width=100% height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" width=100% height="2"><p>For related information see:<br><p><ol><p><li><a href="acd506-06.html">ACD 506&#150;06</a>, &#147;Evaluation for Tenure and Promotion&#148;</li><p><li><a href="acd506-10.html">ACD 506&#150;10</a>, &#147;Annual Evaluation of Faculty&#148;<p>and</li><p><li><a href="acd509-02.html">ACD 509-02</a>, &#147;Grievance Policies and Procedures for Faculty.&#148;</li></ol><p>&#160;<hr noshade><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
