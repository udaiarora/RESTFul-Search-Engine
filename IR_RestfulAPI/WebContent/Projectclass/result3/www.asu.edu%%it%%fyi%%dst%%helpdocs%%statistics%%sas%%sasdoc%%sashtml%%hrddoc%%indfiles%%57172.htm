SAS Companion for the OS/2 Environment, Version 8
</H1><P>
This title offers complete coverage of the OS/2-specific features of the   SAS System.  In addition to providing comprehensive reference
information, this guide shows you how to accomplish basic and advanced     tasks using the SAS System with IBM's powerful desktop environment.  To
take advantage of this book, you should be experienced with some of the    portable features of the SAS System, but not necessarily under the OS/2
environment.  System managers may also want to read this title to          understand how the SAS System works under OS/2.
