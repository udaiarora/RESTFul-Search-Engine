      <h2>Gastevich to head ASU Alumni Association; brings entrepreneurial experience</h2>
      <p>Donna
        Gastevich (pictured on left) is joining ASU as associate vice president
        for Public Affairs/executive director for Alumni Relations. She is an
        accomplished
        entrepreneur, an experienced alumni affairs officer and a highly regarded
        fund-raiser.</p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/gastevich_071403.jpg" alt="Donna Gastevich (left) talks with ASU Women's Basketball Coach Charli Turner Thorne during a recent visit to campus." width="288" height="198" align="right">Since 2000, Gastevich has been president of TechPoint, a
          statewide technology association in Indiana, and executive director
        of the TechPoint Foundation.
          She is credited with re-energizing TechPoint, growing its budget from
          $225,000 to nearly $2 million in three years.</p>
      <p>Gastevich was selected from
          a national pool of 148 candidates. A search committee, which included
          five past-chairmen of the ASU Alumni Association,
          conducted initial interviews and forwarded a short list of qualified
          candidates to the ASU administration.</p>
      <p>ASU President Michael Crow said
          feedback from almost everyone who met Gastevich was extraordinarily
        positive. </p>
      <p>"She is intelligent, creative
          and energetic - the ideal person to lead the ASU Alumni Association
        to the next level of achievement, to make
          it the premier alumni association in the Pac-10 and a model for the
        rest of the nation," Crow said.</p>
      <p>"We had two extremely qualified finalists,
          and Donna's enthusiasm, energy and self-assurance put her in the driver's
          seat," said Virgil Renzulli,
          ASU's vice president for Public Affairs. "Whenever I met with the candidates,
          she would end each meeting by making it clear just how much she wanted
          this job, and she convincingly expressed confidence that she would
        do a great job."</p>
      <p>"ASU is a great school, with much interest and commitment
          here," Gastevich said. "President Crow is awesome. He has so much energy.
          The alumni association
          should have that same energy.</p>
      <p>"We need to explore additional opportunities
          for corporate sponsorships, which is a strength I think I bring; we
        need to leverage our existing
          corporate relationships; we need to increase our marketing and outreach
          efforts; we need to improve our coordination with Intercollegiate Athletics
          and we need to improve the effectiveness of our organization.</p>
      <p>"There are
          great traditions at ASU, and those should be strengthened. We need
        to increase the number of alumni who are actively involved with
          ASU, and work collaboratively with both internal and external stakeholders
          to accomplish our goals," she said.</p>
      <p>Martin Shultz, vice president, government
          affairs, Pinnacle West Capital Corp, said he is pleased to welcome
        Gastevich on behalf of all ASU alumni.
          Shultz is also the ASU Alumni Association chairman for 2000 - 03 and
          was the co-chairman of this executive search committee.</p>
      <p>"We look forward
          to working with Donna to advance, grow and promote the work of the
        ASU Alumni Association, and provide great service to our
          one quarter of a million alums," he said. "Now, more than ever, ASU
        alumni have the opportunity to help promote ASU as the New American University,
          and Donna is uniquely qualified to provide the professional leadership
          for this important work."</p>
      <p>Gastevich earned a bachelor of arts degree from
          Purdue University and a M.P.A. from Indiana University-South Bend.</p>
      <p>Prior to joining TechPoint,
          she was director of Corporate and Alumni Relations for the Schools
        of Engineering and Science at Purdue. She also
          held the position of state specialist for Community and Economic Development
          with the Purdue Cooperative Extension Service. Prior to that, she was
          director of the seven-county Small Business Development Center in Northwest
          Indiana.<br>
