<P>The GMAP procedure requires a map data set and a response
data set. These two data sets must contain the required variables or the procedure
stops with an error message.  You can use the same data set as both the map
data set and the response data set, as long as the requirements are met. If
a different data set is used as the response data set, it must contain an
ID variable that is identical to the ID variable in the map data set.

<P><A name="z0757980">&#13; A <B>map data set</B> is a SAS data set that contains coordinates that define
the boundaries of map areas, such as states or counties.  A map data set must
contain at least these variables: </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>a numeric variable named X that contains the horizontal
coordinates of the boundary points.  The value of this variable could be either
projected or unprojected.  If unprojected, X represents longitude.<P>

<LI>a numeric variable named Y that contains the vertical
coordinates of the boundary points.  The value of this variable could be either
projected or unprojected.  If unprojected, Y represents latitude.<P>

<LI>one or more variables that uniquely identify the
areas in the map.  Map area identification variables can be either character
or numeric and are indicated in the ID statement.<P>
</UL>

<P>The X and Y variable values in the map data set do not
have to be in any specific units because they are rescaled by the GMAP procedure
based on the minimum and maximum values in the data set.  The minimum X and
Y values are in the lower-left corner of the map, and the maximum X and Y
values are in the upper-right corner.
<P>Map data sets in which the X and Y variables contain
longitude and latitude should be projected before you use them with PROC GMAP.
 See <A href="zectchap.htm">The GPROJECT Procedure</A>
for details.
<P>Optionally, the map data set also can contain a variable
named SEGMENT to identify map areas that comprise noncontiguous polygons.
 Each unique value of the SEGMENT variable within a single map area defines
a distinct polygon.  If the SEGMENT variable is not present, each map area
is drawn as a separate closed polygon that indicates a single segment.
<P>The observations for each segment of a map area in the
map data set must occur in the order in which the points are to be joined.
The GMAP procedure forms map area outlines by connecting the boundary points
of each segment in the order in which they appear in the data set, eventually
joining the last point to the first point to complete the polygon.
<P>Any variables in the map data set other than the ones
mentioned above are ignored for the purpose of determining map boundaries.

<P><A name="z0757989">&#13;In
addition to the variables described in </A><A href="#zta-sets">About Map Data Sets</A>, the SAS/GRAPH map
data sets may also contain the following variables: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>a numeric variable named LONG containing the unprojected
longitude in radians of the boundary points.<P>

<LI>a numeric variable named LAT containing the unprojected
latitude in radians of the boundary points.<P>
</UL>

<P>The GMAP procedure uses the values of the X and Y variables
to draw the map.  Therefore, if you want to produce an unprojected map by
using the values in LONG and LAT, you would have to rename LONG and LAT to
X and Y first.
<P>SAS/GRAPH includes
a number of predefined map data sets.  These data sets are described in <A href="z2sets.htm">SAS/GRAPH Map Data Sets</A>.
<BR><H3><A name="z0729033">Map Data Sets Containing X, Y, LONG, and LAT</A></H3>


<P>Most Institute-supplied map data sets
contain four coordinate variables (X, Y, LONG, and LAT).  In this case, X
and Y are always projected values that will be used by the GRAPH procedures
(by default).  If you need to use the unprojected values that are contained
in the LONG and LAT variables, you will need to rename the LONG and LAT variables
to X and Y since the GMAP procedure automatically uses X and Y.  See <A href="z7epts.htm#zng-both">Input Map Data Sets that Contain Both Projected and Unprojected Values</A>
for more details.
<BR><H3><A name="z0729034">Map Data Sets Containing Only X and Y</A></H3>


<P>The Institute-supplied map data sets that
contain X and Y variables (and no LONG and LAT variables), are usually projected
maps.  However, there are a few map data sets for the US and Canada that contain
X and Y values that are unprojected longitude and latitude.  In this case,
you will need to use the GPROJECT procedure to project the map (see <A href="zectchap.htm">The GPROJECT Procedure</A>). 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can determine
whether a SAS map data set is projected
or unprojected by looking at the description of each variable that is displayed
when you use the CONTENTS procedure or by browsing the MAPS.METAMAPS data
set.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>

<P>There are several map data sets available
with SAS/GRAPH that allow you to easily
label maps: 
<DL>
<DT>MAPS.USCENTER</DT>
<DD>contains the X and Y coordinates
of the visual center of each state in the U.S. and Washington, D.C., as well
as points in the ocean for states that are too small to contain a label. You
can use MAPS.USCENTER with the MAPS.US, MAPS.USCOUNTY, MAPS.COUNTIES, and
MAPS.COUNTY data sets.<P></DD>

<DT> MAPS.USCITY</DT>
<DD>contains the X and Y coordinates
of selected cities in the U.S.  Many city names occur in more than one state,
so you may have to subset by state to avoid duplication.  You can use MAPS.USCITY
with the MAPS.US, MAPS.USCOUNTY, MAPS.COUNTIES, and MAPS.COUNTY data sets.<P></DD>

<DT> MAPS.CANCENS</DT>
<DD>contains the names of the Canadian
census divisions.  You can use MAPS.CANCENS with the MAPS.CANADA and MAPS.CANADA3
data sets.<P></DD>
</DL>

<P>See the MAPS.METAMAPS data set for details on each of
the Institute-supplied map data sets.

  A

<P>
<UL>

<LI>one or more response variables that contain data

<P>The response data set can contain other variables in
addition to these required variables.
<P>The values of the map area identification variables
in the response data set determine the map areas to be included on the map
unless you use the ALL option in the PROC GMAP statement.  That is, unless
you use ALL in the PROC GMAP statement, only the map areas with response values
are shown on the map.  As a result, you do not need to subset your map data
set if you are mapping only a small section of the map.  However, if you map
the same small section frequently, create a subset of the map data set for
efficiency.
<P>For choropleth, block, and prism maps, the response
variables can be either character or numeric. For surface maps, the response
variables must be numeric with only positive values.
<BR><H3><A name="z2bles">About Response Variables</A></H3>


<P><A name="z0758011">&#13;  The GMAP procedure can produce block, choropleth,
and prism maps for both numeric and character response variables. Numeric
variables fall into two categories: discrete and continuous. </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI><A name="z0758012">&#13;
 <B>Discrete variables</B> contain a finite
number of specific numeric values that are to be represented on the map. For
example, a variable that contains only the values 1989 or 1990 is a discrete
variable.</A><P>

<LI><A name="z0758013">&#13;  <B>Continuous variables</B> contain a
range of numeric values that are to be represented on the map.  For example,
a variable that contains any real value between 0 and 100 is a continuous
variable.</A><P>
</UL>

<P>Numeric response variables are always treated as continuous
variables unless the DISCRETE option is used in the action statement.
<BR><H3><A name="z0729035">About Response Levels</A></H3>


<P><A name="z0758015">&#13;  <B>Response levels</B> are
the values that identify categories of data on the graph.  The categories
that are shown on the graph are based on the values of the response variable.
 Based on the type of the response variable, a response level can represent
these values: </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>a specific character value.  If the response variable
is character type, the GMAP procedure treats each unique value of the variable
as a response level.  For example, if the response variable contains the names
of ten regions, each region will be a response level, resulting in ten response
levels.
<P>The exception to this is that the MIDPOINTS= option
chooses specific response level values.  Any response variable values that
do not match one of the specified response level values are ignored.  For
example, if the response variable contains the names of ten regions and you
specify these midpoints, only the observations for 


<CODE><B>Midwest</B></CODE>, 


<CODE><B>Northeast</B></CODE>, and 


<CODE><B>Northwest</B></CODE> are included on the map:  



<PRE>midpoints='Midwest' 'Northeast' 'Northwest'</PRE><P>
</UL>
 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>a range of numeric values.  If the response variable
is numeric, the GMAP procedure determines the number of response levels for
the response variable.  Each response level then represents the median of
a range of values.
<P>These options are exceptions to this: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>The LEVELS= option specifies the number of response
levels to be used on the map.<P>

<LI>The DISCRETE option causes the numeric variable
to be treated as a discrete variable.<P>

<LI>The MIDPOINTS= option chooses specific response
level values as medians of the value ranges.<P>
</UL>

<P>If the response variable values are continuous, the
GMAP procedure assigns response level intervals automatically unless you specify
otherwise.  The response levels represent a range of values rather than a
single value.<P>

<LI>a specific numeric value.  If the response variable
is numeric and you use the DISCRETE option, the GMAP procedure treats the
variable much the same way as it treats a character response variable.  That
is, the procedure creates a response level for each unique value of the response
variable.  If you use DISCRETE with a numeric response variable that has an
associated format, each formatted value is represented by a different response
level.  Formatted values are truncated to 16 characters.<P>
</UL>

<P> The BLOCK, CHORO, and PRISM statements assign patterns
to response levels. In CHORO and PRISM maps, response levels are shown as
map areas. However, in BLOCK maps, response levels are shown as blocks. The
default fill pattern for the response level is solid.
<P>PATTERN statements can define the fill patterns and
colors for both blocks and map areas. PATTERN definitions that define valid
block patterns are applied to the blocks (response levels), and PATTERN definitions
that define valid map patterns are applied to map areas.
<P>See <A href="zernchap.htm">PATTERN Statement</A>
for more information on fill pattern values and default pattern rotation.
