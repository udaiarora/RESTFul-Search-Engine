Forward the completed vehicle loss report to Insurance Services (mail code 5212) within 10 calendar days of the loss. ADOA Risk Management Sectionwill not cover a property loss that is reported later than 90 days following discovery of the loss.<p>For vehicle losses anticipated to exceed &#036;10,000, or if personal injury occurred as a result of a vehicular accident, notify Insurance Services by fax (480/965&#150;3442), telephone (480/965&#150;1851), or e-mail (<a href="mailto:insuranceservices@asu.edu">insuranceservices@asu.edu</a>) as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after the incident.  In addition, a vehicle loss report must be submitted to Insurance Services within 10 calendar days of the loss.<p>Insurance recovery funds are issued by ADOA Risk Management Section directly to Insurance Services. A copy of the recovery check and cash receipt is forwarded to the department or unit. ADOA Risk Management Section has salvage rights for vehicles deemed a total loss.<p>The amount of reimbursement for windshield replacement is determined by what is deemed &#147;customary.&#148;  The customary amount is based on the amount normally charged by state-contracted vendors for a similar replacement.<p>Privately owned vehicle liability coverage is the primary coverage for privately owned vehicles operated for official university business.  Excess liability coverage is provided by the state for privately owned vehicles being operated for official university business. The state does not provide property coverage for privately owned vehicles operated for official university business.<p><img src="purhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule] WIDTH="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="purhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule] WIDTH="100%" height="2"><p>See also <a href="pur705-06.html">PUR 705&#150;06</a>, &#147;Foreign Travel Insurance.&#148;<p>For related information, see the <i>Facilities Management Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i><a href="../fac/fac204.html" target="NEW">FAC 204</a>, &#147;Fleet Service/University Vehicle Policy.&#148;<p>&#160;<font color=#FFFFFF>skip navigation bar</font><p><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">PUR</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | PUR&#160;manual&#160;<a href="pur001.html">contact</a> | Purchasing&#160;and&#160;Business&#160;Services&#160;Web&#160;<a href="purchasing.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center></body></html>
