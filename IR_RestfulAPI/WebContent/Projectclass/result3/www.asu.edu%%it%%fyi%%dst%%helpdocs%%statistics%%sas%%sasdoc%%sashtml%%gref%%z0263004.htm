<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">The third figure, a circle with a slash through it that
is assigned the character code C, is composed of three polygons: a circle
and two empty arcs. An observation with missing values separates the observations
defining each of the three polygons. The outer circle is defined by the first
group of observations. The empty arcs are drawn with three continuous arcs
using the PTYPE variable pattern V-C-V-C-V-C-V. The straight line that closes
the arc is drawn automatically by the GFONT procedure in order to complete
the polygon. Because all the polygons are part of one character, the continuous
space they define is filled.
