            <h3>Answers to Blackberry Message Related Problems</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <a name="1"></a><h4>The BlackBerry isn't able to receive or send messages.</h4>
                <p>Make sure you have wireless turned on and check to see if you are in a wireless coverage area. To turn your wireless from off to on, from the main menu/home screen of your BlackBerry, choose &quot;Turn Wireless On.&quot; If the problem persists please follow these steps in the order given to determine the problem: </p>
                <p><strong>a. Check the signal strength: </strong>First, make sure that you are in a place with a strong enough signal for BlackBerry communication. Click the Options icon. Click 'Status'. In the &quot;Signal&quot; field, verify that the value is above -100Bm. If the signal is less than -100Bm (e.g., -105Bm), then the signal strength in your area is too weak for normal functions. If your signal is stronger than -100Bm (e.g., -90Bm), continue troubleshooting.</p>
                <p><strong>b. Verify that you are in a coverage area where e-mail transmission is allowed:</strong> <font color="red">Note:</font> This step does not apply to older models (85x/95x/5810), as they could not connect to different networks. If these older devices have signal strength, then they should be able to send and receive e-mail. If you use one of these older BlackBerries and have signal, but still cannot send and receive e-mail, skip to the next troubleshooting step.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The network status indicator for <strong>AT&amp;T and Cingular </strong>devices should be &quot;GPRS.&quot; &quot;GPRS&quot; should be capitalized. Following is a table of network status indicators for ATT/Cingular:<br/><img src="img/attnetwork.gif" width="698" height="232"/> <br/>Specific troubleshooting for an <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> device can be found on <a href="http://supportattws.primus.com/aws/knowledgebase/ATTW3218.html">this AT&amp;T Support webpage</a>.</li>
                  <li>The network status for <strong>Verizon Wireless</strong> should be '1X' where there X is as large as the 1. The following is a table of network status indicators for Verizon: <br/><img src="img/verizonnetwork.gif" width="705" height="232"/></li>
                  <li>The network status indicator for <strong>T-Mobile</strong> should be &quot;GPRS&quot;. &quot;GPRS&quot; should be capitalized. Following is a table of network status  indicators for T-Mobiler:<br/><img src="img/tmobilenetwork.gif" width="698" height="232"><br/></li>
                </ul>
                <p>If your network status indicates e-mail is not supported in your area, you must move to a location where e-mail is supported. If your network status indicates e-mail support, but you still cannot send or receive e-mail, continue troubleshooting.</p>
                <p><strong>c. Check the date and time:</strong> Click the Options icon. Click Date/Time. If the date and time are incorrect, fix them, and then test to see if you can send or receive e-mail. If the date and time are correct, or if you have problems after fixing them, continue troubleshooting.</p>
                <p><strong>d. Reset your BlackBerry:</strong> Simultaneously press the Alt-RightShift-Backspace keys; this should force a soft reset. These keys vary in appearance according to your model. If you are prompted to press R to reset, do so. Alternately, you can perform a hard reset by inserting a paper clip into the reset hole on the back of the BlackBerry. On some BlackBerries, the reset hole is located beneath the battery cover. Once the BlackBerry has restarted, test to see whether you can now send and receive e-mail. If you cannot, continue troubleshooting. </p>
                <p><strong>e. Check network settings:</strong> Click the Options icon. Click Network or Network Settings. In the &quot;Radio&quot; field, verify that the value is set to On. In the &quot;Roaming&quot; field, verify that the correct country is displayed. Verify that the &quot;Status&quot; is active. Click the track wheel. A menu will appear. Click Register Now and verify that the registration request is sent. If you are unable to register the handheld or connect to the network, or do not have the correct options displayed in the &quot;Roaming&quot; or &quot;Status&quot; fields, contact your service provider. If these settings are all fine, and you are able to register your BlackBerry, continue troubleshooting.</p>
                <p><strong>f. Synchronize your Blackberry:</strong> If your computer recognizes your Blackberry, sometimes synchronizing your Blackberry will fix strange problems. To do this, connect your Blackberry to your computer. Open Desktop Manager and double-click the Intellisync icon. Click Configure PIM. Select the checkboxes for the applications you want to synchronize. Click OK. Verify that the Synchronize PIM option is selected. Click Synchronize Now. If you are able to synchronize your Blackberry without problems and are still unable to send or receive e-mail, continue troubleshooting.</p>
                <p><strong>g. Check to see if redirection is enabled:</strong> Open Desktop Manager and double-click Redirector Settings. Make sure &quot;Redirect incoming messages to your handheld&quot; is checked.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a name="2"></a><h4>The computer doesn't detect any Blackberry devices connected to the computer.</h4>
                <p>Verify that all the physical connections are secure, and the blackberry is properly cradled.</p>
                <p>If it is still having trouble: Remove your blackberry off the cradle. Press the pin hole sized reset button on the back of the Blackberry. Use a bent paper clip to access this reset button. Reregister your blackberry to the network and wait for the confirmation message. Put the blackberry on cradle. if it doesn't detect automatically, open the BlackBerry Desktop Manager. Go to Options, Serial Settings, and click on &quot;Detect.&quot;</p>
                <p>If it is still having trouble, check to see if you have the com port enabled on your computer. If you have more than one com port on your computer, plug the cradle into the other com port, and try detecting the port again.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a name="3"></a><h4>You are only getting some of your e-mail.</h4>
                <p>Blackberry Desktop Manager by default will only forward messages to your handheld if your email address is in the &quot;To&quot; or the &quot;BCC&quot; field. If you are only CC'd, you will get the message header but the body of the message will say &quot;You were CC'd.&quot; To change this setting, open up the BlackBerry Desktop Manager &gt; Redirector Settings &gt; Filters. Here you can add various filters so that you can filter specific messages to your blackberry. If you want all the messages to get to your blackberry, select: when none of the rules apply, &quot;forward the messages to the handheld.&quot;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a name="4"></a><h4>You get a message, but the body of the message says, &quot;You were CC'd.&quot;</h4>
