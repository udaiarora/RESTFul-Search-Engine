                  <br>
                  <p align="center"><b>March 21 , 2001</b></p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Meeting called to order at 3:05 p.m. </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Chair: Pat Etter<br>
  Secretary: Marilyn Wurzburger<br>
  A quorum was present.</p>
  <br>                  
                  <h2>I. Welcome and introduction of Provost Milton Glick - Pat Etter</h2>
               <br>
                <h2>II. Address by Provost Glick</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The subject of Dr. Glick&rsquo;s talk was &ldquo;ASU and the New Economy.&rdquo; It included such issues as the University Budget; the role of the University in the community; and strategies for increasing funding for faculty, students and staff. He asked us not to refer to ourselves just as &ldquo;Librarians&rdquo; but as &ldquo;Builders of the University.&rdquo; Before departing Dr. Glick answered questions from the group. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>III. Approval of February 21, 2001, Minutes</h2>
                  <br>
                  <p>Kurt Murphy submitted an amendment to his remarks made at the February meeting. Minutes were approved as amended.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>IV. Chair & Executive Committee Report</h2>
                 <br>
                  <p>Pat Etter congratulated Marilyn Wurzburger on her celebration of 40 years of service to the University Libraries. She also announced that at our meeting on April 18, Brooke Sheldon, the new Director of the Arizona School of Information Resources and Library Science, will be our guest speaker and classified staff members will be invited to hear her address.
</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;                  </p>
                  <h2>V. Dean&rsquo;s Report - Sherrie Schmidt</h2>
                  <H3>&nbsp;</H3>
                  <p>Dean Schmidt reported that the storage issue is still under negotiation. The proposed facility will be at the East Campus, and she is hoping to get approval for a building which will resemble the Harvard Model, which will allow for expansion in the future. She has been addressing Chairs and Directors, and members of the Academic Senate regarding the Serials Cancellation Project, and has been forwarding messages she&rsquo;s received regarding that issue to Provost Glick. She reports that she has been appointed to the North Central Accreditation Steering Committee, and hopes to see more librarians appointed to this committee since the issue and language of &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; is a very important part of the accreditation process. It is one phase of accreditation best understood by librarians. </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h2>VI. Committee Reports</h2>
                  <H3>&nbsp;</H3>
                  <h3>Personnel Committee - Helen Seaton</h3>
                  <p>Marion, the Librarian&rdquo; packets for Second and Fourth Year reviews are now completed. They have been reviewed by Kurt Murphy and are now to be given to the Review Committee for comment. </p>
                  <h3>Review Committee - Mary Swaty</h3>
                  <p>No report.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Research and Professional Development Committee - Tom Greives</h3>
                  <p>Tom reported that there is still funding available for suitable research projects. Applications should be sent to the Committee as soon as possible.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Compensation Committee - Ken Furuta</h3>
                  <p>No report</p>
                  <h3>Academic Senate - George Bell</h3>
                  <p>No report.</p>
                  <h3>Committee on Academic Professional Status - Helen Seaton</h3>
                  <p>Helen reported that the committee was having difficulty finding candidates willing to serve on the CAPS Grievance Committee, but a slate of candidates has now been selected. The Committee will convene a brown bag luncheon for all A.P.s on May 2.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Page Master - Annie Platoff</h3>
                  <p>No report.</p>
  				  <h3>Nominations Committee - Marilyn Wurzburger</h3>
                  <p>Marilyn reported that in the recent election JoAnn Mulvihill and Lucy Lyons were elected to the Senate for next year.
</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;                  </p>
                  <h2>VII. Old Business</h2>
                  <H3>&nbsp;</H3>
                  <p>Helen Seaton introduced the Revision to Librarians&rsquo; Handbook of section E.2:Criteria. A vote to approve the revisions was taken, and the motion carried. </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <P>Before the revisions to Librarians&rsquo; Handbook C.2.3: Review Committee for Personnel Action could be discussed Kurt Murphy asked to present information he&rsquo;d discovered since our last meeting. It is not allowed for Review Committee &ldquo;business&rdquo; to be conducted via email. Only such personnel documents that are not of a confidential nature and which could be printed and distributed may be transmitted in that mode. It was affirmed that campus mail is considered &ldquo;secure&rdquo; for sending confidential documents and information to members of the committee. Kurt also added that if the Review Committee does not reach a unanimous decision there are specific processes that must be observed. He and Mary Swaty, Chair of the Review Committee, agreed that it would be preferable for them to meet and formulate new recommendations based upon this information. Annie Platoff moved that Council send the document back to the Committee. Motion carried.</p>
                  <br>              <h2>VIII. New Business</h2>
                  <H3>&nbsp;</H3>
                  <p>Kimble Blouin announced that she has recently been appointed to the University Insurance Committee, and that she will try to keep everyone informed of new developments. It has already been determined that everyone will be paying more for prescription drugs and co-payments for office visits when new contracts are in place. Bids for the new contracts are supposed to be received by April 18. Everyone will have to fill out new registration forms for health insurance this year, even if not changing health plans.
</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>                  
                  <P>There being no further business, meeting adjourned at 4:40 p.m.</p>
