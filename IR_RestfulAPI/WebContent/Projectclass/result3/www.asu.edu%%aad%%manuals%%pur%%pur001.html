The policies and procedures contained in this manual reflect the requirements of state and federal statutes, Board of Regents&#146; policies, and good business practices. The director of Purchasing and Business Services is responsible for the interpretation and administration of purchasing policies and procedures.<p>These guidelines cover most but not all cases involving procurement for the university.  In exceptional circumstances or for further information, users should contact Purchasing and Business Services at 480/965&#150;6532 for assistance.<p>Corrections, changes, or suggestions should be communicated to the <a href="mailto:ibujlt@asu.edu">PUR manual coordinator</a>, 480/965&#150;5282.<p>In the event of an inconsistency or conflict, applicable law and Board of Regents&#146; policies supersede university policies and university policies supersede college, department or lower unit bylaws, policies, or guidelines.<p>The university reserves the right to add, amend, or revoke any of the contained rules, policies, regulations, and instructions or incorporate additional ones, with or without notice, as circumstances or the good of the university community may require.<p>The online manual replaces earlier printed versions, which are no longer provided nor distributed.  A printout of this manual and each change to this manual, created from the original text source for the online version, is retained permanently as an official record at University Archives and is available for inspection.  Printouts of all revisions to online manuals will be similarly available.<p>&#160;<font color="FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">PUR</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | Purchasing&#160;and&#160;Business&#160;Services&#160;Web&#160;<a href="purchasing.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
