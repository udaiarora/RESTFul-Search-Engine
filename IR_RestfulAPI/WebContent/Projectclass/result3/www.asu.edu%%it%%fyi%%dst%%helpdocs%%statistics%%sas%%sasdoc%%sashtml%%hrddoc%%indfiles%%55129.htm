<I>by Dr. Larry Hatcher</I><P>
Packed with concrete examples, Hatcher's book provides an introduction to  more advanced statistical procedures and includes handy appendices that
give basic instruction in using the SAS System. Novice SAS users will      find all they need to master SAS basics and move into advanced statistical
analyses in this one book. Featured is a simple, step-by-step approach to  testing structural equation models with latent variables using the CALIS
procedure. The following topics are explained in easy-to-understand        terms: exploratory factor analysis, principal component analysis, and
developing measurement models with confirmatory factor analysis. Other     covered topics of note include "LISREL-type" analyses with the
user-friendly PROC CALIS and solving problems encountered in real-world    social science research.
