                  <P>For those who are able to read Japanese, the stacks of the East Asian Collection (Hayden Level 2) are another major place to look for sources. Various government documents, including federal, states, United Nations, etc., can provide pertinent information to researchers. Additional materials may be identified through a variety of computer databases available in the ASU Libraries. Consult Reference Librarians for further information about these resources, and the Japanese Studies Librarian (Level 4) for the vernacular materials.
