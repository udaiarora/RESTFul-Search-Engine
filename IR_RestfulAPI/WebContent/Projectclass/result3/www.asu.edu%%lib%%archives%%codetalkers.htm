  <p>This bibliography lists both general works on native veterans as well as primary 
  sources for research that are available in the University Libraries, Arizona 
  State University, and the Labriola National American Indian Data Center in particular. 
</p>
<br><p>Nearly all general works on native veterans were written in the past ten years, 
  part of a burgeoning interest in the topic. The main exceptions to that have 
  been works on the Code Talkers. This bibliography does NOT include works on 
  Indian scouts of the nineteenth century or Indian nations as allies fighting 
  alongside the United States against other Indian nations. The guide is on the 
  web at: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/labriola.htm">www.asu.edu/lib/archives/labriola.htm</a></p><br>
