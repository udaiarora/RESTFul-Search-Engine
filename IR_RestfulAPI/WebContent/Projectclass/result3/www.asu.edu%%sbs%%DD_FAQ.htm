<a name="en1">
<b>Q: </b>  Why should I enroll in Student Account Direct Deposit?</a><br>
<b>A: </b>  Direct deposit to your bank account is the fast and efficient way to receive student account refunds, including financial aid. <p> 
<a name="en2">
<b>Q: </b>  How do I enroll in Student Account Direct Deposit?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b>  Log onto <a href="https://sec.was.asu.edu/intsite/Main"><font
color=880000>www.asu.edu/interactive</font></a>, select the option ?Student Account Direct Deposit Enrollment?, and then select the option ?Enroll or Change Direct Deposit Information?.  A paper enrollment form is also available on the Student Business Services web site at www.asu.edu/sbs. <p>
<a name="en3">
<b>Q: </b> What type of account can I use for direct deposit?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b> You may use either a checking account or a savings account.  The account must be with a U.S. bank. <p>
<a name="en4">
<b>Q: </b> Where do I find my bank?s Routing Number? <br></a>  
<b>A: </b> The Routing Number is sometimes referred to as the Transit Number or the ABA, American Banker?s Association, number. The Routing Number is used to identify the particular financial institution that you bank with and it can be found: <p>

<b><u>Checking Accounts: </u></b> The routing number is found at the bottom of your personal check <A HREF="javascript:popUp('checkpopup.html')"><font color=88000> (click here to see sample check)</font></A>. 

<p>  

<b><u>Savings and Other Types of ?Savings? Accounts: </u></b>Deposit slips may not include the correct routing number. For accounts other than checking accounts, contact your financial institution to get the routing number. <p>
<a name="en5">
<b>Q: </b> How many accounts can I have my student account refund deposited to?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b> You may only specify one account at any given time. <p>
<a name="en6"> 
<b>Q: </b>  I just signed up for Student Account Direct Deposit.  When will it become effective?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b>  Your student account Direct Deposit enrollment will be active two weeks after enrolling.  Log onto ASU Interactive and select the link to ?Student Account Direct Deposit Enrollment? to view the Last Enrollment/Modification Date by selecting ?View Current Direct Deposit Information? from the menu.  If refunds are issued to you in the two weeks following enrollment, payment will be made by check and mailed.  Remember to also update your address through ASU Interactive. <p>
<a name="en7">
<b>Q: </b> How do I confirm that my bank account information has been accepted and set up for direct deposit?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b> You can view your direct deposit information and status on the Internet at <a href="https://sec.was.asu.edu/intsite/Main"><font
color=880000>www.asu.edu/interactive</font></a> by selecting the link to ?Student Account Direct Deposit Enrollment? and following the menu options.   If the bank reports a problem with the information you provide we will contact you prior to the enrollment becoming active. <p>
<a name="en8">
<b>Q: </b> Can I have my student account refund deposited into a bank account other than my own? <br></a>
<b>A: </b> You may direct that the refund be deposited to an account that is not your own, for example a parent?s bank account.  You are responsible for specifying the correct account and maintaining accurate banking information with ASU. Once a direct deposit refund is processed, ASU cannot cancel or reverse the direct deposit. <p>
<a name="en9">
<b>Q: </b> If I complete Direct Deposit Enrollment through ASU Interactive do I still need to bring in a copy of a voided check or a savings deposit slip? </a><br> 
<b>A: </b> No.  The Direct Deposit Enrollment function available through ASU Interactive requires you to submit all necessary information.  If the bank reports a problem with the information you provide we will contact you prior to the enrollment becoming active. <p>
<a name="en10">
<b>Q: </b> Is there a paper version of the Direct Deposit Enrollment form that I can turn in rather than using ASU Interactive?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b>  Yes.  The paper form is available for printing from the Student Business Services web site at <a href="./DirectDeposit.htm"><font
color=880000>www.asu.edu/sbs</font></a>.  Follow the instructions on the form. <p>

<b><u>REFUNDS</u></b><p>
<a name="ref1">
<b>Q: </b> How often does the Student Accounts Office process direct deposit refunds?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b>  At the beginning of the semester, direct deposit refunds are processed frequently as financial aid becomes available.   During the rest of the semester, direct deposit refunds are processed three nights a week, Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, for deposit to your bank account on Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday, respectively.  (The schedule will be adjusted for holidays.) <p>
<a name="ref2">
<b>Q: </b> How will I know if I am receiving a student account refund?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b> You can review the transactions posted to your student account, including refunds, on <a href="http://my.asu.edu"><font
color=880000>MyASU</font></a>.  Instructions for viewing student account receivable activity on <a href="http://my.asu.edu"><font
color=880000>MyASU</font></a> are available by clicking here: <a href="./MyAcctsReceivableInstructions.pdf"><font
color=880000>MyASU Instructions</font></a>.   It is important to understand what type of financial aid you will be receiving and what university expenses you will incur. 
<p>  
<a name="ref3">
<b>Q: </b> Can I pick-up my Student Account Refund in person?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b> Direct deposit refunds are processed often so under normal circumstances you won?t have a refund to pick-up in person. <p>  
<a name="ref4">
<b>Q: </b> Can I have my Student Account Refund mailed?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b> You must inactivate your direct deposit enrollment prior to creation of the refund to have a check mailed.  Log in at <a href="https://sec.was.asu.edu/intsite/Main"><font
color=880000>www.asu.edu/interactive</font></a>, select the link to ?Student Accounts Direct Deposit Enrollment?, and then select the option to ?Activate/Inactivate Direct Deposit Enrollment?.  Remember to update your address through ASU Interactive. <p>
<a name="ref5">
<b>Q: </b>  How will I receive a tuition refund if I drop classes?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b>  Tuition credits are processed through Student Accounts Receivable beginning the third week of classes, unless requested earlier through  ASU Interactive <a href="https://sec.was.asu.edu/intsite/Main"><font
color=880000>(www.asu.edu/interactive)</font></a>, &quot;Pay Your ASU Charges and Hold Your Classes&quot;, then ?Tuition Services?.  Tuition credits first pay outstanding charges on Student Accounts Receivable and any remaining balance is refunded beginning the third week of classes.  If you enroll for direct deposit, your tuition refund will be deposited electronically to your bank account. 
<p>   

<b><u>FINANCIAL AID</u></b><p>
<a name="fa1">
<b>Q: </b>  How is financial aid refunded?  Will financial aid be direct deposited to my bank account if I enroll in Student Account Direct Deposit?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b>  Financial aid is first used to pay charges on Student Accounts Receivable.  Any remaining balance is refunded to you.  If you enroll in Student Account Direct Deposit, financial aid in excess of university charges billed to student accounts receivable will be refunded to you and direct deposited to your bank account. <p>
<a name="fa2">
<b>Q: </b>  What is the deadline for enrolling in Student Account Direct Deposit to ensure that my financial aid is direct deposited to my bank account?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b>  Enroll a month before the semester begins to ensure that financial aid is deposited to your bank account.  Refunds issued prior to your direct deposit enrollment becoming active will be made by check and mailed.  Remember to update your address through ASU Interactive. <p>
<a name="fa3">
<b>Q: </b>  When is financial aid refunded?</a> <br> 
<b>A: </b>  If you enroll in direct deposit per the guidelines in the previous question, financial aid refunds will be deposited electronically to your bank account starting six days before classes begins for the fall and spring semesters.  To qualify for the earliest availability, you must register for classes, complete your financial aid packet, and accept your loans at least two weeks before classes begin.<p>  
<a name="fa4">
<b>Q: </b> If I am expecting a late disbursement of my financial aid, will those monies be direct deposited?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b> Yes.  Refunds are issued through-out the semester and direct deposited to your bank account if you are enrolled in Student Account Direct Deposit. <p>
 
<b><u>MISCELLANEOUS</u></b><p>
<a name="mis1">
<b>Q: </b> Can I enroll for direct deposit if I am a student athlete?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b>  In order to comply with NCAA and ICA regulations regarding posting and disbursing of ICA monies, active and potential athletes will not be included in direct deposit.  Athletes may enroll in Student Account Direct Deposit, but refund checks will be produced instead of direct deposit transactions while you are an active athlete.  If your ICA athlete status becomes inactive you will be included in direct deposit. <p>   
<a name="mis2">
<b>Q: </b>  What charges are billed on my Student Account?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b>  Student Accounts Receivable is used to bill residential life charges, parking tickets, library fines, and miscellaneous department charges.  Tuition is billed on Student Accounts Receivable if you hold your classes with financial aid or enroll in the tuition installment plan.  You may view unpaid Student Accounts Receivable charges and make payments on the Internet at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/interactive" class="style1">www.asu.edu/interactive</a>, &quot;Pay your ASU Charges and Hold Your Classes&quot;, then ?Student Accounts Receivable&quot;.  You may view all your Student Accounts Receivable activity on the Internet at my.asu.edu by clicking on your accounts receivable balance.
<p>  
<a name="mis3">
<b>Q: </b> Will my banking information be safe and secure?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b>  Yes, ASU has taken steps to safeguard the banking information stored on its computer systems.  It is important that you keep your ASURITE UserID and password secure so that unauthorized persons cannot log onto ASU Interactive. <p> 
<a name="mis4">
<b>Q: </b> What should I do if I still have questions?</a> <br>
<b>A: </b> Contact the Student Accounts Office located in the Student Services Building room 230 or call (480) 965-6341. <p>
