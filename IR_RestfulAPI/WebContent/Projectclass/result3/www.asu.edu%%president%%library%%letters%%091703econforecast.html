Crow, President, Arizona State University </p>              <p>One of the fundamental premises of my vision for ASU is that                it must assume major responsibility for the economic, social,                and cultural health of the metropolitan area and region. &nbsp; This                is a daunting task, but it is essential because ASU is integral                to the well-being of our region. </p>              <p>Arizona has fought throughout its history to build economic                prosperity, and we cannot stop now. &nbsp; We have secured the                physical infrastructure that makes life in the desert possible,                but in the new knowledge economy the fight is for knowledge infrastructure. &nbsp; There                is a direct correlation between success in the new economy and                the research infrastructure of a region&rsquo;s research universities. &nbsp; Research                capacity has been pinpointed as the single most critical factor                in shaping regional economic success&ndash;as Federal Reserve chairman                Alan Greenspan has argued, investment in university research                structure is key to building economic resiliency. </p>              <p>During the past few years the people of Arizona have made an                unprecedented commitment to university science and technology                research. &nbsp; The approval of Proposition 301 in November                2000 represented public recognition of the need to invest in                the future prosperity of our region by providing a long-term                funding stream for science and technology investments. &nbsp; And                the 2003 legislative session ended June 19 with the state legislature                passing a bill that will enable ASU to build $185 million in                new research infrastructure. &nbsp; A broad coalition of support                from the business community, city government, and state political                leaders, such as Gov. Janet Napolitano, Speaker of the House                Jake Flake, Speaker Pro Tempor Bob Robson, and Senate President                Ken Bennett, helped the bill pass against considerable odds. &nbsp; It                is a pivotal acknowledgment by government leaders that investing                in higher education is critical to the economic success of the                region. </p>              <p>This public investment opens the door to a knowledge-based Arizona                economy in which our universities will play a critical role. &nbsp; The                potential of new technology-based industries&ndash;biotechnology, nanotechnology,                and information technology&ndash;to generate wealth and bring prosperity                to the state, however, depends both on our ability to prepare                our students to become globally competitive innovators, and to                attract and retain knowledge workers&ndash;a &ldquo;creative class,&rdquo;                as it has been termed&ndash;from across the nation. &nbsp; Arizona                must become a <em>knowledge producer</em>, rather than a knowledge                importer. &nbsp; With                growing competition, continued investment, both public and private,                is essential to the success of our plan. </p>              <p>In a metropolitan region with a population that exceeds three                million, a population, moreover, that includes a significant                number of aging adults and families with inadequate medical care,                quality healthcare is a major social issue. &nbsp; But along                with economic prosperity, university research promises to bring                state-of-the-art healthcare to the region. &nbsp; Improving the                human condition is at the core of research at ASU, and without                question it is the prime motivation behind its research in the                life sciences, and the fields of bioscience, biotechnology, and                biomedicine. </p>              <p>The April groundbreaking for the Arizona Biodesign Institute                was a signal event in ASU&rsquo;s research enterprise, marking the                advent of a pioneering collaborative effort in the life sciences                dedicated to improving human health and the quality of life through                biodesign&ndash;the intentional manipulation of biological systems. &nbsp; Arizona                Biodesign combines many of the universitys leading programs                related to biomedicine to form a use-inspired and interdisciplinary                world-class research institute committed to real-world impact,                such as enhanced pharmaceuticals, the development of biomechanical                prostheses, plant-based vaccines that can be easily grown and                distributed in third-world countries, and new rehabilitation                techniques for spinal cord injuries. </p>              <p>The hallmark of Arizona Biodesign is a research agenda that                emphasizes the application of discoveries to commercial uses                and societal benefits. &nbsp; The research programs are clustered                in two focus areas of increasing contemporary relevance: &nbsp; biologics                and therapeutics, and nano-biosystems and devices. &nbsp; And                with the critical mass attained through the establishment in                Phoenix of the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen)                and the International Genomics Consortium, Arizona Biodesign                has the potential not only to advance knowledge and improve healthcare,                but to reconfigure the economic portfolio of the region. </p>              <p>But ASU seeks to have even broader impact, and I would describe                our approach to public service as nothing less than comprehensive. &nbsp; Our                programs and initiatives in local schools and neighborhoods build                communities. &nbsp; Our very presence is a leading force in the                local economy&ndash;the total annual economic impact of ASU on spending                in the state is estimated to be $2.1 billion, and this is to                say nothing of the higher productivity and earnings that are                made possible because of the knowledge and skills students acquire. &nbsp; We                tackle local and regional problems through research and analysis,                and provide a forum for public debate. &nbsp; We bring intelligent                and insightful programming to Arizona through our public television                station, KAET, and, with our libraries, museums, and innovative                programming in the visual and performing arts, ASU's contribution                to the cultural depth of our region requires no elaboration. &nbsp; </p>              <p>Universities are powerful engines for societal transformation&ndash;no                institution has more potential to improve the human condition,                provide us with the tools we need for better planetary stewardship,                and foster sustained economic growth. &nbsp; Never before has                the impact of knowledge been greater, and as one of only 300                major research institutions in the world, ASU has the potential                to generate new knowledge that may influence almost every aspect                of our future&ndash;and bring new economic prosperity to the region                and state. </p>              <p>I appreciate the interest of the business community in ASU,                and look forward to meeting many more of you in person to hear                your ideas and share our vision. &nbsp;
