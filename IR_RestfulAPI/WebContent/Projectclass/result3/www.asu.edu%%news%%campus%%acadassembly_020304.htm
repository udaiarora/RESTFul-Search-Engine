      <h2>Crow drives entrepreneurial focus at Academic Assembly breakfast </h2>
      <p>ASU has made good progress on its path to becoming a comprehensive metropolitan research university, but there is much more ground to cover, said President Michael Crow during his speech at the Jan. 27 Spring Academic Assembly Breakfast. </p>
      <p>"It is our duty - our responsibility - to help build metropolitan Phoenix as it emerges to become one of the largest cities in the United States," Crow said. </p>
      <p>In order to accomplish all that needs to be done, Crow said it is essential that ASU move away from the campus-based model and move to a school-centric model for the university. But, he said it must be done without structuring the university in a way that fosters tiering or ranking, where the main campus is the flagship and other campuses are somehow marginal set-asides or cast-offs. </p>
      <p>"We need a university that is built around outstanding schools, where each school stands on its own, competing not with other schools within the university, but with other schools like it around the country and around the world," Crow said. </p>
      <p>Referring to schools or colleges as the unit of intellectual activity between faculty and students around a theme or objective, Crow said they would have a chance to complement each other, work with each other, leverage each other, and build from each other. </p>
      <p>"At the end of the day, we must build one university where every place you enter is a place where academic quality is high for the program that's present, where the faculty and staff are treated fairly and equally, and people advance to the creativity and merit associated with their work." </p>
      <p>Crow was adamant, however, that, in order to move forward, the university must devolve intellectual authority and intellectual entrepreneurism to the level of the school. </p>
      <p>"You can't drive the university from where I'm sitting," he said. "What I can do is help create the environment, help acquire the resources, help protect and defend the university from its most strategically empowered enemies or ally with our most strategically empowered friends. The university really has to advance through small groups of faculty, working with students to push their intellectual agenda and become competitive in those areas that they feel are right." </p>
      <p>Crow said he believes the university is on a solid academic foundation in this regard, with excellent faculty and staff and good students, with the capacity to do an even better job of attracting and retaining top students. </p>
      <p>He said there are some issues, however. One of those issues is communicating strongly enough how essential it is for everyone to embrace the enterprise model in order for the university to be successful. </p>
      <p>"We are responsible for our own destiny," Crow said. "No legislature, no external group, no donor, can make this university successful. That fundamental fact, in my opinion, is what separates great universities from good universities. The great universities are in charge of their own destinies and they know it." </p>
      <p>He said the enterprise model amounts to each school, each department, each program, saying "this is what we want to be, this is our aspiration, and this is what we need to do to be able to get there." </p>
      <p>"Our objective, and where I will be focusing my energy, is to continue to <br>
  advance the university from its successful attainment of the status of good to the yet to be attained status of great," Crow said. </p>
