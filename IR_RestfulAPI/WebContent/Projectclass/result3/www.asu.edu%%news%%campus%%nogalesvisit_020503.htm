      <h2>Crow's visit to Nogales - educational, memorable</h2>
      <p> <img src="campus_images/nogales.jpg" alt="Crow visits Nogales." width="244" height="188" align="right">While 
        most people were getting ready to go to work or attend class, ASU President 
        Michael Crow spent the morning of Jan. 22 getting ready to take a trip 
        south. His destination was Nogales, Ariz.</p>
      <p>During his inauguration on Nov. 8, 2002, President Crow shared his vision 
        with the Valley and ASU community, for transforming ASU into the new American 
        university. Crow's visit to Nogales signified his efforts to learn about 
        economic and academic issues that affect Arizona border cities, in order 
        to position ASU as the New Gold Standard in higher education.</p>
      <p>"The economic and cultural vitality of the state of Arizona is inextricably 
        linked with the vitality of its universities," Crow said in his inauguration 
        speech. "The transformation of Arizona State University will transform 
        the state of Arizona, enriching it economically and culturally. But let 
        us not limit our vision because the development of a new American university 
        here in Arizona will have impact beyond the borders of our state."</p>
      <p>As one of seven other ASU representatives who accompanied President Crow 
        to Nogales, I felt a strong sense of a loyalty, not only to ASU but also 
        to my hometown of Nogales. Located on the border of Sonora, Nogales radiates 
        an energy and culture unmatched by other cities in Arizona. </p>
      <p>As we headed south, Dr. Crow asked me, "What can you tell me about Nogales?"<br>
        My response was instantaneous: "Nogales has the nicest people you'll ever 
        meet. I hope during your visit, you'll get to experience their unique 
        hospitality."</p>
      <p>Our first stop was an informal luncheon hosted by the citizens of Santa 
        Cruz County and ASU alumni from Nogales. We were treated to a hero's welcome 
        and a performance by the Nogales High School mariachi band and dancers, 
        at the Americana Motor Hotel, located at the heart of Nogales.</p>
      <p>President Crow met various citizens that included Nogales Mayor Marco 
        Lopez, Assistant Superintendent Marcelino Varona Jr., and Education Director 
        for Young Audiences of Santa Cruz County Lourdes Moreno-Jeong, who was 
        one of many ASU alumni who also attended.</p>
      <p>At the luncheon, Crow spoke about the importance of social embeddedness 
        and the need to adopt a more entrepreneurial approach to higher education. 
        Crow also spoke about the importance of establishing partnerships with 
        border cities in order to build a stronger university that best represents 
        all of Arizona and the citizens who strive for success in higher education.</p>
      <p>Following the luncheon we went to Chamberlain Distributing, a family-owned 
        produce distribution business, which has been in existence since 1971. 
        Chamberlain is one of many family businesses struggling to help Nogales' 
        weakened economy. </p>
      <p>We participated in a roundtable discussion focusing on the produce industry, 
        border relations and the Cyber Port Project. Jaime Chamberlain, vice-president 
        of Chamberlain Distributing, and ASU alumni Rudy Paredes, vice-president 
        of BorderPro Logistics; and J.B. Manson, president of Pacific Brokerage 
        Company, Inc. led the discussion that provided President Crow with an 
        overview of how Nogales produce businesses conduct their import/export 
        operations.</p>
      <p>To help demonstrate how the border affects the economic status of Nogales, 
        we visited the South Port of Entry and were given a tour of the facilities 
        by Celia De La Ossa, chief inspector for U.S. Customs. De La Ossa provided 
        President Crow with a detailed runthrough of how cargo is inspected and 
        managed, using high-tech equipment and on-duty customs agents. In addition, 
        we crossed the Arizona/Sonora border on a tour bus. As we made our way 
        into Sonora, we saw a crowd of semi-trucks interwoven with regular traffic, 
        all lined up to make their way into Arizona.</p>
      <p>Once we returned to the Arizona side, our visit to Nogales quickly came 
        to an end. As we thanked our tour guides, I realized how enlightening 
        and bittersweet this trip was for me. Being from a small city like Nogales, 
        I grew up wanting to move away in search of success, but coming home is 
        a feeling that continues to be immeasurable. <br>
        President Crow's visit was a success and one I trust he will refer to 
        as he continues to take ASU into a new direction in higher education.</p>
