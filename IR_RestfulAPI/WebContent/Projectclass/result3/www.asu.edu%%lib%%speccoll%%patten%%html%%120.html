"The Garden of Health" included all the medical knowledge
 of its time.  Its author is unknown and, like many other early herbals,
 it is thought to be a compilation of data from many sources.  This is
 one of two incunabula (books printed before 1501) in this collection.
 <i>Der Gart</i> was the first herbal written not in Greek or Latin, but in
 the vernacular German; however, because it is in the Bavarian dialect
 it is still quite difficult for modern readers.  This work heralded a
 return to nature as the source for the botanical specimens used for
 illustrations.  There were 379 woodcuts designed especially for this work,
 with 65 being faithful renditions of plant specimens.  The remaining
 illustrations were copied from earlier sources.  By using larger woodcuts,
 greater accuracy and detail could be depicted.  <i>Der Gart</i> lists in
 alphabetical order every known disease or ailment, and under each,
 gives references to chapters discussing appropriate remedies.  In
 addition there is an index listing the medicinal "simples" which
 were the single or primary ingredients from which compounded prescriptions
 were made.  There are 435 chapters about plants, chapters on minerals
 and animal products, and a chapter on uroscopy, a method of analyzing
 a patient's urine to diagnose disease.  Some feeling for the style of
 this work can be obtained from a translation of part of the entry for
 bituminous coal: "A master named Enax says in his Book of Stones that
 this is a gemstone that has power to turn away all demons and melancholy
 from virgins [who carry it]."
