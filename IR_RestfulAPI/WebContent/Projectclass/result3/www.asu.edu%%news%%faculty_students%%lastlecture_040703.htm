      <h2>Famous last words - Students choose gifted teachers for 2003 Last Lecture
        Series</h2>
      <p>        Snooze through one of these lectures? Not a chance. In a celebration
        of great teaching, ASU students have chosen three of their favorite professors
        to give a Last Lecture. The teachers are asked to speak as if it were
        the last appearance they would ever make before a class, on topics close
        to their hearts.</p>
      <p>In the eighth year of what has become an honored tradition
          sponsored by Co-Curricular Programs, three dynamic teachers have been
          selected
          out of 106 who were nominated. </p>
      <p>They are Greg Durham, senior lecturer
          in finance who has taught at ASU eight years; Daniel Brouwer, assistant
          professor in the Hugh Downs School
          of Human Communication who has been at ASU three years; and Chris Smith,
          associate professor of history, who is completing 32 years at ASU.</p>
      <p>Durham
          begins the series at 7:30 p.m., April 9, in the Old Main Carson Ballroom,
          with "Parting Thoughts: Alternative Perspectives on Education
          and Capitalism for the Overachieving Undergraduate Student." He will
          share some "slightly idealistic philosophies" about what a student
        should seek from the collegiate academic experience. </p>
      <p>"I'll talk about viewing
          classes, coursework and grades not so much from a competitive perspective,
          but from a collaborative one," he says. "I
          make great efforts to try to instill in my students a set of values
        that is completely different from the fundamental principles which govern
          the professional business environment."</p>
      <p>A student who nominated Durham
          said, "He makes finance come alive before his students' eyes."</p>
      <p>Brouwer's lecture on "The Rhetoric of the Body" will
          be at 7:30 p.m., April 21, in the Memorial Union (MU) Pima Room. </p>
      <p>"I plan to combine a
          lecture with humorous and poignant performance of personal narratives,"
          he says. "This will provide me with the opportunity
          to dramatize the interconnections between teaching and studying, between
          lived experience and scholarly abstractions, and between the university
          and public life."</p>
      <p>He also will comment on how people's relations to their
          bodies are altered after being diagnosed with a serious illness, specifically
          HIV and AIDS.</p>
      <p>Students
          praised Brouwer: "He garners respect while treating his students with
          respect, as well."</p>
      <p>Smith said he will talk about historical items
          in his collections of Americana, from political and labor buttons to
          songs, kitchen artifacts
          and private journals. He will present "Looking for History Everywhere
          and Anywhere I Can Find It: Insights from the American Material and
        Popular Culture," at 7:30 p.m., April 29, in the MU Pima Room.</p>
      <p>"I have always
          been searching for the historical insights that jump from the artifact
          and cry out for understanding of our past," he said. "We
          never outgrow, nor should we, our need to show and tell, for it shows
          our roles in the history of our time and the history of the nation."</p>
      <p>A
          student wrote that "Professor Smith conveys his passion for history
        in and outside the classroom. He approaches his subjects like no other."</p>
      <p>The
          three professors were chosen by a panel of students and each will receive
          a $500 honorarium. For information, call Kim Miller at (480)
        965-9600.</p>
