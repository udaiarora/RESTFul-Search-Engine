						&quot;Free Nelson
						Mandela, Free Nelson Mandela.&quot; So many times I hear these words replaying
						in my mind. Out of all the many people that have inspired me, no one touches
						my heart as much as one man of absolute conviction, Nelson Mandela.

					<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
						 After over 25 years
						serving a prison sentence for demanding basic dignity, Nelson Mandela
						rose from the ashes and became President of South Africa. If one black
						man can become president of a predominantly white, segregated society,
						who knows what I can achieve? The racism in South Africa has always disturbed
						me. As a young child, I couldn't understand why two sets of people were
						separated simply because of their color. Was there no justice in the world?
						I remember following the news, watching the riots, wondering what kind
						of world I was living in. Then, one memorable day, I turned on the news
						to see Nelson Mandela taking his first steps to freedom.
					</font>
					</p>
					<p>
					<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
						 Every day I think
						about my color and how it makes me different from the people around me.
						Growing up with a white father and a black mother traps me between the
						two worlds. As much as I try to pretend that color holds no meaning in
						society, the fact of the matter is that color is important. I have been
						lucky enough to avoid racial confrontations, but the stories I read and
						hear expose me to the reality of racism in the world.
					</font>
					</p>
					<p>
					<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
						 To me, Nelson Mandela
						symbolizes hope. There will always be injustice in the world, but the
						people that stand out and fight for their beliefs shape the world for
						future generations. Because of people like Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther
						King I can walk down the street and live the life of a normal American
						citizen. For this I am grateful and inspired to live my life to the fullest,
						taking advantage of the opportunity I have been given by these courageous
						people.
