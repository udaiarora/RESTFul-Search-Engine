ODS HTML statement opens, manages, or closes the HTML destination. If the
destination is open, it produces output that is written in Hyper Text Markup
Language (HTML). If you use it with SAS/GRAPH procedures,
you can specify one of the device drivers GIF, ACTIVEX, or JAVA (ACTIVEX and
JAVA are only available with GCHART, GCONTOUR, GMAP, GPLOT, and G3D). With
the GIF device driver, the graphics output is stored in GIF files. With the
ACTIVEX device driver, graphics output is stored as ActiveX controls. With
the JAVA device driver, graphics output is stored a Java applets. The HTML
files that are generated reference the graphics output. When viewed with a
Web browser, the HTML files can display graphics and non-graphics output together
on the same Web page. </A>

<DL>
<DT><B>external-file</B></DT>
<DD>is the physical name of an external
file to write to. For information on specifying external files, see the SAS
companion for your operating environment.<P></DD>

<DT> <B>fileref</B></DT>
<DD>is a fileref that has been assigned
to an external file. The fileref must refer to a single file; it cannot point
to an aggregate file storage location.  Use a FILENAME statement to assign
a fileref. See also <A href="zs-parts.htm#zilename">FILENAME Statement</A>.<P></DD>

<DT><B>entry</B>.HTML</DT>
<DD>specifies an entry in a SAS catalog to write to.You
must also specify a library and catalog. See the discussion on

<DT><A name="z0750727">&#13;
URL='<B>Uniform-Resource-Locator</B>'</A></DT>
<DD>provides a URL for <B>file-specification</B>. ODS uses this URL instead of the file name in all the links and references
that it creates that point to the file.
<P><B>Operating Environment Information:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the CMS operating
environment, you must use the URL= suboption in the HTML-file specifications
for the body, contents, and page files because CMS file names do not form
valid URLs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom">
<P>This option is useful for building HTML files that may be moved from
one location to another. If the links from the contents and page files are
constructed with a simple URL (one name), they work as long as the contents,
page, and body files are all in the same location.<P></DD>

<DT><A name="z0750729">&#13;
NO_BOTTOM_MATTER </A>
<BR>NOBOT</DT>
<DD>omits the bottom matter for the file.
By default, when you close a file that was open for HTML output of any kind,
ODS writes some HTML to the bottom of the file. This HTML ends the file so
that it can be viewed cleanly in a browser.
<P>If you wish to leave a file in a state that you can
append to, use NO_BOTTOM_MATTER on the BODY= option on the ODS HTML statement
that opens the file. This option, in conjunction with NO_TOP_MATTER makes
it possible for you to add output to a file that already exists and to put
your own HTML code in the file between pieces of output.
<P>To use NO_BOTTOM_MATTER, you must use a fileref for <B>file-specification</B>. The FILENAME statement that
defines the fileref
must include the host-specific option that opens the file for appending.
<P>When you are opening a file that ODS has previously written to, you
must use ANCHOR= to specify a new base name for the anchors to avoid duplicating
anchors that already exist in the file. (See the discussion of
<A href="#z1032596">ANCHOR=</A>.<P></DD>

<DT><A name="z0750734">&#13; NO_TOP_MATTER   </A>
<BR>NOTOP</DT>
<DD>omits the opening matter for the
file. By default, when you open a file for HTML output of any kind, ODS writes
some HTML to the top of the file.
<P>If you wish to append ODS output to an existing file,
you must open the file with NO_TOP_MATTER on the BODY= option on the ODS HTML
statement that opens the file. This option, in conjunction with NO_BOTTOM_MATTER
makes it possible for you to add output to a file that already exists and
to put your own HTML code in the file between pieces of output.
<P>To use NO_TOP_MATTER, you must use a fileref for <B>file-specification</B>. The FILENAME statement
that defines the fileref
must include the host-specific option that opens the file for appending.
<P>When you are opening a file that ODS has previously written to, you
must use ANCHOR= to specify a new base name for the anchors to avoid duplicating
anchors that already exist in the file. (See the discussion of
<A href="#z1032596">ANCHOR=</A>.<P></DD>

<DT>DYNAMIC</DT>
<DD>enables you to send HTML output directly to a web
server instead of writing it to a file. This option sets the value of the
HTMLContentType= attribute.
<P>By default, if you do not specify DYNAMIC, ODS sets the value of HTMLContentType=
 for writing to a file.
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you specify the DYNAMIC suboption with any file specification
in the ODS HTML statement, you must specify it for all the file specifications
in the statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR><P></DD>
</DL>
<P></DD>
</DL>
 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of how
you specify the file, you may need to include the extension .HTML or .HTM
on the file name. Some browsers require one of these extensions in order to
read the file.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>

ANCHOR='<B>anchor-name</B>'</DT>
<DD>specifies the base name of the HTML
anchor that identifies each piece of output in the body files. An anchor is
the name of a link target. Each output object must have an anchor tag for
the contents, page, and frame files to link to or to reference. These links
and references, which are automatically created by ODS, point to the name
of an anchor. Therefore, each anchor name in a file must be unique.
<P>By default, the first anchor name is IDX, and all subsequent
anchors generated while the HTML destinations remain open increment that name,
for example, IDX1, IDX2, and so forth. Because anchor names continue to increment
while the HTML destinations remain open, it can be difficult to predict what
the name of a link anchor will be. ANCHOR= enables you to control these names.
<P>You can change anchor names as often as you like by
submitting the ANCHOR= option in an ODS HTML statement anywhere in your program.
Once you have specified an anchor name, it remains in effect until you specify
a new one.  Like the default, specified anchor values increment while the
ODS HTML destination remains open or until you assign a new value.  For example,
if you specify ANCHOR='SALESCHART' and submit a procedure that generates three
graphs, the anchor names in the body file are SALESCHART, SALESCHART1, and
SALESCHART2.
<P>If you open an HTML file to append to it, be sure to specify a new anchor
so that you don't write the same anchors to the file again. ODS cannot know
about anchors that are already in a file when it opens the file.

<DT> ARCHIVE='<B>string</B>'</DT>
<DD>writes to an  &lt;APPLET> or &lt;OBJECT> tag the
attribute that specifies the location of the executable files that dynamic
SAS/GRAPH output requires. Use ARCHIVE= in conjunction with SAS/GRAPH procedures
and the DEVICE=JAVA or DEVICE=ACTIVEX option in the GOPTIONS statement.
<P>If you specify DEVICE=JAVA in a GOPTIONS statement, ARCHIVE= provides
the argument for the ARCHIVE attribute in an  &lt;APPLET> tag. In this case, <B>string</B> specifies the location of the archive file that contains the
class files that are necessary to run the applet. (Class files are binary
Java files that the browser runs.) If you specify DEVICE=ACTIVEX in a GOPTIONS
statement,  ARCHIVE= provides the argument for the CODEBASE attribute in the
 &lt;OBJECT> tag. This attribute should point to an executable file that installs
the ActiveX control on your machine.  This attribute is not necessary for
generating dynamic SAS/GRAPH output if the ActiveX control is already installed
on your machine. However, if you wish to publish your output on the Web or
to mail the HTML results to someone else, it is wise to include the ARCHIVE=
option so that the ActiveX control can, if necessary, be installed on the
machine that is reading the results.
<P>The string must be one that the browser can interpret. For instance,
if the archive file is local to the machine that you are running SAS on, you
can use the FILE protocol to identify the file. If you want to point to an
archive file that is on a web server, use the HTTP protocol.
<P>If you do not specify ARCHIVE= and you are using the JAVA device driver,
ODS uses the value of the SAS system option APPLETOC=. This value points to
the location of the Java archive files that ship with the SAS system. To find
out what the value of this option is, you can either look in the Options window
in the Files folder under Environment Control, or you can submit the following
procedure step:



<PRE>proc options option=appletloc;
        run;</PRE>There is no default if you are using the ACTIVEX device
driver.
<P>The ARCHIVE attribute is a feature of Java 1.1. Therefore, if you are
using the Java device driver, your browser must support this version of Java.
Both Internet Explorer 4.01 and Netscape 4.05 support Java 1.1. <P></DD>

<DT><A name="z0750746">&#13;
BASE='<B>Uniform-Resource-Locator</B>'</A></DT>
<DD>specifies a URL to use as the first
part of all links that ODS creates in the HTML files. Consider this specification:
 



<PRE>BASE='http://www.<I>your-company.com</I>/<I>local-url</I>/'</PRE>
<P>In this case, ODS creates links that begin with the
string 


<CODE><B>http://www.your-company.com/local-url/</B></CODE>. The appropriate <B>anchor-name</B> completes the link.<P></DD>

<DT><A name="z0750749">&#13;
 GFOOTNOTE | NOGFOOTNOTE  </A>
<BR>GFOOT | NOGFOOT</DT>
<DD>controls whether the HTML file displays
all the titles that are defined by TITLE statements in the SAS/GRAPH program
that generates the HTML output.  Available only with DEVICE=GIF. GTITLE is
the default and displays all currently defined titles within the SAS/GRAPH output
(the GIF file) that is displayed by the HTML.  NOGTITLE suppresses all TITLE
statements in the GIF files that are created by SAS/GRAPH but
displays them as part of the HTML (this is the only option with the ACTIVEX
and JAVA device drivers).
<P>Footnotes that are displayed by ODS HTML support most SAS/GRAPH FOOTNOTE
statement options. The font must be valid for the browser.  Options that ODS
cannot handle, such as height and text angle specifications, are ignored.

<DD>specifies the destination for all
graphics output generated by the ODS HTML statement.  By default, the output
is stored in the location that is specified on PATH=. If you do not specify
PATH=, the output is stored using the GSFNAME location. If GSFNAME is not
specified, the output is stored in the current directory.

Use HEADTEXT= to define programs (for example, java scripts) that you can
use later in the file.
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ODS cannot parse the HTML that you supply.
It should be well-formed HTML that makes sense in the context of the &lt;HEAD>
and &lt;/HEAD> tags. For information on HTML, refer to one of the many reference
books that are available on the subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR><P></DD>

<DT>METATEXT='<B>HTML-for-document-head</B>'</DT>
<DD>specifies HTML to use as the &lt;META> tag inside
the &lt;HEAD> and &lt;/HEAD> tags of all the HTML files that the HTML destination
writes to. This HTML provides the browser with information about the document
that it is loading. This information could include things like the content-type
and the character set to use. For information on HTML, refer to one of the
many reference books that are available on the subject. 
<P>If you do not specify METATEXT=, ODS writes a simple &lt;META> tag,
which includes the content-type of the document and the character set to use,
to all the HTML files that it creates. It takes the value of the character

ODS writes the HTML only to the contents, frame, and page files.

<DT><B>fileref</B> </DT>
<DD>is a fileref that has been assigned to an external

a fileref in the PATH= option, ODS does not use information from PATH= when
it constructs links. (See <A href="#z1032761">How ODS Constructs Links and References</A>).<P></DD>

</DL>
<P></DD>

<DT>URL='<B>Uniform-Resource-Locator</B>' | NONE</DT>
<DD>provides a URL for <I>file-location</I>.
ODS uses this URL instead of the file name in all the links and references
that it creates to the file. If you specify the keyword NONE, no information
from the PATH= option appears in the links or references. 
<P><B>Operating Environment Information:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the CMS operating environment, you must use the URL= suboption in the PATH=

<P>This option is useful for building HTML files that may be moved from

<DD>specifies an alternate record separator for the HTML
files. A record separator is the character or string that separates lines
in the HTML files. 
<P>Different operating environments use different separator characters.
If you don't specify a record separator, the HTML files are formatted for
the environment that you run the SAS job in. However, if you are generating
files in one operating environment for viewing in another operating environment
that uses a different separator character, you can specify a record separator
that is appropriate for the target environment.
<P>
<DL>
<DT>'<B>string</B>' </DT>
<DD>is the hexadecimal representation of one or more
characters. For example, the following option specifies a record-separator
of a carriage-return character and a linefeed character (on an ASCII file
system):



<PRE>RECORD_SEPARATOR='0D0A'x</PRE><P></DD>

<DT>NONE</DT>
<DD>produces HTML that is appropriate for the environment
that you run the SAS job in. In many operating environments, using a value
of NONE is the same as omitting the RECORD_SEPARATOR option. However, in mainframe
operating environments, it is not.
<P><B>Operating Environment Information:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a mainframe environment,
by default, ODS produces a binary file that contains embedded record-separator
characters. While this approach means that the file is not restricted by the
line-length restrictions on ASCII files, it also means that if you view the
file in an editor, the lines all run together.
<P>If you want to format the HTML files so that you can read them with
an editor, use RECORD_SEPARATOR=NONE. In this case, ODS writes one line of
HTML at a time to the file. When you use a value of NONE, the logical record
length of the file that you are writing to must be at least as long as the
longest line that ODS produces. If it isn't, the HTML may wrap to another
line at an inappropriate place.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><P></DD>

<DD>translate the HTML files to the requested representation.
 This option is particularly useful if you are creating files - for
example, in an EBCDIC-based operating environment and if the files are destined
for an ASCII-based web server. If you use TRANTAB=, you can transfer the files
in binary mode as they are already in the appropriate representation. (SAS

<P>While the ODS HTML destination is open, you can submit
as many ODS HTML statements as you like, and you can place them anywhere in
your SAS/GRAPH program. This enables
you to open new files, change anchor names, or specify a new location for
graphics output whenever you like.  At the end of your ODS HTML processing
step, submit ODS HTML CLOSE to close the destination and all open files.
<BR><H3>Specifying a Destination for ODS HTML Output</H3>


<P><A name="z0750782">&#13; When you use the ODS
HTML statement, you must do the following: </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>assign a body file with the ODS HTML BODY= option<P>

<LI>specify DEVICE=GIF (or
TARGET=GIF) in a GOPTIONS
statement to create the GIF files. By default with ODS processing, the GIF
files are stored in the current directory. To specify a destination for all
the HTML and GIF files, use the PATH= option. To store the GIF files in a
different location than the HTML files, use the GPATH= option to specify a
location for the GIF files, and PATH= to specify the location of the HTML
files. In both cases,the destination must be an aggregate storage location.
With procedures GCHART, GCONTOUR, GMAP, GPLOT, and G3D, you can also use DEVICE=ACTIVEX
to create graphs as ActiveX controls, or DEVICE=JAVA to create graphs as Java
applets. The controls or applets are defined within the body file.<P>

<BR><H3>Submitting Multiple ODS HTML Statements</H3>


<P><A name="z0750786">&#13;
Typically you submit one
or more ODS HTML statements to open files and assign option values. ODS HTML
statements are additive. That is, any files that you open or any options that
you specify remain in effect until you change the option value or close the
ODS HTML destination.</A>
<P>When you are using ODS, it is wise to specify a QUIT
statement at the end of every procedure that supports RUN-group processing.
If you end every procedure step explicitly, rather than waiting for the next
PROC or DATA step to end it for you, the QUIT statement will cause the selection
list to clear, and you will be be less likely to encounter unexpected results.
<BR><H3><A name="zanchors">About Anchors</A></H3>


<P><A name="z0750794">&#13;  ODS HTML automatically creates an <B>anchor</B> for every
piece of output generated by the SAS procedures. An anchor specifies a particular
location within an HTML file. In SAS/GRAPH,
an anchor usually defines a link target such as a graph whose location is
defined in an IMG element.  The following generated HTML output shows how
the default anchor name 


</A><CODE><B>IDX</B></CODE> is associated with the graph stored
in the file named 


<CODE><B>totals.gif</B></CODE>:  



<PRE>&lt;A NAME="IDX">&lt;/A>
&lt;HR size=3>&lt;P>
&lt;CENTER>
&lt;IMG SRC="totals.gif"></PRE>
<P>In order for the links from the contents, page, or frame
file to work, each piece of output in the body files must have a unique anchor
to link to. The anchor for the first piece of output in a body file acts as
the anchor for that file.  These anchors are used by the frame and contents
files, if they are created, to identify the targets for the links that ODS
HTML automatically generates.
<P>By default, the first anchor is named 


<CODE><B>IDX</B></CODE>
and all subsequent anchors generated while the HTML destinations remain open
increment that name.  Anchor values increment while the ODS HTML destinations
remain open unless you use ANCHOR= to assign a new value.  Anchor values continue
to increment when you open new body files, start new procedures, or produce
different types of output.
<P>Controlling the anchor name is useful when you create
a graph with drill-down capability. In this case, you must create a variable
that contains the names of the anchors that are the targets for the different
areas of the graph that the user may click on.
<P>For a complete description, see the <A href="#z0725554">ANCHOR=
option</A>.
<BR><H3><A name="z1032761">How ODS Constructs Links and References</A></H3>


<P>Several options in the ODS
HTML statement affect how ODS constructs the links and references that point
from the frame to the table of contents, table of pages, and body file and
from the table of contents or table of pages to the body file. Links are made
as HREF= attributes on A (anchor) tags inside the HTML files. Each HREF= attribute
points to the NAME= attribute on another A (anchor) tag. HREF= must identify
both the file that contains the target and the name of the anchor within that
file. The value of HREF= must be a valid target in a valid URL. It uses the
following form:
<P>
<TABLE cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2">
<TR valign="top"><TD>
&lt;A HREF="<I>URL</I>#<I>anchor-name</I>">
</TD></TR></TABLE>ODS constructs the value of an HREF= attribute based on information
that you provide in the ODS HTML statement. 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML references to
files use other tags, but the logic for creating the string that identifies
the file is the same as the logic for creating an HREF= attribute.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<P>The <I>URL</I> in an HREF= attribute is composed
of information from three options in the ODS HTML statement: the BASE= option,
the GPATH= or the PATH= option, and the BODY=, the CONTENTS=, or the PAGE=
option. 
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>If you specify BASE=, the value of that option is the first part
of the URL for every HREF= attribute that ODS writes.<P>

<LI>If you specify GPATH= or PATH=, the next part of the URL in an
HREF= attribute comes from that option. 
<P>If the file that you are linking to is a graphic, ODS uses information
from the GPATH= option as the next part of HREF=. If the file that you are
linking to is not a graphic, or if GPATH= is not specified, ODS uses information
from the PATH= option as the next part of HREF=. (For information on these
