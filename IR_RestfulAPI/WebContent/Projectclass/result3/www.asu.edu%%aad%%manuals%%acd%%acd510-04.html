Monitoring the level of this activity is the primary responsibility of the deans.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Supplemental Pay</B></FONT><P>Full-time members of the university faculty are often expected to teach off-campus as part of their regular load.  Ordinarily, they may teach not more than one overload course per semester, or a limited amount of correspondence study, in addition to their primary employment responsibilities.  Resident credit teaching off-campus and correspondence study usually may not be carried on simultaneously with remunerative employment on sponsored projects or faculty grants.<P>Pay for supplemental teaching and other programs and activities is governed by approved rate schedules on file in the offices of the deans.  For faculty members teaching noncredit courses, hourly rates for supplemental pay are in accordance with a flexible rate schedule.  Depending on market forces, negotiations, etc., the hourly rate for supplemental pay can be between 1.0 and 2.0 times the hourly rate of pay computed from the faculty member&#146;s base salary.  Further, faculty teaching noncredit courses receive three hours of supplemental pay for each platform hour.  Thus, for example, if a faculty member with a base rate of salary of &#036;20.00 per hour made a one-hour presentation in a noncredit program, supplemental pay received by the faculty member could range from a low of &#036;60.00, i.e., &#036;20.00 x 3 (hours) x 1 (pay function), to a high of &#036;120.00, i.e., &#036;20.00 x 3 (hours) x 2 (pay function).  The dean would be responsible for deciding on a specific rate within this range.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Deans, Chairs, and Other Administrators</B></FONT><P>Faculty members who are employed as deans, as unit chairs, or in other administrative positions do not receive extra compensation for teaching or lecturing (except for certain continuing education programs), or from the proceeds of grants or contracts involving payment for services rendered by the university to outside agencies or organizations.<P>&#160;<P><HR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">ACD</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="acd001.html">contact</A> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="provost.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
