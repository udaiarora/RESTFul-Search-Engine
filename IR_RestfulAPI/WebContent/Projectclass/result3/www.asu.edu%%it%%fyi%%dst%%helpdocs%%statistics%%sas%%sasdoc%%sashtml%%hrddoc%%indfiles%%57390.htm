SAS Companion for UNIX Environments, Version 8
</H1><P>
This companion describes the features of the SAS language and interface    that are available only on UNIX or behave differently on UNIX than on
other platforms.  It briefly describes basic X window concepts, how they   relate to SAS, and how to use X resources to customize the SAS interface.
Also included are complete descriptions of all features of the SAS System  that have host-specific behavior, but this title does not attempt to teach
you how to use the software.  System administrators may also want to read  this title to understand how the SAS System works under UNIX.  This title
is intended for SAS software users who have had some experience with the   SAS System but not necessarily under UNIX.
