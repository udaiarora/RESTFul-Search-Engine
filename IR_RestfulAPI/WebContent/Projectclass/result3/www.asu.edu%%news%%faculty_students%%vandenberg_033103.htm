      <h2>ASU research scientist wins Priestley Medal for discoveries in plastics</h2>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/Vandenburg_033103.jpg" alt="Edwin J. Vandenberg" width="180" height="276" align="right">For more than 60 years Edwin J. Vandenberg has researched
        plastics in order to customize them to different applications and manufacture
        them more efficiently and cheaply. The American Chemical Society will
        recognize Vandenberg's distinguished career when it presents him with
        the organization's highest honor, the Priestley Medal, March 25.</p>
      <p>Vandenberg now works as a research scientist in the Harrington Department
        of Bioengineering at Arizona State University. But he began his career
        at Hercules, Inc., where he made his best-known discovery.</p>
      <p>Today the plastic polypropylene is found in products from dishwasher-safe
        plastic food containers to indoor/outdoor carpeting. In the early 1950s,
        however, polypropylene was a soft, rubbery substance inappropriate for
        most applications. While working at Hercules, Vandenberg independently
        discovered a rigid, durable form of the plastic.</p>
      <p>Polypropylene is composed of repeating units of propylene, which contains
        three carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. When propylene molecules react
        with each other to form polypropylene, two of each unit's carbon atoms
        are used in the backbone of the chain. The other carbon can hang off
        the top or bottom of the molecule. </p>
      <p>If the carbon atoms are randomly up and down, the polypropylene is soft.
        Vandenberg developed a reaction method that forced all these carbon atoms
        to be on one side of the plastic. His discovery allowed Hercules to be
        the first, and then the largest, producer of polypropylene. Guilio Natta,
        a Nobel Laureate in chemistry, discovered the rigid form of polypropylene
        independently about the same time.</p>
      <p>"It's not a trivial thing. You really need the right catalyst," Vandenberg
        said.</p>
      <p>When Vandenberg retired from Hercules in 1982, he began a second career
        at Arizona State University, first as a visiting professor and then a
        research professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. He
        now works as a research scientist in the Harrington Department of Bioengineering. </p>
      <p>"I like working in the lab," Vandenberg said. "I want to continue the
        work I did in the chemistry department."</p>
      <p>Since the late 1980s Vandenberg has collaborated with Vincent Pizziconi,
        professor of bioengineering, on plastics for biomedical applications.
        Much like his pioneering work with polypropylene, Vandenberg has developed
        a method to manipulate the creation of a biomedical material he invented
        so that small changes in the plastic's chemical structure adapt it to
        different applications or tissues in the body. Thus, based on the medical
        device for which the plastic will be used, Vandenberg can engineer the
        material's properties.</p>
      <p>The new material also appears to be more biocompatible than other biomaterials
        now in use. The body's immune system will attack a medical implant, which
        can interfere with the device's function and necessitate more frequent
        replacement. Creating materials that provoke less of an immune response,
        or, better yet, no response, is a primary aim in the development of next
        generation implants.</p>
      <p>"We need to train more young people to follow in the steps of this Arizona
        pioneer to come up with new polymer systems," Pizziconi said. "There's
        still a lot of work to be done to make truly useful biomaterials that
        can be used to design next generation medical devices to meet the clinical
        needs of the 21st century."</p>
      <p>Vandenberg will receive the Priestley Medal March 25 during the American
        Chemical Society National Meeting in New Orleans. Previous recipients
        include co-discoverer of DNA Francis Crick, astronomer Carl Sagan, and
        evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould.</p>
