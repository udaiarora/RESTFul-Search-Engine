          <h2>ASU to honor baseball legend Jim Brock </h2>
          <p>ASU will honor the legacy of legendary and Hall of Fame head baseball coach Jim Brock by renaming the university&rsquo;s baseball facility in January 2006. </p>
          <p><img src="campus_images/jimbrock_031105.jpg" width="180" height="271" align="right">The baseball facility, currently Bobby Winkles Field at Packard Stadium will be known as Winkles Field-Packard Stadium at Brock Ballpark. A special ceremony to dedicate the facility is scheduled for the 2006 Alumni Weekend in January.</p>
          <p>The addition of Brock&rsquo;s name to the facility pays tribute to one of the best coaches in college baseball history. Brock led the Sun Devils to a pair of national championships in 1977 and 1981 and recorded a 1,100-440 record during his 23 years at the helm of the Sun Devils.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;The new name encompasses the three foundations of our program and we are very honored to pay tribute to a man that meant so much to Sun Devil Baseball,&rdquo; says head baseball coach Pat Murphy. &ldquo;Jim Brock helped perpetuate the tradition of excellence created by Bobby Winkles and deserves to have his name prominently associated with every aspect of our program.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>The honoring of Brock comes in conjunction with a fund-raising campaign and plans for the final phase of renovations to the baseball complex.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;We have been fortunate over the past few years to have added the best player facilities in the country,&rdquo; Murphy says. &ldquo;Now we are shifting our focus to the fan experience and have plans to make much needed improvements to the seating and press facility. We plan to add tribute areas throughout the ballpark to recognize the special components that make Arizona State baseball one of the greatest traditions in the country.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Brock battled cancer throughout the 1994 season and passed away just days after the College World Series that year. Brock coached a handful of Sun Devil legends, including first-round draft picks Eddie Bane, Floyd Bannister, Bob Horner, Hubie Brooks, Oddibe McDowell, Barry Bonds and Mike Kelly. All three of ASU&rsquo;s Golden Spikes Award winners (Horner, McDowell, Kelly) played under Brock.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;This is such an honor for our family and to Jim and we are so thankful to be part of this wonderful event,&rdquo; says Patsey Brock. &ldquo;Jim bled maroon and gold, and there are so many memories at this stadium. It is a wonderful way to honor his great coaching record and the way he felt about Arizona State University.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>He was inducted into the ABCA College Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998, and was the 1977 and 1981 NCAA coach of the year. Additionally, Brock was a five-time winner of the Pac-10 coach of the year award (1981, 1982, 1984, 1988, 1993). Brock earned three degrees from ASU, including a bachelor, master&rsquo;s and doctorate degrees.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I am very thankful to the Packard Family for allowing our family to share the name on the facility,&rdquo; says Patsey Brock. &ldquo;I also owe a lot to Pat Murphy for making all of this happen. We&rsquo;ve had lunch several times over the years and he assured me that this was going to happen and he worked very hard to bring it to fruition.&rdquo;</p>
