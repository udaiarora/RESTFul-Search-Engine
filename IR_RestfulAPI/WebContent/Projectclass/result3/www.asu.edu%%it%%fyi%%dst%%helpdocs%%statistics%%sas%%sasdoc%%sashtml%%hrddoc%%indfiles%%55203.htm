If you've ever stuffed "cheat sheets" into your reference documentation    to guide you through specific tasks that the book never describes in
detail, you'll appreciate the approach of this how-to book.                Self-contained chapters lead you through tasks that SAS/GRAPH software
users typically need to perform. The book features many graphic examples   and programs and helps you interpret the steps your SAS code follows to
produce results. Readers with basic SAS/GRAPH software experience who      are looking for tips on particular tasks or computing problems will
easily find just the sections they need. The book is also an ideal         resource for students who need an example-packed supplement to their
computing textbooks.
