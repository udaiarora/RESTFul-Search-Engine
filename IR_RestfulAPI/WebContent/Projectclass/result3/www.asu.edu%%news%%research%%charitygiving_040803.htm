      <h2>Study highlights strong charitable giving in state</h2>
      <p>        Arizona residents show strong support for charities, particularly in
          volunteering their time, according to a new study by ASU's Center for
        Nonprofit Leadership and Management.</p>
      <p>The representative sample study
            surveyed 1,000 households in the state during the summer of 2002
        and identified the methods and motivations
          of residents in their giving and volunteering with Arizona's 11,504
        charitable institutions. The ASU Center for Nonprofit Leadership Management,
        established
          at ASU in 1999, provides both research and resources while training
        students for careers in the nonprofit sector.</p>
      <p>The study found that almost nine
          out of every 10 Arizona households (87.3 percent) made some form of
        charitable contribution in the past year.
          The figure is on pace with the national average of 89 percent. </p>
      <p>When it
          came to giving time, Arizonans went well beyond the national average.
          The study shows that 55 percent of those surveyed volunteered
          at some point during the year. Nationally, the rate for volunteering
          sits at 44 percent. Volunteers in the state contributed an average
        of 194 hours, or 3.74 hours per week.</p>
      <p>"This is really the first study of
          its kind," says Robert Ashcraft, director of the center. "For the nonprofit
          agencies, this information will go
          a long way to show where their support is coming from. For companies
          and cities that help support these groups it shows that the community
          does find value in supporting charities. For those who give, it shows
          that many of their neighbors are also interested in helping those around
          them."</p>
      <p>The report also states that:<br>
        . Arizona residents gave to a wide range of charities, with 62.6 percent
        giving to religious organizations. Other frequent areas of giving were
        youth development and human services.<br>
        . The average total annual contribution was $1,572, or 3 percent of annual
        household income, very similar to the national averages.<br>
        . Nearly half of the respondents, 48 percents, said their level of volunteering
        had increased in the past three years, while 27 percent had reduced it,
        and 25 percent remained at the same level.<br>
        . Arizona residents rate the state's charitable organizations favorably,
        with a high level of trust and confidence. Of the respondents, 70 percent
        said charities were honest and trustworthy, while 85 percent said the
        groups &quot;generally play a major role in making our communities better
        places to live.&quot;</p>
      <p>The study also looked at the impact of Sept. 11, 2001, on charitable
        giving. On a whole, almost six out of every 10 Arizonans gave to a charity
        directly related to the tragedy. Of those who gave, 89 percent said they
        still planned to give as much or more to their regular charities in the
        coming year.</p>
      <p>&quot;
        Following September 11, Arizona nonprofits made a concerted effort to
        let people know there were still important needs here locally,&quot; says
        Stephanie Hiatt, research associate and editor of the study. &quot;That
        message appears to have gotten through.&quot; <br>
