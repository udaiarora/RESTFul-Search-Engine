          <h2>ASU nursing students attend to community&rsquo;s needs</h2>
          <p>Driving past the intersection of Hayden Road and Roosevelt Street in Scottsdale, it&rsquo;s easy to miss the unassuming Community Health Services Clinic nestled between a beauty salon and a Women, Infants and Children welfare office. But within those walls, ASU nursing undergraduate and graduate students work alongside nurses, nurse practitioners and faculty to provide quality, affordable health care to Valley residents.</p>
          <p align="left"><img src="comm_images/CHSclinic.jpg" width="288" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">The clinic is unique because it is managed and operated exclusively by nurses and nurse practitioners.</p>
          <p align="left">When it opened in 1977, it became the first federally funded nurse-managed clinic in the United States. The clinic was intended to serve the community and be a site for ASU College of Nursing students to receive practical education and experience. Since then, the program has grown to fill a much-needed niche in the community.</p>
          <p align="left"> According to the clinic&rsquo;s manager, Chris Lyons, the clinic has about 500 visitors per month. Efforts are made to keep the fees reasonable, because many of the clients are uninsured or underinsured. In addition, the ASU College of Nursing provides financial assistance to offset some of the clinic&rsquo;s operating expenses. </p>
          <p align="left">The result is a practical educational experience for students &ndash; and affordable health care services for the public. </p>
          <p align="left">Last year, the clinic had 34 undergraduate and 32 graduate students working in various capacities. Staff workers perform adult physical examinations, child and women&rsquo;s health services, treatment of minor illnesses, psychiatric counseling and other preventive health services, such as immunizations and skin cancer screenings. In addition to on-site services, staff members also travel to business, schools and agencies throughout the Valley offering immunizations, health screenings and health education.</p>
          <p align="left">&ldquo;We try to identify what services the community needs and wants,&rdquo; Lyons says. &ldquo;For instance, small businesses don&rsquo;t have the budget for health care that larger companies do, so they are looking for options.&rdquo;</p>
          <p align="left">Lyons, who has been with the clinic for 15 years, says a nurse-managed clinic gives the community access to the nursing model of health care delivery. This model, which emphasizes preventive care, health promotion, health maintenance and health restoration, offers different opportunities than more traditional forms of health care.</p>
          <p align="left">An example Lyons likes to cite is the case of an elderly female patient with several ailments, including hypertension and diabetes.</p>
          <p align="left">Five weeks before coming to the clinic, the woman suffered a lacerated foot that became infected. At an emergency department, her laceration was sutured and she was prescribed antibiotics. The wound persisted, however, and after two more visits the emergency department staff reportedly told her they could do no more to help.</p>
          <p align="left">But the pain continued until finally her family took her to the Community Health Services clinic, where nurses cultured the wound and used a different antibiotic to treat the serious infection. They also explained the importance of managing her diabetes and hypertension and recommended treatments for those conditions. </p>
          <p align="left">Without the clinic, the woman&rsquo;s infection might have turned deadly, and a return to the emergency room &ndash; along with costs of diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation &ndash; would have cost $20,000 to $100,000. By using the clinic, the woman was able to inexpensively prevent a potentially life-threatening condition.</p>
          <p align="left">The Governors, a philanthropic organization that seeks to expand and improve local health care services, recently selected the Community Health Services Clinic as the recipient of a $45,000 donation. This donation will help the clinic fund its Client Assistance Program, which financially assists clients who can neither pay the clinic&rsquo;s fees nor meet requirements for state assistance.</p>
          <p align="left">&ldquo;This donation will provide much-needed funding for the clinic staff to care for individuals and families who have limited resources and who may otherwise not seek care in a timely manner,&rdquo; Lyons says. &ldquo;The impact is enormous for them, their families and their communities.&rdquo;</p>
          <p align="left"> Lyons believes that nurse-managed health care facilities have the potential to greatly enhance the quality of health service locally and beyond.</p>
          <p align="left">&ldquo;There is a critical need in this country for the kind of quality, affordable and accessible health care provided by nurse-managed centers,&rdquo; Lyons says. &ldquo;Nationally, there is a growing interest in nurse-managed centers, because preliminary data show that we make a difference in the health of the community. This successful model could be replicated in other parts of the Valley.&rdquo;</p>
