<H2>Prior Daily Weights and Trading-Day Regression  </H2>
<P>Suppose that a detailed examination of retail sales at
ZXY Company indicates that certain days of the week have
higher sales. In particular, Thursday, Friday and
Saturday have approximately double the number of sales as
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and no sales occur on
Sunday. This means that months with five Saturdays
would have higher sales than months with only four Saturdays.
<P>This phenomenon is called a calendar effect; it can be
handled in PROC X11 by using the PDWEIGHTS (Prior Daily
WEIGHTS) statement or the TDREGR=option (Trading-Day
REGRession). The PDWEIGHTS statement and the TDREGR=option
can be used separately or together.
<P>If the relative weights are known (as in the preceding) it is
appropriate to use the PDWEIGHTS statement. If further
residual calendar variation is present TDREGR=ADJUST
should also be used. If you know that a calendar effect
is present, but know nothing about the relative weights,
use TDREGR=ADJUST without a PDWEIGHTS statement.
<P>In this example, it is assumed that the calendar
variation is due to both prior daily weights and
residual variation. Thus both a PDWEIGHTS statement
and TDREGR= ADJUST are specified.
<P>Note that only the relative weights are needed; in the actual
computations, PROC X11 normalizes the weights to sum
to 7.0. If a day of the week is not present in the
PDWEIGHTS statement, it is given a value of zero. Thus
&#34;sun=0&#34; is not needed.
<P><PRE>

<P>Tables of interest include A1, A4, B15, B16, C14, C15, C18, and D11.
Table A4 contains the adjustment factors derived from the prior
daily weights, table C14 contains the extreme irregular values
excluded from trading-day regression,
table C15 contains the trading day-regression results,
table C16 contains the monthly factors derived from the trading-day
regression, table C18 contains the final trading-day
factors derived from the combined daily weights. Finally,
table D11 contains the final seasonally adjusted series.
