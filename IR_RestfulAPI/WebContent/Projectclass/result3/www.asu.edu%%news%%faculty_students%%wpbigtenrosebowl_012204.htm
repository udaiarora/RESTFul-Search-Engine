      <h2 align="left"><strong>W. P. Carey MBA team is "Rose Bowl" champion </strong><strong>in first-ever Pac-10/Big Ten business competition </strong></h2>
      <p>The W. P. Carey MBA student team from Arizona State University aced the first ever Pac-10/Big Ten MBA Case Competition Saturday evening, finishing first among six teams from major business schools after 36 hours of preparation and presentations. </p>
      <p>The competition - the first ever to pit Pac-10 business schools against schools from the Big Ten - was organized and hosted by the W. P Carey School of Business with co-sponsorship from Honeywell and Dial Corp. and support from Cardinal Health. Students, faculty and administrators dubbed it the "Rose Bowl of case competitions. </p>
      <p>The University of Washington team won second place and the Marshall School at University of Southern California team finished third. These schools, together with first-place ASU, earned the right to compete in the "Rose Bowl" at the inaugural Pac-10 MBA Case Competition in October. </p>
      <p>The Big Ten was represented by the winners of the 2003 Ford Big Ten MBA Case Competition: the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University, the Krannert School of Management at Purdue and the School of Business at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. </p>
      <p>"The event was extremely successful," said Dennis Hoffman, associate dean for graduate programs at the W. P. Carey School. "Our visitors from the West and the Midwest came away very impressed with the quality of the competition, and energized to make the Pac-10/Big Ten event the marquee MBA case competition for the schools in the nation's two most respected athletic conferences." </p>
      <p>"W. P. Carey students proved that they can compete with the best of the best and win," Hoffman added. "It is a proud day for the W. P. Carey MBA, and all of Arizona should be proud of the accomplishments of these fine ASU students." </p>
      <p>Members of the W. P. Carey MBA team included Talli Brown, Matt Disbrow, Brian Martin and Chad Meyers. The team was coached by management Professors Amy Hillman and Gerry Keim. </p>
      <p>Individual awards were also presented. The "Best Presenter" award went to Joe Tapscott of the Marshall School of Business, Lisa Perronne of the University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Justin Puttock of the Purdue University - Krannert School of Business. "Best Q&amp;A" went to Ashli Siddall of the Marshall School of Business, and to the W. P. Carey and University of Washington teams. "Most Innovative Solutions" went to the University of Washington and the W. P. Carey School of Business teams. </p>
      <p>Case competitions provide business students with a forum to exercise the knowledge and skills acquired in class by developing solutions to hypothetical business problems within a set time period. The student teams received the details of an undisclosed business problem on Friday morning, Jan.16. Students, using the technology and other tools in the Ford Graduate Management Suite at the W. P. Carey School, worked for the next 24 hours to develop a solution and prepare a presentation. The teams presented their ideas to panels of judges Saturday morning. Finalists chosen by the judges presented a second time Saturday afternoon. The winning team was announced at a dinner Saturday evening. </p>
      <p>Judges included: </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; Bob Stauth, retired chairman and chief executive officer, Fleming Companies , Inc . </p>
