Addressing Problems with Saving Files on AFS
</center></h2>
  
<p>This document provides information on possible reasons for having
difficulty saving files to your AFS file space.  It shows how you 
can investigate the problem by logging on to any of the ASU UNIX 
clusters such as general.asu.edu and research.asu.edu.  Furthermore, 
it also provides you with available options for addressing this 
space problem.</p>
 
<p>1. There is inadequate amount of space in your personal AFS space.  
To confirm this, enter the command "fs listquota" and a message 
similar to the following will be displayed:
 
<pre>
     Volume Name      Quota    Used    % Used   Partition
     user.agjjc       50000   49000       98%         75%
</pre>
<p>
The percentage under the "% Used" column provides information on 
how much of your space has been used.  In this example, the user 
"agjjc" has used 98% (49 MB) of his 50 MB space.</p>
 
<p>If the numbers displayed under "% Used" for your account is very
high, then the amount of space available to you for saving files 
may be inadequate.</p>
 
<p>The options available to you for addressing this problem include 
going through your files and discarding the ones you do not need or
transferring many of the current files to an external storage media
such as floppy diskettes.</p>

<p>You may use the "ls -l" command to list the files in any of your 
directories.  If you are discarding a file, you can use the 
"rm -i filename" command.  For more information on the "rm" and 
"ls" commands, please refer to the online help information on unix 
commands from the main menu.  For transferring files, you may use 
Kermit, FTP, etc.  Kermit-related transfer information is available
also from the online help system under "Communications & File 
Conversion".  For assistance with transferring files, users may
may send an email to "comm-q@asu.edu" or call the Help Desk at
965-6500.
</p>
 
<p>2. There is inadequate amount of space in the disk partition where 
your personal AFS space resides.  To confirm this, again refer to 
the information diplayed by the "fs listquota" command.

<pre>
     Volume Name      Quota    Used    % Used   Partition
     user.agjjc       50000   37500       75%         95%
</pre>

The percentage under the "Partition" column provides information on
how much of the space on the partition is used.  The disk partition 
is a 2 GB storage location for several users and in this example, 95% 
of the 2 GB space is used.</p>
 
<p>If the percentage displayed under "Partition" is close to the mid-90's
then it is safe to assume that the disk partition where your personal
AFS space resides on is full.</p>
 
<p>The option available to you for addressing this problem is to promptly
report it to the Help Desk by calling 965-6500.  Provide your ASURITE 
id to the help desk staff and they in turn report this to the systems 
staff.  The system staff with the information on your ASURITE id 
locates the partition that is full and takes the necessary steps to 
address the problem.</p>
 
<p>3. If the problem is not related to either items #1 or #2 then it may 
be related to the hard disk that the disk partition resides on or some
other system-related problem.  In either case, follow the suggestion
mentioned in item #2 for reporting it to the Help Desk.</p>
