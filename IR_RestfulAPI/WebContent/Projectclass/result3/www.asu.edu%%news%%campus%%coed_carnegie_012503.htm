      <p>January 25, 2003</p>
      <h2>ASU College of Education among 32 departments selected as partners in 
        Carnegie Initiative on the Doctorate</h2>
      <p>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has selected 
        Arizona State University's College of Education as one of 32 Partner Departments 
        that will guide its Initiative on the Doctorate (CID), a multi-year research 
        and action project aimed at improving doctoral education at American universities, 
        specifically in the areas of chemistry, education, English and mathematics.</p>
      <p>Through the initiative, partner departments selected from universities 
        across the country will analyze all aspects of their doctoral programs 
        and link specific activities to desired outcomes. Departments will begin 
        this analysis by clarifying their goals for doctoral education in their 
        respective disciplines, and then creating "design experiments" in doctoral 
        education to better meet their identified goals.</p>
      <p>"Being one of only nine partner departments of education selected to 
        participate in the Carnegie Initiative on the Doctorate is a great honor. 
        It speaks well of both ASU and the Division of Curriculum and Instruction," 
        said Dale Baker, ASU professor of Curriculum and Instruction, and CID 
        project leader. "The faculty in Science and Mathematics Education as well 
        as Language and Literacy have proposed new and interesting ways to approach 
        doctoral education that will both increase the visibility of our programs 
        and produce superior graduates who will become the next generation of 
        academic leaders," she said. </p>
      <p>Carnegie Senior Scholar Chris Golde said the primary goals of the project 
        are to support and study experiments in doctoral education with leading 
        graduate programs, to document and analyze the character of those initiatives, 
        and --- by working with these innovative departments --- help the disciplinary 
        community create models and evidence of success to inform others in the 
        field. </p>
      <p>"We're working with departments that are committed to being stewards 
        of the discipline," Golde said. "We don't just mean a preservation of 
        the heart and essence of the field, although that's important, but we 
        chose those departments who have a critical eye toward the future, who 
        are willing to take risks and move the discipline forward."</p>
      <p>Carnegie President Lee S. Shulman said the doctoral degree is essential 
        to the continued improvement of all of American education, from the elementary 
        school to the graduate school. "If educators hope to change the character 
        of undergraduate education, the Ph.D. is critical; doctoral programs prepare 
        and socialize the next generation of undergraduate teachers," Shulman 
        said. "If we wish to influence the course of elementary and secondary 
        schools, the Ph.D. is critical, for those who hold the doctorate also 
        educate those who teach our nation's schoolchildren."</p>

      <p>"The national recognition that comes with this award and the opportunity 
        to work in partnership with a host of distinguished programs and colleagues 
        will be a special asset to the College of Education as we move forward 
        in strengthening our doctoral programs," said ASU Education Dean Eugene 
        E. Garcia. "Our faculty and the doctoral program are receiving the national 
        recognition they deserve at a time that will allow the program to develop 
        in significant new ways. Our participation in the Carnegie Initiative 
        on the Doctorate reinforces our equal commitment to high quality research 
        and its implications for education," Garcia added. </p>
      <p>The CID has also selected 22 Allied Departments who will help form a 
        network in each discipline to provide further information collection and 
        dissemination about the study. Further information about the study and 
        all of the participants may be found on the Carnegie website at www.carnegiefoundation.org. 
        Funding for the project is provided by the Atlantic Philanthropies and 
        The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.</p>
