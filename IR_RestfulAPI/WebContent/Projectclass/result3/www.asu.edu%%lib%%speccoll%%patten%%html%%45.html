<i><font size=+1>Le Jardinier Solitaire = The Solitary or Carthusian Gard'ner:
Being Dialogues Between a Gentleman and a Gard'ner.</font></i>
<p>Also contains <i>The Compleat Florist, or, The Universal Culture of

work is a translation of <i>le Jardinier Fleuriste</i>. Spine label: <i>The
Carthusian Gardener</i>. "This is the first edition of a different English

Cleveland coll. 321. <i>Le Jardinier Solitaire</i> translated from the
second, 1706, edition. Printer's pagination imperfect: p. [141] misnumbered
129, succeeding pages also misnumbered. However, Table of Contents reflects
the "misnumbering." References: Johnston, S. H. Cleveland coll. 321. Includes
index.
<p>Two popular French garden books translated into English by a rival English
publisher. Francis Gentil was a Carthusian lay brother who had been the
gardener to the Charter House at Paris for over thirty years. He writes
his work as a dialogue between a Gentleman and a Gardener. The Gentleman
wishes to retire to the country and needs to learn "whatever 'tis necessary
for me to know in Order to make a Kitchen-Garden, and to Cultivate Fruit-Trees."
This dialogue technique allows the author to explain his subject matter
with great ease, and it effectively draws the reader into the work. In
the second work in this volume, which is actually much lengthier and more
detailed than the Gentil's, Sieur Liger d'Auxerre sets out to give a complete
discussion of all aspects of gardening, and not just the information needed
to put "a plant in the ground." He covers such topics as the proper use
of tools, when each flower should be planted, how to arrange borders, what
to do with animals which are harmful to plants, how to culture trees and
small shrubs, what embellishments are suitable, and how to make all sorts
of knots to render gardens agreeable to the sight. This entire volume is
arranged with first Gentil's Preface, followed by d'Auxerre's Preface,
which in turn is followed by the two separate table of contents. At the
end of the entire volume there is an index which includes both works together.
Both works have printed marginal notes to assist the reader in finding
information.
