<P>
An employee&#146;s job performance may be affected by emotional, social, physical, and/or behavioral health problems.  Conversely, an employee&#146;s emotional, social, physical, and/or behavioral health may be affected by work-related problems. The university offers help to employees with such problems through the Employee Assistance Office (EAO).  Services available from the EAO at no cost to the employee include:

<P>
<OL>
<LI>assessment and evaluation</LI>

<P>
<LI>information and referral</LI>

<P>
<LI>short-term counseling (one to five sessions)</LI>

<P>
<LI>consultation and education</LI>

<P>
<LI>crisis intervention

<P>
and </LI>

<P>
<LI>psychiatric consultation.</LI>

</OL>

<P>
If professional judgment suggests it in a particular case, the Employee Assistance (EA) professional may extend the number of counseling sessions.

<P>
To assist employees with resolving their problems, the EAO provides referral services to appropriate professional resources in the community.  The employee is responsible for costs incurred from an external provider or other resource. However, the EA professional and employee will discuss the employee&#146;s options to cover third party costs. The employee&#146;s health insurance coverage will be considered before any referral is provided.

<P>
Employees may seek services directly from the EAO.  <A HREF="spp002.html#supervisor">Supervisors</A> may encourage, but not require, employees to seek assistance. In cases where an employee has violated the university drug and alcohol policy, sanctions may require that the employee participate in a drug rehabilitation program.  If so, the employee may be required to seek assistance from the EAO to identify available drug rehabilitation programs and/or to obtain an EAO referral to a drug rehabilitation program.

<P>
Supervisors may seek advice and counsel from the EAO regarding employees with personal problems, work-related problems, and/or unit dysfunction.  If a supervisor directly makes a referral, he or she will be informed if and when the employee has attended the appointment.

<P>
The first appointment with the EA professional and the first appointment with the EA psychiatrist may be made during working hours without charging time to accrued sick or vacation leave.  All additional visits must be charged to accrued sick leave (if appropriate), vacation leave, or leave without pay.

<P>
Use of the EAO services shall not exempt the employee from university policies and procedures.  However, the supervisor, in consultation with the campus director of Human Resources or designee, may determine on an individual basis if special exceptions shall be made.

<P>
EA records will be maintained by the EAO  and kept separately from the employee&#146;s personnel records.

<P>
All information in EA records and all communication between EA professionals, mental health counselors, psychiatrists, psychologists, or interns and clients participating with the EAO are confidential.  No communication, information, or record involving a client (employee, spouse, or dependent) who is participating with the EAO shall be disclosed to anyone unless the client has provided a signed and dated written release to the EAO allowing release of the records or information requested.

<P>
EA records and information will not be disclosed or provided without signed consent from the client on file with the EAO.  If the EAO receives a court order or subpoena requiring disclosure, the ASU Office of General Counsel must review the order before compliance.
