<div id="horizontalboxdecoration"></div>
 <h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>General Overview</h2>  
		
<p>The Latin American Studies Certificate is intended to provide students with a multi-faceted exploration 
of the histories, cultures, and contemporary status of the people living in the Spanish and Portuguese 
speaking Americas.</p>
<p>This Certificate is designed for:
<ul>* ASU undergraduates in any major who wish to enhance their degree and employment possibilities by 
adding expertise in Latin America.</ul>
<ul>* ASU Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies undergraduates who seek a certificate program for their 
degree.</ul>
</p>
<p>The purpose of the Certificate Program is to encourage undergraduate students to develop a broad-based 
understanding of Latin America--through the study of its history, society and politics, language and 
literature, environment and culture--while pursuing other degrees at ASU. In order to gain this 
understanding, students take coursework in a variety of different disciplines and departments. The 
knowledge and understanding gained from this endeavor will benefit students both in their future academic 
work and in their employment in the public or private sector. Completion of the Certificate is noted 1) 
on the student's transcript, and 2) via a Certificate signed by the Director of the Center and the Dean 
of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. </p>

<div id="horizontalboxdecoration"></div>
<h2><a name="App" id="App"></a>Application Process</h2>
      <p> Anyone interested in earning the Certificate must make formal application 
        at the Center for Latin American Studies. This Certificate is available 
        to all ASU undergraduate students, regardless of major. Students may begin 
        taking courses before they formally register for the Certificate; however, 
        they should apply for admission as soon as possible. An application form 
        is available--please complete the top portion and bring it to the Center 
        for Latin American Studies in Room 4450 of the Lattie F. Coor Hall. </p>
<div id="horizontalboxdecoration"></div>
<h2><a name="Cert" id="Cert"></a>Certificate Requirements</h2>
<p>
<p>   Requirements for the Certificate Program are satisfied through formal language instruction and by 
completing upper division courses taught on Latin American topics.</p>
      <h2> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language Requirement:</h2>
<p><ul>* The minimum requirement in formal language instruction is SPA313 or POR313.</ul>
   <ul>* Native speakers, or those with in-field experience equivalent to SPA313/POR313, can have this 
   requirement waived. Equivalence will normally be assessed by a faculty member in the Department of 
   Languages and Literature.</ul>
   <ul>* While students are encouraged to enroll in language instruction courses (i.e., conversation 
   and composition) above the 313 level, they cannot apply such course work to the Latin American course 
   requirements.</ul></p>
      <h2> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latin American Content Course Requirements:</h2>
<ul>* Students will take 30 upper division semester hours (10 courses) from the list of Latin American 
Content courses filed with the Latin American Studies Center. Students are encouraged to select courses 
both from within their major, and from other disciplines.</ul>
<ul>* Language instruction courses dealing with Spanish and Portuguese conversation and composition 
cannot be used to satisfy these requirements.</ul>
<ul>* Courses used to satisfy these requirements must receive a minimum grade of 'C'. ASU Main and 
West Campus will supply courses for this certificate.</ul>
<p>At least six (6) of the ten (10) courses must be taken at ASU Main. </p>
</p>

<h2><a name="Community" id="Community"></a>Community Outreach</h2> 	
<p>The Center for Latin American Studies also seeks to enter into partnerships with community 
organizations and the Arizona business community with an interest in Latin America. Our state's economy is increasingly tied to international trade. 
Of this overall trade, Arizona businesses are trading more with Latin American countries than ever before.</p>

<p>Mexico has overtaken Japan to become Arizona's primary trading partner. Arizona exports to Brazil 
have made a dramatic 700% increase in the last few years- growing from $17 million in 1993 to about 
$125 million through 1997. The copper mining industry in our state is similar to Chile's primary economic 
activity. High technology industries in Arizona are finding more and more markets throughout Latin America.</p>

<p>There is also heightened interest in the sub regional trading blocs such as MERCOSUR in the Southern 
Cone, the Andean Pact countries comprised of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, the Central American 
Common Market and of course, the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>

<p>The hemispheric goal of creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas will increase economic contacts 
between Arizona and the rest of this hemisphere in the years ahead. The CLAS can serve as a focal point 
for identifying programs that provide opportunities for partnerships for our larger Arizona community 
in the areas of language acquisition, socio-cultural exchange, and economic development opportunities.

<div id="horizontalboxdecoration"></div>
<h2><a name="Special" id="Special"></a>Special Events</h2> 	
<p>Community events highlight the diverse peoples and cultures of Latin America. The Focus on Brazil 
Program (Enfase no Brasil), was a day-long activity to acquaint our community with the music, art, 
cuisine, and film of Brazil.</p>

<div id="horizontalboxdecoration"></div>
<h2><a name="Friends" id="Friends"></a>Friends of the Center</h2>
<p>The CLAS outreach efforts includes the Friends of the Center for Latin American Studies. This 
association comprised of community and business leaders who have an interest in the people and nations 
of Latin America. It was organized to help identify and plan activities for the community at large. 
The Friends hold numerous social, cultural and business events to further link Arizona State University 
and the non-campus community. Through their annual Festival Latino, the Friends raise funds for 
students' scholarships, faculty research and other programs of the Center.</p>
