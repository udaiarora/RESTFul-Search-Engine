<h2>
Williams, John, Dr.</h2>
<i><font size=+1>Dr. John Williams' Last Legacy, or The Useful Family Herbal.</font></i>
<p>[s.l.: s.n.], 1827 Probably US--NY or PA.
<p>This work is a small pamphlet of "cures."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author
begins with a preface stating that he "has a desire to leave something
for the good of his fellow creatures, and being sensible of soon retiring
from time, and seeing no other opportunity to benefit the rising generation,
hopes it will be kindly received--being a true and faithful statement of
each Medicine and Cure."&nbsp; The author states that all the information
in his pamphlet is based on his own personal knowledge and not heresay.&nbsp;
The cures are numbered and there is a table of contents listing them at
the end of the work.&nbsp; The work has an advertisement for it at the
very end which gives a biographical sketch of the author.&nbsp; He was
born in New York, and now resides in washington county.&nbsp; Most of his
life has been spent in the study of health and he has travelled extensively
in search of information.&nbsp; He even spent a period of time among the
Indians, "learning the Indian method of treating disorders, and the medical
virtues of the vegetable kingdom" as well as "much literary and scientific
knowledge."
