This work contains 137 never before published letters, 103 from Rossetti
to Leyland and 34 from Leyland to Rossetti. These letters &quot;document
a business relationship that extended over sixteen years and that involved
enough intricacy and confusion to satisy the most ambitious accountant&quot;
(ix). Rossetti depended heavily on his circle of wealthy patrons, and Leyland
spent more money on commissioning Rossetti's works than anyone else. No
one else &quot;maintained his relationship with the artist over so long
a time. Moreover, Leyland was the kind of buyer who made demands on Rossetti's
art, who helped determine the shape and direction of that art. And the
rather surprising friendship which grew up between thes men who were in
so many ways dissimilar is itself an important dimension of Rossetti's
life&quot; (xii). PRB-93</P>

Autobiography</I>. William Michael Rossetti, tr. London: Sands, 1901. &quot;This
edition consists of 1000 copies only.&quot; The Special Collection copy
is not numbered. Gabriele Rossetti, father of Dante Gabriel and Christina
Rossetti, has found popularity in Italy, but is little known in England,
according to William Michael Rossetti, translator. Rossetti goes on to
quote Dr. Garnett, in his History of Italian Literature who said that &quot;Rossetti
assuredly will not be forgotten by England, for which he has done what
no other inhabitant of these isles ever did, in begetting two great poets.&quot;
Rossetti continues by saying that &quot;on me it can be no less than a
filial obligation to do what I can for the memory of my patriotic, highly
gifted, laborious, and loving father. I therefore offer to the British
public the following authentic record of him, and leave it to obtain such
readers as it may.&quot; The contents of this work then include Gabriele
Rossetti's autobiography, including his life in Italy and his life in exile
in Malta and England. The appendix has six of his letters to his wife and
eight letters to Charles Lyell, Kinnordy. There are also three letters
to him from Seymour (Barone) Kirkup and eleven from Giuseppe Mazzini, as
well as six poems by Gabriele Rossetti. The work contains six illustrations
and concludes with an index of names. PRB-147</P>

Maria Francesca. A Shadow of Dante, Being an Essay Towards Studying Himself,
His World and His Pilgrimage. London: Rivingtons, 1871. Maria Francesca
Rossetti opens this work with introductory comments about Dante, &quot;a
name unlimited in place and period. Not Italy, but the Universe, is his
birthplace; not the fourteenth century, but all Time, is his epoch. He
rises before us and above us like the Pyramids?awful, massive, solitary;
the embodiment of the character , the realization of the science, of his
clime and day; yet the outcome of a far wider past, the standard of a far
wider future. Like the Pyramids, again, he is known to all by name and
by pictorial representation; must we not add, like them unknown to most
by actual sight and presence? Who among us has indeed experienced the soul-subduing
hush of his solemnity? Who beheld all average heights dwarfed by his sublimity?&quot;
Thus, Rossetti sets the mood for her work on Dante. She continues with
chapters on Dante's universe, Dante's life experiences, the apparition
of Virgil, Hell, Dante's pilgrimage through hell, purgatory, Dante's pilgrimage
through purgatory, Garden of Eden and the descent of Beatrice, paradise,
and Dante's pilgrimage through paradise. The work also contains five illustrations,
four of which are fold-out maps of the universe, hell, purgatory, and the
rose of the blessed. PRB-143</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Rossetti, William Michael. <I>Dante and his Convito:
A Study with Translations</I>. London: Mathews, 1910. Rossetti notes in
his introduction to his translation that Dante wrote Il Convito (The Banquet
or Meal) sometime after writing Vita Nuova. Il Convito is written mainly
&quot;in prose, four treatises; but it embodies three of Dante's canzoni,
and the aim of the treatises is to explain the true meaning of the canzoni.&quot;
Rossetti continues by explaining that this work is of particular interest,
even if it is incomplete, because in it Dante &quot;certifies us as to
what he meant by certain poems which wear the external aspect of love-poems.&quot;
This translation is a literal rendering for the sake of exactness. Rossetti
notes that &quot;a reasonably poetical version would necessarily be less
exact, and therefore less s</FONT>erviceable for my present purpose.&quot;

inclination therefore is not to put myself forward, now or hereafter, as

Ruskin notes in his Appendix that he has given this series of lectures
in direct response to a general exhibition of Rossetti's works. Ruskin
seeks to provide &quot;some permanently rational balance between the rhapsodies
of praise and blame which idly occupied the sheets of various magazines.&quot;
In examining the art of England, Ruskin wishes to find a balance &quot;chiefly
in the form of qulified, though not faint, praise, which is the real function
of just criticism&quot; (245). Ruskin also seeks to discover &quot;why
British painters, great or small, are never right altogether? Why their
work is always, somehow, flawed,--never in any case, or even in any sigle
picture, thorough?&quot; (246-7). PRB-41</P>

<P>---. <I>The Elements of Perspective</I>. Arranged for the use of schools
and intended to be read in connexion with the first three books of Euclid.
London: Smith, Elder, 1859. Bookplate of Francis Frederick Fox. Ruskin's
aim in this work is to provide what he feels is a much-needed &quot;written
code of Perspective Law.&quot; The laws he draws up are in mathematical
form and are such that &quot;any school-boy may read through [them] in
a few days, after he has mastered the first three and the sixth books of
Euclid.&quot; After a brief introductory chapter, Ruskin proceeds to provide
the rules for the following topics: fixing the position of a given point,
drawing a right line between two given points, finding the vanishing-point
of a given horizontal line, finding the dividing-points of a given horizontal
line, using sight-magnitude and dividing points to draw a horizontal line
in a given position and magnitude, drawing any triangle, drawing any rectilinear
quadrilateral figure, drawing a square, drawing a square pillar, drawing
a pyramid, drawing any curve, dividing a circle into any number of equal
parts, drawing a square within a larger square, drawing a truncated circular
cone, drawing and inclined line, finding the vanishing point of a given
inclined line, finding the dividing points of a given inclined line, finding
the sight-line of an inclined plane, finding the vanishing-point of steepest
lines in an inclined plane, and finding the vanishing-point of lines perpendicular
to the surface of a given inclined plane. The work concludes with two appendices:
one on the practice and observations on the preceding problems and the
other containing demonstrations which could not be included in the text.
Most of the pages in this work remain uncut. PRB-140</P>

<P>---. <I>The Ethics of the Dust: Ten Lectures to Little Housewives on
the Elements of Crystallisation</I>. London: Smith, Elder, 1866. First
edition, bound in tan calf with gold tooled compartments on spine. Contents:
The Valley of the Diamonds, The Pyramid Builders, The Crystal Life, The
Crystal Orders, Crystal Virtues, Crystal Quarrels, Home Virtues, Crystal
Caprice, Crystal Sorrows, The Crystal Rest. Ruskin states in his &quot;Preface&quot;
that the lectures in this volume &quot;were really given, in substance,
at a girls' school (far in the country); which, in the course of various
experiments on the possibility of introducing some better practice of drawing
into the modern scheme of female education, I visited frequently enough
to enable the children to regard me as a friend.&quot; Ruskin does not
intend that this volume should serve as an introduction to mineralogy,
but merely &quot;to awaken in the minds of young girls, who were ready
to work earnestly and systematically, a vital interest in the subject of
their study.&quot; These lectures are written in the format of dialogues
between an &quot;old lecturer&quot; and a number of young girls. The work
concludes with a section of notes. PRB-4</P>
