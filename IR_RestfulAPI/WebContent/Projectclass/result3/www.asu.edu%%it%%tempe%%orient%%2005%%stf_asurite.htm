        User<acronym title="identifier" class="nosmall">ID</acronym></h2>

    <p>Every person at 
    <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> is assigned an 
    <acronym title="Arizona State University Rational Information Technology Environment">ASURITE</acronym> 
    User<acronym title="identifier" class="nosmall">ID</acronym>.  
    This 
    User<acronym title="identifier" class="nosmall">ID</acronym> is unique, and 
    is yours to use as long as you are associated with the university and you follow 
    the 
    <a href="/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html" class="online">appropriate 
    policies and guidelines</a>.</p>

    <p>The 
    <acronym title="Arizona State University Rational Information Technology Environment">ASURITE</acronym>
    User<acronym title="identifier" class="nosmall">ID</acronym> 
    is used to access various services at 
    <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym>.  Your eligibility for 
    services will depend on your affiliation with 
    <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym>.  New applicants, for 
    example, may have access to certain Web pages to check the status of their 
    application or to register on-line once they have been admitted.  Enrolled 
    students, faculty, and staff will be able to add other computing services as 
    needed to their 
    User<acronym title="identifier" class="nosmall">ID</acronym>s.</p>

    <p>Because the 
    <acronym title="Arizona State University Rational Information Technology Environment">ASURITE</acronym>
    User<acronym title="identifier" class="nosmall">ID</acronym>
    is used for such a wide variety of access, including sensitive information, it is important to protect your password.  Do not share it with 
    others.   Change your password frequently.  Pick passwords that are difficult to 
    guess. Contact the
    <a href="http://www.asu.edu/helpdesk/" class="online">IT Help Desk</a> if you suspect your access has 
	been compromised.</p>
