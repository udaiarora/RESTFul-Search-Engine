<P>Until the configuration is properly specified,
it can be difficult to establish communications within an SNA network, especially
for a host subarea peripheral node. To simplify troubleshooting, SAS/CONNECT
uses a convention for error handling that passes information to you to help
you debug your configuration.  This information includes operation codes,
return codes, and sense data, which is framed within the context of the function
the software is trying to perform. SAS/CONNECT does not attempt to interpret
this information.  Use this information to work with network systems and SAS
support personnel at your site to resolve the problem.  



<PRE>ERROR: VTAM Communications Failure:
 ACB initialization error.  Verify pooling options 
(LUPOOL, LUPREFIX, LUFIRST, LULAST) or that the target ACD 
is not already in use. 
IEF170I SAS ABEND 0999.</PRE>
<P>This error occurs during a SIGNON to SAS on a remote OS/390 host if
the SRBEXIT parameter of the OS/390 LU APPL definition is set to YES.
<P>SRBEXIT=YES uses SRB-enablement.  This is a privileged and optimized
method by which VTAM can deliver asynchronous event notification to an application.
 To do this, the VTAM application must be running in supervisor state or authorized
through APF (Authorized Program Facility). This mode is generally reserved
for operating system services.  SAS is not an application of this class and
does not support SRBEXIT enablement. By setting SRBEXIT=NO or
deleting the parameter so that it defaults to NO, VTAM is informed that SAS
is a problem-state program with no special privilege authorization.  



<PRE>ERROR: VTAM Communications Failure:  
ACB initialization error when using the 
APPC access method and SAS/CONNECT software.</PRE>
<P>This error occurs if all of the available LUs are defined to APPC/MVS
using LUADD ACBNAME.  To avoid this problem, verify that all LUs are not defined
to APPC/MVS.  



<PRE>ERROR: VTAM Communications Failure:  
ACB initialization error.  Verify LU options.
ERROR: The target ACB is not already in use.</PRE>
<P>This error occurs in SAS/CONNECT sessions between two OS/390 hosts if
the LU_NAME parameter is defined in the local session instead of using LU
pools.  



<PRE>Communication partner has terminated
the conversation.</PRE>
<P>When signing on to a remote APPC/MVS system, you can avoid this error
by adding REMOTE=<B>ACBname</B> to the SAS configuration file on the
OS/390 host, where <B>ACBname</B> is the LU defined to the APPC/MVS
scheduler.  



<PRE>USER1701 ABEND</PRE>
<P>This error occurs under OS/390 when an ACB associated with a pool of
LUs fails to open.  Many events can cause this ABEND.  Follow these guidelines
to resolve the problem: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Verify that all required zaps and maintenance are applied.<P>

<LI>Check pool definitions: LUFIRST, LULAST, and LUPREFIX, and refer
to the installation and administration documentation for SAS software under
OS/390, Release 6.08 and later.<P>

<LI>Verify that the value for the REMOTE= option is the logical unit
that is defined to the APPC/OS/390 scheduler through APPCPM<B>xx</B>
in SYS1.PARMLIB.<P>

<LI>Verify that the REMOTE= logical unit that is defined to APPC/MVS
is defined to SAS through your OS/390 SAS configuration file.<P>

<LI>Query VTAM to verify that the logical units are active.  



<PRE>You cannot connect to remote host &lt;name> because ERROR:
APPC CNOS failure: RC = 00080000 SENSE = 087D0002</PRE>
<P>The remote host whose name was specified has not been defined as a VTAM
LU6.2 application.  



<PRE>APPC transaction program failure: RC = 00480000 SENSE = 080F6051</PRE>
<P>The remote host is running secured, and the user's APPCSEC= option does
not represent a valid userid and password combination for the remote host.<P>
</UL>

<P>If you cannot resolve a problem from the explanations given here or
by using the cited resources, call SAS Technical Support for assistance. 
You will probably be asked to generate traces that document the problem, so
be sure that you or your site support personnel are familiar with the tracing
services available through OS/2 Extended Services and VTAM.

<P>
<PRE>VTAM communication failure: ACB initialization error.</PRE>
<P>Verify that the pooling options (LUPOOL, LUPREFIX, LUFIRST, and LULAST)
or the target ACB is not already in use.
<P>The server whose name was specified was unable to initialize itself
as a VTAM LU6.2 application, or a server with that name is already active.

does not correctly represent the user pool as defined, or it is blank.
