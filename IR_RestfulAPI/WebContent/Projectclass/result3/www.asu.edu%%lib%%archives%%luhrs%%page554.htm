  <p>Letter 13
  </p><br>


<br><p align=right>
Phoenix, Arizona, July 6th, 1887
<p>
<br><p align=left>
My dear, good, beloved Gretchen,</p>
<br>
<p>I am writing you these lines with a sad heart, since I
have not received any letter from you this morning. I was so
sure there would be a letter waiting for me at the post office
from my beloved Gretchen. When I opened the mail box and saw
several letters inside, my heart was jumping with joy, but after
I went through the entire mail and found nothing from you, I was
very disappointed and sad. I cannot understand why there was
no letter, there was the Neuhaus newspaper mailed on June 19th,
5 days after you wrote me a letter that you would write once
more the same week. I went back 4 times but there was nothing
for me. My dearest Gretchen, since you left I cannot do my
work efficiently. I am only half efficient because my thoughts
are always with you. I do hope to get a letter from you tomorrow,
because I can feel it. I know you wrote one. You could not leave
poor Georg in such despair. Maybe it got lost somewhere. I
still did not get your letter from Plymouth, it probably got lost.</p>
<br>
<p>	Mr. Herrick sent some money to his wife today and she is
supposed to be back on August 1st. We had a terrible sandstorm
today. It was as bad as any you have ever seen. The air was so
filled with sand that it became dark in the middle of the day,
as if it were night. I was glad that you and the children were
not here then, you would have been frightened.</p>
<br>
<p>	I am closing for today and wishing you a good night.
To you my sweetest Gretchen, Arthur and Louise a warm kiss and
embrace. I am praying for you.
<br>
<br>
<p>
Thursday, July 7th - Another day without your letter. You don't
know how much I worry. I can't think of anything else but you.
I get so frustrated and sometimes angry with myself and I don't
know what to do. Please my beloved Gretchen, don't let me wait
so long for your letters. I am sure you don't like to be without
news from me either and this is why I write to you twice a week
because I know it cannot be too much. I will not stop writing you
regularly until you leave and even then I'll write to you in
New York at the Bush Hotel. Let me know in time when you leave,
so that it reaches you just when you get there. As soon as you
arrive in Hoboken, go to the Bush Hotel and ask for your mail.
You have to let me know at least 3 weeks before you leave when
you plan to be here so that I know when to stop writing. Please
write long letters, all about the children, what they are doing
and whether Arthur remembers his papa and does he want to come
back to see me soon? I miss him very much. How nice it would be
if he were near me, to play with me and talk to me, I would not
be so lonely. I feel as if I were all alone in this world. I
will never let you go away from me, because it hurts not to
