      <h2>Realistic Romance&reg; Awards are given to honor portrayals that model 
        any of the the 12 Prescriptions from Dr. Galician's Prescriptions&reg; 
        for Getting Real About Romance</h2>
      <p>Rx #1: CONSIDER COUNTLESS CANDIDATES.<br>
        Realistic Romance&reg; Awardee: CastAway<br>
        . . . because when Tom Hank's character returns home after being presumed 
        dead, his former fiance has married someone else and had a child. Hard 
        as it is for him to accept this, he does. And while doing his work - rather 
        than desperately seeking a romantic replacement - he meets someone who 
        might become an appropriate partner.</p>
      <p>Rx #2: CONSULT your CALENDAR and COUNT CAREFULLY.<br>
        Realistic Romance&reg; Awardee: While You Were Sleeping<br>
        . . . because a young woman who initially believes she's fallen in love 
        at first sight learns that a romance based on friendship and understanding 
        can be even more soaring and solid at the same time.</p>
      <p>Rx #3: COMMUNICATE COURAGEOUSLY.<br>
        Realistic Romance&reg; Awardee: "Romeo and Juliet (Or, When You Assume 
        You Make an ASS Out of U and ME)," Chapter 6 of the book Frankly Scarlett, 
        I Do Give a Damn! A Parody of Classic Romances Retold (Beverly West and 
        Nancy Peske)<br>
        . . . because thanks to courageous clear communication, the outcome of 
        this clever parody (whose title is self-explanatory) is much happier than 
        Shakespeare's tragic version.</p>
      <p>Rx #4: CONCENTRATE on COMMITMENT and CONSTANCY.<br>
        Realistic Romance&reg; Awardee: Newsweek's 12/9/02 cover story, "The New 
        Virginity - The Politics of Abstinence"<br>
        . . . because this issue calls attention to rarely publicized but healthier 
        approach of many smart teens, detailing their stories honestly and without 
        preaching.</p>
      <p>Rx #5: CHERISH COMPLETENESS in COMPANIONS (not just the COVER).<br>
        Realistic Romance&reg; Awardee: My Big Fat Greek Wedding<br>
        . . . because although the movie is filled with too many over-the-top 
        ethnic stereotypes, it's rare and refreshing to see a woman who doesn't 
        measure up to model and centerfold proportions find happiness with a thoughtful 
        and attractive man who values her for the complete person she has become.</p>
      <p>Rx #6: CREATE COEQUALITY; COOPERATE.<br>
        Realistic Romance&reg; Awardee: TV's Mad About You<br>
        . . . because on most criteria (age, income, etc.), these two were evenly 
        matched - a TV rarity.</p>
      <p>Rx #7: CEASE CORRECTING and CONTROLLING; you CAN'T CHANGE others (only 
        yourself!).<br>
        Realistic Romance&reg; Awardee: 28 Days<br>
        . . . because after finally seeing the light during alcohol rehab and 
        determining to stay sober, Sandra Bullock's character realizes she can't 
        change her boozy boyfriend, so she simply and without recrimination says, 
        "Goodbye." This wise heroine knows that Myth #7 only works in the movies. 
        (Bonus: The movie doesn't paint these lovers as black-and-white cartoon 
        characters, and she doesn't ride off into the sunset with the attractive 
        baseball player who's still in rehab.)</p>
      <p>Rx #8: COURTESY COUNTS; CONSTANT CONFLICTS CREATE CHAOS.<br>
        Realistic Romance&reg; Awardee: ABC-TV's Life with Bonnie<br>
        . . . because, like all gems, Bonnie Hunt's new sit com is a rarity: The 
        married couple don't constantly bicker and fight and demean each other. 
        Instead, each episode opens and closes with a few tidbits of warm, witty, 
        and wonderful pillowtalk dialog that is dialog - courageous two-way communication 
        underlined with obvious loving respect. And it's funny.</p>
      <p>Rx #9: CRAVE COMMON CORE-VALUES.<br>
        Realistic Romance&reg; Awardee: Legally Blonde (also Realistic Romance&reg; 
        Grand Prize winner)<br>
        . . . because despite the movie's totally unrealistic college and courtroom 
        aspects, the Valley Girl in this fantasy transforms herself into a top 
        Harvard Law School student, turns enemies into friends, and empowers a 
        variety of other people along the way. Wisely dumping her shallow earlier 
        crush whose values are clearly inferior to hers, she ultimately and rewardingly 
        partners with a man who shares her idealism and social activism. He's 
        a lawyer, too, and he's her friend. These two respect and honor each other.</p>
      <p>Rx #10: CULTIVATE your own COMPLETENESS.<br>
        Realistic Romance&reg; Awardee: ("young adults" book) Just Ella (Margaret 
        Peterson Haddix)<br>
        . . . because this exciting novel for adolescents is an empowering reframing 
        of Cinderella. After winning the prince, young Ella realizes it's not 
        the life she wants at all, so she escapes before the wedding. She finds 
        a more appropriate boyfriend who shares her values, but because they each 
        have goals to achieve, they wisely decide to devote time to developing 
        their friendship as well as their romance while encouraging each other 
        to achieve their goals. One day they might marry each other. Meantime, 
        she wonders why people "would rather believe in fairy godmothers . . . 
        than to think you took charge of your own life."</p>
      <p>Rx #11: (DE)CONSTRUCT CELEBRITIES.<br>
        Realistic Romance&reg; Awardee: Nurse Betty<br>
        . . . because in this delightful send-up of Myth #11, Renee Zellweger 
        plays a woman who believes that the doctor she adores and all the characters 
        on her favorite soap are real. But she's suffering from a traumatic experience 
        that has left her mind out of whack. Most fans who think they really know 
        their favorite stars (and often think they are in love with them) don't 
        have the same excuse.</p>
      <p>Rx #12: CALCULATE the very real CONSEQUENCES of unreal media.<br>
        Realistic Romance&reg; Awardee: (music video) Precious Illusions (Alanis 
        Morissette)<br>
        . . . because the clever split-screen visuals demonstrating mythic portrayals 
        (for example, a knight in shining armor on one side) side-by-side with 
        comparable realistic visions (a young suitor on a motor bike) perfectly 
        illustrate the wise and hauntingly honest lyrics that acknowledge the 
        singer who "won't keep on playing the victim" by clinging to her old "precious 
        illusions." Even though "parting with them is like parting with a childhood 
        best friend," this smart and talented woman wants "to decide between survival 
        and bliss."</p>
