This document will be retained in the bid file.</DD><P><DD><B>Energy Conservation Considerations</B></DD><P><DD>In developing specifications for items that have a high rate of energy consumption, consideration must be given to energy conservation. When purchasing items from categories in which Energy Star-qualified products exist, the university will make Energy Star compliance a mandatory specification. Refer to http://www.energystar.gov for more information on the Energy Star program. </DD></DL><P><B>Response Evaluation Criteria</B><P>Purchasing and Business Services and the requesting department share responsibility for developing the evaluation criteria for the responses to an RFP.  The evaluation criteria should include a method for scoring <A HREF="pur004.html#Vendor">vendor</A> responses against specific criteria.<P>A method for scoring each evaluation criterion will simplify the evaluation process and enable the response evaluator(s) to explain why any responding firm was or was not selected. Examples of evaluation criteria based on a five-point scale are available on the <A HREF="purforms.html">Purchasing and Business Services</A> Web site.<P><IMG SRC="purhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Cross-References</B></FONT></CENTER><IMG SRC="purhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><P>For related information on procurement, see <A HREF="pur303-01.html">PUR 303&#150;01</A>, &#147;Purchase Requests.&#148;<P>For related information on the solicitation process, see:<P><OL><LI><A HREF="pur305-01.html">PUR 305&#150;01</A>, &#147;Bidding Requirements for Procurements Costing Less than $15,000&#148;</LI><P><LI><A HREF="pur305-02.html">PUR 305&#150;02</A>, &#147;Bidding Requirements for Procurements Costing at Least $15,000 but Less than $35,000&#148;<P>and</LI><P><LI><A HREF="pur306-01.html">PUR 306&#150;01</A>, &#147;Bidding Requirements for Procurements Costing $35,000 or More.&#148;</LI></OL><P>For further information on information provided to vendors, see the policies in <A HREF="index.html#501">PUR 501</A>, &#147;Vendor Information/Advertising.&#148;<P>For further information on selection of vendors, see the policies in <A HREF="index.html#502">PUR 502</A>, &#147;Vendor Selection.&#148;<P><FONT COLOR="FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><HR><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">PUR</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | PUR&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="pur001.html">contact</A> | Purchasing&#160;and&#160;Business&#160;Services&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="purchasing.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
