                  <H3>Executive Committee of Librarians Council</H3>
                  <P>The Librarians&rsquo; Council provides the best opportunity for us to make our collective voices heard by the Dean. She has always welcomed the opportunity to work with Council members on issues affecting Academic Professionals, and this year was no exception.  
  
                <P>By the end of October the <I>Librarians&rsquo; Handbook</I> was loaded on the Web. Once the revisions were completed an archival copy was printed and sent to the Department of Archives and Manuscripts (DAM) where copies of all updates and revisions, along with revision date, will be retained permanently on file. Revision notices for all changes appear as a prominent link at the top of the Table of Contents page, just like the <I>ACD Manual</I>. It was decided that forms not be a part of the <I>Librarians&rsquo; Handbook</I>, since many of the forms are not generated by Council, but instead, will be provided as links on the appropriate <I>Handbook</I> Web page. In accomplishing this changeover from print to a Web-based document, we found many inconsistencies of style and nomenclature. Officers of the Executive Committee were able to resolve the self-explanatory technical changes without going to Council members, but referred more complex decisions to various committees to propose corrections to be presented to Council for approval. It was further decided that the <I>Handbook</I> on the Web will be updated on a regular basis, as revisions are approved, but a hard copy will be printed only once each year and submitted to the Archives.
  
                <P>JoAnn Mulvihill agreed to serve in the Kenneth B. Knepp Parliamentarian post, and Annie Platoff accepted appointment to the newly created position of Council Webmaster. The Executive Committee agreed to review the position description of the Parliamentarian position, to consider officially adding that position to the Executive Committee Roster, and also to define the role of Webmaster, with an eye to making the Webmaster position automatically a member of the Executive Committee also.
  
                <P>Each of our standing committees has taken positive action this year towards the furthering of Council goals. Items pending or carrying over until next fiscal year:
                  <UL>
                    <LI>The Personnel Committee has begun work on a set of generic packets to be placed on file and used as guides for librarians seeking guidance on how various levels of promotion requests should look, including successful formats, and style of presentation.
                    <LI>The Review Committee is studying the issue of member involvement in discussions of others&rsquo; packets if they also have a packet under consideration. While it is currently accepted that a librarian serving on the committee not be present when his/her packet is under discussion, the question remains whether or not (s)he should participate in discussion of other packets submitted for the same personnel action.	
                    <LI>The RPDC Committee has prepared recommended changes to the guidelines which will be presented to Council members for review and discussion in the next FY.
                  </UL>
                  <P>Standing committees have submitted their reports where you can read in more detail what each has accomplished this year.
  
                <P>I personally enjoyed working with the Council this year and especially with the officers comprising the Executive Committee. All members exhibited an outstanding level of commitment to addressing issues brought before the group and working in a constructive way to solve problems. We hope we have made a significant contribution to furthering the work of the Council this year.

                  <H3>Personnel Committee</H3>
                  <P>For 1999/2000, the Personnel Committee concentrated on the list of inconsistencies discovered by Lydia LaFaro when she was developing the web version of the Librarian's Handbook. The following Handbook sections were corrected, brought to Council and approved:
                  <UL>
                    <LI><B>D2 Ranks:</B> The special definition of Learning Resources Specialist was removed and the rest of the document adjusted so that all APs in the University Libraries are covered under one blanket description.
                    <LI><B>E3 Requirements (Retention, Continuing Appointment, Promotion):</B> Adjustments to text were made to reflect that Continuing Appointment is not granted without a promotion to Associate (if currently at Assistant level).
                    <LI><B>F3 Curricula Vita:</B> Additions to text regarding recommendations in format and style.
                    <LI><B>G2.2 Continuing Appointment/Promotion:</B> Adjustments to text were made to reflect that Continuing Appointment is not granted without a promotion to Associate (if currently at Assistant level).
                    <LI><B>G2.3 Notification Process for Negative Recommendations:</B> Adjustments to title and text were made for clarification. NOTE: after approval by Council, the Assistant Dean for Personnel requested a procedural change; this change was approved by Personnel Committee and Librarians' Council Executive Committee and will be brought before Council at the first meeting of the new year.
                    <LI><B>G2.4 Letters of Reference:</B> This new section was devised to include recommendations on obtaining letters of reference.
                  </UL>
                  <P>Sections or related activities remaining:
                  <UL>
                    <LI><B>G1.2 Supplementary Evaluations:</B> Adjusts are needed to the Mandatory Supplementary Review section
                    <LI><B>J. Orientation</B>
                    <LI><B>K. Mentoring</B>
                    <LI><B>Generic CV Packet</B>
                    <LI>
                  </UL>
                  <P>Other Activities
                  <OL>
                    <LI>The committee met with the Assistant Dean for Personnel and discussed the following issues:
                        <UL>
                          <LI>Should review committee members who have a packet under consideration, absent themselves just from the discussion of their packet or for all packets for the same level? AD for Personnel thought it should be from all packets. Request was sent to Walter Harris for an opinion. The Review Committee will be addressing this issue further.
                          <LI>Letters of Reference - this resulted in the new section G2.4 for the Handbook (see above).
                          <LI>Training/Assistance the AD does or could do for individuals preparing packets and for their supervisors.
                          <LI>Mandatory Supplementary Reviews - who should have them, for what and when? The Chair of the committee also met with Jeanne Richardson (Collection Development) and Scott Herrington (LIST) regarding this issue and an open discussion was held at a Council session. This issue will be revisited during the next year.
                          <LI>Orientation
                        </UL>
                  </OL>

                <P>Re: Research and Professional Development Committee Annual Report
  
                <P>The Research and Professional Development Committee received an allocation of $44,000 in travel funds and $3000 in research funds for the 1999-2000 fiscal year. We received 69 travel requests totaling $60,331.21. We allocated $44,015.00 for the year; this total includes funds that were reallocated when they were returned. A total of $42,866 was spent. The Committee also allocated $13,990 of the $14,000 allocation that we received for the ALA Annual meeting and other travel that occurred through September 2000. Two research requests were funded, each for $1000; $1000 of the research fund was not used. <BR>

                  <H3>Review Committee for Personnel Actions</H3>
                  <P>Members of the Committee for 1999/2000 were: Bob Follet (chair), Marcia Anderson, John Barnard (Personnel Committee), George Bell, Gordon Dutrisac (Probationary member), Mary Swaty, and Becky Uhl. The Committee made recommendations to the Dean on four sabbatical requests , two second-year reviews, one request for early promotion to Associate Librarian with continuing status, two promotions to full librarian, and one supplementary review for a conditional contract. In addition, the Committee reviewed packets for potential hires and made recommendations for rank. Finally, the Committee examined the issue of members who are applying for promotion, and has prepared a change to the <I><B>Librarians&rsquo; Handbook</B></I>, that will be considered in the fall.

                  <P>Members: Kenneth Furuta, Phil Konomos, Katherine Krzys, Katsuko Hotelling, Kimble Blouin
  
                <P>Phil Konomos was Co-Chair for the last half of 1999. Ken Furuta was Co-Chair for the first half of 2000.
  
                <P>The Committee held a series of meetings in February and March to discuss Librarians&rsquo; Council members&rsquo; concerns about the &ldquo;Bell Curve&rdquo; memo from Library Administration. Those meetings resulted in the Committee forwarding a &ldquo;Request for Comment&rdquo; e-mail to Council members, compiling and analyzing the replies, and sending a memo to the Dean expressing members&rsquo; concerns. The Dean responded to the memo at the April 19th Council meeting.
  
                <P>Kimble Blouin tendered her resignation from the Committee for the second year of her term. She was replaced through the Council Election.
