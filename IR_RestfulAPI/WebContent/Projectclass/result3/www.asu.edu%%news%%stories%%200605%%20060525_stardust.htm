<h1 class="storyhead">Stardust Center spurs research projects on affordable housing </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>With a burgeoning population and escalating cost of living, affordable housing is becoming a scarce resource in metropolitan Phoenix. To address this inevitable dilemma, the Stardust Center for Affordable Homes and the Family launched a new seed grant program to initiate studies that eventually will lead to efforts that help neighborhoods and organizations produce sustainable housing. </p>
<p>Three ASU professors have begun research in distinctive, highly critical areas related to affordable housing. Carlos Balsas, an assistant professor at the School of Planning, is evaluating the homeless population and its effect on downtown Phoenix revitalization; Peg Bortner, the director of the Center for Urban Inquiry, is researching affordable housing for ex-prisoner women and their children; and Filiz Ozel, a professor at the College of Design, is studying the correlation between spatial distribution and community assets. </p>
<p>?These studies will help us understand different populations and techniques for evaluating a community's needs in order to foster more affordable housing projects,? says Sherry Ahrentzen, associate director of research for the Stardust Center. </p>
<p>To initiate these pilot research projects, Balsas, Bortner and Ozel each applied for a seed grant of up to $10,000 from the Stardust Center in January. Proposals were awarded in February and funding began in March. Grant funds can be used to support personnel salaries, consultant fees or costs for data collection, such as printing surveys. </p>
<p>?A seed grant helps develop a preliminary study that establishes the necessary background and evidence to obtain a larger grant from an outside party,? Ahrentzen says. </p>
<p>Ahrentzen says the seed grant proposals were reviewed by a selection committee and chosen based on the following criteria: </p>
<p>? Significance, coherence, and innovation of the project and its relationship to the center's mission. </p>
<p>? Partnership with other faculty, community organizations and non-ASU institutions or businesses. </p>
<p>? The quality and feasibility of the proposal. </p>
<p>? The likelihood of a successful grant submission to an external agency. </p>
<p>? Demonstrated expertise or scholarly promise of the applicants. </p>
<p>Ozel says the Stardust seed grant is helping her evaluate how certain characteristics of a neighborhood correlate with spatial distribution of community assets, which is an essential evaluation for municipalities considering land development and revitalization. </p>
<p>Asset evaluation is a well-recognized function for most revitalization projects, but there is no strong model that clearly addresses how to consider spatial factors. </p>
<p>?Most asset evaluation is a usability study, but once they see spatial distribution, we think people will have a whole different layer of understanding when it comes to rebuilding communities,? she says. </p>
<p>Using the neighborhood of Sunnyslope as a case study, Ozel and her graduate research assistant are building maps from a geographic information system (GIS), which is an electronic database used to map potential uses for a community's development. </p>
<p>?The GIS maps are not just a visual replica of an area,? she says. ?The system allows you to enter specific data about a community and build a specialized map based on future community assets.? </p>
<p>Ozel's research involves interviewing Sunnyslope stakeholders ? residents, city leaders and business owners ? to identify desirable community assets. Subsequently, she creates GIS maps to determine a common interest among all stakeholders. Research is under way and will continue through the fall. The results will be presented to Sunnyslope and the Stardust Center in February. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Stardust grant is allowing Bortner to take an in-depth approach to one of the most elusive housing issues: providing adequate housing for ex-prisoner women and their children. The imprisonment rate for women has quadrupled in the last decade. Therefore, there's a need to address housing needs for these women once they re-enter society, Bortner says. </p>
<p>Bortner further explains that finding affordable and safe housing is an enormous problem for a vast majority of imprisoned women, especially those with children. She says the transition from prison to society is an extremely difficult time for women, and Arizona is in the preliminary stages of addressing re-entry issues such as housing, employment and education. </p>
<p>Specifically, Bortner's research includes looking at the historical perspective of this social issue and reviewing relevant research and public policy. Additionally, she will conduct in-depth interviews with 40 women within six months of their release from prison. </p>
<p>Following the interviews, Bortner will conduct a survey of 200 imprisoned women to gain a statistical perspective of what factors influence their housing histories and situations. Bortner is optimistic that her findings contribute to policy discussions regarding the needs of prisoners and their children. She will present results to decision makers, such as the Arizona Department of Corrections, the governor's office and Stardust Center in March. </p>
<p>Lastly, Balsas attributes the Stardust seed grant to helping him further his research on the implications of homelessness to the revitalization of Arizona 's capitol mall and downtown Phoenix . </p>
<p>?Without the grant, I wouldn't have been able to hire a research assistant to help me study how the city and other entities can help homeless people transition into better housing conditions,? he says. </p>
<p>With more than 12,000 homeless people in Maricopa County and 1,000 in downtown Phoenix alone, Balsas says homelessness is a serious problem in Arizona. This problem can be attributed to the erosion of affordable housing, urban poverty, inadequate community support and lack of funding. </p>
<p>As the inaugural year for Stardust Center's seed grant program, Ahrentzen says the center will be soliciting new research proposals for the fall. For information on the application process, visit the Web site (<a href="http://www.asu.edu/stardust">www.asu.edu/stardust</a>) this summer. </p>
