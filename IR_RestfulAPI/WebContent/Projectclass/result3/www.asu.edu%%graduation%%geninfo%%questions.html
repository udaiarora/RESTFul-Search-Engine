	  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>What is the difference between Graduation and Commencement?</strong></p>
    <p><EM><strong><em>Graduation</em></strong></EM> refers to   actually receiving a degree once a student has been certified by the University   as having met all degree requirements. Upon certification, the degree is awarded   and noted in the ASU Student Information System so that it displays on ASU   transcripts. Graduation certification occurs 4-6 weeks after final term grades   are posted.</p>
    <p>      <EM><strong><em>Commencement</em></strong></EM> is a   ceremony. It is an opportunity for students, families, friends, and the ASU   community to celebrate their academic accomplishments. Except for doctoral   students (who must actually graduate to participate), the commencement ceremony   is open to any student who has applied to graduate, notified the Commencement   Office that they intend to participate, purchased the required regalia, and shown   up at the designated time on the day of the ceremony. Participation in   commencement does not mean that a student has graduated and students do not   receive diplomas on that day. Diplomas are printed after the degree certification process is   complete.</p>
    <p><strong>What is the difference between Commencement and Convocation?</strong><br>
	    The University Commencement Ceremony is the campus-wide ceremony at  which students from all colleges and all degree programs are invited to  participate. The President of Arizona State University confers degrees  upon graduating students at this ceremony.</p>
	  <p>Convocation ceremonies are celebrations of individual student  achievement. Each college or special interest ceremony is different in  form and structure. Please contact the dean&rsquo;s office of your college to  inquire about college convocation information. For information about  special interest convocation ceremonies, please contact the Office of  University Ceremonies (480) 965-3565 and you will be referred to the  appropriate convocation coordinator.</p>
