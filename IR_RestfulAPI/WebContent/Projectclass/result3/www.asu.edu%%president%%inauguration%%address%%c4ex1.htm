The role         of religion in conflict has become especially prominent with recent events         and continuing disputes in Indonesia, the Middle East, India, Pakistan,         and in our own nation, in New York City. </p>      <p> Religious-based conflict has occurred throughout the world during most         of recorded history. It would be no exaggeration to suggest that religious-based         conflict exists in our nation in areas as diverse as foreign policy, international         law, teaching and learning in our schools, science and technology research         and application, news coverage, and political ideology. The growing recognition         of religion&#8217;s enormous role in conflict and public affairs around         the world clearly indicates the urgent need for the creation of the center.       </p></td>    <td align="center" valign="top"> &nbsp;<BR> </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
