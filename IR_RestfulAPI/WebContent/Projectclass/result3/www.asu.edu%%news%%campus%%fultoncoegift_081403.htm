      <h2>Ira A. Fulton honors wife Mary Lou with $5 million endowment for 
        ASU College of Education chair and research program; 
        Follows $50 million naming gift to ASU College of Engineering</h2>
      <p> Fulton Homes CEO Ira A. Fulton is honoring his wife, former teacher 
        Mary Lou Fulton, by making a $5 million gift to the ASU College of Education, 
        where she earned her teaching degree. The gift, which comes less than 
        two months after he gave $50 million to endow the Ira A. Fulton School 
        of Engineering, is the largest ever given to the College of Education 
        and makes Fulton the largest donor in the history of Arizona State University. 
      </p>
      <p> The gift will allow ASU to recruit a national expert in early reading 
        development and reading remediation as the first Mary Lou Fulton Presidential 
        Chair. It also will endow fellowships for outstanding graduate students 
        who are the future &#147;stars&#148; of the teaching profession, scholarships 
        for high potential undergraduates preparing for teaching careers and a 
        research fund for faculty.</p>
      <p> The gift launches an initiative to improve public education for children 
        in Arizona, by helping prepare high quality teachers and develop faculty 
        researchers who are engaged in community partnerships. <br>
        Arizona&#146;s public schools for children in preschool through high school 
        face tremendous challenges, and are struggling with changing demographics, 
        a high drop-out rate and a shortage of highly qualified teachers.</p>
      <p> &#147;When my wife was a teacher, what she most enjoyed was teaching 
        children to read, lifting their self-esteem and giving them a vital skill,&#148; 
        said Fulton. &#147;We are delighted that this chair, the graduate fellowships 
        and the research fund are in special education and remedial reading, two 
        areas we have to focus on in this state.</p>
      <p> &#147;The gift is being used for the right reasons, and will help our 
        state and the people of Arizona significantly. I hope the gift will have 
        an impact on other people who have the money to step up and make a similar 
        gift,&#148; Fulton said.<br>
        ASU President Michael Crow praised Fulton as a generous benefactor for 
        many worthy causes, but especially for efforts to improve education.</p>
      <p> &#147;Ira Fulton doesn&#146;t just build homes, he builds communities,&#148; 
        said Crow. &#147;With the gift to endow the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering 
        at ASU, he was helping build the Phoenix metropolitan area by enhancing 
        the quality of the engineering school and the education of world-class 
        engineers. With this gift to the College of Education, he is helping to 
        build a better pre-K/12 educational system, and an unparalleled program 
        for preparing high quality teachers for Arizona.&#148;</p>
      <p> Eugene Garcia, who came to ASU from UC Berkeley to become dean of the 
        College of Education a year ago, said the gift will provide critical help 
        for an effort underway at ASU to strengthen pre-K/12 education. As part 
        of this effort, Garcia recently was named vice president for university-school 
        partnerships.</p>
      <p> &#147;This is really great news for us,&#148; said Garcia. &#147;This 
        most welcomed gift, the largest ever to the College of Education, allows 
        ASU and the college to take a leadership position in addressing a critical 
        need.</p>
      <p> &#147;We all recognize the importance of having success in school, particularly 
        success in reading. We know so much more now about producing such success 
        and limiting failure. At ASU we will work to enhance early reading success 
        and eliminate the far-reaching effects of reading disabilities for Arizona&#146;s 
        children.&#148;</p>
      <p> Just as the donation to the College of Engineering marked the Fultons&#146; 
        49th wedding anniversary in June, the Mary Lou Fulton Presidential Chair, 
        fellowships and scholarships are a special gift from Fulton to his wife 
        for her 70th birthday, on August 10.</p>
      <p> One of Arizona&#146;s and the nation&#146;s most successful residential 
        builders, Fulton Homes gives generously to charity, focusing on education, 
        health and family services. Fulton Homes has built a 14,000 square-foot 
        Learning Center in Chandler, established scholarships for Native Americans 
        and Hispanic students, created a statewide Teacher of the Year award and 
        donated land for schools in four communities.</p>
      <p> The Fultons met at ASU in 1953, when he was a student-athlete, a Sun 
        Devil football player, and she was a shy education student. He pursued 
        her for a year, and the two were married June 26, 1954. She gave up her 
        college career to rear three children, returning to complete her coursework 
        and earn a bachelor of arts in education from ASU in 1975.</p>
      <p> Mary Lou Henson was born in Phoenix and attended Whittier Elementary 
        and Phoenix Union High School before she went to ASU. After 20 years, 
        she was especially proud to have finally received her teaching degree 
        in 1975, balancing her coursework with family needs as her own children 
        were in school.</p>
      <p> &#147;I loved working with my students in remedial reading,&#148; she 
        said of her student teaching semester at Tempe&#146;s Rural School. &#147;Even 
        though I only taught one semester, doing so was one of the most rewarding 
        experiences of my life. Those children were precious, and I learned more 
        from them than they did from me.&#148;</p>
      <p> Fulton said he is honoring his wife for her dedication, to her family 
        and to the needs of children.<br>
        &#147;I am doing this to honor my sweetheart, and for my state,&#148; 
        Fulton said. &#147;I was so happy for her when she received her diploma, 
        and for how hard she had struggled to get it. Her sensitivity to needy 
        children is one of her main joys in life.&#148;<br>
