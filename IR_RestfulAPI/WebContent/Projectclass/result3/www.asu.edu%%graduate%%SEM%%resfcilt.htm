<h4>
Thermal Analysis Methods and Equipment</h4>
Thermal stability, chemical reactivity and phase transitions are some of
the properties of materials, that can be investigated by thermogravimetric
and differential thermal analysis (TGA and DTA). TGA is used for precise
measurement of specimen weight changes are functions of time and temperature
in various gaseous environments. This experimental method is very useful
for investigations of reactivity and stability. Thermal decomposition and
nitridation reactions are typical examples. DTA is used for measuring changes
in specimen heat content during solid sate transformations and gas-solid
reactions. Data can be acquired during heating and cooling cycles. Endothermic
and exothermic events can be identified easily. TGA and DTA measurements
can be made simultaneously on the sample to allow direct correlation of
weight and heat change events with greater certainty than available with
separate measurements.

<a NAME="micro"></a>Microscopy</h2>

<h3>
Electron Microscopy</h3>
The properties and performance of new materials for many different applications
are determined by the presence and interaction between microstructural
features such as interfaces and dislocations. The interaction strength
of these features is determined by their individual atomic arrangements
and local chemistry. Electron microscopy is the primary method for studying
relationships between microstructure of materials and their properties.
Lower magnification wide-field microscopy methods are used to determine
the interactive behavior of groups of microstructural features, and high-magnification
high-resolution methods are used to determine the structure and chemistry
of individual microstructure features such as interfaces or dislocations.
<i>The
Materials Science Electron Microscopy Laboratory (MSEML)</i> and the <i>Center
for High Resolution Electron Microscopy (CHREM)</i> are available for electron
microscopy and MSEML and CHREM contain a wide range of electron microscopy
specimen preparation equipment. Researcher in both laboratories are major
users of computing facilities. In addition, CHREM researcher are major
developers of new computing methods for analyses of electron microscopy
images, diffraction patterns and spectra.
<h4>
MSEML Facilities</h4>
The <i>Materials Science Electron Microscopy Laboratory (MSEML)</i> was
established to support graduate and undergraduate education in the methods
and practices of electron microscopy analysis and interdisciplinary materials
research. It contains both transmission and scanning electron microscopes.
Comprehensive laboratory experiments illustrating all aspects of imaging
and diffraction (elastic scattering) and high spatial resolution chemical
analysis using energy dispersive X-ray and electron-energy-loss spectroscopy
methods (inelastic scattering) are performed in conjunction with formal
classroom lectures during the academic year. Many dissertation research
projects in materials are performed in this laboratory. Electron microscopes

<h3>
Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM)</h3>
An atomic-level understanding of materials surfaces is of fundamental interest
in both basic and applied advanced materials research. The invention of
the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the evolution of the more general
field of scanning probe microscopy has provided unprecedented atomic-level
insight into the nature of materials surfaces, including their structure,
electronic properties and reactivity. Among the techniques inspired by
the STM is atomic-force microscopy (AFM), which provides atomic-level insight
for non-conductive as well as conductive materials. Scanning probe microscopes

<h3>
Optical Microscopy</h3>
Optical microscopy remains one of the most widely-used characterization
techniques associated with advanced materials research and development,
with advantages that include the ability to incorporate color in materials
analysis, its utility in interactive materials processing (e.g., ultramicrotomy),
overall ease of use, and its ability to provide a convenient low-magnification
bridge to the high-resolution capabilities of electron and scanning probe
microscopy. Optical microscopes available in the facility are:

Single and double-bevelled samples can be prepared for structural and compositional
mapping, such as the two-dimensional mapping of dopant and carrier profiles
in integrated-circuit devices Conventional grinding and polishing are also
available.
<br><i>Scanning Probe Microscopy:</i> Surfaces suitable for SPM analysis
can be prepared by conventional grinding and polishing, sample cleaving
and by an ultramicrotomy technique recently developed in the Center for
Solid State Science.
<br><i>Transmission Electron Microscopy:</i> A variety of sample preparation
techniques are available, including standard mechanical pre-thinning following
by ion milling, wedge polishing, electropolishing, chemical polishing,

is also available by the precision angle-lapping procedure, which is often
used for application such as integrated-circuit construction/failure analysis
and localized defect analysis of optical coatings.

<a NAME="surface"></a>Surface and Thin Film Analysis</h2>

<h3>
XPS/Auger Surface Analysis</h3>
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, also referred to as electron spectroscopy
for chemical analysis or ESCA) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) are
sensitive techniques used for determining surface composition. Information
is usually obtainable for the first ~50 Angstroms below the surface of
interest. Both techniques rely on the emission of secondary electrons from
the specimen after the surface has been excited with either X-rays (XPS)
or electrons (AES). Samples must be compatible with an ultrahigh vacuum
system (~10<sup>-9</sup> torr or better). XPS has the sensitivity to detect
spectrum peak position energy shifts due to chemical bond formation, but
has limited spatial resolution. AES allows the incident electron beam to
be moved from one specimen surface region to another for mapping of the
surface elemental distribution, but has limited energy resolution. These
methods are complementary and are used together to determine elemental
distributions and chemical bonding states for sample surfaces.

<h3>
Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS)</h3>
SIMS is a surface analytical technique with a very high sensitivity to
most of the Periodic Table. Detection levels better than 1ppm are commonly
achieved. In SIMS, an incident ion beam is allowed to strike the phase
of interest. Each impacting ion releases, or "sputter" atoms from the target.
Some specimen atoms are ionized by the sputtering processes, and these
"secondary ions" can be steered into a mass spectrometer for mass selection
and detection. The instrument can be used in several modes:

</dl>

<h4>
SIMS Lab Facilities</h4>
The ASU SIMS is a Cameca IMS 3f ion microscope. Base pressure in the sample
chamber is 10<sup>-7</sup> torr. Depth resolution can be better than 10
nm. Lateral resolution is ~5-20 &micro;m) in point analysis mode and lateral
image resolution is ~1 &micro;m.
<h3>
Ion Beam Analysis of Materials (IBeAM)</h3>
Ion beam analysis (IBA), using MeV ion beams for compositional and structural
determination of materials, combines the advantages of non-destructive
and standardless analysis of the surface and near surface regions (0-2
&micro;m) of solids. IBA is most advantageously applied to analysis problems
where elemental composition and depth or thickness information are needed.
Rutherford backscattering (RBS) is a surface analysis technique which uses
the recoil energies of accelerated ions (e.g., He or H) to determine the
species and depth profiles of atoms in a given sample. RBS is extremely
useful when quantitative results are required in the absence of standards.
A variation of RBS is ion channeling, in which a single crystal sample
is aligned on a goniometer in situ so that one of its major symmetry axes
is parallel to the incident MeV ion beam. In this arrangement the backscattered
yield is reduced in proportion to the crystalline quality of the sample.
Studies can be made of lattice locations of impurities or dopants (substitutional
vs. interstitial lattice sites). Ion beams can also be used for X-ray analysis
(Proton Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) with the advantage of a much improved
signal/noise ratio when compared to electron induced X-rays. PIXE is sensitive
to impurities in the ppm range and requires no sample preparation. Another
unique application is hydrogen content analysis. H atoms are scattered
from the sample (by the incident accelerated ions) and energy analyzed
for concentration and depth distribution. All of the above processes are
virtually non-destructive to the sample. It is important to note that these
techniques yield elemental composition, independent of the type of chemical
bonding present.
<h4>
IBeAM Lab Facilities</h4>
The IBeAM (Ion Beam Analysis of Materials) facility consists of a 1.7 MeV
tandem accelerator with a beamline and analysis chamber. The Tandetron
accelerator is a Cockroft-Walton, gas insulated high frequency device which
can use either a gas source for ions (H, He, N, O, etc.) or a sputter source
for heavy ions (MeV implantation). Ion energies of several MeV can be created
since the tandem accelerator operates by producing negative ions at ground
potential and then uses a gas stripper at the high voltage terminal, thereby
creating multiple charged states of positive ions which are accelerated
to ground and selected by the bending magnet on the beamline where the
sample chamber is located.
<p>&nbsp;IBA measurements are done in a high vacuum environment requiring
samples to be clean and vacuum compatible. The ion beam is typically 1-2
mm<sup>2</sup> in area. An additional beamline allows the ion beam to pass
from the vacuum through a polymer window into the room atmosphere. Samples
place at the beamline exist window can be X-ray analyzed in air. This allows
chemical composition analysis of sample which are large or liquid or in
some way not vacuum compatible. A variety of materials ranging from objects
of art and archeology to environmental (air and water samples) and geological
(meteorites and rocks) samples can be analyzed.
<h2>
<a NAME="compute"></a>Research Computing Analysis</h2>
Materials research and education requires visualization of a variety of
materials and materials' processes, including crystalline and amorphous
microstructures and defects and multivariable physical processes such as
thin-film deposition. Numerical calculations are also routinely required
to interpret experimental data and for theoretical experiment design. The
Center for Solid State Science maintains two computer facilities that provide
computer hardware/software for these purposes: the Materials Science Computing
Facility in the Goldwater Building and the Center for HREM Computing Facility
in the Physical Sciences B-wing.
<p>&nbsp;High-speed workstations with accelerated graphics are available
in both facilities. Priority is given to graduate and undergraduate research
and education, which includes simulation and visualization of materials
science microstructures and the modeling of physical processes. Software
is available for simulation of the 232 crystallographic space groups, grain
boundaries, dissimilar crystal interfaces and surfaces for these materials.
Diffraction patterns and high-resolution electron microscope images can
be interactively simulated. This visualization capability has become critically
important for efficient teaching of interdisciplinary materials students
from diverse backgrounds, who must learn to visualize unfamiliar materials
structures in three dimensions.
<p>&nbsp;The computing facilities within the Center for Solid State Science
are integrated into a local area network which is link to the entire Internet
community. The vast implementation of electronic messaging has created
worldwide electronic communication. This enables researcher and students
to access national supercomputer centers, international databases and libraries,
and allows collaboration with colleagues campus-wide as well as worldwide.

The major objective of the Materials Science Laboratories is to provide
a productive environment for interdisciplinary materials research. The
laboratories are open to all, but priority is given to ASU affiliated researchers,
followed by non-ASU users carrying on publishable/non-propriety research,
and finally, as schedules allow, proprietary work can be done. Potential
users are encouraged to review the materials and instrumentation related
aspects of their research programs with the labs research consultants who
have knowledge and information about the capabilities with the various
labs and also about the extensive facilities located elsewhere on campus.
