      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most remarkable man, I think, that ever walked this earth was Rev. Leon Sullivan, my grandfather.
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandpa, standing 6'6", blue eyed, olive skin, and most importantly was an African-American who fought for human rights.  Born in 1922, he grew up in West Virginia in a shack and was raised by his grandmother whom he called "mama."  He fought for the right for ALL to be treated equally.
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young 8-year-old boy walked into a white's only restaurant and recited the preamble to the Declaration of Independence when the owner wouldn't allow him to eat there because of the color of his skin.  After reciting that all men are created equal, the owner was so moved that he offered young Leon a free hamburger and told him to come by any time he wanted.  This event may have been the event that changed thousands of others' lives around the world.  The event that spoke to young Leon made him want to change the world in a positive way for all.
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of his greatest accomplishments was the development of the seven Sullivan Principles that led to the fall of apartheid in South Africa.
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also the first African-American appointed to be on the Board of Directors of a major corporation, where he became a Director of General Motors.
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A remarkable life my grandpa lived.  A life of service to others?and for others?for ALL.
