The university&#146;s academic freedom policy applies to academic professionals, regardless of their appointment period. <p>Academic professionals on year-to-year appointments must have a position description that articulates standards for position effectiveness; professional contributions; and institutional, professional, and/or community service.  Individual academic professionals will have different percentages of effort in each category; it is not necessarily the case that all academic professionals will have responsibilities in each category.  It is the responsibility of the colleges and the unit that such a job description exist for each academic professional.<p>The performance by academic professionals on year-to-year appointments shall be evaluated at least once annually by the immediate supervisor and, where appropriate, the administrator to whom the supervisor reports.  Unit policies shall be consistent with <a href="acd507-08.html">ACD 507&#150;08</a>, &#147;Annual Performance Evaluation.&#148;   <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Ranks of Appointment</b></font><p><b>Assistant </b><p>All academic professionals appointed at this initial rank must meet the minimum standards for appointment as defined by the unit. Ordinarily, academic professionals have earned an advanced degree or have acquired a high level of the particular skills needed for a position. As assistant academic professionals gain experience, they are expected to improve in their performance categories as outlined by position descriptions and unit guidelines.<p><b>Associate  </b><p>Academic professionals appointed at/promoted to associate rank must exceed the standards for initial appointment at assistant rank, and meet the standards for appointment to the associate rank as defined by the unit. They must have attained considerable expertise in the areas of competence required of their positions. Associate academic professionals must demonstrate excellence in their performance categories as outlined by position descriptions and unit guidelines.<p><b>Full or Senior </b><p>Academic professionals appointed at/promoted to full or senior rank must exceed the standards for associate rank, have substantial professional experience, and meet the standards for appointment to the full or senior rank as defined by the unit. Academic professionals at this rank must demonstrate a high level of effectiveness and should be considered experts in their chosen fields. At this rank, both professional contributions and service activities, if required, must involve sharing knowledge and experience with others by providing substantial guidance and leadership in areas of professional or academic interest. <p>Although there is no prescribed timeline for promotion from associate to full, it would be unusual for a person to accumulate the record of accomplishment expected for this rank without working for several years at the associate level. <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Eligibility for Other University Employment </b></font><p>Academic professionals on year-to-year appointments are not eligible for continuing appointments.<p>Academic professionals on year-to-year appointments are eligible to apply for other positions within the university.  Should a year-to-year position be reclassified, the incumbent is eligible to apply. <p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Procedures</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p><b>Promotion</b><p>Academic professionals on year-to-year appointments are eligible to apply for promotion.<p><b>Renewal</b><p>Academic professionals on year-to-year appointments have no expectation of employment beyond the end of the current appointment period. Year-to-year appointments may be renewed annually, conditional upon satisfactory job performance, the continued availability of funds, and the needs of the unit and the university.  There is no limit to the number of times year-to-year appointments may be renewed.<p><b>Notification of Non-Renewal</b><p>An academic professional on a year-to-year appointment shall be notified in writing of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the appointment. If written notice of non-renewal is given less than 90 days prior to the end of  the appointment period, the academic professional shall be entitled to continuation of salary for 90 days from the date of notification, but shall not be entitled to another year&#146;s appointment in the same position. <p>&#160;<p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
