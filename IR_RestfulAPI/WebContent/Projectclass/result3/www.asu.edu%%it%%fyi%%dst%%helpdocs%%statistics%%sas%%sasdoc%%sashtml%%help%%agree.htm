Agreement, are referred to as &quot;Licensee&quot;.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, SAS Institute Inc. (&quot;Institute&quot;) 
hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the computer program (&quot;Program&quot;) 
and the documentation (&quot;Documentation&quot;).  The Program and the Documentation are collectively referred to as &quot;SAS OnlineDoc&quot;. 
The Program is supplied to Licensee in object code form only.</P> 

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Scope of Use</B> </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The use of and access to SAS OnlineDoc shall be made only by persons authorized to use the related SAS software (&quot;Users&quot;).  
Licensee shall use SAS OnlineDoc only for its own internal business use.  The Institute provides a single copy of SAS OnlineDoc to Licensee.  
Licensee may: (1) copy and use SAS OnlineDoc in the same manner and to the same extent as Licensee is authorized to copy 
and use the related SAS software or (2) copy SAS OnlineDoc to a single hard disk of computer hardware that is owned or controlled by Licensee for 
use over the Licensee's internal network.  Licensee must retain the original media containing SAS OnlineDoc during the term of this Agreement.  
Licensee may not duplicate the original media containing SAS OnlineDoc except as necessary for backup purposes. 
Licensee shall not: (1) modify SAS OnlineDoc or (2) translate, decompile, create or attempt to create, by reverse 
engineering or otherwise, the source code, which is a trade secret of the Institute, from the object code 
supplied hereunder or (3) adapt the Program in any way or use it to create a derivative work. In such event, 
this Agreement shall be deemed terminated and all warranties and other obligations of Institute shall be deemed 
revoked by Institute and waived by Licensee.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Printing</B> </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Licensee may print portions or all of the Documentation.  
Users may duplicate such printed Documentation only for internal use.  
Licensee agrees to ensure that all printed or duplicated copies of the Documentation contain the Institutes 
copyright notices.  Licensee and Users may not sell such printed or duplicated copies of the Documentation.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Term</B> </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time.  Institute may terminate this Agreement 
if Licensee breaches any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or breaches any of the terms and conditions of 
its software license for SAS software.  Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Licensee shall destroy all copies of 
SAS OnlineDoc and return the original copy of SAS OnlineDoc to Institute.  All provisions of this Agreement relating to confidentiality, 
proprietary rights, disclaimers of warranties, and limitation of liability, remedies or damages shall survive termination.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Proprietary Rights</B> </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Title to SAS OnlineDoc shall be the sole and exclusive property of 
Institute or its Licensors.  Licensee shall not sell, transfer, publish (except as specifically set forth herein), 
rent, lease, loan or otherwise make available any portion of SAS OnlineDoc to others or export 
(except as specifically set forth herein) SAS OnlineDoc. Licensee agrees to secure and protect 
SAS OnlineDoc in a manner consistent with the maintenance of Institute's rights therein and to take appropriate 
action by instruction or agreement with all persons who are permitted access to SAS OnlineDoc to satisfy its obligations hereunder.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Limited Warranty and Disclaimer</B>  </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Institute warrants that the media on which SAS OnlineDoc is furnished will 
be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use for a period of ninety (90) 
days from the date of delivery of SAS OnlineDoc.  Licensee's exclusive remedy for breach of 
this warranty shall be replacement of the defective media by the Institute. 
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>Institute and its licensors disclaim all other warranties, 
express or implied, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties of merchantability 
and/or fitness for a particular purpose whether alleged to arise by law, by reason of custom or usage in the trade, or by course of dealing.  
Because some jurisdictions do not allow the waiver or exclusion of implied warranties, the limitations 
in this Section 6 may not be wholly enforceable.</FONT>  </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Limitation of Liability</B></LI></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Institute and its licensors shall have no 
liability with respect to their obligations under this Agreement or otherwise for special, incidental, 
consequential, punitive or exemplary damages even if advised of the possibility of such damages.  
In no event shall Institute's and its licensor's liability for all reasons and upon all causes of 
action in the aggregate exceed the lesser of (1) the fees paid by Licensee to the Institute under this 
Agreement or (2) the then-current retail price of SAS OnlineDoc.  Because some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of 
liability for incidental or consequential damages, the limitation in this Section 7 may not be wholly enforceable.  </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Government Use</B> </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Use, duplication or disclosure of SAS OnlineDoc by the U.S. Government is

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Licensee may not download or otherwise export or reexport the SAS OnlineDoc or any underlying 
information or technology except in full compliance with all laws and regulations of the United States of America and in full compliance with
any other applicable laws and regulations.  By accepting this Agreement and installing SAS OnlineDoc, Licensee is 
agreeing to the foregoing.  Licensee also affirms that Licensee is a lawfully admitted permanent resident of and located in a country to which the United States permits Institute 
to send SAS OnlineDoc. Licensee further affirms that Licensee is a party to whom the United States allows the Institute to license SAS OnlineDoc, 
and Licensee is not on any United States Government list of parties to whom the Institute may not license SAS OnlineDoc, and 
Licensee will not allow any such party to access SAS OnlineDoc.  Currently, the United States prohibits exports of SAS OnlineDoc to 
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.  This list of countries may change in the future and may differ for 
other products Institute provides.  The current list of parties to whom the Institute may not license SAS OnlineDoc includes but 
is not limited to parties who are involved in terrorism or who will use SAS OnlineDoc for design, development, or production of
nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, or missiles.</P>                                                                                                                                   

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>General</B> </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Agreement and any invoices relating to SAS OnlineDoc constitute the complete agreement 
between Licensee and Institute about SAS OnlineDoc and supersede any purchase order, communications, or representations regarding SAS OnlineDoc. 
If any provision of this Agreement shall be unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this 
Agreement and shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions.  Any additions or modifications must be approved in 
writing signed by both parties.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not 
apply to this Agreement.  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the United States of America and the State of North Carolina. </P>
