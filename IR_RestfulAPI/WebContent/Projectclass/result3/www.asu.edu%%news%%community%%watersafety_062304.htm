      <h2>Doran Community Scholars provide educational program on water safety </h2>
      <p>The summer months are here and high temperatures are causing many outdoor enthusiasts to seek refuge at local pools, lakes and water parks. In the midst of splashing around with family and friends, water safety may sometimes be overlooked. </p>
      <p>The 2004-05 senior class of ASU's Doran Community Scholars Program (DCSP) recently completed a project that serves as a reminder to be safe around water this summer. </p>
      <p>This year's DCSP senior class - Alma Aguirre, Marlene Berry, Sylvia Carrizoza, Alisha Jimerson, Edward Olaya, Jannet Ortega and Carlos Sandoval - decided to research and develop a program that would educate children and adults about water safety. </p>
      <p>"Many people aren't aware of some of the dangers that can occur while playing with water," says DCSP participant Alma Aguirre, who just earned a bachelor's degree in psychology in May. "Water safety doesn't only pertain to swimming pools, it also applies to lakes, bathrooms and even water buckets. Not many people, especially in the Hispanic community, are aware of this." </p>
      <p>Aguirre is one of seven DCSP seniors who collaborated with the City of Phoenix Water Safety Task Force and the City of Phoenix Fire Department on May 1 to host the third annual Fiesta del Agua, which officially celebrates the first day public pools open around Phoenix and promotes water safety. </p>
      <p>Wayne Doran, a consultant to the Ford Motor Company, founded the Doran Community Scholars Program in 1997. The mission of the DCSP is to facilitate the development of scholars to be caring leaders for the purpose of taking action while improving the social conditions of the community. </p>
      <p>Christopher Erran, DCSP program coordinator says, "Each year the senior class is responsible for developing and researching a program that focuses on leadership and special program/event coordinating as they relate to the social conditions of communities in the Phoenix metropolitan area; on board development and on implementation." </p>
      <p>Through their research, conducted in collaboration with the City of Phoenix, the students discovered that the Maryvale area had the highest statistics for drowning and water related incidents in Arizona, as well as the nation. The Maryvale area is predominantly populated by low-income neighborhoods, old neighborhoods, and Spanish speakers according to research <br>
  demographics. </p>
      <p>Olaya and Aguirre said designing an interactive, fun and informative water safety program, that would also address Spanish speakers, was the best solution. The one-day event, held at Starlight Park Pool located at 7810 W. Osborn Rd., included food, swimming, games and prizes and provided a wide range of resources on water safety. </p>
      <p>"The project offered C.P.R. classes. There were approximately 1,500 who participated," says Edward Olaya, a senior bioengineering major. "The sessions were also provided in Spanish and participants left knowing the basics of C.P.R." </p>
      <p>"I had a lot of fun working with kids," Aguirre says. "It was important to provide information to the parents, as well as to educate the kids about water safety and the dangers that may occur." </p>
      <p>Erran says this year's seniors, like every senior class, produced a very creative and informative community project. </p>
      <p>"They dedicated a lot of time and effort to this project," he says. "Each year our students come up with some of the most resourceful projects that benefit the community. This one was a big success." </p>

      <p>The City of Phoenix Fire Department continues to host this event to educate and provide helpful resources for citizens about water safety. </p>
