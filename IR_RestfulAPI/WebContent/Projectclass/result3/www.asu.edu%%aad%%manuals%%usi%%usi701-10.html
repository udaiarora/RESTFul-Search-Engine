<p>
The DRC provides rides from residence halls and parking lots to campus and between classroom buildings for individuals with disabilities. However, these individuals should seek alternate transportation whenever possible.

<p>
Individuals who are unable to walk to Tempe campus locations must register with the Disability Resource Center (DRC) to be eligible for on-campus cart transportation.

<p>
Individuals requesting transportation services who are not registered with the DRC for other services related to their disability are required to provide medical verification of a mobility impairment. A form to be used for this purpose will be provided by the DRC upon registration for transportation services. The form must be completed by the individual&#146;s attending physician and be returned to DRC Transportation Services by fax, mail, or hand delivery within three business days from the initial scheduling date. Passengers failing to return the completed form by the deadline indicated on the form will have services canceled. Services will be reinstated upon receipt of the completed form.

<p>
The DRC provides a shared ride, prescheduled transportation service. The DRC schedules rides on a first-come, first-served basis. All rides requested are subject to availability of vehicles and drivers. Regular operating hours are Monday through Friday, 7:10 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Individuals requiring rides after 6:45 p.m., should call the ASASU Escort Service at 480/965&#150;1515 for services Monday through Friday, 7:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m.

<p>
Transportation is on a call-in basis and is limited to availability of open time slots on the current pickup schedule. To accommodate students attending classes, carts will leave residence halls and parking lots according to specific lead times established by the DRC. These times can range from 20 to 30 minutes prior to scheduled class start times. Students traveling from one class to another have priority for pickup times and will be scheduled accordingly. Students traveling from classes back to residence halls and parking lots will be picked up no later than 20 minutes after class lets out.

<p>
If an individual will not need a scheduled ride, he or she must notify the DRC. Failure to notify the DRC twice results in cancellation of transportation services.

<p>
The DRC does not provide students with personal assistance and/or personal trips, e.g., trips to a bank or store.


<p>
