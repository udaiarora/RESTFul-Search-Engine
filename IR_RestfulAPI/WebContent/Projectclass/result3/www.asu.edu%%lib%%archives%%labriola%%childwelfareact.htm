  The Indian Child Welfare Act, passed into law on November 8, 1978, established
    minimum federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families
    and the placement of these children in foster or adoptive homes. In essence,
    the act restricts the placement of Indian children in non-Indian homes and
    gives jurisdiction to tribal courts in deciding matters of child welfare
    cases, even when problems occur off the reservation.</p>
<br><p>The law was specifically designed to end discriminatory practices of state
  and county welfare agencies which disregarded Indian extended family arrangements
  and placed large numbers of Indian children in non &#8211;Indian homes.</p>
<br><p>Below is
  a list of readings published by the National Indian Child Welfare Association.
  These have been cataloged to the Labriola Center, and are listed
  in the ASU Online Catalog. In addition, consult the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/">ASU
  online catalog</a> with
  a keyword search for &#8220;Indian Child Welfare Act,&#8221; and using the
  same terms, search the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/db/amerindx.htm">American
  Indian Index</a> (from the Library home page, click
  on &#8220;Articles&#8221; and type American Indian Index). From the same point,
  search <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/db/ethnicnw.htm">Ethnic Newswatch</a>, or <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/db/edrs.htm">ERIC</a> for additional material.</p>
<br><p>For general information, take a look at <em>American Indians in the Twentieth
  Century</em> on the Labriola reference shelf. The Labriola Subject Guide on<a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/boardingschools.htm"> mission
  schools and boarding schools</a>, will give valuable assistance on early education
  of the American Indian.</p>
