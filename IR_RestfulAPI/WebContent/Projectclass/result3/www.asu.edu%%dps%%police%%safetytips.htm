<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following Holiday Safety Tips were compiled, in cooperation with the ASU Police Crime Prevention Section, to contribute to the safety and security of people during the holiday season. The holiday season is always a special time of year. It is also a time when busy people become careless and vulnerable to theft and other holiday crime. We can never be too careful, too prepared or too aware. Please share this information with family, friends and neighbors. The ASU Police Department wishes you a safe, happy and peaceful holiday season. </font></p>
