<p><em><strong>What Drives a Nobel Prize Winner? Economic Research and Students</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This is part of a series of articles that highlight the recent President&rsquo;s Professors and Regents&rsquo; Professors at ASU.</em></p>
<p>As a Nobel Prize-winning professor of economics with the W. P. Carey School of Business, Edward Prescott always is looking for new and innovative ideas that he can apply to his research. It is that same vision and determination that led to his 2004 Nobel Prize Laureate in Economic Sciences, where he was lauded for his methodological contributions to transcend business cycles.</p>

        <p><strong>Regents' and President's Professors </strong></p>
        <p>Edward Prescott  is one of six ASU faculty members awarded Regents Professor appointments for 2006. Regents&rsquo; Professors are marked by excellence in teaching, exceptional achievements in research or other creative activities, and national and international distinction in their fields. Named by the Arizona Board of Regents, they serve as advisers to the university president and take on a broader role as consultants and teachers throughout the university.</p>
        <p> The other members of this year's Regents' Professor class are:  <a href="20060209_regents_candelaria.htm">Cordelia Candelaria</a>, Chicana and Chicano Studies; Carlos Castillo-Chavez, Mathematics and Statistics Department; <a href="20060202_regents_montgomery.htm">Douglas Montgomery</a>, Industrial Engineering Department; George Poste, Biodesign Institute and School of Life Sciences; Edward Prescott, Economics Department, Rogier Windhorst, Physics and Astronomy Department. </p>

        <p>ASU is also honoring for the first time a class of President's Professors. This new prestigious award, is designed to reward enthusiasm and innovation in teaching, the ability to inspire original and creative work by students, mastery of subject matter and scholarly contributions.</p>
        <p> Inaugural awardees are Randall Cerveny, professor of geography; Alice Christie, associate professor of technology and education; Ian Gould, professor of chemistry and biochemistry; and the late Paul Rothstein, associate professor of industrial design.</p>

<p>Prescott shared his Nobel Prize with Finn Kydland of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of California-Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I continue to be honored to have won the Nobel Prize, and I deeply thank everyone who has helped me, in particular Finn Kydland,&rdquo; Prescott says.</p>
<p>The two worked together to answer some of the longstanding questions in macroeconomics such as time consistency of economic policy and the driving forces behind business cycles.</p>
<p>As a senior monetary analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis, Prescott is thoroughly familiar with international finance and monetary policy. According to Prescott, this is the golden age of economics. He says economic theory has become quantitative &ndash; a hard science.</p>
<p>There previously have been many questions that economists could only speculate about, but now they have the methodology to unravel them &ndash; questions, for example, that address why openness is so important to a country&rsquo;s economy. In 2002, Prescott authored a book called &ldquo;Barriers to Riches,&rdquo; in which he argued that &ldquo;barriers to technology adoption are the dominant cause of the large differences in standards of living across countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prescott&rsquo;s career achievements and continued enthusiasm for economic research has led to his recent appointment to Regents&rsquo; Professor at the W. P. Carey School of Business. It&rsquo;s a position that allows him to share his wealth of knowledge with students, whom he greatly values.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned a great deal from students of all academic levels &ndash; undergraduates and graduates,&rdquo; Prescott says. &ldquo;They ask good questions, and some of those questions have resulted in good papers. It&rsquo;s important for society that students can carry out evaluation of policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His primary goal is to encourage students to think more critically and openly about economic theory, and the world in which it thrives. Prescott is considered by many to be one of the most prolific producers of doctoral students in the economics profession.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Prescott has been the recipient of many highly acclaimed awards, including the 2002 Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics for his major contributions to economic analysis.</p>
<p>He also has been invited to speak at many lectures throughout the country. In 1997, he presented the first Lawrence R. Klein lecture, titled &ldquo;Needed: A Theory of Total Factor Productivity.&rdquo; In 1994, he gave the third Pareto-Walras lecture, titled &ldquo;Barriers to Riches,&rdquo; and gave the first Lionel McKenzie lecture, titled &ldquo;Dynamic Coalitions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prescott has an impressive educational background. He attended Swarthmore College, where he earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in mathematics, and earned a master&rsquo;s of science in operations research at Case-Western Reserve University. He then attended the Graduate School of Industrial Administration at Carnegie Mellon University, where he earned his doctorate in economics.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1981, Prescott began his association with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and was on the faculty at the University of Minnesota for more than 20 years. In 2002, he received an academic award from the University of Rome. In that same year, Prescott delivered the Richard T. Ely Lecture, titled &ldquo;Prosperity and Depression,&rdquo; at the American Economic Association meetings. And in the fall of 2003, he joined the W. P. Carey School of Business teaching economics.</p>
<p>Prescott has held a number of visiting professorships throughout the United States and Europe. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Econometric Society.</p>
