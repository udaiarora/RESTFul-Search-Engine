      <h2>Home affordability keeps sales soaring in first quarter 2003</h2>
      <p>Record low mortgage rates and high rates of appreciation continued to
        be a boon to the Greater Phoenix home buyer in first quarter 2003, according
        to the Arizona Real Estate Center.</p>
      <p>"Ongoing economic concerns have greatly benefited home buyers, because
        funds have flowed from the uncertain equity market to the bond market,
        driving down interest rates," according to Dr. Jay Q. Butler, director
        of the Center at Arizona State University's W. P. Carey School of Business.
        "The average 30-year mortgage interest rate has declined from 6.7 percent
        in first quarter 2002, to 5.7 percent at the end of the year, to 5.5
        percent at the end of the first quarter 2003."</p>
      <p>In the Greater Phoenix resale market, the median home price rose to
        $148,750, compared to $139,000 in the same period last year. The previous
        record of $147,000 was set in fourth quarter 2002. For new homes, the
        median price decreased from $164,540 (fourth quarter 2002) to $163,545,
        but still emerged ahead of the $158,015 for a year ago. "The slower rise
        in new home median price is due primarily to the increasing role of the
        lower-priced housing market in the West Valley," Butler said.</p>
      <p>As lower interest rates and a slightly higher median household income
        offset a higher median resale home price, the Greater Phoenix resale
        affordability index increased from 128 in fourth quarter 2002 to 131
        - much more favorable for home buyers than the 122 reported a year ago
        (but short of the record level of 139 reported in first quarter 1999).
        An index value of 100 means that the typical home buyer - based on the
        current median resale price and household income - would be able to afford
        a median-priced home at the effective interest rate. Since home prices
        and incomes vary throughout the Valley, so does the affordability index.
        With the decline in the new home median price, the affordability index
        value for new homes improved slightly from 115 to 119, which is well
        above last year's 108.</p>
      <p> Since 1985, the Arizona Real Estate Center has computed affordability
        indexes for the Greater Phoenix area. Recently, it has begun to develop
        affordability indexes for cities and even smaller geographical areas.
        The following provides some examples of affordability indexes.</p>
      <p>&middot; Even though Chandler and Gilbert have some of the most expensive
        homes in the Valley, their respectively high household incomes support
        a strong affordability index. Based on current estimates, the median
        household income in Chandler is $62,665, while it is $72,800 in Gilbert.
        Thus, the resale affordability index in Chandler - based on a median
        price of $158,000 - is 159, while the new home median price of $227,375
        set the affordability index for new homes at 111. In Gilbert, the resale
        index is 173 (median price $170,000) and new home affordability index
        is 142 ($207,040). </p>
      <p>&middot; Based on an estimated median household income
        of $48,290, Glendale has a resale index of 137 (median price $141,900)
        and a new home index
        of 125 ($155,675).</p>
      <p>&middot; Mesa, with an estimated median household income of $45,930,
        the resale index is 136 (median price $135,700) and new home index of
        109 ($169,410). Much like the Greater Phoenix area, affordability here
        can vary throughout the city. For example the resale index is 160 in
        East Mesa and 131 in North Mesa.</p>
      <p>&middot; In North Scottsdale, with a median household income of $78,650,
        the resale index value is 93 (median price $340,000) and the new home
        index value is 83 ($381,060). In South Scottsdale, the resale index value
        is 120 based on median home value of $162,000 and median household income
        of $48,270.</p>
      <p>&middot; In the city of Phoenix, the resale affordability index is at
        139, ranging from 98 in the East Camelback area to 160 in Deer Valley
        area. In the new home market, the index value is 109 with a range spanning
        81 in Union Hills, to 111 in South Phoenix, to 123 in Deer Valley. </p>
      <p>&middot; The West Valley communities are known for their affordable
        housing. For example:</p>
      <p>o In Avondale, with an estimated median household income of $52,725,
        the resale affordability index is 150 (median price $141,375) and new
        home index is 160 ($132,420).</p>
      <p>o Based on a median household income of $36,270, El Mirage has a resale
        index of 125 (median price $117,000) and new index of 119 ($122,910).</p>
      <p>o Goodyear, with an estimated median household income of $61,675, has
        resale index of 151 (median price $164,500) and new home index of 153
        ($161,540).</p>
      <p>o Surprise, with an estimated median household income of $47,370, has
        a resale index of 136 (median price $140,500) and new home index of 125
        ($152,695).</p>
