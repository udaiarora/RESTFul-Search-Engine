<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> <B>Generate the regional map.</B> The ID statement
specifies the variable that defines the map areas and is in both the map data
set and the response data set. DISCRETE specifies that each value of the numeric
response variable, STATE, be treated as a separate response level. HTML= specifies
REGIONDRILL as the variable that contains the targets for the map regions.
Specifying HTML variables causes SAS/GRAPH to
add an image map to the HTML body file. DES= specifies the description that
is stored in the catalog and used in the Table of Contents. NAME= specifies
the name of the graphics catalog entry. Because the PATH= destination is a
file storage location and not a specific file name, the catalog entry name
EPAMAP is automatically assigned to the GIF file.
