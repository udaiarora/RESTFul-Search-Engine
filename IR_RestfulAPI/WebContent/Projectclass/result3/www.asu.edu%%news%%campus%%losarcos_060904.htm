      <h2>New center sets stage for south Scottsdale economic boost </h2>
      <p>The City of Scottsdale, ASU and the ASU Foundation have proposed a partnership that would significantly enhance the city's economic base and serve as the cornerstone for the revitalization of south Scottsdale. </p>
      <p>As an economic driver, this partnership would allow Scottsdale to enhance its participation in the region's move toward building a knowledge-based economy. </p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/Los-Arcos-2.jpg" width="216" height="144" align="right">Under the terms of the joint venture, the ASU Foundation has made arrangements to purchase the 42-acre parcel of property known as Los Arcos for $41.5 million. The city would purchase the site from the foundation for that amount and enter into an agreement to make the site available to the foundation for the development of the ASU Scottsdale Center for New Technology and Innovation. </p>
      <p>This center would focus on technology commercialization, entrepreneurship and business development. It would include traditional and non-traditional business incubators, as well as programs focusing on technologies at the intersection of engineering, art and bioscience. </p>
      <p>"This partnership taps into the tremendous potential southern Scottsdale offers," said Mayor Mary Manross. "It takes advantage of the proximity to ASU and superb location in the Valley. It brings a sustainable economic engine to a part of our community poised to be the Valley's next hotspot for residential and business revitalization. It's the start of a true <br>
  renaissance for this area." </p>
      <p>"This is a win-win situation for the City of Scottsdale and the university," said ASU President Michael Crow. "The ASU Scottsdale Center for New Technology and Innovation gives the university a creative outlet as well as much needed space. It will renew southern Scottsdale and advance the economic base of the entire city, giving it a 21st century center for innovation that is unique in the Southwest if not unique in the nation and the world." </p>
      <p>It is expected that when fully implemented, this project would catalyze significant economic development in southern Scottsdale and throughout the city. Specifically on the Los Arcos site, the center will help the City of Scottsdale realize approximately 4,000 jobs. </p>
      <p>This center would also be the catalyst for improved retail in the southern Scottsdale area. Because of this announcement, there is already a commitment from Bashas' Supermarkets to evaluate the feasibility of a new store nearby to serve the community. </p>
      <p>The center would house university units and to-be-built programs that focus on technology, commercialization, entrepreneurship and industry development. It would also be a magnet for business and venture capitalists from around the country and abroad. </p>
      <p>The city must close on the purchase of the property by July 31, 2004. To meet this deadline the Scottsdale City Council must approve the expenditure of $41.5 million, available from the sale of Municipal Property Corporation bonds. The city would also fund infrastructure costs in an amount not to exceed $45 million. </p>
      <p>The City Council is scheduled on June 28 to consider a memorandum of understanding with the ASU Foundation, including the terms for the development and use of the site. The city and the foundation would work out a more detailed development agreement and present it to the council at a later date. </p>
      <p>Scottsdale has conservatively estimated that the development of the center would result in a return of approximately $175 million in direct revenues to the city plus the economic impacts of the creation of new jobs. </p>
      <p>"This is truly a redefining moment for the Los Arcos/McDowell corridor" said Virginia Korte, Scottsdale Chamber President. "Recently we were asked 'Which Way Scottsdale' and today we are taking a giant step in the right direction." </p>
