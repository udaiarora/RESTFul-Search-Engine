<p><em><strong>Peering at galaxies gives professor a long-term perspective </strong></em></p>
<p align="left">A career of peering into deep space (and basically back in time) to see how and why the universe developed in the way it did has given Rogier Windhorst a wonderful long-term perspective. But even he didn't see what would result from a somewhat innocuous meeting on campus in early 2000. </p>

        <p><strong>Regents' and President's Professors </strong></p>
        <p>Rogier Windhorst  is among six ASU faculty members who have been awarded Regents Professor appointments for 2006. Regents&rsquo; Professors are marked by excellence in teaching, exceptional achievements in research or other creative activities, and national and international distinction in their fields. Named by the Arizona Board of Regents, they serve as advisers to the university president and take on a broader role as consultants and teachers throughout the university.</p>
        <p> The members of this year's Regents' Professor class are: <a href="../200602/20060209_regents_candelaria.htm">Cordelia Candelaria</a>, Chicana and Chicano Studies; <a href="20060323_regents_chavez.htm">Carlos Castillo-Chavez</a>, Mathematics and Statistics Department; <a href="../200602/20060202_regents_montgomery.htm">Douglas Montgomery</a>, Industrial Engineering Department; George Poste, Biodesign Institute and School of Life Sciences; <a href="../200602/20060216_regents_prescott.htm">Edward Prescott</a>, Economics Department, <a href="20060331__regents_windhorst.htm">Rogier Windhorst</a>, Physics and Astronomy Department. </p>

        <p>This year ASU is honoring the first class of ASU President's Professors. This new prestigious award, is designed to reward enthusiasm and innovation in teaching, the ability to inspire original and creative work by students, mastery of subject matter and scholarly contributions.</p>
        <p> Inaugural awardees are <a href="20060309_cerveny.htm">Randall Cerveny</a>, professor of geography; Alice Christie, associate professor of technology and education; Ian Gould, professor of chemistry and biochemistry; and the late Paul Rothstein, associate professor of industrial design.</p>

</table><p align="left">Windhorst, a professor of physics and astronomy, realized in that meeting that a technology he uses to detect the oldest galaxies might have several important applications for saving lives on Earth. It took a meeting organized by the Office of the Vice President for Research and Economic Affairs to bring Windhorst together with a Valley doctor. </p>
<p align="left">Windhorst and his group had modified a software package that they had used since the 1990s to help discern images sent back from the Hubble Space Telescope, an orbiting telescope that can look back 95 percent of the way in time to the "dawn of the cosmos." The software is used to pinpoint specific galaxies that may be crowded </p>
<p align="left">together with many others. </p>
<p>"It's like taking a picture of a football stadium with 100,000 people in it, and you are trying to find just one person," he says. "The software does a 'de-blending' of objects where there may be overlapping, and it isolates them and counts them very accurately." </p>
<p>Richard Herman, director of the Clinical Neurobiology &amp; Bioengineering Research Center at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center in Phoenix, also was at that meeting. He needed something that could help him count C-fibers in skin biopsies. Herman had found that, by counting C-fibers in biopsies, he could detect the onset of Type II diabetes at a very early stage. </p>
<p>"He was bemoaning how hard it was to count all of the fibers to a high degree of accuracy," Windhorst recalls. "It was a solved problem for us. We counted galaxies that same basic way. So if Herman could give us an image, we would tinker with it to see if we could apply this software to his problem. It took some effort, but it does work." </p>
<p>It is these unexpected twists and turns that Windhorst, who recently was named a Regents Professor, intellectually lives for. Whether it is in his research, which focuses on cosmological questions such as the dawn of galaxies and black holes, or in his teaching to graduate and undergraduate students at ASU, it is the quest to confront the unknown - to figure it out and explain it - that gives him great satisfaction. </p>
<p>"I really like to make the best use of myself by exploring new things and getting my students involved in new areas," he says. </p>
<p>Windhorst's research has significantly added to our understanding of the universe and the reasons why it is the way it is. He has been one of the most consistently funded users of the Hubble Space Telescope, from which he obtains images to explore some of the most basic and fundamental questions about the structure of the universe. He is involved in upgrades to the Hubble and development of its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled for launch in 2013. </p>
<p>Windhorst's research has led to new understanding of how the universe first lit up with observable stars and galaxies. The process ended the so-called "re-ionization epoch" of hydrogen, which he says makes us live in a "refried universe" today. One of his students found that this re-ionization process was caused by an early epoch of galaxy formation. </p>
<p>Two recent Windhorst studies focused on huge black holes, among the most curious entities found in the universe. Black holes are so dense that nothing - not even light - can escape them. Windhorst's research aimed to determine how massive black holes became so large. They are found at the center of many galaxies, including our own Milky Way. </p>
<p>The work is based on some of the deepest views of the universe and provided compelling evidence that these monster black holes in the centers of galaxies were not born, but grew big over time through repeated galactic mergers - essentially eating other, smaller galaxies. </p>
<p>While considered a dense and complex topic, Windhorst explains it in very common terms. </p>
<p>"A black hole's typical mealtime lasts a few dozen million years," he says. "This is equivalent to black holes spending no more than 15 minutes per day eating all their food - a veritable fast food diet." </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Focus on students </strong></p>
<p>Windhorst puts his graduate students front and center in research projects, noting their involvement and accomplishments in the projects. His graduate students have found homes at the Caltech Observatory and Carnegie Observatory, both in Pasadena, Calif., and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. </p>
<p>"I take great pride in my students doing well," he says. </p>
<p>Windhorst teaches his undergraduate classes with equal vigor. In a field that can either quickly captivate the imagination or just as quickly lose a student in minutiae, Windhorst has found a few interesting twists can keep most any student involved. In teaching introductory AST111 (planets) and AST112 (stars and galaxies) classes, which students take to fulfill their science requirements, he has an end-of-semester project that challenges each of his students to prove that they have mastered one thing in their universe: the scientific method. </p>
<p>"We have a great debate on whether ET exists or not on the last day of class," Windhorst says. "You can argue either way, and there is only one rule for the debate. It is to use the scientific method. The student is not allowed to say: 'I believe in ET because I was beamed up, and they did experiments on me,' " Windhorst says. </p>
<p>Within that constraint, these non-science major students have shown a wide breadth and intellectual depth to many of their arguments. They debate about, among other things, advanced societies, space-faring beings, methods of interplanetary communication and the physical abilities to traverse huge amounts of space in relatively short periods of time, as well as societal sustainability. </p>
<p>One argument that popped up in a class focused on the most likely way to communicate with people of other planets - which would be through radio signals and would require development of radio telescopes. The argument touched on how radio telescopes were developed on Earth, and our society's flirtations with self-destruction. </p>
<p>Noting the physical constraints of radio signals and putting a 100-year limit on the lifetime of an advanced society that develops that technology, Windhorst says the students argued that "ETs could be like fireflies passing in the night." </p>
<p>"They will not likely see each other before obtaining the technology to destroy themselves," he says. "The debate along those lines can be argued in a fairly scientific way, and serves as another good reason not to have nuclear wars. We want ET to see us." </p>
