In our case, as demonstrated         by the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/asunews/university/fallenroll_081502.htm">quality         of the freshman class</a> we admitted for fall 2002, size is a consequence         of the quality of the education we provide. What distinguishes us from         other institutions is the extent of our capacity to attend to students         as individuals. </p>      <p> Traditional assumptions about teaching and learning are no longer adequate.         While listening to a professor lecturing&#8212;the &#8220;sage on the         stage&#8221;&#8212;is certainly a critical component of a university education,         it is but one element. Learning takes place around the clock, and not         only in classrooms, laboratories, and libraries. As educators, we must         take every advantage of both traditional methods and new approaches that         make students an intimate part of the research process and the creative         act, bringing an intensity to education that is often lacking. Regardless         of our approach or methodology, I propose an institutional commitment         to focus on the individual student.</p>      <p> <br>      </p></td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td align="left" valign="top"> <p>I lament the fact that in most fields teaching         methods have not changed over the past 30 years. We need to incorporate         new findings on the processes of learning and apply these to our classrooms.         We must take every advantage of the new media tools that are the product         of the technological advances of the past decade. These allow students         to learn individually and through collaboration with others, and to learn         at their own pace, sometimes exceeding the parameters of the course. </p>      <p><img src="images/Ed-Grad-Brochure-53.jpg" alt="Graduate Students" width="288" height="202" align="right">Consistent         with our commitment to focus on the individual is a commitment to enhancing         the undergraduate experience with learning in small groups. It has been         said that students sometimes learn as much from one another as they do         from their professors. ASU will facilitate mechanisms to structure education         in small clusters of students wherever practical. This does not mean no         large classes&#8212;on the contrary, large classes can be among the very         best. It means that these classes will be attended by groups of students         who are connected&#8212;students who are learning together. </p>      <p>In addition to facilitating a focus on the individual student, we must         ensure that those quintessential aspects of a university education&#8212;the         excitement of discovery, the craft of scholarly writing, the precision         of research, the appreciation for scientific method, the passion for a         discipline&#8212;become increasingly embedded in the learning process.       </p>      <p><img src="images/ASU-Nursing.jpg" alt="ASU College of Nursing student and faculty member" width="250" height="187" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">In         order to focus on the individual, Arizona State University must expand         and contract and redesign all at the same time. On the main campus we         need smaller and more focused programs, and we need more learning groups         within those programs. At the same time we must grow as a university,         so we must accelerate the development of new learner-centered programs         on the <a href="http://www.west.asu.edu/">West</a> and <a href="http://www.east.asu.edu/">East</a>         and <a href="http://www.asu.edu/xed/">downtown</a> campuses, each with         their own unique identity. In addition, we need to expand the size and         intensity of our learning environment for our highest-achieving students         so that they might infect us all with their irrepressible energy and enthusiasm.         To do this, we will do many things, but the following three are being         planned and will be implemented as soon as possible.<br>        &#8226; <a href="c5ex1.htm" class="indent">The         Polytechnic at ASU East</a><br>        &#8226; <a href="c5ex2.htm" class="indent">The &#8220;New College&#8221;         at ASU West</a><br>        &#8226; <a href="c5ex3.htm" class="indent">Barrett Honors College Expansion</a>       </p>      </td>    <td align="left" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>    <tr>     <td align="left" valign="bottom"><a href="c4.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom" class="indent"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="c6.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="c6.htm"><img src="images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
