  The following bibliography honors the Five Southeastern Tribes, the Cherokee,
  Chickasaw, Creek, Choctaw, and Seminole. Material is held in the Labriola Center
  and covers history of the tribe
  both
  before and after removal from their ancestral homelands in the southeast, feast
  of the Mississippi from Lake Michigan to Florida. They owned plantations, lived
  in frame houses, had governments with written constitutions, a public school
  system, a written language, and a newspaper,
  and some had black slaves. Their forced removal to Oklahoma
  was authorized by President Andrew Jackson with passage of the 1830 Indian Removal
  Act. The following bibliography includes basic reference materials along with
  both primary and secondary resources.

<p><strong>From the Labriola Reference Collection</strong></p>
<br> <p><em><strong>American Indian History</strong></em>, edited by Carole A. Barrett, 2 volumes. Pasadena,
  California: Salem Press, Inc., 2003.</p><br>
  <p>The volumes contain brief but useful information on Cherokee legal cases; the
  Choctaw Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek; Indian Removal; Seminole Wars; Trail
  of Tears; Chickasaw and the Battle of Fallen Timbers; <em>Cherokee Phoenix</em>, and
more.</p>
<br> <p><em><strong>American Indians: Answers to Today&#8217;s Questions</strong></em>, by Jack Utter. Second
  Edition, revised. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2001.</p><br>
  <p>Here is a volume that could be especially helpful to those just beginning Indian
  studies. It answers questions about federal &#8220;recognition,&#8221; treaties,
voting rights, trust land, hunting and fishing, economic issues, and more.</p>
<br> <p><em><strong>Encyclopedia of American Indian Contributions to the World: 15,000 Years
    of Inventions and Innovations</strong></em>, by Emory Dean Keoke and Kay Marie Porterfield.New
  York: Facts on File, 2002.</p><br>
  <p>The encyclopedia lists the many ways American Indians have contributed to the
  world&#8217;s common fund of knowledge. For example, the Cherokee can be credited
  with creating various indigestion medications, and sassafras, among others,
  while the Creek had lacrosse, the Choctaw, chewable dentifrices, and the Seminole
had a form of evaporative cooling.</p>
<br> <p><em><strong>Gale Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes</strong></em>, edited by Sharon Malinowski and
  Anna Sheets, 4 volumes. New York: Gale, 1998.</p><br>
  <p>Each tribe is introduced with a short history in addition to basic information
  on religion, language, house styles, subsistence, clothing and adornment, healing
  practices, tribal organization, current tribal issues, with a bibliography
for further reading. Organized by culture area.</p>

    by Wilcomb E. Washburn, vol. 4. Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution,
    1988.</p><br>
  <p>Here is a good deal of information on each of the tribes in addition to an
overall look at the Five Tribes as a unit.</p>
<br> <p><em><strong>Native America in the Twentieth Century: An Encyclopedia</strong></em>, edited by Mary B.
  Daves, et.al. New York: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1994.</p><br>

  about each of the five tribes, along with various political and policy issues.

<br> <p><em><strong>Notable Native Americans</strong></em>, edited by Sharon Malinowski. New York: Gale, 1995.</p><br>
  <p>Contains the bibliographies of both current and past individuals from the five
    tribes that had influence on the history, culture, and political life of
the people.</p>

      Indian Reservations</strong></em>, edited and compiled by Veronica E. Velarde Tiller. Albuquerque,
  New Mexico: BowArrow Publishing Company, 2005.</p><br>
  <p>In his preface to the current volume, Senator Daniel Inouye has written that &#8220;the
  economic conditions of Native people and their communities have been largely
  hidden from America&#8217;s awareness and in their place, stereotypes have
  thrived in the darkness of ignorance. Today, tribal governments are actively
  employing every conceivable means of revitalizing their economies, and this
  <em>Guide to Indian Country</em> is a valuable tool that will continue, as it has in
  the past, to dispel myths and to inform those who desire to work with Native
  people and their governments to achieve economic renaissance that is the birth
right of this nation&#8217;s First Americans.&#8221;</p>

    Tribes in Indian Territory</em>, Prepared by the Commission and Commissioner to the Five
  Civilized Tribes. Baltimore, MD: Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc., c1907 [reprinted
  2003].</p.></p><br>
  <p><p>The Dawes Commission sat out to abolish tribal governments of the Cherokee,
  Chickasaw, Creek, Choctaw, and Seminole, and to provide for allotment of land
  to tribal members. Application procedures were rigorous, which involved proof
  of blood and tribal affiliation, and thus became the basis for official identification
  of degrees of Indian blood among the five tribes. Original Final Rolls are
  housed in the National Archives. This printed work, however, is one of the
best sources for genealogical research. </p>
