Employees eligible for leaves of absence are those university personnel defined as members of the Academic Assembly under the <I>Academic Constitution</I> (see <A HREF="acd112-01.html">ACD 112&#150;01</A>, <I>&#147;Academic Constitution and Bylaws&#148;).</I>  To permit academic planning for the following year, an individual should <A HREF="provost_forms.html">apply for a leave of absence without pay</A> at the earliest possible date.  However, it is recognized that the need to request a leave to accommodate pregnancy or dependent care cannot always be anticipated.<P>A leave of absence without pay assures the faculty member or academic professional that following the expiration of the leave period, he or she may return to the university in the position he or she left as stated in the approval granted for the leave of absence.  If the position involves an administrative and a teaching, research, or other assignment, it is understood that for faculty only a teaching <A HREF="acd002.html#Appointment" TARGET="New">appointment</A> is being ensured upon return, unless the administrative, research, or other assignment is clearly set forth, approved, and authorized in advance of the leave period.  For academic professionals, a change in assignment but not in rank may be necessary.<P>A faculty member shall not accept a tenured or tenure-track position, nor shall an academic professional accept a comparable position, at another university while on leave from ASU.  If an individual accepts such a position, ASU will assume that the individual has terminated his or her employment at ASU, giving ASU the option of not offering a contract for the following year.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Notification Deadline</B></FONT><P>To permit planning for the following year, a faculty member or academic professional on academic- or fiscal-year leave of absence without pay must notify the <A HREF="acd002.html#departmentchair" TARGET="New">chair</A> and dean, by March 1 at the latest, if he or she plans (or does not plan) to return to ASU.  Failure to provide notice of return or to request an extension by March 1 may be interpreted as abandonment of the position. The same early notification policy applies to semester leaves of absence without pay.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Duration of Leave</B></FONT><P>Normally, periods of leave will be for a semester or academic year for faculty or academic professionals employed on an academic-year basis, or for the first or second six months of a fiscal year (providing no conflict occurs with a teaching or other assignment), or a fiscal year, July 1&#150;June 30, for those employed on a fiscal-year basis.  The leave of absence may be extended for an additional period, up to a maximum of two years under unusual circumstances, with prior approval and if it has no adverse effects upon academic planning.  Fiscal-year appointees do not accrue vacation time while on a leave of absence.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Effect on Promotion and the Probationary Period</B></FONT><P>The period of one year or less granted as a leave may be counted toward years of service for promotion and sabbatical leave when the leave is in the best interest of the faculty member and university; however, it does not assure a merit salary increase or other fiscal benefits of any kind.  A one-semester or one-year leave of absence granted for purely personal reasons having no significant relationship to the professional activity of the employee may be exempted from the <A HREF="acd002.html#ProbationaryAppointments" TARGET="New">probationary</A> period, if requested by the employee and deemed appropriate by the institution.  Such an exemption must be agreed to by both parties, in writing, at the time the leave is granted.  A one-semester or one-year leave granted for professional reasons, such as fellowships, visiting appointments, and research grants, will not interrupt the sequence of probationary years.  Any additional leaves during the probationary period may be exempted from the probationary period.  Such an exemption must be agreed to by both parties, in writing, at the time the leave is granted.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Benefits During Leave without Pay</B></FONT><P>In order to maintain group insurance coverage on any or all of the insurance plans (life, health, <A HREF="acd002.html#disability" TARGET="New">disability</A>, etc.) the employee must prepay the premiums in Human Resources (HR) for the year, or fraction thereof, that he or she is not on the payroll.  The state contribution does not apply while a person is on leave without pay, so the total health insurance premium must be prepaid.<P>A fiscal-year employee on leave of absence without pay will not accrue sick and vacation leave.<P>Employees who are members of the Arizona State Retirement Program will not earn service credit for a leave of absence without pay.  However, employees may purchase up to one year of service credit in an amount equal to the period of a leave of absence without pay if the leave is in the best interests of the university (i.e., the leave has a significant relationship to an employee&#146;s professional activities and is not for purely personal reasons).  Employees must contact the Arizona State Retirement System to apply for service credit purchases within 90 <A HREF="acd002.html#day">days</A> of returning from leave.<P>Tax-sheltered annuities are possible by payroll deduction only, so the insurance carrier should be advised of the hiatus in contributions during an absence.  If the annuity is with TIAA-CREF, no notice is required as TIAA-CREF contracts may be started or stopped at any time.<P>If payments are being made to a credit union by payroll deduction, for either savings or a loan, arrangements should be made directly with the credit union for continuation or cancellation of such payments since these cannot be handled by HR like insurance payments.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Family Medical Leave</B></FONT><P>Eligible faculty and academic professionals who desire leave for child care purposes within the first year after the birth, adoption, or placement of a <A HREF="acd002.html#child" TARGET="New">child</A> in the household; or to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent; or to receive care for their own serious health condition, must consult <A HREF="acd702-03.html">ACD 702&#150;03</A>, &#147;Family Leave,&#148; for entitlements and requirements under that policy.<P><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Procedure</B></FONT></CENTER><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><P>After granting leave without pay to a faculty member or academic professional, the administrator must submit a Personnel Action form (PAF) to Human Resources, placing the employee on leave-without-pay status.<P>Administrators, faculty members, and academic professionals are encouraged to contact the Human Resources Department for further, detailed information about leaves of absence.<P>&#160;<P><HR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">ACD</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="acd001.html">contact</A> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="provost.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160</BODY></HTML>
