<P>Baldry, Alfred Lys. <I>Sir John Everett Millais, His Art and Influence</I>.
London: Bell, 1899. PRB-794</P>

<P>Bandello, Matteo. <I>The Novels of Matteo Bandello, Bishop of Agen</I>.
First done into English prose and verse, by John Payne. 6 vols. London:
Printed for the Villon Society for private subscription and for private
circulation only, 1890. According to John Payne's introductory biographical
note, Matteo Bandello was the &quot;most celebrated novelist of the Italian
Renaissance period.&quot; His exact birth date is not known, but he was
probably born &quot;in the penultimate decade of the fifteenth century.&quot;
He acquired a knowledge of the world by traveling with his uncle, Fra Vincenzo
Bandello, General of the Dominican Order, &quot;through Italy, France,
Spain and Germany to inspect the convents of his order.&quot; His quiet
literary life in Milan was disrupted by the war between Spain and France,
and he had to take flight after the disastrous battle of Pavia, after which
the Imperialists burned his father's house, destroying many books and manuscripts.
Bandello never fully recovered from this destruction and after wandering
about Italy for a time, he decided to expatriate himself and settle in
France. Much of Banello's writings have been lost, but what remains, Payne
has translated into English. PRB-145</P>

<P>Barrington, Emilie Isabel. <I>G. F. Watts: Reminiscences</I>. New York:
Macmillan; London: Allen, 1905. Design for cover: Figure representing humanity
gazing upward from earth's orbit to the universe beyond, by Watts. Plates
accompanied by guard sheets with descriptive letterpress. The author notes
the difficulty of writing about someone soon after their death, and states
that to attempt to write &quot;an impartial criticism of one who was possessed
of such an unusual power of sympathy and of so much personal charm would
at any time be difficult; at this moment it would seem impossible. My object
in writing the following pages is to record accurately those things which
have reference to my huband's and my own personal friendship with Watts
during many years of his life--to give to the future a page of contemporary
history, which, though by no means exhaustive, is correct.&quot; PRB-97</P>

accompanied by guard sheet with descriptive letterpress. The Preface to
this work says that it is &quot;an endeavour to give both in letterpress
and illustrations a brief review of the artists who have painted under
the Pre-Raphaelite inspiration, and of the work which they have done.&quot;
The work deals only with pictorial art, omitting because of space considerations
information on sculpture and the decorative arts. This work contains seven

Rossetti shone, for the men and women who knew him, with the ambiguous
light of a red torch somewhere in a dense fog. And so he still shines for
me.&quot; PRB-63</P>

<P>Brown, Oliver Madox. <I>The Dwale Bluth, Hebditch's Legacy, and Other
Literary Remains of Oliver Madox-Brown</I>. 2 vols. William M. Rossetti
and F. Hueffer, ed. With a memoir and two portraits. London: Tinsley brothers,
1876. Contents: I: Memoir; A lament, by Philip Bourke Marston; Dwale Bluth;
Hebditch's legacy. II: Hebditch's legacy, cont.; The black swan; The yeth
hounds; Dismal Jemmy; Note of the plot of an Irish story; To all eternity,
and other stanzas and verses; The last story. The opening &quot;Memoir&quot;
states that a &quot;memoir of a youth who had not completed his twentieth
year,?who had been favourably circumstanced and lovingly nurtured,?who
had never so much as left for many weeks together the shelter of the paternal
roof,?who was studiously inclined, to the extent of wholly disregarding
other interests and enjoyments,?who, in fact, never encountered misfortune
until the one dire misfortune of his untimely end,?such a memoir cannot
be expected to contain incidents of exciting interest. A simple outline
of what he did, worthy of keeping his name in remembrance, may seem the
most rational form of memorial.&quot; The editors then recount Brown's
history, detailing especially his early painting career and his switch
to writing two years before his death. The biographical sketch is followed
by lament written by Brown's friend Philip Bourke Marston. The remainder
of these two volumes contain Brown's writings. PRB-144</P>
