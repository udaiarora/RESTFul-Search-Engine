        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>ABSTRACT</u></b></font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primary focus of my research topic is to determine what statistical relevance ?distance from a military installation? has on Air Force Recruitment.  My hypothesis is that the closer one lives from a military installation, the more familiar that person is with the military lifestyle; consequently, because of this familiarization, they are more prone to joining the military than those who live farther away.<br>
        <br>
        In order to prove (or disprove) my position, I have collected data from four primary sources.  The first source of data comes from the Air Force Recruitment Service.  This data are comprised simply of  Air Force enlistee ?Home of Records?, in other words, their place of residence when the joined the service.  I have Home of Record information from the Fiscal Years 2002, 2003, and 2004, which comprises of just over 100,000 records.<br>
        <br>
        My second source of data originates from the 2000 Census.  This information will be used to overlay demographic information relating to the recruit?s neighborhood.  Originally, I had hoped to use census block information.  Unfortunately, as I delved into the census data, I realized that the county information was the lowest level that reported the demographic information that I wanted; thus, county level information is what I will use.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) originated my third set of data which is primarily a Military Installation shapefile.  I utilized this shapefile as a starting point and compared it to the Department of Defense?s (DOD) list of ?Major Military Installations?.  After review of the list, I deleted those installations out of the shapefile that were not on the DOD?s list.<br>
        <br>
        My final data source will come from a survey targeted at recent Air Force recruits.  The survey will ask questions that will try to reflect the information contained in the census.  Upon comparison between the survey and the census information, hopefully, I will be able to state that the census information is not statistically different than the survey information.<br>
        <br>
        As for how I am going to utilize GIS in this study, I plan on utilizing GIS? geostatistical applications in addition to using it as a platform to visualize the statistical results.  Furthermore, GIS will be used extensively to join the information contained within BTS? Military Installation shapefile with the 2000 Census information.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        In the end, I aim on showing that distance to a military installation does matter when it comes to a recruit?s decision on joining the Air Force and illustrate the demographic patterns that are prone to enlistment.  Finally, I plan on overlaying the location of every Air Force recruitment facility and compare those locations to those ?ideal? locations as determined by my
        study.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
