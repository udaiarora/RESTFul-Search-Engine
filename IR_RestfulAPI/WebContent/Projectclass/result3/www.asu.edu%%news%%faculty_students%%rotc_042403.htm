      <h2>ROTC program gives cadets hands-on look at military life</h2>
      <p>        Black Hawk helicopters and M-16's aren't just being used 7,000 miles
        away - they're being used here in Arizona's own back yard. </p>
      <p>Cadets in
            ASU's ROTC program are being offered a chance to be trained with
        the same equipment used in Operation Iraqi Freedom with the added
          benefit of a structured academic program. This two- to four-year program
          allows students to engage in hands-on military experiences while earning
          three elective credits per semester.</p>
      <p>"We are developing the future leaders
          of the Army," said Major Herbert Chong, head of the ROTC department.
          "We like to think of ROTC as the
          best leadership course on campus."</p>
      <p>According to Chong, there are three
          core elements that ROTC is all about: fitness, academics, and leadership.
          To be an ROTC cadet is to go to a
          class twice a week, attend physical training up to three times a week
          at 6:30 a.m., go to a lab once a week and participate in other activities
          such as a field training exercise once a semester.</p>
      <p>The field training
          exercises allow cadets to participate in such war simulations as using
          M-16's, practicing land navigation techniques and
          undergoing other problem solving tests. </p>
      <p>The hands-on applied learning
          by "going out and doing various activities" is geography freshman Kymberly
          Boyer's favorite part of being in ROTC.
          According to Boyer, "It's a very fun, educational experience."</p>
      <p>Juan Tabora,
          an environmental technology management junior, served for eight years
          in the Army before joining ROTC and therefore was promoted
          to the 300, or junior, level. This is a critical year for Tabora, because
          this is the year when he undergoes more scrutiny.</p>
      <p>The better he does,
          the better his chances are at receiving his choice in what he wants
        to do in the army after graduation. He will be tested
          in such areas as academics, leadership and physical fitness.</p>
      <p>"ROTC gives
          you the leadership skills to be able to lead soldiers at a managerial
          level," Tabora said.</p>
      <p>Boyer is in her first year in the ROTC
          program but is no stranger to military service. She was part of JROTC
          her freshman year of high school,
          and has many family members that are in the military. However, she
        still learns by example from older cadets such as Tabora. </p>
      <p>"I look up to them
          and try and learn things from them," Boyer said. "I watched and listened
          in the beginning of the year when I didn't know
          what I was doing. It's all about setting goals for yourself. It's all
          about being committed."</p>
      <p>Tabora said that with respect to the war in Iraq,
          he feels prouder to be in the program. </p>
      <p>"We tend to think about our fellow soldiers a lot
          more. Like any other group or team, you get closer through adversity,"
          Tabora said.</p>
      <p>"I think
          the war has strengthened their commitment to what they're doing," Chong
          said.</p>
