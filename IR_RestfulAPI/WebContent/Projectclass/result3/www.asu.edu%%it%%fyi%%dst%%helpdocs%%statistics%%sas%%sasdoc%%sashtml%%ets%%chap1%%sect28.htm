<H2>Loan Analysis, Comparison, and Amortization  </H2>
<P>The LOAN procedure provides analysis and comparison
of mortgages and other installment loans.
The LOAN procedure includes the following features:
<P><UL>
<LI> contract terms for any number of different loans may be input
and various financing alternatives may be analyzed and compared
<LI> analysis of four different types of loan contracts including
   <UL>
<LI> fixed rate
<LI> adjustable rate
<LI> buydown rate
<LI> balloon payment
   </UL>
<LI> full control over adjustment terms for adjustable rate
loans: life caps, adjustment frequency,
and maximum and minimum rates
<LI> support for a wide variety of payment and compounding intervals
<LI> loan calculations can incorporate initialization costs,
discount points, down payments, and prepayments (uniform or lump-sum)
<LI> analysis of different rate adjustment scenarios for variable rate loans including
   <UL>
<LI> worst case
<LI> best case
<LI> fixed rate case
<LI> estimated case
   </UL>
<LI> can make loan comparisons at different points in time
<LI> can make loan comparisons at each analysis date on the basis
of five different economic criteria
   <UL>
<LI> present worth of cost (net present value of all payments to date)
<LI> true interest rate (internal rate of return to date)
<LI> current periodic payment
<LI> total interest paid to date
<LI> outstanding balance
   </UL>
<LI> can base loan comparisons on
either after-tax or before-tax analysis
<LI> reports best alternative when loans of equal amount are compared
<LI> amortization schedules for each loan contract
<LI> when starting date is specified, output shows
payment dates rather than just payment sequence numbers
<LI> can optionally print or output to SAS data sets the amortization schedules,
loan summaries, and loan comparison information
<LI> can specify rounding of payments to any number of decimal places
<P></UL>
<P>The MORTGAGE procedure
provides amortization schedules for fixed rate mortgages.
The MORTGAGE procedure has been superseded by the LOAN procedure
but is supported for compatibility with previous releases
of SAS/ETS software.
The MORTGAGE procedure includes the following features:
<P><UL>
<LI> fixed rate mortgage calculations and amortization schedules
<LI> loan amount, payment, interest rate, or length of loan
computed given the other three items
<LI> supports a wide variety of payment and compounding intervals
<LI> payment schedule with principal and interest division and
ending balance printed or output to a data set
