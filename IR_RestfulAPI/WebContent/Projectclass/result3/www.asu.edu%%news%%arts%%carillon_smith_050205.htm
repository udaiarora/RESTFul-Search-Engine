          <h2>Carillon finds champion in ASU&rsquo;s Smith</h2>
          <p> ASU&rsquo;s Judith Smith may be the answer for whom the bells toll. </p>
          <p> Smith, information specialist coordinator and chair of the ASU Carillon Society, is leading an effort to restore a carillon to its former glory at the Tempe campus. </p>
          <p> Many people don&rsquo;t know what a carillon is, let alone that ASU has one. Smith hopes to change that and let people see, hear and fully engage in the carillon experience. </p>
          <p> A standard carillon is set of cast-iron bells, located in a bell tower, connected to a keyboard for playing. In 1966, ASASU bought a carillon keyboard and a set of smaller, encased bells that was put into storage after a few short years. Smith, who learned about this purchase through old newspaper clippings, was immediately intrigued. She inquired about it and found it in December 2002. It had been sitting, forgotten, in a storage room in Matthews Center. </p>
          <p> Now the set is awaiting restoration at the Maas-Rowe Carillons Inc. factory, in Escondido, Calif., where it was built. In the meantime, Maas-Rowe loaned ASU a small carillon with no keyboard that chimed electronically through speakers on top of Matthews Hall. Last October, the speakers were stolen and ASU lost that music as well. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Many people would bring their lunches to this area, and to the Secret Garden, to enjoy the carillon music at noon,&rdquo; Smith says. &ldquo;When the speakers were stolen, it ruined a lot of lunch hours.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Smith has organized the Carillon Society and has raised money to restore the originally purchased carillon for display in the Memorial Union. Other supporters, such as alumni who were the original purchasers of the carillon and Bobby Freeman, the Arizona Diamondbacks organist, are on board the project. </p>
          <p>So far, $13,000 has been collected, but the ultimate goal is to reach $50,000. That will cover the cost of moving the carillon from California to Arizona, cleaning it and placing it in the MU in glass casings. It also will leave money to buy more bells and start projects once the carillon is ready to play.</p>
          <p> &ldquo;We hope to give scholarships to music students to play the carillon a few times a week,&rdquo; Smith says. </p>
          <p> She also is interested in using the carillon for weddings, special memorial occasions, commencement and concerts. She wants the carillon to become central to ASU in weekend concerts where people can view public art, stroll through the campus arboretum, bring a picnic and enjoy the music. </p>
          <p> Even though public fundraising may be a slow, hard process, Smith likes that no one person has funded the whole process. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Having everyone pitch in allows it to be a community project,&rdquo; Smith says. </p>
          <p> But she adds that the carillon group won&rsquo;t turn away anyone who wants to donate. </p>
          <p> There are two fundraisers that allow people to contribute to the Carillon Society. Arizona Diamondbacks tickets are being raffled in a drawing, courtesy of Freeman. The winner will receive four lower-level seat tickets and the opportunity to join Freeman in his organ booth during the seventh-inning stretch. The tickets for the raffle are $10 and are on sale at the Credit Union in the lower level of the Memorial Union until May 12, when the drawing will be held. </p>
          <p> Smith also has teamed up with jewelry designer Barbara Atkinson for an ongoing sale of handmade cast bells. They come in different sizes and styles, including pins, pendants and display bells. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;We have a lot of bell collectors that buy them,&rdquo; Smith says. </p>
          <p> For more information about both fundraisers, e-mail Smith at (jps.asu.edu) or visit the carillon Web site at (<a href="http:/asu.edu/carillon">asu.edu/carillon</a>). </p>
          <p> Smith has no plans to quit her volunteer work with the Carillon Society anytime soon. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;We need more bells, and then we need a bell tower and cast-bell carillon,&rdquo; Smith says. &ldquo;I believe in the project. I believe that when the carillon is back, the university community will fully realize how enriching it is to campus life.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Campbell, with Marketing &amp; Strategic Communications, can be reached at (480) 965-9370 or (lisa.campbell@asu.edu).</p>
