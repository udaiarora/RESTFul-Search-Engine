      <h2> Collaborate to improve teacher quality, report urges </h2>
      <p>TEMPE, Ariz.- Quality education rests largely on finding and keeping 
        good teachers. <br>
        A new study suggests that to improve teacher quality and address any teacher 
        shortages, colleges of education should work collaboratively with school 
        districts and community colleges in the recruitment, preparation, and 
        retention of K-12 teachers.</p>
      <p>"Recruiting, Preparing and Retaining High Quality Teachers: An Empirical 
        Synthesis," by Gerald W. Bracey of George Mason University and High/Scope 
        Foundation, and Alex Molnar of Arizona State University, published by 
        ASU's Education Policy Studies Laboratory, suggests that improving retention 
        rates for qualified teachers may be the best short-term solution for any 
        teacher shortage. </p>
      <p>Bracey and Molnar found that teachers leave the profession for a number 
        of reasons, including inadequate salaries, reduced teacher autonomy, and 
        pressures from high-stakes testing-factors that should be addressed if 
        retention rates are to be improved.</p>
      <p>The authors also found that defining the characteristics of high quality 
        teachers continues to be controversial. They found that no single characteristic, 
        such as content knowledge, verbal skills, or enthusiasm for learning, 
        necessarily marks a person as likely to be a "successful" teacher. </p>
      <p>According to the report, "The complexity of teaching and the long list 
        of possible indicators of quality suggest that there should be no single 
        model of teacher preparation." </p>
      <p>The report makes a number of recommendations: </p>
      <p><strong>Teacher Recruitment </strong></p>
      <p>&middot; Salaries matter-Colleges of Education should be strong and consistent 
        advocates for adequate teacher salaries. <br>
        &middot; Colleges of Education at four-year institutions of higher education 
        should seek to <br>
        establish collaborative programs with community colleges to recruit new 
        teachers. <br>
        Community colleges are preparing an increasing proportion of teachers 
        and they <br>
        enroll a large number of minority students. Four-year institutions, on 
        the other <br>
        hand, have expertise and connections not found in the community college 
        <br>
        environment. Partnerships would prove mutually beneficial. <br>
        &middot; Colleges of Education should establish programs to encourage 
        high school students to consider careers as teachers.</p>
      <p><strong>Teacher Preparation </strong></p>
      <p>&middot; Colleges of Education should seek to develop training programs 
        that reflect complex models of teacher quality. Research clearly shows 
        that teaching cannot be reduced to a few indicators of quality that transcend 
        all situational variations.</p>
      <p>&middot; Colleges of Education should seek to develop programs that will 
        ease the transition from the lecture hall to the classroom. Such programs 
        might well include beginning teacher induction programs that match new 
        teachers with experienced ones.</p>
      <p><strong>Teacher Retention </strong></p>
      <p>&middot; Colleges of Education should, in collaboration with school districts, 
        develop programs to improve the retention of existing teachers. Reducing 
        turnover of existing teachers would greatly reduce the difficulties in 
        finding new teachers. In the short term, this may be the single most effective 
        strategy for reducing the need for new teachers.</p>
      <p>The Education Policy Research Unit (EPRU) conducts original research, 
        provides independent analyses of research and policy documents, and facilitates 
        educational innovation. EPRU facilitates the work of leading academic 
        experts in a variety of disciplines to help inform the public debate about 
        education policy issues.</p>

      <p>The Education Policy Studies Laboratory (EPSL) at Arizona State University 
        offers high quality analyses of national education policy issues and provides 
        an analytical resource for educators, journalists, and citizens. It includes 
        the Commercialism in</p>
      <p>Education Research Unit (CERU), the Education Policy Analysis Archives 
        (EPAA), the Education Policy Reports Project (EPRP), the Education Policy 
        Research Unit (EPRU), and the Language Policy Research Unit (LPRU).</p>
