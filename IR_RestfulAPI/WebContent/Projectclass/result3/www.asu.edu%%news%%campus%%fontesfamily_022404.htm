      <h2>Fontes family continues expressing Sun Devil Pride </h2>
      <p align="left">Twenty-five to 30 percent of Nogales High School graduates go on to attend a four-year university, according to the Nogales Unified School District. The Fontes family has fought to improve these odds, producing a long line of college graduates and serving as an inspiration to others who want to pursue a higher education. Most importantly, they've all earned their degrees with Sun Devil pride. </p>
      <p align="left"><img src="campus_images/fontesfamily_022304.jpg" width="360" height="202" align="right">Norma (Fontes) Ahumada said her father, Florentino, always instilled the importance of education to his children and "encouraged us to continue studying." </p>
      <p align="left">Florentino and his wife, Artemisa raised their children (in birth order) Victor, Gene (deceased), Daniel, Norma, Robert and Jaime in the city of Nogales, Ariz. Artemisa was a housewife and Florentino, who once served as the city's mayor, worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad for 40 years and moonlighted as a custodian at the county courthouse for 17 years. </p>
      <p align="left">According to Norma, her father may have given the words of encouragement, but it was her older brother, Victor, who first set foot on ASU's campus and began a tradition her family is very proud of. </p>
      <p>"The college experience was completely foreign to us, as no one in the family had more than a high school education," says Norma, who received a bachelor of arts degree in elementary education, in 1974. "Once Victor took the initial step and was able to hold his own in college, Gene followed suit and so did the rest of us." </p>
      <p>Victor, who earned a bachelor of science degree in construction engineering in 1967, was the first Fontes family member to graduate from any university. He says choosing ASU was an easy decision. </p>
      <p>"I chose ASU because of better opportunities to find employment, which I needed to put myself through school," he says. "Attending a university within the larger metropolitan Phoenix area was very rewarding. I perceived a smaller environment like Tucson as restrictive." </p>
      <p>Victor's influence has had a tremendous effect on his family. Since Victor, there have been 12 family members who have followed his example and graduated from ASU. </p>
      <p>Victor's son, Adrian, earned a bachelor of arts degree in communication from ASU in 1998. He said a "strict" upbringing was the reason he decided to make ASU his home. </p>
      <p>"I chose ASU because I was brainwashed as a small child to believe that Wilbur (the University of Arizona mascot) was the root of all evil," he says jokingly. "But seriously, it seemed like there was never a doubt. Both my parents were avid Sun Devils, and there was always an unspoken assumption that ASU was the only choice. I had my ASU dormitory reservation completed when I was still a sophomore in high school." </p>
      <p>For the Fontes clan, the ASU experience was filled with diversity, opportunities and life-long friendships. It's an experience they continue to value today. </p>
      <p>"The circle of people that I met and friends that I made while at ASU were what I valued most," says Norma, who first began in the College of Business before transferring to the College of Education. "Many of them are Latinos from various cities and regions of Arizona. I learned quite a bit about the differences and similarities that we shared as Latinos raised in diverse environments." </p>
      <p>"What I enjoyed the most was meeting many different people from all over the United States and the world," says Dan, who got his master's degree from ASU in communication disorders in 1974. </p>
      <p>"I most enjoyed the energy of my peers and professors, like Dr. Kristin Valentine, Dr. Fred Corey and Dr. Jerry Buley," Adrian says. "They took my energy and helped me focus. I guess I most enjoyed knowing that these folks cared about their students." </p>
      <p>Just as Adrian found support through mentors among peers and professors, other students have found support through programs like Upward Bound, Hispanic Mother-Daughter Program and the Student Multicultural Center. These recruitment and retention efforts have helped ASU's enrollment climb to a record 57,543 students on all three campuses this fall, including the largest class of freshmen in history. This represents a 3.7 percent increase over last year's 55,491. </p>
      <p>Norma's son, Jaime, is a member of the freshmen class and the latest member of the Fontes family to roam the ASU campus as a student. Jaime, an architecture major, says there are many reasons he decided to attend ASU. </p>
      <p>"Aside from the fact that most of my family are or have been Sun Devils, I believe that it is a school that fits my needs and lifestyle," says Jaime, one of five members of the Fontes family currently enrolled at ASU. "Coming from a very close-knit family and not being accustomed to being away from home for a long period of time, I felt that it was wise to attend an in-state school. ASU is close enough that I can visit home." </p>
      <p>Attending college is a challenge for many people, financially and academically. Jaime says he is extremely proud and fortunate that he is continuing his family tradition. </p>
      <p>"I understand that many are unable to attend college for one reason or another and because of this realization I am very grateful toward my family who have always emphasized the importance of working hard and receiving an education." </p>
