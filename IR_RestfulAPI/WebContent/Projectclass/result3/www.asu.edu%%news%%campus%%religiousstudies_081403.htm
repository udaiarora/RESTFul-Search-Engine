      <h2>Religious studies department helps Arizona teachers, increases outreach</h2>
      <p>        With interest rising in the role of religion in public life around the
          globe, the ASU Religious Studies Department is helping Arizonans understand
        the roles different religions play in their own state.</p>
      <p>Current Arizona
            social studies standards require schools to give academic and objective
            instruction in major world religions. But most public school
          teachers have not been adequately trained to give such instruction,
        says David Damrel, religious studies professor. </p>
      <p>Damrel and the department
          hosted 45 middle-school teachers from around the state on July 25,
        for an outreach conference on "World Religions
          in Arizona Schools." The teachers were eager to find out how to teach
          their students about Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism
          and Sikhism. </p>
      <p>The conference also was sponsored by the ASU Center for
          the Study of Religion and Conflict and the Arizona Humanities Council. </p>
      <p>"There's been
          so much interest in this from around the state," says Damrel. "We weren't
          sure what to expect, but we had to put a ceiling on attendance
          as the conference filled up. Religion touches on the ways different
        cultures deal with big questions. We gave teachers classroom-ready lesson
        plans
          for teaching about religion in a school setting." </p>
      <p>The lesson plans were
          designed by the Arizona Geographic Alliance. Teachers of geography,
        English, history, art and social studies came from as far
          away as Chino Valley, Sierra Vista and Tucson.</p>
      <p>It's possible to teach
          about a religion, linking it to cultural traditions, music, art and
        literature, without advocating for the religion, Damrel
          says. Teachers can compare and contrast religions by categories: sacred
          texts, sources of authority and rules of behavior. </p>
      <p>"Our challenge is
          to think about ways of discussing and comparing religions without front-loading
          the discussion," he says. "Rumor, misinformation
          and the media shape our ideas about world religions, but this is too
          important to be left up to the media. It's a complicated subject, one
          that we need to approach in a responsible way."<br>
        Damrel, whose expertise is in Islam, made about 60 presentations in
          Valley classrooms in the weeks after the terrorist attacks of Sept.
          11, 2001,
          and has continued to work with high schools. </p>
      <p>Last year he received a
          grant from the Harvard "Pluralism Project" to develop a course called
          "World Religions in Arizona," documenting a broad
          range of Valley religious communities. </p>
      <p>His students in a pilot class
          last spring went out to churches, synagogues and mosques, conducted
        interviews and helped write histories on the communities.
          Owen Anderson, a community college teacher and an ASU religious studies
          graduate, also helped develop course materials. The results are online
          at (www.pluralism.org/affiliates/damrel/index.php).</p>
      <p>The department hopes
          to make it part of the regular class offerings. </p>
