Thurneisser was an adventurer
 and charlatan of the first order.  Born in Basle, he engaged
 in the fraudulent practice of trying to pay a debt by faking
 the alchemy of gold by gilding a block of lead.  When discovered,
 he was forced to leave town.  He travelled widely, settled in
 Berlin and began practicing medicine there.  He continued to
 indulge in questionable practices, such as prescribing costly
 drugs to the rich, including gold drops, tincture of pearls,
 and water of amythyst, as a way of enhancing his own fortune.
  He formed a cabinet of natural curiosities, including a large
 collection of dried plants and seeds, and grew many rare herbs.
  His writings are classed as astrological botany, and he advocated
 planting and harvesting according to the correct position of the
 planets and heavenly bodies.  He includes in his writings numerous
 diagrams, which are possibly horoscope charts, to give an
 indication of the course of an illness and possible herbal
 treatment.  His drawings or descriptions of plants are not
 always clear enough for precise identification.  This is the
 Latin version of his work, translated from the original German.
