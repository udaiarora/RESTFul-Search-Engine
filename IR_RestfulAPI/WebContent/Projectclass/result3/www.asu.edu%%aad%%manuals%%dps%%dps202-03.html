Complimentary alcohol may be provided by a host, so long as no state-appropriated funds are used to purchase alcoholic beverages.  In such instances, alcohol will be served by a Insurance Services-approved licensed university food service contractor pursuant to procedures and charges (e.g., labor, supplies) subject to approval by Insurance Services and the director of the Memorial Union if the food service provider is serving pursuant to the food service agreement relating to the Memorial Union, or other appropriate university official if the food service provider is serving pursuant to the public event food service agreement or other appropriate agreement.

The consumption of beer and wine is limited to ASU at Tempe campus parking lots only, and is subject to such restrictions and limitations as ASU DPS may impose from time to time. All tailgate party attendees are required to comply with the instructions of ASU DPS officials. The consumption of beer and wine at tailgate parties in accordance with this section does not require a permit. The provision and/or service of alcohol to more than 20 guests, however, requires a permit. The sale of alcoholic beverages at tailgate parties is prohibited unless otherwise specifically approved by the president pursuant to this policy.<p><img src="dpshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Exceptions</b></font></center><img src="dpshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>Any exceptions to this policy must be approved by the president.
