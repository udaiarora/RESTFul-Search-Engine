      <h2 align="left"><strong>Roundtable Explores Technology Solutions for Bio-Terrorism Issues </strong></h2>
      <p align="center">A research center at Arizona State University (ASU) has assembled a group of state and county health officials and representatives of the technology industry to discuss issues related to bioterrorism and methods available to efficiently utilize current technologies within this area. </p>
      <p>The Center for Advancing Business though Information Technology (CABIT) at the W. P. Carey School of Business is hosting the roundtable discussion on Friday, April 30 from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Memorial Union on ASU's Tempe campus. Cisco Systems is co-sponsoring the event. Panelists include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>David Englethaler, chief of the Office of Public Health, Emergency Preparedness and Response, Arizona Department of Health Services </li>
        <li>Lori Bush, senior advisor for homeland security, Cisco Systems </li>
        <li>Govind Iyer, professor, W. P. Carey School and co-principal investigator, Maricopa County Department of Public Health Bio-Terrorism Surveillance Project </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Following initial comments by the panelists, Harvey Shrednick, CABIT Partnership Development Coordinator, will moderate an open discussion involving attendees and the panelists, drawing in perspectives from the public sector, private sector and academic orientation. </p>
      <p>Roundtable participants representing the government/public sector will include staff from the Maricopa County Department of Public Health and the Arizona Department of Health Services, and members of the Arizona State Chief Information Officer Council. Additionally, CABIT has invited participants from its partner organizations in the private sector. Completing the group will be researchers and faculty from the W. P. Carey School of Business. </p>
      <p>"Given the national concern about the risk of bio-terrorism, we at CABIT feel an obligation to help raise the level of awareness of the technology issues involved in responding to this kind of incident," said Ajay Vinze, center director and professor of information systems at the W. P. Carey School. "The timing is right for CABIT to host this event because of our current engagement with public health organizations at the county and state level on projects focused on emergency preparedness and response." </p>
      <p>CABIT and the Maricopa Department of Public Health are presently engaged in a needs and capabilities assessment related to the bio-terrorism surveillance system at the county level. The CABIT effort focuses on data management practices and communications/connectivity issues. The study, which is funded by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control, includes an examination of similar measures implemented throughout Arizona by the state. </p>
      <p>The CABIT team includes: Professors Ajay Vinze, Govind Iyer and Philip M. J. Reckers and Harvey Shrednick in the role of co-principal investigators, and Orneita Burton (Ph.D. Candidate), Dr. Minu Ipe and Professor Sury Ravindran as researchers. Findings from this project are scheduled to be completed and reported in early May. </p>
      <p>The Center for the Advancement of Business through Information Technology was founded in 2002 to advance the W. P. Carey School's commitment to information technology in management education. Through its research partnerships with industry, government and other university units, CABIT facilitates technology transfer of knowledge management and software service innovations in the e-business environment. </p>
