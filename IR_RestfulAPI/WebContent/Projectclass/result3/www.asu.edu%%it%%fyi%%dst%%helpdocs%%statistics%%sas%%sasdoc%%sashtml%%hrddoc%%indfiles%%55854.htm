Take the guesswork out of selecting a statistical technique for social     science data! This guide will help you select from the vast array of
statistical techniques that can be applied in a particular analysis.       This guide addresses social scientists, data analysts, and graduate
students who have some knowledge of social science statistics and who      want a systematic, highly condensed overview of many of the statistical
techniques in current use and the purposes for which each is intended.     Originally published in 1971, this guide has been updated to incorporate
current statistical and analytical developments. In addition, you'll       find a summary of how each of the techniques is provided through SAS
software.
