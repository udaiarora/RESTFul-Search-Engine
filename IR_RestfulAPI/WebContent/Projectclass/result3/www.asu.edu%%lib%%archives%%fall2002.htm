     Iverson&#8217;s Navajo History</strong></font> - <strong>Due 
      Soon in Bookstores</strong> 
      <p> <hr>
	  <a name=IVERSON>Peter Iverson</a>, Regents Professor of History at Arizona State University, 
        has completed a comprehensive history of the Navajo: <em>Din&eacute; A 
        History of the Navajos</em>. The book also features photographs by Navajo 
        photographer, Monty Roessel.
<p>
        Iverson writes that Navajo identity is rooted in land, which is bordered 
        by the four sacred mountains. At the same time the people have successfully 
        incorporated new elements and new ways of doing things to their culture. 
        The author includes major themes and events of the twentieth century, 
        including political leadership, livestock reduction, Code Talkers, schools, 
        health care, government, economic development, the arts, and athletics.
      <p> Iverson&#8217;s second book, <em>For Our Navajo People Din&eacute; Letters, 
        Speeches, and Petitions, 1900-1960</em>, reproduces one hundred documents 
        written by prominent Navajo leaders, including Chee Dodge, and Annie Wauneka; 
        spokespersons such as Howard Gorman; students at boarding schools; World 
        War II soldiers; and members of the Native American Church. The book celebrates 
        the resilience of the Din&eacute; and honors the men, women, and children 
        who built the Navajo Nation.</p>
      <p>Both books are published by the University of New Mexico Press. </p>

      <p>
      Joyce Kievit (Eastern Cherokee) comes to ASU from the University of Houston, 
      as the new editor of H-AmIndian. She replaces Justina Parsons-Bernstein, 
      who has taken the position, Coordinator of the Cultural Forum, at the University 
      of Oregon in Eugene.<p>
      Dr. Kievit has long been interested in American Indian History and retains 
      ties with the American Indian Community. She wrote her Master&#8217;s thesis 
      on the Cherokee Nation during the Civil War for the University of Houston, 
      Clear Lake, receiving that degree in 1992. She defended her dissertation, 
      &#8220;Trail of Tears to Veil of Tears: The Impact of Removal on Reconstruction 
      in Indian Territory,&#8221; at the University of Houston in April 2002.
      <p> In addition to experience as a web developer and researcher, she has 
        received a number of awards for her scholarship. She has published biographical 
        entries in <em>Native American Women: A Biographical Dictionary</em> (Garland, 
        1993 and 2001) and <em>Handbook of American Women&#8217;s History</em> 
        (Sage, 2000).
<p>
      Dr. Kievit is currently working on an entry for a volume for ABC-CLIO, &#8220;The 
      Experience of Native Americans During the Second World War.&#8221;

	<a name=LAURA><strong><font size="+1">Laura Tohe Interviews on WBUR</font></strong> </a>
      <p>
      NPR Station, WBUR Boston, called to see if the Labriola Center could recommend 
      a guest reviewer to participate in a discussion on the much talked-about 
      movie, on Navajo Code Talkers, Windtalkers. We suggested Laura Tohe (Navajo), 
      Associate Professor of English here at ASU, and she graciously agreed to 
      take part in the program, &#8220;Here and Now&#8221;on June 21, 2002. Tohe 
      was a particularly good choice since she is fluent in the Navajo language 
      and could talk about her father who was a Code Talker. During the interview, 
      she noted that she was happy to hear the Navajo language spoken in the movie, 
      and was quite impressed with the Navajo actor, Roger Willie. Participants 
      in the discussion agreed that the Code Talker story was submerged by many 
      battle scenes.<p>
      The interview is available in the Labriola Center on CD-ROM. The call number 
      is LAB EPH IG-19.11.
      <p> Tohe is author of <em>No Parole Today</em> (West End Press, 1999) and 
        Editor with Heid E. Erdich of <em>Sister Nations: Native American Women

      <p> The Marine Corps Navajo 
        Code Talker Program was established in September 1942. At that time, few 
        people outside of the reservation spoke the Navajo language, and it was 
        expected that it would be completely unintelligible to an outsider and 
        could successfully be used as a code to transmit secret messages (the 
        Choctaw language had been used as a code during World War I).
      <p> The experiment was successful and by the end of World War II there were 
        some 400 active Navajo code talkers in the Pacific Campaign. They were 
        instrumental in almost every Marine action in the Pacific from Guadalcanal 
        to Okinawa in 1945. To this day, it remains the only un- broken code ever 
        used in the history of war. 
      <p> The Labriola Center is pleased to add a CD-ROM from the History and 
        Museums Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps, Washington, D. C., 
        containing now declassified information on the formation of the Code Talker 
        Program: <em>Navajo Code Talkers: Oral History Collection</em>. Call Number 
        is D810.I5 M37.

          1945.</li>

          with eight Code Talkers: Sidney Bedoni, Alex Williams, Jimmy King, Sr., 
          Wilfred Billey, Carl Gorman, Paul Blatchford, John Benally, and W. Dean 
          Wilson. There is an index to the 172 pages recorded on the disk.</li>
        <li> Third, is correspondence dealing with the recruitment and training 
          of the Navajo Code Talkers, most dated from 1943.</li>

      The guide describes 269 titles, which include community newsletters, school

      interviews was conducted in the late 1960s and early 1970s with Plains Indians 
      and those non-Indians working with them. The original collection, part of 
      the American Indian Research Project, is housed in the library of the University 
      of South Dakota, Vermillion.
