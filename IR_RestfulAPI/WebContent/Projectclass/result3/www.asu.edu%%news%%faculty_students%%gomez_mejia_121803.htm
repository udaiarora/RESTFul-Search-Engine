      <h2>        Distinguished management scholar at W. P. Carey School of
        Business; Luis Gomez-Mejia receives University of Minnesota's highest
        alumni honor</h2>
      <p>Luis Gomez-Mejia, a management professor at the W. P. Carey School of
        Business at Arizona State University, will be honored by the University
        of Minnesota with its highest alumni accolade: the Outstanding Achievement
        Award. The award, which recognizes Gomez-Mejia for his professional achievement
        as a management scholar, will be presented at a celebration at the Phoenician,
        6000 E. Camelback Road, Scottsdale, on Feb. 19 at 6 p.m.</p>
      <p>"It would probably
          be impossible to identify an academic educated during the last 25 years
          in the Ph.D. program based in the Carlson School who
          has accomplished more in a career than Luis Gomez-Mejia," said John
        Fossum, professor of human resources and industrial relations at the
        Carlson
          School. "His record is replete with accomplishments and successes." </p>
      <p>Gomez-Mejia,
          recognized internationally for his scholarship and leadership in the
          management discipline, is a Dean's Council of 100 Scholar at the
          W. P. Carey School and holds the Horace Steele Arizona Heritage Chair
          - one of the highest honors awarded by Arizona State University. In
        November 2003 he was also named a Regents Scholar, a title presented
        by the Arizona
          Board of Regents to the most distinguished professors at the three
        state universities. </p>
      <p>Gomez-Mejia's research explores macro human resource management
          with a focus on executive compensation, high technology compensation,
          and
          compensation strategies. He has been named the most productive researcher
          in the management discipline by the Academy of Management Journal(AMJ)
          - the leading empirical journal in the field, as is one of just 33
        scholars chosen from the Academy of Management's 13,500 members for the
        organization's
          Hall of Fame. <br>
        <br>
        Dr. Gomez-Mejia has served two terms on the AMJ editorial board. In
          total he has published more than 120 papers, including "Determinants
          of Faculty
          Pay," which was judged the best article published in 1992 in the AMJ.</p>
      <p>Gomez-Mejia
            has also authored, co-authored or edited 21 books, including a leading
            text in human resource management and texts in Spanish for
          European and Latin American markets. Additionally, he is the founder
          and president of the Ibero-American Academy of Management, which has
          become the catalyst for creating a community of management scholars
        among faculty and students at business schools in Spain, Portugal, Latin
        America
          and South America. His service contributions at Arizona State University
          and the Human Resource Division of the Academy of Management are also
          extensive.</p>
      <p>"The management department at the W. P. Carey School of Business
          has made great strides toward becoming a top 20 leader in research
        and education
          that develops and promotes effective managerial practices," said William
          Glick, chairman. "Luis has contributed tremendously through his research,
          teaching, and service. His productivity contributed greatly to the
        department's third-place international ranking in premier management
        journals and
          he has received numerous outstanding service awards for his leadership
          roles in the major associations of the field."</p>
      <p>Gomez-Mejia has taught
          at the Carlson School of Management, Hamline University, Mankato State
          University, University of Florida, and the University of
          Colorado at Boulder. He has been on the faculty at the W. P. Carey
        School at Arizona State University since 1989. He graduated summa cum
        laude
          from the University of Minnesota's College of Liberal Arts with a bachelor's
          degree in economics and received his masters and doctorate at the Carlson
          School in industrial relations in 1974 and 1981, respectively.</p>
