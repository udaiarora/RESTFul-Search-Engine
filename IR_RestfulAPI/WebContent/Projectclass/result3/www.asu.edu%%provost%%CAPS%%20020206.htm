<h2><b>Minutes of Meeting</b></h2>

      </font></font> 
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">February 6, 2002</font></b> 
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members Present: Patricia Feldman, 
        Stefan Myhajlenko, Carol Behl, Santos C. Vega.<br>
        Members Absent/Excused: Linda Shackle, Annie Platoff</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Agenda included: Review 
        and approval of minutes from 12/5/01 There having been no meeting in January; 
        Continue discussion of CAPs speakers for Spring 2002; Old business; New 
        business; Plan next meeting, and Adjourn. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patricia Feldman, Chair, called 
        the meeting to order.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Review and Approve Minutes. 
        Members present reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting. It was decided 
        that the minutes were to be corrected at a later time by Annie Platoff, 
        CAPs secretary, and sent out later. Carol Behl moved to approve the minutes 
        with the changes Annie will make. Motion passed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Discussion of CAPs speakers. 
        Discussion on CAPs speakers for spring 2002 ensued. Ms. Barbara Mawhiney, 
        Director of Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Office, ASU agreed to 
        speak on April 3rd, 2002 on Job classification system. The time scheduled 
        is 10:30 - 11:30. Carol Behl pointed out that Pre-registration was on 
        the same day and that she would not attend and possibly others needing 
        the information would also not be able to attend. Discussion followed 
        with the result that April 3rd was not approved as a feasible date. Other 
        dates were proposed. Patty Feldman agreed to investigate room availability 
        with a possible change to Pinal room, which is larger and holds more persons. 
        She would approach Ms. Mawhiney for availability on a different date. 
        Committee members agreed to allow Patty to probe and make the appropriate 
        decision. Carol Behl will approach Linda Shackle on use of name rosters 
        for publicizing the Speaker's event. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New Business. It was discussed 
        that Annie Platoff would move to UCSB in May. In addition, new CAPs members 
        would be needed for next year's elections. It was recommended that CAPs 
        members search for possible APs for the elections. <br>
        The next CAPs meeting was planned. It was decided to ascertain the remaining 
        times of the CAPs members' terms. It was decided to draw up an executive 
        summary of Barbara Mawhiney's presentation and place it on the CAPs web-site. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next CAPs meetiings will 
        be March 6th, April on Speakers Day, May 1st, and June 5th.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Old Business. Under Old business: 
        Ms. Feldman presented a copy of the memorandum she had mailed to Dr. Morton 
        Munk, President of the Academic Senate. The subject of the memorandum 
        was the &quot;Request for Academic Associate Voting Rights. Dr. Munk had 
        not yet responded to the memorandum. In regards to the letter sent out 
        to Dr. Munk and his failure to respond, it was decided that Patty would 
        attend the Committee on Committees meeting on Feb. 8, 02 and bring up 
        the issue, again. Also, Patty planned to bring up the pending replacement 
        of Annie Platoff, if necessary, with Darby Shaw, secretary of Committee 
        on Committees.</font></p>
