      <h2>Presidents share vision of higher education</h2>
      <p> The presidents of Arizona's three universities and the Arizona Board 
        of Regents (ABOR) are sharing their vision of how the Regents' Changing 
        Directions initiative will enhance the future of higher education in Arizona.</p>
      <p>On Jan. 6 the three presidents, and ABOR President Jack Jewett, participated 
        on a panel discussion hosted by the University of Arizona Foundation at 
        the Phoenix Country Club. The audience included club members, university 
        donors, and other supporters of higher education. </p>
      <p>Crow said, "Changing Directions is an immense opportunity for the university 
        system to mature to a level of greatness that is not only possible, but 
        doable at this time."<br>
        He said the process is enabling the universities to grow up and take responsibility 
        for their own destinies, moving from the notion of squabbling siblings 
        fighting over limited resources to becoming adults, each with its own 
        identity.</p>
      <p>"We must distance ourselves from an agency model and move toward an enterprise 
        model, where we are energetic, quick, responsive and adaptive," Crow said.</p>
      <p>The most pressing areas of focus are tuition, admission issues and creating 
        individual identities for each institution. </p>
      <p>University of Arizona President Pete Likens said, "The Arizona university 
        system is in jeopardy without significant change. You often can improve 
        utilization of resources by relaxing the rules that bind us to be more 
        alike than different."</p>
      <p>Likens said the presidents recognize they are a team and are committed 
        to working together to ensure each individual university is most successful, 
        which, in turn, results in the entire system becoming more successful.</p>
      <p>Together, the presidents are determined to improve financial access to 
        a university education in Arizona. Currently, there is no substantial 
        financial aid policy in Arizona. The regents have indicated a significant 
        tuition increase is needed to dramatically ramp up financial aid for qualified 
        students. </p>
      <p>On Jan. 10, the Arizona Board of Regents and the three university presidents 
        met, via closed-circuit television, with State Board of Education leaders 
        for the first of several planned joint meetings. Educators vowed greater 
        efforts to enhance collective collaboration and ingenuity as a way to 
        strengthen education statewide.<br>
        State Board of Education Vice President Wade McLean said he believes the 
        two-way communication between K-12 and higher education officials could 
        offer valuable solutions to teachers in elementary and secondary education 
        to better prepare school children for college-level courses. </p>
      <p>The question and answer session was designed to communicate to State 
        Board of Education officials the significant changes underway within the 
        Arizona University System. The Regents' Changing Directions Initiative, 
        which seeks to loosen operation constraints for universities, was at the 
        forefront of the conversation. </p>
      <p>ABOR President Jack Jewett told the state education leaders that its 
        Changing Directions initiative was born out of a necessity to address 
        the state legislature's reduced investment in education. He said as the 
        board contemplates significant tuition increases in March, it will, for 
        the first time, be addressing financial aid as part of the process. He 
        asked State Board of Education members, including Superintendent of Public 
        Instruction Tom Horne, to support the tuition increase.</p>
      <p>ASU President Michael Crow detailed his vision for transforming ASU into 
        "the greatest comprehensive metropolitan research university in the nation." 
        He said the university would embrace the notion of size and would work 
        proactively to make growth an asset rather than a deterrent. Through the 
        Changing Directions Initiative ASU's multi-campus institution will increase 
        its graduation rates because students will be matched to programs in which 
        they can achieve success.</p>
      <p>Crow told the crowd of about 50 that ASU will seek ways in which students 
        in substantive subjects could become teacher certified while obtaining 
        their degree in other areas. Horne praised Crow for addressing the current 
        state teacher shortage and encouraged Arizona's other universities to 
        pursue similar programs.</p>
