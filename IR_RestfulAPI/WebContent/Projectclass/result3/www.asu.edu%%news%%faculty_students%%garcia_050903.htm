      <p><font size="3"><strong>Garcia joins President's Working Group as vice president for University-School
        Partnerships </strong></font></p>
      <p>To focus university resources on bolstering Arizona's
          public schools, ASU President Michael Crow has appointed Eugene Garcia
          as vice president
            for university-school partnerships. The appointment is pending approval
      from the Arizona Board of Regents in June.</p>
      <p>Garcia will continue to serve
            as dean of the College of Education on Main Campus and also will
        ensure that all segments of the university
          are engaged in these vital efforts. In his newly created vice presidential
          position, he will become part of the President's Working Group, reporting
          to Executive Vice President and Provost Milton Glick. </p>
      <p>President Crow,
          because of his experience as a new member of the State Board of Education,
          has become more aware than ever of the importance
          of having Arizona's schools, from preschool through high school, achieve
          success.</p>
      <p>"I am convinced that ASU must take a much stronger, more visible
          role in making a difference in the critically important agenda of making
          the
          state's public education system as strong as possible," Crow said.
        "The entire university must become part of the solutions that ensure
        educational
          success; we must aggressively lead these efforts.</p>
      <p>"Already the education
          faculty and other faculty on all three campuses are engaged in innovative,
          responsive initiatives. It is our intent to
          expand these efforts even more broadly and deeply. Further, Dean Michael
          Awender and Dean Garcia are co-chairmen for the ASU Education Initiatives
          and Solutions Council, which includes faculty, school administrators
          and teachers, and leading members of the business and non-for-profit
          community."</p>
      <p>In strengthening pre-K/12 education, ASU has four primary
          goals - develop high quality teachers; develop strong school leaders;
          create early interventions,
          by drawing on faculty and data from multiple disciplines; and build
        on linkages with schools and the private sector for the distribution
        of
          fiscal and human resources.</p>
      <p>"These goals must be represented at the highest
          levels of the university," said Crow. "Dr. Garcia will continue his
        direct oversight as dean of
          the College of Education while engaging the rest of the university
        in working with pre-K/12 and private sector partners to create, support
          and sustain efforts enhancing the goal of high academic performance
        for
          all of Arizona students."</p>
      <p>Garcia said he shares Crow's vision that ASU
          can play a critical role in meeting Arizona's educational challenges.</p>
      <p>"These challenges are diverse,
          from serving our youngest children, preparing and retaining the best
          professionals, to engaging the community in producing
          the best research and evaluation so we know what will work," said Garcia.
          "ASU can help in responding to these challenges. I am pleased to lead
        such an effort." </p>
      <p>Before becoming dean of ASU's College of Education last
          July, Garcia had served as dean of the Graduate School of Education
        at University
          of California, Berkeley, as well as a senior officer in the U.S. Department
          of Education and dean of the Division of Social Sciences at UC Santa
        Cruz. </p>
      <p>"Education was our founding mission and must continue to be at
          the forefront of what we are doing today and in the future," said Crow.
          "We are pleased
          that we have someone of Dr. Garcia's stature and extensive experience
        to lead the charge." </p>
