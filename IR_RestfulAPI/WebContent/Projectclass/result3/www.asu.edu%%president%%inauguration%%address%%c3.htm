Not only         do universities train new generations of scientists, artists, educators,         and leaders in business, industry, and government, university research         enables entire industries to emerge and evolve. Research universities         offer a considerable return on investment, and bring billions of dollars         into their regional economies. </p>      <p> As we move&#8212;fiscally, psychologically, emotionally&#8212;away from         the paradigm that Arizona State University is only an agency of the state         government, we must move towards a paradigm that casts the university         as an enterprise responsible for its own fate, an enterprise which the         state government charters and empowers, and in which it invests. </p>      <p> We must commit ourselves to exploring the entrepreneurial potential         of university teaching and research. ASU faculty members engage in path-breaking         research, developing new learning tools and new products with commercial         application, all of which have the capacity to generate new revenues for         the university. ASU must capitalize on its knowledge content and intellectual         property, expediting the transfer of knowledge and technology developed         in our classrooms and laboratories to the commercial sector. </p>      <p> ASU must aggressively seek new revenue streams, fully exploring the         potential of university research to bring a higher return on resources         invested by the state. ASU must develop a competitive research infrastructure         that draws faculty of national prominence. Leading scholars attract the         federal funding that is currently available for research in such areas         as the life sciences. </p>      <p> I would like to see ASU develop a reputation for its entrepreneurial         boldness. The enterprise imperative must become a part of our culture.         But moving from the agency model to an enterprise model will take many         years to accomplish. Our approach is to begin immediately by investing         in initiatives that help move us in this direction. </p></td>    <td width="20%" valign="top" class="indent"> &nbsp;      <!-- begin table containing example urls and image -->      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="145" align="right">        <tr>           <td colspan="4" valign="bottom" width="145"><img src="images/examples_top.jpg" alt="Examples" width="145" height="21" border="0"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td background="images/examples_left.gif" width="1"><img src="images/i.gif" width="2" height="1" alt=""></td>          <td><img src="images/i.gif" width="2" height="1" alt=""></td>          <td valign="top" width="130"> <table width="120" border="0" align="left" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">              <tr>                 <td> <p class="examples"><a href="c3ex1.htm" class="nodecor">Arizona Biodesign                     Institute at Arizona State University</a></p>                  <p><a href="c3ex1.htm"><img src="images/AZBio-buildingTN.jpg" alt="AZ Biodesign Building" width="111" height="130" border="0"></a>                   </p></td>              </tr>            </table></td>          <td background="images/examples_right.jpg" width="12" align="left"><img src="images/i.gif" width="13" height="1" alt=""></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="4" valign="top" width="145"><img src="images/examples_bottom.jpg" alt="" width="145" height="21" border="0"></td>        </tr>      </table>          </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="61%" align="left" valign="bottom"><a href="c2.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom" class="indent"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="c4.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="c4.htm"><img src="images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
