The Department of English?s <i>Stretch Program</i></font></b>
<p><b>The Problem</b>
<p>During the years leading up to 1987, ASU?s Department of English had
a major problem: too many students were failing the required ENG 101 and
102 courses (which sometimes were identified as ?killer courses?).
<p>No one seemed to know how to help more students succeed, so many students
failed and left the university.&nbsp; This failure/retention problem was
especially acute for those writers labeled as ?basic writers??students
who had little academic writing experience in high school, who enrolled
with low test scores and academic deficiencies, or who otherwise were seen
as ?at risk? in their university studies.
<p>The university tried a number of approaches to try to help these students,
finally in 1987 asking a local community college to teach ENG 071, a ?remedial?
basic writing class, on the ASU campus.&nbsp; Based on placement information
from the Provost?s Office, about 20 percent of first-year students were
placed into ENG 071.&nbsp; The hope was that such a class would better
prepare ASU students for the academic writing they would be asked to do
for their ENG 101 and 102 classes.
<p>The results were dismal:
<ul>
<li>
ASU controlled neither the curriculum nor hired the instructors</li>

<li>
class size sometimes jumped to 35 or more students</li>

<li>
the course was labeled ?remedial,? and students received no college credit
for it</li>

<li>
the pedagogy focused on grammar drills and workbook exercises, rather than
actual writing</li>
</ul>

<p><br>The percentage of students passing ENG 071 leveled-off at only 66
percent.&nbsp; Worse, not all of those who managed to pass ENG 071 continued
on to ENG 101, and many of those who did enroll in ENG 101 did not pass
that class . . . and often left the university.
<p>In the end, of every 1,000 new students who took ENG 071, less than
half (46 percent) managed to successfully complete ENG 101, and of those
460 students who did pass, only 280 remained at ASU to register for ENG
102?a ?loss rate? of almost 75 percent.
<p><b>An Original, Unique Solution</b>
<p>In the 1991-92 academic year, Director of Composition David Schwalm
and future Director of Composition John Ramage designed and then piloted
two versions of what they called the<i> Stretch Program</i>, ultimately
deciding ? based on that pilot project ? that what ASU?s basic writing
students needed was more time and more experience at constructing full-length,
college-level writing assignments.&nbsp; The <i>Stretch Program </i>was
subsequently proposed and approved by the university and the Department
of English.
<p>While many universities still had (and still have) community colleges
teaching their basic writing students, the <i>Stretch </i>model was unique
to ASU.&nbsp; The first class of the <i>Stretch </i>sequence was called
WAC 101 (?Writing Across the Curriculum?) to reflect John Ramage?s involvement
as director of ASU?s Writing Across the Curriculum program, and students
received ASU elective credit for passing the class.&nbsp; Students who
passed WAC 101 then enrolled in ENG 101 the following semester, usually
with the same teacher and same group of students.&nbsp; The <i>Stretch</i>
pilot (and other studies) demonstrate that students who remain with a cadre
of the same classmates are retained at a higher rate; they also bond more
effectively with the teacher, from the two semesters of working together.
<p>In the fall of 1994, the full <i>Stretch Program</i> was implemented,
with 510 registered students.&nbsp; Lecturer (and now Director of Writing
Programs) Greg Glau was assigned to coordinate the program.&nbsp; Classes
were capped at 22 students, so students could receive more individual attention.
<p>In the fall of 1997, an ESL (English as a Second Language) component
was added, for international students (who then take a WAC 107 ? ENG 107
sequence of classes).
<p>A note about the student population of <i>Stretch</i>: at ASU, students
are placed into a writing class based on their standardized test scores.&nbsp;
Students who come from high schools that are underfunded (which is often
the case in Arizona) tend to test more poorly than those who come from
more affluent and modern high schools.&nbsp; Students from groups traditionally
under-represented at the university (Asian Americans, African Americans,
Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans) also often come to ASU with the
lower test scores ? so more of them are placed into <i>Stretch</i>.&nbsp;
In numbers, about 23 percent of ASU?s student population comes from the
under-represented groups; in <i>Stretch,</i> nearly 40 percent come from
those groups.&nbsp; Put another way, in an average ASU class, one in five
students comes from an under-represented group; in Stretch classes, two
in every five students come from one of those groups.
<p>In effect, then, <i>Stretch</i> classes have the students with the lowest
test scores, who more often come from groups seen as ?at risk? in the university
? the same group of students formerly placed into ? and who often failed
? ENG 071.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Results and Benefits to Students and to ASU</b>
<p>The data ? both narrative student reports and statistical analysis ?
tell us that the <i>Stretch Program</i> has made a significant difference
to ASU and to ASU students.
<p><b>What Our Students Say</b>
<br>Each semester, <i>Stretch </i>students are asked to complete an anonymous
evaluation of the program.&nbsp; 89 percent of those completing these anonymous
surveys tell us they think their "writing has improved" because of the
program.&nbsp; Students note that especially they feel more confident about
their writing, they can expand and provide more detail, that their organization
has improved, and even that they see an improvement in grammar and mechanics.
<p>As we might expect, most of these students say the program is effective
because of the extra time they receive to work on their writing (fully
40 percent of those students completing the survey cite the extra time
to be the "best thing" about the program).&nbsp; Students also point to
having the same teacher and same classmates for two semesters as positive
aspects of the program.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Statistical Results</b>
<br>The statistical results of <i>Stretch</i> have been no less than astonishing:
when we compare the <i>Stretch </i>sequence with the former ENG 071?ENG
101 sequence:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>ASU writing students now enjoy greater success than they did under the
previous model, passing WAC 101 at about a twenty-percent higher rate than
they passed ENG 071.&nbsp; It?s clear that <i>Stretch </i>students benefit
from the extra semester of writing experience, as they also pass ENG 101
at a higher rate than their ?regular? ENG 101 counterparts ? and this has
been true for each year ASU has offered<i> Stretch</i>:
<center>
<p><img SRC="imageBT4.JPG" height=254 width=381></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>For each of the past eight academic years,<i> Stretch Program</i> students
? those seen as most ?at risk? at the university ? pass ENG 101 at a higher
rate than those who take ?regular? ENG 101.
<p>In addition, almost twice as many students are retained under the Stretch
Program model:
<ul>
<li>
Under the old model (before <i>Stretch</i>), out of each 1,000 new students
who took ENG 071, only 280 remained at ASU to register for ENG 102</li>

<li>
Under the new model (<i>Stretch)</i>, out of each 1,000 students who take
WAC 101, 460 are at ASU to register for ENG 102</li>
</ul>
And more <i>Stretch </i>students pass ENG 102 than ?regular? students.&nbsp;
While we might expect (since they have the same teacher for two semesters)
Stretch students pass ENG 101 at a higher rate than "regular" ENG 101 students,
they also pass ENG 102 at a higher rate:
<ul>
<li>
Average pass rate, all ENG 102 students, academic years 1993-94 through
2001-02 (excluding summer sessions) ............................<b> 85.39%</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Average pass rate, for ENG 102 <i>Stretch</i> students, academic years
1994-95 through 2001-02 (excluding summer sessions).............. <b>88.32
%</b></li>
</ul>
<i>Stretch</i> ENG 101 students pass ENG 102 at about a three percent higher
rate than do ?regular? ENG 101 students.

Others, too, both promoted and supported <i>Stretch</i>, including each
Chair of the Department of English and those who?ve directed the program;
they?re listed on the roster sheet:
<ul>
<li>
Former Directors of Writing Programs David Schwalm and John Ramage designed
and piloted the <i>Stretch Program</i></li>

<li>

from 1999-2000</li>

<li>
The <i>Stretch Program</i> has been continually supported by Department
of English Chairs: Nancy Gutierrez, Dan Bivona, and Elizabeth Horan</li>

<li>
Karen Dwyer took over <i>Stretch </i>in the fall of 2000, and currently
directs the program.&nbsp; Each year she responds to a number of inquiries

so from 1994?2000, and is currently Director of Writing Programs, where
he has responsibility for curriculum and instruction, including <i>Stretch</i></li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>A National Model</b>
<p>With the publicity <i>Stretch</i> has garnered, other colleges and universities
are putting such a model into place.&nbsp; While not every school with
a <i>Stretch Program</i> identically copied ASU?s paradigm, these colleges
and universities all base their curriculum on the Stretch model:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Boise State University&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whatcom Community College</li>

<li>
The University of Washington&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Northern Illinois University</li>

<li>
Southern Illinois University Carbondale&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fresno Pacific University</li>

<li>
The Writing Program, Fort Lewis College&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Quinnipiac University</li>

<li>
Scottsdale Community College&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
University of Virginia</li>

<li>
The Writing Program, Indiana University, Purdue University Indianapolis</li>

<li>
Harry S Truman College</li>
</ul>
<b>Summary</b>
<p>In summary, more than 6,000 students have enrolled in the<i> Stretch
Program</i>, and many students who would have formerly failed at ASU have
succeeded here:
<ul>
<li>
they pass WAC 101 at a higher rate than they passed ENG 071</li>

<li>
they pass ENG 101 at a higher rate when compared to ?regular? ENG 101 students</li>

<li>
they pass ENG 102 at a higher rate than their ?regular? counterparts</li>
</ul>
All this means that:
<ul>
<li>
<b><i>Stretch students </i>? those seen as ?at-risk? here at ASU ? succeed
and are retained at a higher rate than these same groups of students under
the old model we had before Stretch</b></li>
</ul>
