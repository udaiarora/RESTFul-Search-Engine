      <h2>Annual "New American Piano" features collaboration with dance department
        in three premieres</h2>
      <p>WHAT: Annual new music series, "The New American Piano" WHEN: 7:30 p.m.,
        Monday, March 24; WHERE: Evelyn Smith Music Theatre, Herberger College
        School of Music Building, 40 E. Gammage Pkwy., Tempe; TICKETS: Free admission,
      no tickets required. </p>
      <p>The School of Music in the Herberger College of Fine Arts
        at ASU presents "The New American Piano." Now in its fifth season, this
        year's performance of new piano music is a collaboration between the
        Herberger College Dance Department choreographer Elina Mooney, professor
        of dance, and Madeline Williamson, professor of piano. The program features
        the premiere of three new dance pieces choreographed by Mooney especially
        for the piano music chosen for the program.</p>
      <p>Mooney's new works will be performed by Williamson's KRUST&Aacute; ensemble,
        a new music small ensemble dedicated to the performance of works written
        for piano and percussion, with original choreography.</p>
      <p>The three new premieres will be: 1) Chinese Poems, the first choreography
        of composer Barbara Kolb's 1977 Spring Flowers Moon Night for two pianos
        and electronic tape; 2) Celebration, to John Cage's innovative 1948 work,
        Three Dances for Two Prepared Pianos (various objects are inserted throughout
        the 88 keys of each of the two grand pianos to entirely alter their sound
        to that similar of a Balinese Gamelan Orchestra) and 3) Fury, a premiere
        world choreography for Marlos Nobres' Sonancias III for two pianos and
        two percussionists. </p>
      <p>Mooney and Williamson have known each other and interacted professionally
        for numerous years, frequently attending one another's performances and
        sharing a mutual interest and inquisitiveness about the interactive nature
        of dance and music. Following the spring 2002 residency of composers
        George Crumb and David Burge, the two artists determined that it was
        finally time that they merge their dual interests in artistic collaboration
        through the intersecting of original choreography performed with live
        music. </p>
      <p> Now in its fifth season, the intriguing New American Piano event is
        dedicated to showcasing more infrequently performed works for the piano
        from the 20th and 21st centuries by composers of the Americas. This year's
        performance draws upon the richness of the music of acclaimed Brazilian,
        Marlos Nobres. According to founder and concert coordinator Madeline
        Williamson, of special interest to the series "are innovative works for
        the piano that utilize the vast resources of timbre inherent to the instrument
        as well as programming which draws upon the wide diversity of composers
        from the Americas in ethnicity, locale, style, and gender."</p>
      <p>An especially intriguing work on Monday night's program will be the
        rarely performed "Dances for Two Prepared Pianos" by American avant-gardist,
        John Cage. This dynamic work is seldom heard in live performance due
        to the complexity and rehearsal difficulty of using a pair of prepared
        pianos (i.e. inserting various screws, nuts, bolts, and pieces of plastic
        and rubber into the strings of both pianos).</p>
      <p>According to Williamson, "This transforms the two pianos into a Kaleidoscope
        of tumultuous sounds-bangs, thuds, buzzes, and gongs-all of which are
        quite exhilarating to the listener." Williamson describes the Cage work
        as "virtuosic in temperament, physically energetic and intricate to execute.
        The syncopations and cross-rhythms should leave the listener breathless.
        The preparation alone for just one piano, averages about 20 hours in
        time." </p>
      <p>The program features Mooney's ensemble of dancers, including guest artists
        Candace Ammerman, Amy Oakley-Sams, Karen Schupp and Renee Waters in key
        solo roles. Additionally, a student ensemble of six dancers will also
        be involved. Mooney says, "The choreographer/musician collaboration will
        explore the particular relationship between musicians and dancers-encompassing
        the gamut from musicians and dancers sharing the same "space" with direct
        interaction to the actual juxtaposition of the two artistic elements
        fostering a spontaneity of performance as their connecting factor." </p>
      <p>Other members of Williamson's ensemble KRUST&Aacute;, Brazilian pianist,
        Rubia Santos, and Douglas Nottingham, percussion, will be joined in the
        performance by local professional artists, Andria Fennig on piano, and
        Brett Reed on additional percussion. </p>
