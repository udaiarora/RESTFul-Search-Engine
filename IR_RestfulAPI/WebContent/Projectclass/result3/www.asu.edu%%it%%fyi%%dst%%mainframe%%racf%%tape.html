    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">TAPE</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When a tape volume is placed
    in the tape library, anyone is permitted to read or write on
    the tape volume with the exception of two conditions listed below:</FONT></P>

    <UL>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">the tape management system TLMS
      prevents anyone, including you, from writing over a tape data
      set if that data set or any following it on the tape volume is
      not expired</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">the owner of the tape volume
      has informed RACF which userids are allowed access to the tape
      volume</FONT>
    </UL>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The protection provided by TLMS
    is used primarily to protect you from accidently writing over
    your own tape data sets. RACF does not alter the function provided
    by TLMS.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you, the owner of a tape volume,
    want to have the tape volume protected by RACF, you should contact
    the tape librarian and request that the tape volume be defined
    or added (the terms are synonymous) to RACF.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Once the tape volume has been
    defined to RACF, you can inform RACF what the UACC (univeral
    access) code should be and which userids, if any, should be allowed
    access to the tape volume. You do not need to tell RACF that
    your userid should be allowed access; since your userid is the
    owning userid, it already has access. (Regarding protection of
    tapes, RACF provides protection on a tape volume level, not a
    tape data set level. If you permit a userid to have a certain
    type of access to a tape volume, the userid has that type of
    access to all tape data sets on the volume.)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When a userid attempts to access
    a tape volume which has been defined to RACF, the system checks
    to see if the userid is the owner of the tape; if so, access
    is granted. If the userid doesn't own the tape, the system checks
    to see if the userid is on the access list for the tape and the
    type of access permitted. (It is possible for the owner of a
    tape to designate that certain userids are allowed to read the
    tape and that other userids are allowed to read and write.) If
    the userid is not in the access list, the system checks the universal
    access code UACC to determine what, if any, access should be
    allowed.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The following types of access
    codes are possible:</FONT></P>

    <PRE>  NONE    - no access allowed
  READ    - allowed read access
  UPDATE  - allowed read and write access
  CONTROL - same as UPDATE
  ALTER   - allowed read, write, and scratch access</PRE>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If a tape volume had a UACC code
    of NONE and no userids existed in the access list, only the owner
    would have access to the tape.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If a tape volume had a UACC code
    of NONE and three userids existed in the access list (one with
    access of READ and the other two with access of UPDATE), only
    the owner and the three userids would have access to the tape.
    One of the userids would have READ access, two would have UPDATE
    access, and the owner would have ALTER access.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If a tape volume had a UACC code
    of READ and no userids existed in the access list, any userid
    would be permitted to read the tape, but only the owner would
    have any additional access.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">(The tape volume protection provided
    by RACF is available for standard labeled tapes, non-labeled
    tapes, and foreign labeled tapes; however, only standard labeled
    tapes are protected from human error resulting from the operator
    mounting the wrong tape volume.)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There are three basic tape functions
    you can perform with RACF:</FONT></P>

    <UL>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">display the tape volume profile;
      this lists the UACC code and the userids, if any, which are permitted
      access and the type of access allowed</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">change the UACC code</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">remove selected userids from
      the access list, remove all userids from the access list, add
      userids (and the type of access allowed) to the access list</FONT>
    </UL>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You can use ISPF 9.R to perform
    these functions. If you choose to enter the RACF commands directly,
    either on a TSO command line or in a batch job, the more commonly
    used commands are those shown below.</FONT></P>

    <UL>
      <LI><A HREF="rlist.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">RLIST</FONT></A><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> - perform the display function</FONT>
