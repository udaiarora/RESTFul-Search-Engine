                  <br><h2 align="center">Minutes of Meeting</h2>
                  <br>
                  <p align="center"><b>April 17, 2002</b> </p>
                  <p>Meeting called to order at 3:06 pm. 
                  <p>Chair: John Barnard<br>
  Secretary: Mimmo Bonanni<br>
  A quorum was present. </p>
                 <br> <H3>I. Approval of Minutes March 20, 2002</H3>
                 <br> <p>Minutes were approved as written.
                  </p>
                  <br><H3>II. Dean's Report - Sherrie Schmidt </H3>
                  <br>
<p>Sherrie briefly spoke of the forthcoming changes in the libraries, the Video Resources closure, and the Noble CPS desk, and Noble reference merger. In regards to current open positions, she emphasized that if a position is not currently filled, the position will go back to the library. </p>
                    <br><p>Sherrie also reminded council that the 2003 Budget is still not final. She mentioned that there are two current camps of thought: (1) As a result of a tuition increase, we may not have do any adjustments, or (2) We may still need to pay back 4% next year. </p>
                   <br> <p>Sherrie mentioned a new contract with the AZ Historical Foundation. Under the new agreement, the Foundation will receive funds from ASU Libraries to hire employees. The library will provide cataloging, technology, collection maintenance costs, and space within the Hayden Library. The Foundation will be open 70 hours per week. It will be directed and managed by one curator. </p>
                    <br><H3>III. Kurt Murphy, AD for Personnel Report</H3>
                   <br> <p>Lois introduced Kurt Murphy's presentation. She mentioned that Compensation committee has met and discussed the three-year salary adjustment cycle project with Kurt. Compensation Committee wanted Kurt to present council with a history and development of the project. </p>
                    <br><p>Kurt provided a history of a three year compensation plan approved by the Provost office to increase salaries. ARL salary data from ASU's peer institutions was used to determine the 50th percentile for the defined job categories, combined with years of service. </p>
                    <br><p>To determine a market target salary, ASU Libraries was compared to 108 other ARL libraries. Kurt gathered figures and determined salary schedules over a 5-year period. ASU Libraries academic salary plan began in July of 2000 with the Entry and Lower range Adjustments: 30,000 - 36,000 to 36,000 - 40,000, an average increase of 14 percent. Then in July 2001, the Upper Range Adjustments were made - 51,000 - 68,000 to 53,000 - 71,000, an average increase of four percent. Finally, the Mid-Range Adjustments were made in January 2002, 41,000 - 50,000 to 43,000 - 52,000, an average increase of five percent. </p>
                    <br><p>Sherrie mentioned that the adjustments made were self-funded. The Libraries did not acquire monies outside of the libraries. Kurt concluded by saying that salaries in ARL go up three percent each year, so it is difficult task to match salary with our peers. </p>
                    <br><H3>IV. Chair &amp; Executive Committee's Report John Barnard</H3>
                    <br><p>John welcomed Hillery Oberle as the new Map Archivist for Government Documents and Maps Department.
