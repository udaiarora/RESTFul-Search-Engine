University design process:&nbsp; the college/school-centric        model </strong></h1>      <p><font size="2">The key to ASU&rsquo;s transformation and success will be college and        school empowerment.&nbsp; The objectives of the university design process        based on the &ldquo;college/school-centric&rdquo; model are:</font></p>      <ul>        <li>To build the university around strong entrepreneurial colleges and          schools (the enterprise model); </li>        <li>To devolve intellectual and entrepreneurial responsibility to the          level of the college and school;</li>        <li>To create a design that allows colleges and schools to grow and prosper          to the extent of their intellectual and market limits; </li>        <li>To create a federation of unique colleges, schools, academic departments,          and interdisciplinary research centers (&ldquo;colleges and schools&rdquo;)          as the foundation of the premier metropolitan research university of          the twenty-first century. </li>      </ul>      <p><font size="2">The evolving design of ASU is essential, not only to          achieving academic excellence, but to serving the metropolitan region          and state, and meeting the challenges of the decades ahead.&nbsp; In order to become nationally        competitive, ASU must increase overall academic excellence.&nbsp; This        becomes possible by increasing the excellence of the academic units that        comprise the university&mdash;building the university around strong entrepreneurial        colleges and schools.&nbsp; ASU must become a university that is structured        around outstanding colleges and schools (designating academic units,        whether colleges, schools, academic departments, or interdisciplinary        research centers) free to grow and prosper to the extent of their individual        intellectual and market limits.&nbsp; A college or school is a unit of        intellectual connectivity between faculty and students organized around        a theme or objective.&nbsp; Towards this end, our objective is to create        a single institution with programs distributed across metropolitan Phoenix        in which all academic units have the potential to achieve excellence.&nbsp; In        this conception, ASU is a federation of unique colleges and schools with        no implicit hierarchy or &ldquo;tiering.&rdquo; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">The key to ASU&rsquo;s transformation and success will          be <em>college          and school empowerment</em>.&nbsp; Success will be driven by increasing          academic excellence, fostering creativity, and enlarging the social,          economic, and cultural impact of the university.&nbsp; Such excellence,          creativity, and impact are attained when communities of students and          scholars are driven to compete at the highest level.&nbsp; Such competition          is nurtured and enhanced by close-knit organizations with focused missions          and high degrees of freedom.&nbsp; In the case of a major research          institution, these characteristics are associated with smaller academic          units, such as colleges and schools.&nbsp; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">College and school empowerment will help overcome historical          physical and fiscal constraints through ownership of the competitive          academic process at the level of each college and school.&nbsp; Devolving          responsibility to the level of colleges and schools will encourage          colleges and schools to excel, allowing each to articulate new designs          and embark in new directions, as well as to set higher standards to          ensure national competitiveness. </font></p>      <p><font size="2">A college/school-centric model for the university assumes          an institution in which each college and school competes for status,          not with other colleges and schools within the university, but with          peer colleges and schools around the country and around the world.&nbsp; Each college and        school will have an opportunity to gain its own competitive status within        its own sphere.&nbsp; And colleges and schools within the university        will have the opportunity to complement and leverage one another.&nbsp; In        this model, the School of Technology at ASU Polytechnic, for example,        has the potential to become a leading school of technology, linked to        a leading school of engineering on the Tempe campus, comprised of programs        with students appropriately placed, ensuring mechanisms for maximum success. </font></p>      <p><font size="2">The college/school-centric model of ASU is predicated          on devolving intellectual and entrepreneurial responsibility to the          level of the college or school.&nbsp; The        president of the university and administration will endeavor to create        the optimum environment for success, acquiring operating resources, and        helping to strategically ally the institution and its academic units.&nbsp; But        the university will advance primarily through small groups of faculty        working with students to advance their intellectual agendas to become        nationally competitive.&nbsp; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">In this college/school-centric model, each college and          school is unique in conceptualization and driven by its own intrinsic          requirements, with the caveat that it must integrate with other elements          within the university.&nbsp; The        colleges and schools are the competitive units by which the university        advances, each college and school advancing on its own.&nbsp; It is the        responsibility of the leadership of each college and school to articulate        aspirations, advance conceptualizations, and finalize nuts-and-bolts        designs.&nbsp; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">Because ASU is a single institution with multiple campuses,          the design process does not give precedence to the historic Tempe campus.&nbsp; ASU        will not be comprised of a flagship campus and tiered secondary campuses.&nbsp; The        evolving design of the university transcends the campus-based model.&nbsp; We        must build one university in which the academic quality of units different        in kind is uniformly high, all are treated fairly and equally, individuals        are free to advance their creativity, and the merit associated with their        work is recognized. </font></p>      <h2>i.&nbsp; Financial considerations          of the design process</h2>      <p><font size="2">The ability of the university to enhance academic quality          by building colleges and schools of national and international rank,          while continuing to provide access to the people of Arizona, is directly          tied to the university's ability to attract investors and grow investments.&nbsp; Over the past        decade the investment of the State of Arizona has not kept pace with        the university&rsquo;s growth and increasing complexity.&nbsp; Accordingly,        ASU must overcome its fiscal constraints by developing new public and        private funding partners, as well as making a better argument for investment        in the institution with the state of Arizona.&nbsp; In the public sector,        for example, ASU must work to develop enhanced partnerships with the        cities in which it is located.&nbsp; In addition, ASU must work to attract        new investment from the research funding agencies, private sector, philanthropic        organizations and foundations, and alumni.&nbsp; Only with new and enhanced        investment will the university be able to hire the faculty, build the        facilities, and develop the campuses necessary to advance the quality        of the colleges and schools in the manner described in this report.</font></p>      <h2>ii.&nbsp; Implementation of the design process </h2>      <p><font size="2">This report sets out a design that will require the complex          set of implementation activities and interactions identified in Appendices          B-1 and B-2, a process that will continue well into the future.&nbsp; First, as indicated above,        there are important financial considerations to be addressed.&nbsp; Second,        as indicated in the University Provost's recommendations, the implementation        of the design will incorporate principles to facilitate the orderly transition        and migration of programs, schools, and colleges.&nbsp; Third, ASU will        need to initiate or expand new partnerships and alliances with the public        and private sector including the City of Tempe, the City of Phoenix,        the City of Mesa, the City of Scottsdale, other city governments, the        Maricopa Community College District, and the private sector.&nbsp; Finally,        as one of three state universities, the implementation of the design        set out in this report requires collaboration with the Arizona Board        of Regents to obtain input and approval as appropriate.</font><br>      </p>      <h2><strong>iii.&nbsp; Many            places:&nbsp; the university campuses</strong></h2>      <p><font size="2">The essence of a great university is not only in its          libraries, laboratories, studios, and classrooms; its irreducible core          is the human relationships within its scope.&nbsp; Although it is inconceivable to imagine a great        university without its libraries and research infrastructure, the physical        manifestation of universities remains secondary to the community of students        and scholars who are its spirit.&nbsp; This said, universities are often        identified with their campuses, and, in this context, the design process        seeks to break new ground in defining the relationships between campuses,        the university community, and academic programs.&nbsp; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">The operational concept of &ldquo;campus&rdquo; must be distinguished        from the academic processes that comprise the entities termed &ldquo;colleges        and schools.&rdquo;&nbsp; Because ASU is a single institution that owing        to historical circumstance has become distributed spatially across metropolitan        Phoenix, it is nearly inevitable that a hierarchical model developed,        with the historic campus perceived as the flagship, and tiered subsidiary        campuses offering duplicate programs conceived primarily for expedience        and convenience.&nbsp; From its inception, ASU East (now the Polytechnic        campus), with a focus on applied science, technology, and business, has        largely been an exception to this model.&nbsp; </font></p>      <p><font size="2">The college/school-centric model embraced in the design          process will instead produce a deliberate and planned clustering of          programs on each &ldquo;campus&rdquo; around        a related theme and mission.&nbsp; The <em>empowerment of colleges and        schools</em> will be enhanced by the judicious relocation and clustering        of existing colleges and schools or, in the future, the placement of        new colleges and schools according to an integrated and thoughtful plan.&nbsp; The        imposed spatial distribution of the university offers extraordinary opportunities,        to depart from the traditional model and create academic complexes with        distinct identities, and to better embed the university in the diverse        communities of the metropolitan region.&nbsp; The plan is also motivated        by limitations of space on the Tempe campus, and the commitment of the        university to provide access and serve the entire metropolitan region. </font></p>      <p><font size="2"><a href="appendixd.html">Appendices D-1 through D-4</a> introduce the design concepts          of each of the four campuses of ASU.&nbsp;
