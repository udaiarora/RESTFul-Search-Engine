<p>
<font size=+1><b><a name="Vehicle Marking and Identification">Vehicle Marking and Identification</a></b></font></p>

<p>
University vehicles are identified by standard markings. These markings comply with the University Graphic Standard. Markings shall be of the size and appearance indicated below:</p>

<p>
<b>Color</b></p>

<p>
University vehicles are painted white. Vehicles acquired by the university subsequent to approval of this policy shall be in compliance with the color requirement. Vehicles donated to the university need not be repainted solely to change the color; a color change can occur when the vehicle&#146;s paint requires refinishing.</p>

<p>
<b>Standard Markings</b></p>

<p>
Departmentally owned vehicles have door markings indicating the owning department. Departmental markings are on a white reflective 12-inch square with a 3 1/2-inch ASU logo. The department name is in 1-inch maroon letters. Cart type vehicles use a 9-inch reflective square with a 2 5/8-inch ASU logo, and the department name in 5/8-inch maroon letters. Vehicle numbering is maroon. All markings shall be in accordance with the ASU Graphic Standard. Under extenuating circumstances, this requirement may be waived at the discretion of the executive vice president and chief finance officer.</p>

<p>
<b>Numbering System</b></p>

<p>
All university vehicles use the following numbering system:</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>All vehicles use a five- or six-digit number.</li></p>

<p>
<li>The first character reflects the owning campus:</p>

<p>
M&#151;Tempe Campus</p>

<p>
E&#151;Polytechnic Campus</p>

<p>
W&#151;West Campus.</li></p>

<p>
<li>The second and third digits are the model year of the vehicle. The next two or three digits are assigned by Fleet Service in the order of purchase for the model year.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Extraneous Markings</b></p>

<p>
No decals, stickers, signs, or other markings are allowed on any university vehicle, other than official university markings, without the express written consent of the supervisor of Fleet Service.</p>

<p>
<b>For-Official-Use-Only-Decal</b></p>

<p>
All university vehicles have a decal on each side of the vehicle according to <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> &#167; 38&#150;538.</p>

<p>
<b>Registration</b></p>

<p>
University vehicles bear state governmental license plates and are so registered. Those vehicles that have been authorized as undercover car exemptions by the executive vice president and chief finance officer are issued regular state license plates.</p>

<p>
<b>Undercover Plates</b></p>

<p>
Exemption approval for each undercover vehicle must be obtained from the executive vice president and chief finance officer and renewed yearly. Fleet Service processes exemption approvals by marking them &#147;Confidential&#148; and sending the original to the Arizona Department of Transportation, Motor Vehicle Division.</p>

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b><a name="Clean Air/Emissions Control">Clean Air/Emissions Control</a></b></font></p>

<p>
<b>Emission Control</b></p>

<p>
Emission inspections shall be conducted according to <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> &#167; 49&#150;541. Fleet Service notifies the using department of the date the vehicle is scheduled for emissions testing. Vehicles not meeting state standards are removed from service until completion of repairs. Failure to have vehicles emissions-certified may result in the deregistration of the vehicle or cancellation of the fuel card.</p>

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b><a name="Alternate Energy Fuel Economy Program">Alternate Energy Fuel Economy Program</a></b></font></p>

<p>
<b>Vehicle Acquisition</b></p>

<p>
University vehicles shall be purchased in accordance with the Clean Air Act of 1990, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> &#167; 41&#150;803.</p>

<p>
All vehicle purchases must be approved in writing by the fleet manager to ensure that vehicles meet the guidelines of this policy. Criteria including age obsolescence and life cycle costs are used to determine when a vehicle is replaced. The fleet manager prepares vehicle specifications in coordination with the customer department for the customer&#146;s approval and in accordance with this policy.</p>

<p>
All vehicles acquired by the university are evaluated by the fleet manager for feasibility of utilizing alternate fuels based on cost and use of the vehicle.</p>

<p>
<b>Scheduling</b></p>

<p>
A schedule by which fleet vehicles might be replaced follows:</p>

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b><a name="Preventive Maintenance/Safety Inspections">Preventive Maintenance/Safety Inspections</a></b></font></p>

<p>
<b>Standards</b></p>

<p>
All university vehicles receive preventive maintenance and safety inspections on a 6,000-mile or six-month interval, whichever comes first as determined by Fleet Service and in accordance with the manufacturer&#146;s specification. The program is administered by Fleet Service. Failure to comply with requests by Fleet Service personnel to make the vehicle available for servicing may result in notification to the responsible department chair. Fleet Service may notify the responsible department directors for vehicles overdue preventative maintenance inspection more than 60 days. For vehicles overdue more than 120 days, the responsible vice president or provost may be notified.</p>

<p>
<b>Scheduling</b></p>

<p>
Fleet Service will schedule all vehicles requiring preventive maintenance/safety inspections. This will be done to minimize out-of-service time to the using department. Vehicles that are unsafe or in noncompliance with emissions standards remain at Fleet Service until repaired. The department is notified of the expected repair completion date.</p>

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b><a name="Authorized Drivers">Authorized Drivers</a></b></font></p>

<p>
University officers, employees, and students with a valid driver&#146;s license may operate Fleet Service/university vehicles for university business as authorized by their supervising authority.</p>

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b><a name="Commercial Driver's License Requirements">Commercial Driver&#146;s License (CDL) Requirements</a></b></font></p>

<p>
This law (<i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> &#167; 28&#150;403) applies to any driver who operates a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight of 26,001 pounds or greater and/or pulls a trailer with a gross vehicle weight that exceeds 10,000 pounds. This law also applies to any vehicle that must display hazardous material placards as required by law, regardless of its gross vehicle weight.</p>

<p>
Having a valid license of the proper class is a condition of employment if required for an employee&#146;s job classification and job description.</p>

<p>
A driver holding a CDL is required to have a Department of Transportation approved physical examination every two years. The employee&#146;s department pays for the first physical examination and biennial physical. If special tests are required (EKGs, X-rays, etc.), the cost of the physical examination that exceeds &#036;65 is the employee&#146;s responsibility. If the physical examination is done at a facility not approved by ASU, the maximum reimbursement is &#036;65 or the actual cost of the examination, whichever is less.</p>

<p>
The employee is responsible for the cost of the basic CDL. The employee&#146;s department reimburses him or her for any amendments required for the employee&#146;s job classification. The university will provide training for a written exam to be given during normal working hours. The department employing the driver must ensure that its employees are trained.</p>

<p>
The university allows the use of a vehicle for the practical test on university time.</p>

<p>
An employee is allowed to take the written test and the practical test up to two times on university time. After two failures it is the employee&#146;s responsibility to take the test on his or her personal time.</p>

<p>
An employee who is unable to obtain the proper license may be reassigned or discharged, subject to availability of the position or the needs of the department.</p>

<p>
The employee is responsible for keeping his or her license and physical examination updated. Failure to have a current physical examination or license will result in disciplinary action. The employee must notify his or her supervisor of any traffic violations pertaining to the CDL law.</p>

<p>
An employee who loses the license must obtain a new license on his or her personal time.</p>

<p>
Each department that employs drivers who are required to have a CDL must set up a routine monitoring system to ensure compliance with this law. Supervisors shall require employees to present quarterly a license and evidence of physical examination and to sign a statement that the license is current and valid. </p>

<p>Records are to be kept in the department&#146;s central office and must be made available to state or federal officials upon request. Failure to comply with the CDL law and its record keeping requirements can result in a substantial fine to the department head and the university. Fleet Service provides a copy of the CDL law upon request.</p>

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b><a name="Vehicle Modifications">Vehicle Modifications</a></b></font></p>

<p>
For reasons of safety, university vehicles will not be modified without prior approval from the fleet manager. Modifications include, but are not limited to, luggage racks, trailer hitches, lift kits, lift gates, tire-size modifications, cranes, add-on generators, seating, storage bins, additional lighting, lumber racks, camper shells, and non-manufacturer modifications.</p>

<p>
<b>Coverage</b></p>

<p>
The Arizona Department of Administration maintains liability and property insurance coverage for university-owned vehicles in accordance with state law and regulations. Coverage is on a primary basis for university-owned, leased (rental), and hired vehicles, and on an excess basis for privately owned vehicles. There is no coverage provided for damage to or loss of privately owned (POV) vehicles.

If another driver is involved, the operator should ask the other driver to fill out the police-provided courtesy cards. Names and telephone numbers of any witnesses should also be obtained. Vehicle operators must take drivable vehicles to two automobile body shops for repair estimates. Operators must return the vehicle to the university and deliver the estimates to Fleet Service for insurance processing.</p>

<p>
Fleet Service distributes a copy of the accident report to the appropriate administrator. The responsible administrator reviews the report and takes corrective action, as appropriate.</p>

<p>
ASU and its officers, agents, and employees shall cooperate with the Arizona Attorney General&#146;s Office and Department of Administration and their representatives and shall provide all information and materials required for adequate investigation and resolution of insurance claims.</p>

The daily rental fleet has passenger and cargo vehicles based in the Fleet Service compound that are made available for daily rental to all departments as needed. Vehicles are dispatched on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

<p>
To ensure that ASU vehicles are used only for university business, all billing must be authorized and paid for using the university accounting system. Requesters must use a <a href="fmformfac.html">Motor Pool Request</a> form with an internal purchase order (PO) or agency/org account information for billing. A driver&#146;s license and university ID must be presented before Fleet Service releases a vehicle. Drivers of passenger vans with a seating capacity of eight or more must have completed a training course in the operation of high-occupancy vehicles through the Department of Environmental Health &#038; Safety.</p>

Reserved vehicles are held for one hour beyond the stipulated time of dispatch. If the requester has not picked up the vehicle by that time, the request is cancelled and the vehicle is dispatched to the next requester. A service charge of one day&#146;s rental fee is charged for failure to show up for a reserved vehicle. If the vehicle can be rented that day to another department, the fee is reduced to $10.</p>

Credit cards are for the purchase of items for university vehicles only. Major purchases or repairs over &#036;100 require authorization from the Fleet Service manager. The credit card may not be used within 25 miles of the campus during Fleet Service operating hours unless essential. Copies of service station receipts must substantiate all purchases made with the credit card. For daily rental vehicle users, the credit card and all receipts are turned in to the dispatcher upon completion of the trip. Accumulated receipts from vehicles on long-term lease/rental are turned in weekly. Failure to turn in credit card receipts as stated results in termination of use of the credit card. The mileage at fueling must be written on each receipt.</p>

<p>
<b>Lost Cards</b></p>

<p>
Lost credit cards must be reported to Fleet Service immediately. There is a &#036;25 fee for each lost credit card.</p>

<p>
<b>Department Responsibility</b></p>

The driver to whom the vehicle is dispatched is ultimately responsible for the proper use of the vehicle. Should it become necessary to allow another authorized person in the department to drive the vehicle, the individual to whom the vehicle is dispatched assumes the responsibility for ensuring that the person to whom the vehicle is loaned is a properly licensed driver and instructed in the proper use of Fleet Service vehicles as outlined in these rules.</p>

Requests for specially installed equipment (two-way radios, sirens, cages, tanks, etc.) must be submitted in writing to Fleet Service for approval. The user department is responsible for the cost of procurement and installation of equipment for any special modifications, and for the removal of the equipment at the termination of the agreement. Any damage caused by specially installed equipment that reduces the resale value of the vehicle is billed to the department that had the equipment installed.</p>

<p>
Charges for daily rental vehicles dispatched to a user department may be determined by a dual rate method. This method consists of a cost-per-day charge and a cost-per-mile charge. Long-term lease vehicles are assigned to departments on an annual basis. The charge is levied for each year they are assigned, regardless of days driven. The rental is billed on the first of each fiscal year. Fleet Service&#146;s rates may vary from year to year, depending upon cost of new vehicles, prices for petroleum products, and maintenance and repair costs.</p>

<p>
Departmentally owned and operated vehicles are subject to the same university guidelines specified in this policy. The owning department&#146;s director/chair ensures that all university vehicle policies are followed. All the general vehicle requirements and standards for university vehicles outlined in this policy apply to the owning departments. Departments not wishing to use Fleet Garage Services may use outside sources for inspections and services. However, the fleet manager establishes the inspection criteria and service standards for university vehicles. A checklist of required services and inspections can be obtained from Fleet Services. A copy of all outsourced maintenance records and receipts must be forwarded to Fleet Services for vehicle records update, or the maintenance actions are not considered accomplished. Fleet Services provides vehicle preventive maintenance and inspection schedules to designated departmental representatives.</p>

Specifications for all vehicles must be approved by Fleet Service to ensure that they meet university standards as specified in this policy. The purchase, lease, or rental of 12- and 15-passenger vans for official university road travel is prohibited. Minivans, SUVs, and buses are still options for official university road travel.</p>
