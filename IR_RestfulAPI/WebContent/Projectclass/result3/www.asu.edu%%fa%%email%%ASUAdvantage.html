       Dear ASU Student,<br />
       <br />
       <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You have been selected to continue participation in the ASU Advantage program for 2006-07 academic year. ASU has prepared your 2006-07 academic year online Financial Aid Notification (FAN) which details your financial aid offer. Please view your online FAN using <a href="http://www.asu.edu/interactive">ASU Interactive</a>. Once you have logged in, choose &quot;Access Financial Aid Services&quot; from the main menu. In order to maximize funding opportunities available to all students, ASU asks that you accept, reduce and/or decline your offered award(s) without delay. Quick response allows ASU to reallocate declined funds to other deserving students. </p>
     <p>As you know, ASU Advantage is a financial commitment by ASU to students whose total family income is $18,850 or less. Participation in this program means ASU will guarantee enough grants, scholarships, outside resources and Federal Work-Study to cover the standard estimated direct costs (minus the studentâ??s Expected Family Contribution) associated with tuition, mandatory fees, room, board and books for up to eight (8) consecutive fall and spring semesters at any ASU campus. Special class fees and program fees will not be covered as part of this program.</p>
     <p><strong>Continuing Program Criteria:</strong></p>
     <ul>
       <li>You were selected last year for the ASU Advantage program and you maintained requirements for eligibility.</li>
     <li>Your total family income is equal to or less than $18,850 as demonstrated on your FAFSA.</li>
     <li>You will be enrolled at ASU full-time (12 or more regular credit hours) as of census each fall and spring semester. <br />
       Census info: <a href="../policies/census/">www.asu.edu/fa/census</a>.</li>
     <li>You meet all federal student aid eligibility criteria as defined at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/fa/policies/eligibility_criteria/index.html">www.asu.edu/fa/eligibilit</a>y.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Your estimated cost of attendance includes both direct and indirect costs. Although direct costs (through the ASU Advantage Program) will be covered through aid you do not have to repay, ASU may have offered you loans for indirect costs associated with transportation and personal expenses.</p>
     <p>Indirect costs for transportation and personal expenses are estimated at $3,800. ASU has found that most families already have indirect costs (i.e., clothing, laundry, etc.) accounted for in their normal family budget so you may not need to accept loans. Loans do require repayment. ASU wants to take this opportunity to remind you to only borrow loans that you truly need to cover your actual educational expenses. Excessive borrowing can create undue financial burden once repayment begins. </p>
     <p>You must continue to meet all program criteria to maintain your eligibility for this program. Please carefully read through these additional important details related to your participation in the ASU Advantage program:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>You must remain eligible for federal aid to participate in this program. For details, visit <a href="http://www.asu.edu/fa/policies/eligibility_criteria/index.html">www.asu.edu/fa/eligibility</a>.</li>
     <li>You may choose to spend one (1) semester in an ASU sponsored study abroad program. ASU Advantage funding will be used for the Study Abroad semester and will count as one semester towards the eight (8) semester maximum. </li>
     <li>Classes and costs associated with enrollment at any other college are not covered. Exception: Chandler-Gilbert Community College classes that are required as part of the standard arrangement for students in affected programs.</li>
     <li>ASU may verify your FAFSA information. If, after verification, you do not meet the program criteria, you will not be eligible for program participation for that and future semesters. </li>
     <li>You must file a FAFSA each year. If your total family income in any given year exceeds $18,850, you will no longer be considered for this program. However, ASU will make every attempt to award you the best financial aid possible outside of the scope of the ASU Advantage program. </li>
     <li>If you were awarded scholarships or outside resources, you may have annual renewal criteria unique to those awards.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>If you are unable to access your online FAN or you have questions, please call or visit any of our convenient <a href="http://www.asu.edu/fa/contact/">campus locations</a>.<br />
          <br />
          Best wishes for a successful year,<br />
          <br />
