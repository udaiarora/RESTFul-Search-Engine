    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">DISK</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">All disk data sets are fully
    protected unless RACF has been informed otherwise by the owner
    of the data sets. You control whether or not other people can
    access your data. Other people control whether or not you have
    access to their data.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A data set is owned by the person
    whose userid appears in the first part of the data set name.
    Data set naming conventions require a a data set name to conform
    with either the TSO or the WYLBUR naming convention. For the
    TSO naming convention, the data set name begins with the userid.
    For the WYLBUR naming convention, the data set name begins with
    the character sequence &quot;WYL.xx.yyy.&quot; where &quot;xx&quot;
    and &quot;yyy&quot; represent the first two and last three characters
    respectively of the owning userid.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you, the owner of a disk data
    set, choose to have exclusive access to the data set, you need
    do nothing. The default protection for a disk data set permits
    only the owner of the data set to have access. It is only when
    you wish to allow other people access to your data sets that
    you need to take any special action. The special action consists
    of executing RACF commands, either via ISPF option 9.R (recommended),
    via the TSO command line, or via a batch job.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You can allow other userids to
    have the following types of access to your data sets:</FONT></P>

    <PRE>  NONE    - no access allowed
  READ    - allowed read access
  UPDATE  - allowed read and write access
  CONTROL - same as UPDATE for all data sets except VSAM data sets;
            for VSAM data sets this provides the same function as
            a CONTROL password
  ALTER   - allowed read, write, rename and scratch access</PRE>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Whenever a disk data set is accessed,
    the system checks to see if the owner of the data set is attempting
    the access. The owner is permitted access; a non-owner receives
    further checking before access is granted or denied.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If a userid is attempting to
    access a disk data set owned by someone else, the system checks
    the RACF data base to determine what type of access, if any,
    the userid is permitted to have. If the userid is on the access
    list for the data set with the proper level of access permitted
    then access is granted. If the userid is not on the access list
    or does not have the appropriate access (for example, trying
    to WRITE when only READ access is permitted) then the system
    checks the universal access code.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The universal access code UACC
    is checked only if the other conditions have failed. The default
    value for UACC is NONE, meaning no one other than the owner can
    access the data set. (If the owner sets the UACC to READ, anyone
    is permitted to read the data set. A UACC value of READ is equivalent
    to the no-password-read or NOPWREAD attribute in a non-RACF environment.)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is possible for a disk data
    set to have more than one access list in addition to having a
    UACC code. There could be a list of userids with WRITE access,
    another list with UPDATE access, and a UACC of READ.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There are several basic disk
    functions you can perform with RACF:</FONT></P>

    <UL>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">add a disk data set profile;
      this defines an entry in the RACF data base which is necessary
      before the protection of a disk data set can be changed</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">delete a disk data set profile;
      this restores full protection for a disk data set</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">change the UACC code in an existing
      data set profile</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">remove selected userids from
      the access list, remove all userids from the access list, add
      userids (and the type of access allowed) to the access list of
      an existing data set profile</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">display a disk data set profile;
      this lists the UACC code and the userids, if any, which are permitted
      access and the type of access allowed</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">search for disk data set profiles;
      this lists the names of the disk data set profiles which you've
      previously established</FONT>
    </UL>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Once a disk data set profile
    has been added to the RACF data base, you can make changes to
    the protection associated with the corresponding data set(s).
    (A discrete profile protects one data set; a generic profile
    may protect many data sets.) A discrete profile will remain in
    the data base until you delete the profile or delete the data
    set. If you delete a data set which has a discrete profile, the
    profile will be automatically deleted. A generic profile will
    remain in the data base until you explicitly delete the profile.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When a data set profile is added
    to the RACF data base, RACF assumes the profile is discrete unless
    the profile name contains &quot;wild card&quot; characters (the
    asterisk and percent symbols). If you want the data set profile
    to be generic and the name does not contain wild card characters,
    you can specify the generic option when you add the profile name
    to the data base. (A generic profile name which does not contain
    wild card characters protects only one data set, the one which
    has the same name as the profile.)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You can use ISPF 9.R to perform
    these functions. If you choose to enter the RACF commands directly,
    either on a TSO command line or in a batch job, the more commonly
    used commands are those shown below.</FONT></P>
