      <h2>Jakubowski set to advance polytechnic campus </h2>
      <p>Gerald S. Jakubowski has been named vice president and provost of the ASU East campus, effective July 15, pending Arizona Board of Regents approval. Jakubowski replaces Charles Backus, who is retiring June 30. The East campus has a polytechnic focus and is transitioning to become the Polytechnic campus. </p>
      <p>Jakubowski has been the dean of the College of Science and Engineering at Loyola Marymount University (LMU) in Los Angeles since 1990. Prior to being named dean at Loyola, Jakubowksi held academic and administrative positions of increasing responsibility at the University of Memphis, University of Toledo and the University of South Alabama. </p>
      <p>During his tenure at LMU, Jakubowski helped raise more than $19 million for a new science and engineering building; increased the level of scholarship, research and consulting conducted by faculty; established endowed chair positions in mathematics and ethics; and raised funds to establish a minority engineering and science program. </p>
      <p>"Gerald Jakubowski is a leader with the capacity to move Arizona State University's Polytechnic campus forward with speed, focus and a commitment to scholarship and teaching, as well as the greater good of the surrounding community," said Michael M. Crow, ASU president. "We're fortunate that he is joining ASU at this critical time in our transformation." </p>
      <p>Jakubowski says he's excited about further developing the campus into a first-class polytechnic institution that will provide students a seamless transition from college into the work force to benefit communities locally and beyond. </p>
      <p align="left">"I am very impressed with the programs that are offered now, the faculty that teach in these programs and the staff that supports them," he says. "The spirit of collegiality among the faculty, staff and students I met overwhelmed me. There are many strengths to build upon and the opportunities are boundless." </p>
      <p align="left">Milton Glick, ASU executive vice president and provost, said, "We are delighted Dr. Jakubowski has agreed to join us. He is a national leader in engineering education and has shown extraordinary achievements in building the College of Science and Engineering at Loyola Marymount University. He has built innovative programs at LMU and has a strong record of increasing diversity." </p>
      <p align="left">Much of Jakubowksi's research has focused on thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer and energy. He has conducted research in the areas of wind energy, pump cavitation and laser Doppler velocimetry, including conducting research at the NASA-Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. He and fellow colleagues have a patent on the "Process for Producing Thin Transparent Gold Coatings." </p>
      <p align="left">Jakubowski is an active member in several professional organizations and advisory boards. He is a past president of the American Society for Engineering Education and served on its board for seven years. He currently serves on the boards of the Society of Automotive Engineers Education Foundation, the Triangle Fraternity Education Foundation, the Engineering Accreditation Commission, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, and the Institute for the Advancement of Engineering. </p>
      <p align="left">In addition, he has received numerous awards and honors from professional organizations and universities, as well as being named a NASA Faculty Fellow and receiving the Dow Outstanding Young Faculty Award. </p>
      <p align="left">Jakubowski has his Ph.D. in engineering science, and his M.S. and B.S. in mechanical engineering, all from the University of Toledo. </p>
