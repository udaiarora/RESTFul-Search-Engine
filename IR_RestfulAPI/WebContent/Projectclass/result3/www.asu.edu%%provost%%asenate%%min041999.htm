<p><b>1. Call to Order.</b>

<p><b>The meeting was called to order by Senate President William Davey

at 3:08 p.m.</b>

<p><b>2. Approval of Previous Minutes (March 22, 1999).</b>

<p><b>The Minutes<i> </i>of the Senate meeting of March 22, 1999 were approved

by voice vote as distributed.</b>

<p><b>3. Announcements and Communications.</b>

<p><b>3.A Senate President's Report (William Davey).</b>

<p><b>I would like to introduce Jennifer Holsman, the new president of

ASASU. She is here today with Paul Frost.</b>

<p><b>I would also like to introduce Dean John Meunier, College of Architecture,

who will update us on the Rio Salado Crossing Proposal, about ASU's plans

for existing property and buildings.</b>

<p><b>3.B. University Provost's Report (Milton Glick).</b>

<p><b>Report on the Biennial Budget. The legislators have said that we

are getting $48 million. $40 million of that is restoration of what was

taken away one month ago. I find that more difficult to accept than the

dollar amount, the fact that people in the field now believe that we, the

three universities, have received this windfall of $48 million. We are

then at about $8 million after restoration funds, and you remember that

this is over two years. That means about $4 million and $4 million. You

have three universities to divide this amount, and the Governor said that

the first million will go to NAU for a Teacher Education Center (since

this was a Governor's priority, that will not count against NAU's proposal)

and that left about $7 million to be split three ways; at ASU that means

three more ways between Main, East, and West.</b>

<p><b>That is the short of it; let me give you the long of it. You recall

we had an $8 million shortfall from our projected tuition this year, which

will carry forward to next year, unless we have a substantial recovery

of student enrollment. The legislature has agreed to backfill $2.5 million

of that $8 million. We received $500,000 for new facilities. We have to

take out of our tuition base about $2.5 million for increased debt service

due to the new building projects that will be going on. There was a faculty

productivity cut; 5% of our faculty base or $6 million. They restored that

$6 million. There was a proposal for the first part of a three-year phaseout

of support for the Law School of $2 million. That was restored. They essentially

took away $8 million, then restored $8 million. There is an out-of-state

travel cut, which remains, of $400,000. They added in salary annualization,

which is the annualization of last year's salaries. They put $350,000 in

a software institute, which was an initiative created by Peter Likins to

have a tri-university software institute. They reduced our fringe benefits

by $90,000, which is a technical correction. The bottom line is that in

the first approximation, we will have as much money to spend this year

as we had last year, with the difference being the shortfall of the tuition,

if we cannot make it up. In addition, there will be a 2% merit-based salary

increase effective April 1, 2000 and another 2% effective April 1, 2001.

The frustrating part of this is that it happened in a year when the state's

economy, and therefore the state's revenues, are booming. They also put

several footnotes on our budget (the three university budgets). One is

although we got rid of TIP; they want us to report to JLBC those data that

were calculated for TIP. Secondly, they want us to go back to different

parts of our budget; twenty-two to one tuition growth and decision package

growth, and the decision package growth will be easy because we have had

almost none. We have had sometimes five years, sometimes ten years, to

audit and show that we spent the money the way they provided it. The problem

with that is that we receive a lump sum budget from the legislature, so

although we ask for particular things, when they appropriate it, it will

be a lump sum. Once it is appropriated, all money is green. That is, we

cannot say readily say that tuition dollars went here, and appropriation

went here and decision packages went here. We can say here are the different

things we did in year X versus year Y. To argue which dollars caused that

to happen would be an accounting artifice because all dollars are green.

Therefore, we are concerned with the complexity of how we fulfill our obligation

to work with the state auditors; we want to be as responsive as possible,

but in fact when you have a lump sum budget, those dollars are really not

segregated but they are aggregated.</b>

<p><b>This is a two-year budget, but since this state has never had a biennial

budget, there is no evidence of what will happen in the second year. Will

the second year really hold as appropriate? Will the whole budget be reopened?

There is certainly better than a 50-50 chance that the budget will be opened,

depending on what happens to revenues. We will be thinking through with

your faculty leaders a strategic approach to the second year.</b>

<p><b>Senator Jacob: What is the current status of the 2.2 multiplier for

the early retirement window and what is the current status of the retroactive

sick leave approval?</b>

<p><b>Provost Glick: The latest information is that they plan to use a

2.1 multiplier rather than a 2.0 multiplier but it will not be a window.

It will be permanent and will retroactively apply to all present retirees.

This could change. What they plan to do is put an inflator on all retirees,

and certainly one that the retirees are deserving of and will appreciate.</b>

<p><b>On sick leave, we have met with the Attorney General's Office and

they have indicated they serious concerns about the way we are trying to

retroactively assign sick leave, but they would like to help us do it in

a way that is legal. One of the possibilities is actually to do individual

(person by person) agreements that all have the same bottom line. We have

sent a letter to them with several options; they have not gotten back to

us but we are also trying to run an amendment in the legislature. We continue

to be committed to trying to do what is fair and equitable, that is to

obtain the same credit for our faculty that NAU and U of A are getting,

but it is not a done deed yet.</b>

<p><b>Senator Jacob: Is it your feeling that there is a set of workable

solutions?</b>

<p><b>Provost Glick: Yes. I think so. I believe we will come out of this

with a workable solution because it is to everyone's advantage. It is to

the faculty's advantage because they will get more retirement and sick

leave payout. It is to the university's advantage because we want our faculty

to be treated equitably with all other faculty in the state. It is to the

state's advantage to avoid litigation if our faculty are treated less well

than the other faculties. There is no agreement yet by the Attorney General

as to which, if any, of our proposals would pass muster. I think they really

do want to help us. They are not trying to find a way to not do this. They

are trying to find a way that is legal and we empathize with that.</b>

<p><b>Senator Jacob: Should people defer retirement this year, in order

to ensure that this benefit might accrue before retirement?</b>

<p><b>Provost Glick: Yes. I think it has to be done this legislative session.

So, before the end of the session, this either will have gotten it done

or will have failed. I would say they should hold off and see what happens.

We are trying to keep Bill Davey informed, and we will try to keep the

present retirees informed as well. One of the problems is that we have

not had anything new to tell them. I believe it has to be done this legislative

session and that is our goal. Again, if there were people who are on the

bubble, if they can wait, if this would be the determining factor, I would

urge them to wait before they make a final decision. I think it has to

be done this fiscal year. Remember that we have some 25 faculty who retired

last year, but they have a different argument. They could say, and in some

cases, it would be true, that we retired because we were told that this

would be true. That gives them some legal obligation. The group ahead does

not have that same situation because everybody knows it is in question.

The arguments are different for the people who have already retired than

for the people who will retire. 3.C ASASU President's Report (Paul Frost).</b>

<p><b>Jennifer Holsman will be the new ASASU President next year and she

is here today. Some of the things that ASASU will focus on next include

figuring out a better way to inform students about what ASASU is doing

for them. I hope that we will get a better voter turnout next year and

get more people involved in the election process. Jenny and several of

her colleagues are working on getting more accurate advisement for students,

and they are excited to work with the Provost and his staff on this issue,

to increase the awareness of students when they come to ASU, to make them

aware of the graduation requirements as quickly as possible.</b>

<p><b>I am pleased that the streamlining graduation requirement proposal

is before you today. I recommend that you pass this proposal.</b>

<p><b>We are pleased to announce that the Insuring Tomorrow Leadership

Conference will be on May 1, in the Wells Fargo Arena and Reverend Jesse

Jackson will be the keynote speaker for the event. This event is free and

open to the public. The speeches will start at 3:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon

but the doors will open at 2:30 p.m.</b>

<p><b>We have named the next director of the Instructor Evaluations Program,

and we can discuss what we are going to do in the future about that project.

Our sense is that the questions that we chose to ask are good ones. I believe

you have a copy of those questions from when we presented the program to

you at a previous meeting. The form in which the data is presented to the

student may not be as effective as it could be. Therefore, we will continue

to work with Dr. Crawford and the Student-Faculty Policy Committee next

fall to find a way to present that data so that it is more meaningful to

students who see it.</b>

<p><b>Senate President Davey: There is no report from the Senate President-elect

today but at our next Senate meeting, he will update us on the SAP initiative

concerning the revision of the Student Information System. There are no

reports from East or West Campus today.</b>

<p><b>4. Open Forum. There were no issues from the floor to come before

the Senate.</b>

<p><b>Senate President Davey: I would like to introduce Dean John Meunier,

College of Architecture and Environmental Design, to address the Senate

concerning the Rio Salado Crossing proposal.</b>

<p><b>A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to tour the crossing

project with the Alumni Association Board of Directors, along with Tempe

Mayor Neil Guiliano. I feel that it is important the general university

have an understanding of what our role is in this project. In addition,

if any of the senators are interested in touring these facilities, contact

me, and I will try to arrange for you to take that tour.</b>

<p><b>Dean John Meunier gave his presentation and senators were told that

if they had further questions to contact him following the Senate meeting

(meunier@asu.edu).</b>

<p><b>5. Unfinished Business (Motions from Senate Committees) (SECOND reading).</b>

<p><b>5.A Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee (Linda Johnson).</b>

<p><b>Senator Johnson read Senate Motion #17 (1998-99): The Curriculum

and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of

a proposal submitted by the General Studies Council to establish a continuous

enrollment requirement in General Studies N1 courses.</b>

<p><b>Rationale: The proposed policy reads as follows:</b>

<p><b><i>All students are expected to have fulfilled the University's N1

requirement by the time they have accumulated 30 hours of credit in residence

at ASU. Any student who has more than 30 hours of resident ASU credit and

has not fulfilled the N1 requirement must enroll in an N1 course or an

appropriate prerequisite course and continue to do so every semester until

the N1 requirement is met. College officers may grant waivers to the immediate

and continual enrollment requirement only when there are scheduling conflicts

detrimental to the student's academic progress.</i></b>

<p><b>The proposal, if enacted, would apply to new students effective fall

2000. This means that all students are expected to complete their math

course within their first two to three semesters of full-time study at

ASU, regardless of whether they are entering freshmen or transfer students.

A student who accumulates more than 30 resident ASU credits and still has

not finished the N1 course must enroll in a math course immediately and

continually until the N1 requirement is satisfied.</b>

<p><b>Senate President Davey: You will recall the Senate had asked that

Vice Provost Bantz and I review this motion. We did revise the rationale,

worked with the principal people to clarify precisely what this resolution

means, and I think it now is much more specific in terms of its definition

and implementation.</b>

<p><b>Senator O'Grady: I am opposed to this motion. I feel that students

should be free to take a math course when they wish.</b>

<p><b>Senator Mayer: I am in favor of this motion. If this motion does

not pass successfully, students may set this math requirement aside and

forget it until their final semester.</b>

<p><b>Senator Linder: I served on the task force that considered the mathematics

requirements and how they were fulfilled at ASU. I recall that we recommended

immediate and continuous enrollment as one of the remedies for</b>

<p><b>failure to complete the Numeracy requirement in a timely manner.

I am pleased to see that recommendation come to fruition and I am, therefore,

in favor of this motion.</b>

<p><b>Senate President Davey: Hearing no further discussion of the motion

we will move to a vote. A yes vote on this motion requires the student

to take their math courses in sequence. Senate Motion #17 passed by voice

vote with one nay vote duly recorded.</b>

<p><b>6. New Business (Committee Reports and New Motions) (FIRST reading).</b>

<p><b>6.A Executive Committee (William Davey).</b>

<p><b>I have one announcement to make from the Executive Committee. The

Senate President is constitutionally required to appoint a committee to

review the Academic Constitution and Bylaws every four years.</b>

<p><b>I have received approval of the Executive Committee to appoint the

following people to the Bylaws Revision Committee for next year. Senate

Parliamentarian John Crawford (Communication) will chair the committee.

I will serve as a consulting member, because I was parliamentarian the

last time the bylaws were reviewed. Secretary of the Senate, Dawn Bates

(English), Michael Stanford (Honors College) and Timothy Karcher, Chair,

Committee on Committees (Center for Solid State Science) will serve. One

interesting aspect of this study will be the study of the status of governance

issues involving Academic Professionals and Lecturers. Michael Stanford

is a Lecturer; Tim Karcher is an Academic Professional. The committee has

been appointed, and they will initially meet on May 6, 1999, begin to do

their work next semester and report back to the Senate in March of 2000,

with any proposed changes to our Academic Constitution and Bylaws.</b>

<p><b>6.B Committee on Committees (Timothy Karcher).</b>

<p><b>The Academic Assembly Election Ballots have been distributed in campus

mail. Senators are asked to remind their colleagues to vote in this election.

The ballots are due back in the Senate Office by April 23, 1999.</b>

<p><b>Regarding the Academic Standing Committee Ballot, we will publicize

the candidates for those committees via email before the next Senate meeting,

and the election will take place at the May 3 Senate meeting.</b>

<p><b>My final announcement is a request for those of you who are leaving

the Senate this year; we still have a large number of units who have not

reported the election of their new senators. Please remind your unit that

there needs to be an election, and to report the results to the Academic

Senate Office (Darby Shaw 965-9245vm).</b>

<p><b>6.C Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee (Linda Johnson).</b>

<p><b>Action Items:</b>

<p><b>6.C.1 Senate Motion #18 was introduced (first reading): The Curriculum

and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of

a proposal from the President's Committee on Streamlining Undergraduate

Requirements. The motion and rationale were distributed to senators with

the agenda, and are available by calling the Academic Senate Office (965-9245

vm). Are there any questions on this proposal?</b>

<p><b>Senator Higgins: I think the proposal does not streamline. It only

creates chaos for Engineering degrees. I am not sure I understand all the

little bits and pieces of it. The only part of our degree right now that

confuses the students is the humanities and social studies requirements.</b>

<p><b>Senator O'Grady: Is the only thing the Senate is doing is voting

on lines 1,2,and 3. Is there no potential to modify the proposal?</b>

<p><b>Senate President Davey: In reality, we have a variety of proposals;

we will be voting on the 15 separate recommendations. These have already

been reviewed by a variety of university committees including the General

Studies Council, the Streamlining Committee itself, and the Senate Executive

Committee. I suspect that if it is the will of the house, we can modify

those recommendations.</b>

<p><b>Senator O'Grady: I have a question on recommendation number four.

It seems to me that each student must have six hours of free electives.</b>

<p><b>Vice Provost Bantz: Recommendation 4 was based upon Paul Frost's

recommendation, that students be given the opportunity to make a choice

in their first and their last years. Your question, Senator O'Grady, has

been asked several times. The committee did not say a student must have

in every program a free elective in the first, the second semester, or

the last two semesters. The reason being is that they recognized in Engineering,

for example, and in Nursing that their final semesters are completely blocked

by the requirements for student teaching. If we believe that we succeed

in the educating our students, as they get to be seniors they will know

better than anyone which course that they need to take in order to advance

their future life as citizens and working adults, and we should be very

careful about blocking off such opportunities. It is an expectation; it

is not a requirement.</b>

<p><b>Paul Frost: Actually, that recommendation was made to me by a friend

who is a Psychology major. He asked me what would I do if I had an opportunity

to change the curriculum, and I said to him, I would have changed the curriculum

last year!</b>

<p><b>Senator O'Grady: My comment is, having stated it this way that a

student should have 6 hours of free electives, it raises the question of

if a student does not take one of these free electives in the first year,

is it then lost, or does it become a free elective in the second, third,

or even fourth year. It seems to me that the way that we are saying this

is that it can be taken at any time. My other comment is that there seems

to be a conflict between recommendation #14 and recommendation #2. Recommendation

#2 seems to say that a major or a college cannot force a student to take

a particular course as part of General Studies. Yet recommendation #14

seems to say that the course apparently called the L2 course, ought to

be a course in the major. It seems to me that if it ought to be a course

in the major, the major ought to be able to specify the course, otherwise

the student can take any L2 course the student wishes and need not take

a course that is required and limited to the major. There seems to be a

direct conflict between recommendation #2 and recommendation #14.</b>

<p><b>Vice Provost Bantz: I can say that is in line with our current situation,

and it begs a good question for language substitution.</b>

<p><b>Senate President Davey: That is a really good point, and if you can

bring back some language that will clarify that or get that to us ahead

of time, we can put it on a slide for the Senate to consider. The streamlining

committee, which included faculty from all our campuses, met for about

a year. There were four open meetings where representatives from each college

from the university participated. We also ran these recommendations by

the General Studies Council, the Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee

and the Executive Committee. They were widely discussed at the open forums

we held. There were over 140 people that attended; every college had a

chance to look at these before their current form. These are not being

imposed upon colleges. Several representatives from Engineering participated

in our discussions. Your view is your view, Senator O'Grady, but I just

wanted to say that we are concerned about the impact that this effort will

have on the professional colleges.</b>

<p><b>Senator Higgins: Can the student use a pre-elective to satisfy a

General Studies requirement?</b>

<p><b>Senate President Davey: Yes they can. This is not the type of debate

that we can have today but yes, they can do this.</b>

<p><b>Senator O'Grady: Is there any estimate out of all these studies as

to how many departments or colleges will to seek exemptions in order to

be accredited?</b>

<p><b>Vice Provost Bantz: We do not have that analysis completed yet but

we can assume, for example, out of the 13 colleges, Engineering and Nursing

will be the most obvious to request exemption. Several of the associate

deans have been working on that analysis.</b>

<p><b>Senate President Davey: At the next Senate meeting, we will debate

this proposal and its merits and go through these recommendations one by

one. We will have a chance to change their wording if necessary.</b>

<p><b>6.C.2 Senate Motion #19 (1998-99) was introduced (first reading):

The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate

approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

to establish a B.S. in Biochemistry. The motion and rationale were distributed

to senators with the agenda, and are available by calling the Academic

Senate Office (965-9245 vm).</b>

<p><b>6.C.3 Senate Motion #20 (1998-99) was introduced (first reading):

The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate

approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

to establish a B.S. in Molecular Biosciences Biotechnology. The motion

and rationale were distributed to senators, are available by calling the

Academic Senate Office (965-9245 vm).</b>

<p><b>6.C.4 Senate Motion #21 (1998-99) was introduced: The Curriculum

and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of

a proposal submitted by the College of Fine Arts to establish a Post Bachelors

Artist Diploma Certificate. The motion and rationale were distributed to

senators with the agenda, and are available by calling the Academic Senate

Office (965-9245 vm).</b>

<p><b>Information Item:</b>

<p><b>6.C.5 Establishment of a concentration: Interdisciplinary Ph.D. in

Curriculum and Instruction: Mathematics Education.</b>

<p><b>Senate President Davey: I would like to introduce Zeke Prust, who

will be taking Hal White's place as President of the ASU Retirees Association.

He will be attending Senate meetings.</b>

<p><b>Our next Senate meeting will be held, not in the Great Hall but in

the John W. Schwada Office and Classroom Building, which many of you know

as COB. It will be in room A-252, on Monday, May 3, 3:00 p.m.</b>
