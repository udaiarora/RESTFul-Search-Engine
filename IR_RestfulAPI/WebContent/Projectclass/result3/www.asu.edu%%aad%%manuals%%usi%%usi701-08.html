Services involve a variety of language modes, including American Sign Language (ASL), Pidgin Signed English (PSE), Signed English, or Oral. These services are provided by qualified, certified staff interpreters, pool interpreters, or in some cases, freelance agency interpreters. Deaf/hard-of-hearing students may use available interpreting services and/or have access to FM radio systems. Additional communication services include Computer-Aided Real Time (CART) and C-print.</p><p>The university is responsible for funding all interpreting services related to all enrolled degree and nondegree students (graduate or undergraduate). These services are provided for all academic courses and course-related activities such as internships, field trips, and cocurricular activities. If the academic or cocurricular program includes expenses (e.g., travel, per diem, and lodging expenses) beyond the actual cost of the disability accommodation, the sponsoring department is responsible for the extra costs.</p><p>Students must provide required disability documentation, which includes a current audiogram. Services are requested in advance through the Disability Resource Center (DRC) disability access consultant.</p><p>All student interpreter requests are processed through the DRC disability access consultant. Requests are processed on a first-come, first-served basis with a priority given to currently enrolled students. The need for interpreters for academic classes takes priority over nonacademic activities.<p>Interpreting services through the DRC are not available for public activities.</p><p>Public, self-supporting university units (e.g., Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium) are responsible for providing their own interpreter services for the general public. This includes nonacademic credit and/or fee-based programs, lectures, classes, workshops, conferences, and activities.</p><p>Nonuniversity units that need interpreters for activities or programs not covered by the DRC interpreter/transliterator services can contact the following agencies:<br><p><table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1><tr><td valign=TOP>Arizona Freelance Interpreting Services (FLIS)</td><td valign=TOP>480/595&#150;9515 V</td><td valign=TOP>480/857&#150;0694 TTY</td></tr><tr><td valign=TOP>Arizona Interpreting Services (AIS)</td><td valign=TOP>480/961&#150;7331 V/TTY 8:00 a.m.&#150;4:00 p.m.</td><br><td valign=TOP>602/851&#150;7635 4:00 p.m.&#150;8:00 a.m. (after hours/emergency)</td></tr><tr><td valign=TOP>Valley Center of the Deaf (VCD)</td><td valign=TOP>602/267&#150;1921 V/TTY</td></tr></table><p>Some of these agencies require as much as one-week advance notice.
