      <h2>College hosts conference to focus spotlight on dropouts</h2>
      <p>        For many years, mounting evidence has suggested that young people who
          do not finish high school face many more problems later in life than
          their counterparts who graduate. But, while national leaders have demanded
          that schools, families and communities make a concerted effort to ensure
          that students complete high school, the dropout rate remains high.        </p>
      <p>In an effort to crystallize the issues around high school completion
          and dropouts in the Southwest, ASU, together with the Harvard University
          Equity Project and colleagues from the University of Texas at San Antonio,
          the University of Texas at El Paso and the University of New Mexico
        will host the "Southwest Conference on Enhancing School Completion."
        The event,
          to be held Nov. 7 - 8 at ASU, will feature both regional and national
          experts on the subject.</p>
      <p>"Our focus will be on the risk factors for dropping
          out that are specific to populations in the Southwestern United States,
          and on determining
          concrete strategies that schools and families can use to help students
          complete high school and pursue post-secondary education at significantly
          higher rates," says Eugene Garcia, vice president of university-school
          partnerships and dean of the College of Education at ASU.</p>
      <p>"Students drop
          out for many reasons, some of which are perceived as being good ones
          - to help support their families, for instance," Garcia says.
          "But, the consequences of leaving are becoming more and more severe,
          as the gap between dropouts and more educated people continues to widen." </p>
      <p>Consequently, educators and scholars from across the United States and
          Mexico are coming to Tempe not only to examine the factors and circumstances
          that most significantly impact graduation and dropping out, but also
          to craft viable solutions to ultimately boost graduation rates and
        college enrollment among students from the Southwest. </p>
      <p>Gary Orfield of Harvard
          University will present "The national perspective on school completion:
          New numbers for the Southwest."</p>
      <p>Also delivering
          a keynote address will be Dennis Hoffman and Arthur Blakemore of ASU's
          College of Business. "The economics of dropout: The complexities
        of uncovering the real costs," is the topic to be explored in their address.</p>
      <p>Donna
          Deyhle of the University of Utah, will discuss the "Native American
        perspective on school completion," while Ursula Casanova of ASU and her
          co-presenters Vi Florez, Harriet Roma and Josefina Tinajero will lead
          conference attendees in the exploration of "Exemplary high schools
        in
        three states," during their keynote address.</p>
      <p>The conference is open to
          all. The registration fee is $100, and a special rate of $25 will be
          available for a limited number of full-time students
          who wish to attend the conference. Additional information and online
        registration is available at (http://bers.asu.edu/swc).</p>
