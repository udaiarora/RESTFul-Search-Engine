        The Labriola Center hosted a book signing and reception for Regents&#8217; 
        Professor of History, Peter Iverson and Navajo photographer, Monty Roessel, 
        on October 28, 2002.

        <font size="-3">LAB FILM S104:445 </font>
      <p> Two books were available: <em>Din&eacute;: A History of the Navajos</em> and 
        <em>For Our Navajo People: Letters, Speeches, and Petitions, 1900-1960</em> 
        (University of New Mexico Press, 2002).

        <font size="-3">LAB FILM S104:422</font> 
      <p> Some 80 guests attended, including the Center&#8217;s generous benefactors, 
        Frank and Mary Labriola.

        <font size="-3">LAB FILM S104:429</font> 
      <p> Roessel and Iverson both spoke about their work on the volumes. Roessel, 
        who is also Executive Director of the Rough Rock Community School in Chinle, 
        Arizona, provided 32 spectacular color photographs of people and scenes 
        in the Navajo Nation for <em>Din&eacute;</em>, and edited the historical 
        photos for the second volume.
<p>
        Iverson said that he tried to let the Navajo voices speak for themselves 
        in an effort to portray the Navajo as people in control of their destiny 
        and not as victims of history.
      <p> <em>Din&eacute;</em> is a comprehensive history of the Navajo people, 
        traced from origins to the beginning of the twenty-first century. It is 
        based on extensive archival research, traditional accounts, and first-hand 
        information.
      <p> <em>For Our Navajo People</em> features one hundred documents written 
        by Din&eacute; men, women, and children speaking for themselves and on 
        behalf of their communities. Most were previously unpublished and provide 
        a uniquely moving portrait of the Navajo people during an era in which 
        they were fighting to defend their lands and to build the Navajo Nation.

      <p> Hot off the press from Native Images Editions, is a magnificent production: 
        <em>The Creation As the Maidu Told It - p&uacute;ktim</em>. It reproduces 
        the account of the creation of the Mountain Maidu people of northeastern 
        California. Linguist and scholar, William Shipley, fluent in the language, 
        re-translated the hand-written interview of Maidu story teller, H&aacute;nc&#8217;ibyjm. 
        Dixon had tediously recorded this small part of Maidu folklore back in 
        the early 1900s. This work is the first publication of any part of the 
        text in the original language. It also includes the English translation. 
      <p>
      Noted California artist, Daniel Stolpe, created thirteen magnificent woodcuts 
      to accompany the story of Creation, which features Coyote and Earthmaker. 
      Stolpe &#8220;chose the relief medium of woodblock because this technique 
      was used for printing the first carved pictures in books.&#8221; He added 
      that &#8220;wood grain is very expressive echoing the colors of creation 
      as well as giving visual vibration to the text.&#8221;<p>
      The Labriola copy, signed by the artist, is number 3 of 65 copies. It was 
      printed in Weiss Roman and Doulos linguistic fonts on Arches Cover White 
      and printed by Peter Koch Printers, Berkeley. It features full linen, hand 
      sewn binding with cover pastedown by Taurus Binder of San Francisco.

      <p> Honored guests this year were a number of Navajo Code Talkers, who first 
        devised the code that was used in the Pacific and hastened the end of 
        World War II. Roger Willie, co-star of the movie, <em>Windtalkers</em>, 
        was present along with Mervin Ringlero, one of the few American Indian 
        saddle makers who still totally handcraft and custom fit each saddle for 
        both horse and rider. He has made saddles for many actors including Gary 
        cooper and President Ronald Reagan.</td>
