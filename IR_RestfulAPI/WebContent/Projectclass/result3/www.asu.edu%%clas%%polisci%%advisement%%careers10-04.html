&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sooner or later every political science major confronts the question: "What can I do with a degree in Political Science?"  In one form or another, this same question is asked by history, English,  sociology,  anthropology, and other social science majors.  As part of the liberal arts curriculum, these disciplines do not claim to train students for specific careers and occupations.  And yet, as a result of their studies in these disciplines, students acquire a variety of skills which are essential for success in a wide range of careers and occupations.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One effective answer to this question is to list some of the positions held by ASU graduates with degrees in political science.  A short and very incomplete list would include:
<p>
o  Director of Undergraduate Admissions, major state university<br>
o  Financial consultant and advisor<br>
o  Television network news broadcaster<br>
o  Political consultant, Washington, D.C.<br>
o  Newspaper editorial-page columnist<br>
o  Medical doctor<br>
o  Television sportscaster<br>
o  Dentist<br>
o  Director of Water Resources for a western state<br>
o  Superior Court judge<br>
o  Tribal President for a Native American tribe<br>
o  Budget Director for a western state<br>
o  Director of Government Relations for a public utility<br>
o  President of a business corporation<br>
o  Owner of a private business<br>
o  State legislator<br>
o  Member of Congress<br>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the list could go on and on, 
it is important to keep in mind that a degree in political science prepares 
one for a career in a multiplicity of fields.  The one common element in the 
above list of careers is that each occupant of the position graduated from 
college with a degree in political science.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that a student's 
major is only one part of his or her education, and that the courses taken 
in areas other than the major will have a significant impact on what career 
a person pursues.  Think about it: of all the courses you will take to graduate 
from ASU, about 25% will be in political science.  So your major is only a 
part - albeit an essential  part -  of your education.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to realize that the 
professional and business world is comprised of positions occupied by people 
with particular skills.  These range from analytical skills to computational 
and computer-related skills, from communication skills (both verbal and 
written communication) to "people" skills.  So the real questions are:  
"When you graduate from ASU, what skills will you have?" and "How can you 
take courses - both in your major and in other areas - that will help you 
develop these skills?"  The best time to begin thinking about these 
questions and developing your answers to them is in your first year in 
college - not a month or two before you graduate.
<p>
Some of the more common career fields open to political science majors include:
<p>

o  federal bureaucracy<br>
o  state and local government<br>
o  legal profession<br>
o  journalism<br>
o  business and educational administration<br>
o  higher education/teaching/research<p>

<center><b>Federal Government</b></center>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Careers within the federal government vary widely and include position such 
as a teacher of government in an overseas school for U.S. military children; 
a personnel specialist at a U.S. foreign embassy;  a  staff member of a Congressional 
committee; a  staff aid to a member of Congress; a specialist in environmental 
protection at a regional office outside of Washington, D.C.; or an economist engaged 
in long range planning and resource allocation for the Department of Energy.  To prepare 
for a job in the federal government, students should take an array of American 
politics courses as well as courses emphasizing research design, statistics, and 
computer utilization.  Courses in public policy and  public administration are 
also useful preparation for a career in the federal government.  For those 
interested in federal government jobs overseas or that focus on relations with 
foreign governments and societies should also take courses in international 
relations and comparative politics.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are uncertain about what kind of a government job might interest you,
 consider consulting the <i>U.S. Government Manual</i>, published by the 
 U.S. Government Printing Office.  The Manual is available online ASU's 
 Hayden Library government documents section (GP 3.35:GOVMANUL).   
 The Manual includes information about federal government departments, 
 agencies, and offices; provides telephone numbers; and lists national, 
 regional, and field offices.  Two other useful sources published by the 
 Congressional Quarterly are the <i>Federal Yellow Book</i>  (Hayden 
 Library reference JK6 .F45) and the <i>Washington Information 
 Directory</i> (Hayden Library reference AS29.W37W3x).  In addition, 
 you may want to visit the web site of the U.S. Office of Personnel 
 Management for information about openings in federal agencies, 
 at: <A href="http://www.usajobs.opm.gov/"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.usajobs.opm.gov/</A></font>.  
 Not only are job listings available, but instructions about how to apply 
 for a federal position and other information useful for securing a 
 federal position may be accessed on this web site.  Federal government 
 jobs listed at <A href="http://www.jobsfed.com/"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.jobsfed.com/</A></font>,

 <p>
 <center><b>State and Local Government</b></center>
 <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State and local governments are expected to 
 continue to expand significantly in the next century and personnel needs are likely to 
 grow as well.  Among the variety of state-level employment opportunities are: highway 
 safety, soil conservation, consumer protection, industrial development and manpower 
 training, water pollution, transportation licensing, intergovernmental relations and 
 public administration,  statistics/data use-computer programming,  urban and regional 
 planning,  housing (zoning),  economic development,  public safety,  public welfare 
 and community organization.  In addition, as state and local governments grow so too 
 will public and private interest groups seeking to influence government policy 
 decisions.  In preparing for a position in state and local government, students 
 will benefit from courses in public administration, budgeting, intergovernmental 
 relations, public policy, and in state and local government.  Graduate training 
 in public policy, public administration, and in politics coupled with courses 
 emphasizing research design and statistical methodology will also be useful.
 <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good place to search for a position in state or local 
  government is the  state jobs web site at <a href="http://www.governmentjobs.com"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.governmentjobs.com</a></font>  
  Because not all states have listings at <a href="http://www.statejobs.com"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.statejobs.com</a></font>, 
  search for a job listing in a state, county, or city of your choice by using a search engine such as 
 <a href="http://www.profusion.com/"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.profusion.com</a></font>, <a href="http://www.hotbot.com"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.hotbot.com/</a></font>, or <a href="http://www.Google.com"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.Google.com</a></font>.  
 Another potentially useful site is the MultiState web site at <a href="http://www.multistate.com/"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.multistate.com/</a></font> , 
 which has links to major cities, including Houston, Los Angles, Phoenix, and Seattle.  
 If you are interested in an Arizona State government job or a position in the Phoenix 
 metropolitan area, for example, consult. <a href="http://207.21.203.96/az.html"><font color=#0000ff>http://207.21.203.96/az.html</a></font> for state government 
 positions; <a href="http://www.ci.phoenix.az.us/"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.ci.phoenix.az.us/</a></font> for the City of Phoenix; <a href="http://www.tempe.gov"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.tempe.gov/</a></font>, 
 for the City of Tempe; <a href="http://www.maricopa.gov/"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.maricopa.gov/</a></font> for Maricopa County.  
 Finally, doing  an internship with a federal, state, or local agency is not only a good way to discover 
 whether or not you want a government career, but it may also provide an entree into a position after graduation.
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more information on seeking federal, state, and 
  local government employment, consultation with the university career services office is advisable.
<p>
 <center><b>Law</b></center>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most lawyers are in private practice, many others 
work for large corporations, labor unions, trade associations,  or for federal, state, and 
local government agencies.  Many with legal training also pursue satisfying careers in politics, 
corporate management, legal publishing, public administration, and in the judiciary.  A degree 
in political science, coupled with an emphasis on developing effective oral and written communication 
skills and an ability to think critically, is excellent preparation for one seeking a law degree.  
Pre-law students majoring in political science are encouraged to take courses in constitution law, 
in the law and society, and  the Supreme Court.  These courses not only provide an understanding of 
the relationship between the law and other institutions in society, but they are also useful in 
helping one decide whether or not to seek a career in law.   You should also consult with the 
department's pre-law advisor, Professor Valerie Hoekstra, whose office is on the sixty floor of 
Lattie F. Coor Hall, Room 6770.  You can also phone her at: 480-965-6627.
<p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those planning to attend law school 
should consult <i>The Official Guide to U.S. Law Schools</i>, published each March 
by the Law School Admissions Council/Law School Admission Services.  Check 
the ASU bookstore for the <i>Guide</i> or order it from Law Services, Box 2000, 
Newton, PA, 18940.  The <i>Guide</i> is also available at Hayden Library reference and 
on reserve at the Law Library (KF273 .A87).
<p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from undergraduate grade point 
average, performance on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) is an 
important criterion for admissions to law school.  The LSAT focuses on 
one's analytical and logical reasoning abilities and on reading 
comprehension.  Consult the <i>Law Services Information Book</i> (LSIB) for 
information about the LSAT.  The LSIB is available free of charge at 
most law schools and universities and may also be obtained from Law 
Services, Newton, PA.  Law Services also publishes LSAT test preparation materials.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may also 
find it useful to visit various web sites with additional information on 
attending law school. Several places to start are: <a href="http://www.law.stetson.edu/career/handbook.htm"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.law.stetson.edu/career/handbook.htm</a></font>, 
which is Stetson University College of Law's Career Services Handbook.  The Boston College Law School Locator 
at <a href="http://www.bc.edu/offices/careers/gradschool/law/lawlocator/"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.bc.edu/offices/careers/gradschool/law/lawlocator/</a></font> 
lists law schools by their admission standards based on a cross-tabulation of 
undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores. The Law School Admission Council's web page 
is: <a href="http://www.lsac.org/"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.lsac.org/</a></font>. Also, the College of New Jersey Pre-Law web page provides information on the 
LSAT and other useful information about attending law school, 
<a href="http://fair.intrasun.tcnj.edu/index.html"><font color=#0000ff>http://fair.intrasun.tcnj.edu/index.html</a></font>.

<p>
 <center><b>Education/Teaching/Research</b></center>
<p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different levels of training are 
required for teaching with a political science degree at the post-secondary, 
secondary, and primary educational levels.  Those seeking a career at the 
post-secondary level, which includes universities, four-year colleges, and 
two-year community colleges, should in most instances pursue a Ph.D. in 
political science.  Keep in mind that universities and colleges often differ 
in the amount of teaching and research one is expected to do.  At ASU and 
other major public and private universities that are considered research 
institutions the division of labor is (roughly) 40 percent teaching (two courses per 
semester), 40 percent research, and 20 percent service.  At non-research 
institutions, such as small liberal arts colleges, more time is devoted to 
teaching and service and less to research.  And two-year community colleges 
generally give heavy emphasis to teaching, with little or no emphasis on 
research.                         
<p>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching careers at the 
pre-collegiate level require students to pursue a broad-based curriculum 
that may include political science courses along with a wide variety of 
educational and social studies courses that provide a solid general 
education background.  Often those wanting to teach social studies in 
secondary and primary schools are able to organize their curriculum to 
include a variety of political science courses that emphasize government, 
politics, political theory, and law.  A focus on political science courses 
is also good preparation for pre-collegiate educational administration.                                                              
<p>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department participates with 
the College of Education in offering a Bachelor of Arts in Education for 
secondary education majors who want a focus in political science.  For more 
information on this program, consult p. 428 in the Arizona State University 
General Catalog, 2000-2001 and/or consult with Professor W. Thomas Keating, 
the Director of Undergraduate Advisement, who is located in Lattie Coor Hall 
Room 6698 and can be reached by phone at 480-965-1336 or by email at 
William.Keating@asu.edu. A good way to find web sites with information on 
careers in education is to go to are <a href="http://www.google.com"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.google.com</a></font>
and search on key words such as teaching+jobs.  More specific information about 
job openings can sometimes be obtain by visiting the web site of a 
particular school or school district.  The Mesa, Arizona, public school 
system, for example, has a web page at <a href="http://www.mpsaz.org/main2"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.mpsaz.org/main2/</a></font>, 
as does the Maricopa County Community Colleges at <a href="http://www.maricopa.edu/"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.maricopa.edu/</a></font>.  
Both contain information about employment opportunities.  For other school 
web sites visit <a href="http://www.ade.state.az.us/"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.ade.state.az.us/</a></font>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduates with a degree in political 
science, especially those who have M.A. and Ph.D. degrees, are often well 
trained for research positions in government agencies such as the Library of 
Congress, congressional and state legislative committees, the Office of 
Management and Budget, and the Department of Defense; or in public interest 
"think tank" organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the Brookings 
Institution; or in private corporations such as Booz-Allen, and Hamilton and 
other Washington, D.C.- based research entities popularly referred to as 
"Beltway Bandits."  Many of the "think tanks" are listed with a brief 
description at <a href="http://www.nira.go.jp/ice/"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.nira.go.jp/ice/</a></font>.   
Another "think tanks"  listing with an indication of political ideology, 
publications, and goals is at <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/psthink.html"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/psthink.html</a></font>.  
In addition, political scientists increasingly have found positions in the 
area of campaign management and political polling.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students interested in a research or 
a campaign management career should take courses on research methodology, 
statistics, multivariate analysis, survey research, and research design in 
addition to courses in a substantive area of interest.  Students should 
also be at ease using the Internet for research purposes.  For example, 
one interested in doing political risk analysis in Asia should take courses 
in Asian languages and the politics, history, and cultures of Asia, while 
another interested in running a U.S. Senate campaign would structure a 
curriculum with an emphasis on American politics and history.  Both, however, 
should have preparation in variety of research methodologies and technical 
skills.  
<p>
 <center><b>Journalism</b></center>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalization has been a boon for 
political scientists interested in journalism and journalists interested in 
political affairs at home and abroad.  For a political scientist interested 
in a career in journalism, an ability to write quickly and with clarity is 
a must.  Preparation for seeking a job in journalism should include a 
variety of courses in  English, journalism, communications, and in other 
departments that emphasize writing.  Students should also look for 
opportunities to serve on college newspapers and/or seek experience writing 
for local newspapers or community newsletters to gain experience in research, 
writing, and meeting deadlines.   Political science majors should also take 
courses in American national, state, and local politics that provide a broad 
background on American society and politics as well as an array of courses in 
international relations and comparative politics that provide insights into 
foreign societies and cultures and the relations between and among nations.  
Courses in the areas of public administration, campaigns and elections, and 
public finance are also helpful.  
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students interested in a career 
in journalism (including broadcast journalism) may profit from contacting 
the Dow Jones Newspaper Fund, Inc., P.O. Box 300, Princeton, N.J. 08543-0300 
and the Radio-Television Directors Association, 1000 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20036.  Also useful is <a href="http://www.asne.org/kiosk/careers/carerdet.htm"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.asne.org/kiosk/careers/carerdet.htm</a></font>, 
a web site titled, "Careers in Journalism."  The site has information on 
finding newspaper internships, newspaper jobs, what it is like to work for 
a small newspaper, tips on preparing for a career in newspapers, and a link 
to newspaper job resources.  The National Diversity Newspaper Job Bank can 
be accessed at  <a href="http://www.newsjobs.com/"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.newsjobs.com/</a></font>.  The Newspaper 
Association of America is located at <a href="http://www.naa.org/"><font color=#0000ff>http://www.naa.org/</a></font>, 
and it has a "Hotlinks" button to newspapers throughout the United States.

<p>
 <center><b>Business and Corporation Management</b></center>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps as many as one-third of 
political science graduates find employment in small businesses and 
corporations in areas such as public relations, finance, marketing, human 
resources, and advertising.  Increasingly, businesses must interact with 
governments - national, state, and local - at home and abroad.  With an 
understanding of government, politics, and bureaucracy, coupled with good 
writing and analytical skills, political science graduates are well 
positioned to work in the business and corporate world.   Moreover, just 
as in seeking a research career in government and the private sector, 
political science students interested in a career in business should 
structure their curriculum to include courses in math, statistics, 
accounting, and computer utilization.  A diversity of political science 
courses in American politics, public administration and policy, 
international relations, and comparative politics are important preparation 
for an increasingly global business environment.  In addition, students 
should consider taking courses that provide fluency in foreign language 
and an understanding of different religions and cultures.   Academic work 
outside of political science should include courses in business, marketing, 
and finance.  
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because scores of businesses 
recruit on campus annually, students should visit ASU's Career Services 
Offices for information about business career opportunities or visit 
the web site <a href="http://career.asu.edu/"><font color=#0000ff>http://career.asu.edu/</a></font> 
and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences web site <a href="http://clas.asu.edu/students/clasworks/"><font color=#0000ff>http://clas.asu.edu/students/clasworks/</a></font>.
