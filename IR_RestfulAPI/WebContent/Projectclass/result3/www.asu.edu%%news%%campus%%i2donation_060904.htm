      <h2>W. P. Carey School of Business Receives Multi-million Dollar Supply Chain Software Donation from i2            </h2>
      <p>The W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University has received a donation of software and services from i2 Technologies (OTC: ITWO), a leading provider of closed-loop supply chain management solutions. The multi-million dollar donation from i2 will augment an IBM-sponsored joint research and teaching initiative in supply chain management which links Arizona State University (ASU) with research laboratories at the Eli Broad College of Business at Michigan State University and the Smeal College of Business at Pennsylvania State University. A fourth laboratory, at the Smurfit School of Business, University College, Dublin, will be dedicated this summer.
      <p>"Partnerships between industry-leading supply chain solution providers and university leaders in research, education and executive development can be used to prepare tomorrow's supply chain leaders," said Joseph Carter, chairman of the department of supply chain management at the W. P. Carey School. "Curriculum enhancements made possible by this initiative can ultimately enhance the ability of businesses to optimize and synchronize dynamic supply chain activities."
      <p>The donation includes the following i2 solutions:
      <ul>
        <p>
        <li><strong>i2 Supply Chain Strategist (Tactician) </strong>, a scenario-based strategic planning tool that supports key strategic decisions at each stage of the supply chain, from raw materials procurement through finished goods distribution.
        <li><strong>i2 Supply Chain Planner </strong>, a modeling tool designed to help companies achieve a high degree of customer satisfaction while working within the constraints imposed on their business. i2 Supply Chain Planner creates an executable plan that is truly optimized and spans different divisions within a company, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, and warehousing.
        <li><strong>i2 Demand Planner </strong>, a forecasting tool that can optimize collaboration, collection, and rationalization of multiple forecasting inputs through a user-friendly interface combined with industry-leading statistical techniques and unlimited causal factors.
        <li><strong>i2 Factory Planner </strong>, a decision support solution for production planning and scheduling that simultaneously manages material and capacity constraints to develop feasible operating plans for plants, departments, production lines, or work centers. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>"Our customers can focus on increasing profitability via supply chain efficiencies that improve decision making and the ability to respond to rapidly changing market conditions," said i2 CEO Sanjiv Sidhu. "Through our donation and support for this inter-university program, we can expose future business leaders to solutions and processes that we believe are essential to helping companies achieve the highest levels of efficiency."
      <p>Supply chain management Professor Craig Kirkwood, who is facilitating development of the project at the W. P. Carey School, said that the inter-university effort is expected to result in new knowledge in the area of supply chain excellence. "The nature of a supply chain, which connects suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers, is collaborative and can benefit from planning solutions like those from i2," Kirkwood explained. "We are exploring distinct ways for i2 supply chain solutions to serve as vehicles for teaching more about optimizing supply chains."
