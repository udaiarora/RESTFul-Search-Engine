Second issue has index.  Johann Bauhin was the son
 of a French physician, Johann Bauhin the Elder, a
 native of Amiens.  Bauhin the Elder retreated to
 Switzerland to escape religious persecution; both
 his sons were born there.  Johann became acquainted
 with the foremost botanists of his day, studying
 botany at Basle under Leonhart Fuchs, and accompanying
 Konrad Gesner on a trip through the Alps.  His work
 on the Historia was such an ambitious undertaking that
 he did not live to see it finished.  It fell to his
 son-in-law, Jean-Henri Cherler, who worked with Bauhin
 for many years on this work, to see that it
 was published.  It was edited by Chabrey and contained
 clear, detailed and accurate descriptions of 5,000 plants,
 including their ecology.  An earlier, abridged
 edition of this work was produced in 1619, but
 this three volume set constitutes the complete work.
