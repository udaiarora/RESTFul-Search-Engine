      <h2>Branding, names to evolve with campuses <strong></strong></h2>
      <p align="left">The design plan for ASU's evolution as a premier national research institution, presented by President Michael Crow at an all-university meeting on April 8, calls for major changes in how the university is organized. </p>
      <p align="left">At the center of the design plan is the move to a college/school-centric model, in which colleges and schools are empowered as entrepreneurial entities in control of their own destinies. This will involve a deliberate and planned clustering of programs on each campus around a related theme and mission. </p>
      <p align="left">To coincide with the design around the college/school-centric model, Crow announced the plan for new campus names - to move the university away from the hierarchical model of a "main" campus and perceived lesser campuses distributed across metropolitan Phoenix. The impending name changes have created a buzz, particularly among those who create publications, marketing materials, Web sites, and other communication items with a graphic identity. </p>
      <p align="left">The most frequent question has been "are the new names official yet." The answer is "no, not yet." </p>
      <p align="left">Before they can be official, the proposed name changes must be approved by an appropriate authoritative body, such as the Arizona Board of Regents. The necessary approval is not expected until at least July 1. </p>
      <p align="left">In order to assist with the appropriate graphic usage of the new names, the university Graphic Standards Manual will be updated with clear guidelines for incorporating them into ASU's graphic identity. </p>
      <p align="left">In addition, Linda Pedersen has joined the Office of Public Affairs as graphic standards specialist, reporting to Assistant Vice President Nancy Neff. </p>
      <p>"An important component of the university's graphic standards is education, and Linda will spend part of her time meeting with individuals and groups to explain not only the specifics of our graphic standards, but also the relationship between the graphic standards and maintaining and strengthening ASU's overall brand," says Neff. </p>
      <p>Neff says there is a tendency for individual programs to want a secondary logo as part of their graphic identity. </p>
      <p>"We do a lot of reminding that secondary logos are not allowed below the college level," says Neff. "It's all part of the education process. Secondary logos do a disservice, because they dilute the primary logo and cause confusion, which defeats the purpose of the communication piece." </p>
      <p>Terri Shafer, director of marketing and public affairs in the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, says once people understand what makes a strong brand, they realize that secondary logos are a liability and not an asset. </p>
      <p>"There are no strong brands that combine more than one logo. Pick any recognized brand - Nike, Intel, Coca Cola, Mercedes - if it's a strong product or organization brand, it's built around a single logo. Adding a secondary logo tells the public you're a marketing amateur," she says. </p>
      <p>"There are great creative things you can do with fonts, color and non-logo-related graphic design elements to build an attractive and distinct identity that strengthens the ASU brand and, ultimately, your impact with target audiences," she adds. "People make a big mistake when they fail to explore those options and create secondary logos instead." </p>
      <p>That's not to say company logos and graphics are never updated or refreshed, or even changed in some cases. But that should never be undertaken without thorough research behind the decision. </p>
