        Media may contact Prof. Waller
        directly. </p>
      <h2>Americans' stress level high, says ASU Professor </h2>
      <p> At this moment in time, Americans are faced
        with an unprecedented level of uncertainty. Between dwindling financial
        resources, corporate downsizing, threats of terror and war-not to mention
        normal daily challenges-feeling stressed out is a normal response to
        exposure of these acute and chronic stressors according to Margi Waller,
        an associate professor in the School of Social Work, at Arizona State
        University in Tempe.</p>
      <p>Waller says it is important to recognize that most Americans are probably
        experiencing the impact of these stressors, even if they don't feel distressed
        at the moment. </p>
      <p>"Ambiguity is one of human beings' least favorite things and Americans'
        are particularly vulnerable because we have so little practice dealing
        with this level of ambiguity in our lives and particularly, about our
        safety. We are dealing not only with this fear, but also with the real
        anxiety about the current level of uncertainty in our lives, " Waller
        said.</p>
      <p>Chronic stress is like an illness that requires management as opposed
        to acute stress that calls for mobilization, she says. </p>
      <p>Chronic stress may cause sleeplessness, memory problems, worry and anxiety,
        sexual problems, hair loss, chronic tiredness, and a change in eating
        habits and appetite. In some cases, suffers may feel overwhelmed" or
        "out of control", and may be more mistake or accident-prone. Chronic
        stress is also associated to an increase in work-related absenteeism.</p>
      <p>Given the right amount of stress, everyone is susceptible to chronic
        stress serious enough that it requires professional help. Knowing how
        to identify the symptomatic road signs is critical to maintaining ones
        physical and mental health says Waller.</p>
      <p>Coping with stressors is not a one-size-fits-all process. She says coping
        styles are idiosyncratic and each individual should employ techniques
        that work for them. However, while everyone's coping style is unique,
        there are some basic practices that seem to work well for most people,
        Waller says. </p>
      <p>Generativity. Order your personal priorities, giving the most energy
        to the things and people that give your life meaning and purpose. Most
        of us have a finite amount of energy, so prioritizing is important to
        ensure that you are not needlessly over-extending yourself, she said.</p>
      <p>Attend to the Basics. Basics include body maintenance, including sleep,
        healthy diet and exercise. Waller also says in times of chronic stress
        it is equally important to schedule some down time. "Many people respond
        to stress by trying to go into high gear and produce more, but this is
        not generally a healthy response. If anything, we should commit to and
        produce less while reminding ourselves that down time is necessary maintenance
        to prevent additional health problems relating to failure to take care
        of ourselves."</p>
      <p>        Nurturing. Treat yourself to special things. Laugh, dance and sing. Take
          a walk or a long relaxing bath, putter in your garden, or go to a movie
          or spend the weekend fishing. "As any child will tell you play is a
          restores body, mind and spirit," she said.</p>
      <p>Social Support. Thirty years of research has confirmed that social support
        strengthens individuals, families and communities, says Waller. "People
        with social support cope better than who are socially isolated." Increase
        the time spent with people you feel good around, and let trusted people
        know how you feel and talk about what is bothering you. Likewise, minimize
        the time spent with people you feel stressed around and limit your exposure
        to hostile and fear engendering messages.</p>
      <p>Distract yourself with purposeful activity. Rather than shutting down
        in front of the television set, Waller suggests it is healthier to engage
        in planning a trip (even if you can't take it right away) or helping
        someone in some small way. Engaging in an activity that makes you feel
        good inside can work wonders, she said.</p>
