      <h2>ASU-Maricopa Alliance gears up for fall roll out </h2>
      <p>The first phase of the ASU-Maricopa Alliance is set to roll out this fall with three academic pilot programs, including a program targeting honors students at Mesa Community College and Chandler-Gilbert Community College. </p>
      <p>ASU and the Maricopa Community Colleges announced the alliance last fall to enhance and increase the number of associate and baccalaureate degrees awarded. </p>
      <p>Since the initial announcement of the alliance, teams of educators from both institutions have been working at an accelerated pace to prepare for the fall 2004 launch. </p>
      <p>"This alliance is another example of how we can partner with the community colleges to break down the barriers to successful completion of degree programs," says ASU President Michael Crow, who has agreed to establish the academic home for the alliance in ASU's newly created University College. </p>
      <p>Crow says collaboration between the university and the community colleges is critical in order to significantly increase the number of degrees being granted in Arizona. ASU and the Maricopa Community Colleges, over the past several years, have worked together to improve the traditional 2+2 transfer program, making it a more seamless transition for students transferring from the community colleges to the university. </p>
      <p>The alliance goes significantly beyond the traditional transfer arrangement, offering eligible students co-enrollment and all of the benefits both institutions have to offer in guiding students through their higher education pursuit. </p>
      <p>"The Maricopa Community Colleges are committed to providing innovative programs that keep students engaged in learning," says Rufus Glasper, chancellor of the Maricopa Community Colleges. "More than half of all the baccalaureate degree recipients at ASU already have credits from one of our ten colleges. The alliance is designed to help students realize they can achieve high academic goals and that we are here to support them in doing that." </p>
      <p>"The ASU-Maricopa Alliance will provide the structure and opportunity for seamless transition that can help students keep their sights focused on academic excellence, without being burdened with administrative paperwork," says Betsy Hertzler, district honors coordinator at the Maricopa Community Colleges. "An example of this streamlined approach is the development of an Internet portal that will allow students to access the community colleges and ASU, enabling students to obtain services and support from the institutions through one site." </p>
      <p>Christine Wilkinson, senior vice president at ASU, says, "The first cohort of eligible honors students from Mesa Community College and Chandler-Gilbert Community College who are invited to participate in this pilot will be able to become more involved in activities offered by the university and the ASU Barrett Honors College, while maintaining strong ties and taking advantage of the unique offerings of the community college honors programs." </p>
      <p>Students who have been invited to participate in this cohort see this opportunity as a great way to help them transition to a university once they are ready. </p>
      <p>Melanie Hartmann agrees the program will help her learn about the university and also looks forward to accessing uni versity resources as well as being a part of history. "I have always been very interested in history," says Hartmann, a presidential scholar honors student at CGCC. "I will be making history being a part of this charter." </p>
      <p>Also this fall, ASU will offer select upper-division general education courses at several of the 10 Maricopa Community Colleges. </p>
      <p>As further incentive, the alliance will allow community college students wishing to transfer to ASU prior to completing an associate's degree to use courses they take at ASU to satisfy requirements for an associate degree while pursuing a baccalaureate degree at ASU. </p>
      <p>"Students transferring to the university do so with the intention of finishing their baccalaureate degree, but, often, what happens is students leave for one reason or another and end up with no degree," says Anna Solley, vice chancellor of academic affairs at the Maricopa Community Colleges. "We want to change that, so all of their hard work, time, and effort results in a tangible outcome." </p>
      <p>During the pilot phase, all of the processes, as well as extensive feedback from students, faculty and staff, will be evaluated to improve upon the programs as further implementation is planned. </p>
