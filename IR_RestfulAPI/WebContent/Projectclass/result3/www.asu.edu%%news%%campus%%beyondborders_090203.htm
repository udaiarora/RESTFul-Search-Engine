      <h2>Beyond Borders - Programs build cultural links locally, internationally</h2>
      <p>        <img src="campus_images/beyond_borders_090103.jpg" width="288" height="216" align="right">Whether it's here in the communities of the Valley or the newsrooms in
          Europe, the College of Public Programs is working on projects involving
          individuals and organizations as diverse as the programs it offers. </p>
      <p><strong>Asian Pacific American Studies</strong><br>
        Faculty in the Asian Pacific American Studies Program are doing two oral
          history projects that focus on two separate Asian communities in Arizona
        and in Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>"Islands in the Desert - An Oral History of the
            Pacific Islander Community in Phoenix" is a project led by Professor
            John Rosa to document a sampling
          of Pacific Islander experiences in the Phoenix metropolitan area for
          future generations. </p>
      <p>Oral history interviews will serve as the groundwork
          for the Pacific Islander community oral history project that will eventually
          be maintained
          by the Asian Pacific American Studies program and stored in the Arizona
          Collection of ASU's Hayden Library. </p>
      <p>"In general, the interviews from
          this summer and those to be collected in the fall are a sampling of
        Pacific Islander experiences in the Phoenix
          metropolitan area," says Rosa. "Native Hawaiians, Samoans, Tongans
        and Micronesians are the largest Pacific Islander groups in the state
        of
          Arizona, but the project will also highlight some Maori (Native New
        Zealander) experiences as well." </p>
      <p>The oral histories will be on display at the 2004
          Aloha Festival in mid-March in Phoenix. </p>
      <p>Professor Melinda de Jesus is exploring aspects of racial
          identity and cultural maintenance as represented in oral histories
        of Filipino-Americans
          living in a small steel town in Southeastern Pennsylvania. </p>
      <p>Through edited
          life histories collected from 1999 to 2001, this research traces the
          themes of identity, belonging, family, community and spirituality. </p>
      <p>"Overall, I believe my study will contribute greatly to the understanding
          of the distinct, local cultures that comprise the Filipino American
        experience today," says de Jesus. </p>
      <p><strong>Hugh Downs School of Human Communication</strong><br>
        A little closer to home, Professor Sara Amira de la Garza, in the Hugh
          Downs School of Human Communication, is making a link with psychology
          faculty at Escuela Libre de Priscologia, A.C. in Chihuahua, Mexico.        </p>
      <p>De la Garza received funding from the Institute of International Education,
          Inc., and the U.S. State Department for a project that will create
        an online digital journal for the dissemination of scholarly work between
          faculty from both universities. The online aspects of the ethnographic
          journal will permit visual and audio technology to be part of the ethnographic
          record. </p>
      <p><strong>Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication</strong><br>
        In the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, two
      different projects look at the media's influence locally and abroad.</p>
      <p>Professor
            Carol Schwalbe is examining how news photographs of the U.S. civil
            rights abuses published overseas during the early years of the
          Cold War (1947 - 65) affected American policy makers, causing them
        concern about our image abroad.</p>
      <p>"Scholars have written about the negative
          repercussions of racial discrimination on U.S. foreign relations, but
          this research has been based mainly
            on non-visual documents," she says. "My study provides a unique opportunity
            to study primary sources that show connections between the power
        of still
          photography and U.S. foreign policy."</p>
      <p>Not only are faculty studying the
          impact of media on foreign policy, they are showing ASU students firsthand
          the differences between the American
          media and media in other nations. "News Bridges: Transatlantic Television
          News, British Broadcasters at ITN" is the first international program
        offered by the Cronkite School.</p>
      <p>Professor William Silcock received funding
          from the Association of Schools of Journalism and Mass Communication
          to coordinate a lecture seminar
          for ASU students in London and other parts of Europe this summer. Topics
          included international reporting, global newsroom producing skills,
        ethical decision making and global newsroom management. </p>
      <p>A group of 24 students,
          along with Silcock and Professor Joe Foote, spent three weeks in England,
          Ireland and France in intensive visits to media
        operations in all areas of mass communication.</p>
      <p>"Our students experienced
          and learned a great deal in a short amount of time," says Silcock.
        "They were really focused on two issues - the
          differences between American journalism and English journalism and
        the differences in media culture between the two systems."</p>
