      <b><a name="property"></a>If a handbook is arranged by property, search 
      the index first, then the table of contents.</b><br>
      Some handbooks are arranged so that each chapter or section is devoted to 
      a specific property, related group of properties, or a subject. There is 
      usually an index in the back of the volume or separate index volume at the 
      end of the set if the handbook is muli-volumed. The index may include either 
      the properties or the compounds or both. The most common form of index has 
      the properties listed in alphabetical order and the compounds or groups 
      of compounds that have property information available are indented under 
      the property. The table of contents may help determine where a specific 
      property is located within the volume. An example of a handbook arranged 
      by property is the <i><b>CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</b></i> (QD65 
      .H3 Science Reference). <br>

      Other handbooks have the content listed alphabetically by the chemical name. 
      Under each name is the property information. There are usually indexes for 
      names, CAS registry numbers and molecular formulas at the back of the volume, 
      or, for multi-volume works, in a separate index volume at the end of the 
      set. An example of a handbook arranged by chemical name is the <i><b>Merck 
      Index</b></i> (RS51 .M4 1996 Science Reserve). There is no way to search 
      by the property name in these types of handbooks. <br>

Databases are usually searchable by name, CAS registry number and molecular formula. Some
databases are searchable by the property name.  Most databases require searching the complete
name, registry number or molecular formula; a few may permit truncation (sometimes called
"wildcards") or allow browsing (being able to see all the names, etc. in alphabetical order). 
Browsing is very helpful if the exact spelling of the name is unknown.  Databases are similar to
handbooks that arrange information under the chemical name, so searching is usually done by the
chemical name not the property name.  An example of a chemical database is <a
href="http://www.chemfinder.com">http://www.chemfinder.com</a>.

If the handbook is arranged by the properties, search all synonyms of the property in the index.  If
the handbook has little or no indexing, the Table of Contents can be browsed for the property
name(s).  For handbooks that arrange the information in alphabetical order by the chemical name,
look for all synonyms of the property in the information part of the entry for that chemical.

      <P> The 109+ elements are the "building blocks" of chemicals. The elements 
        are usually displayed in a <a href="http://ull.chemistry.uakron.edu/periodic_table/index.html">periodic 
        table</a> that links elements with similar characteristics in vertical 
        and horizontal rows. Each element has a one or two letter symbol; one 
        letter symbols are always in upper case (ex. K, P, S); two letter symbols 
        are always written with the first letter in upper case and the second 
        letter in lower case (ex. Ar, Co, Na) . Many symbols are derived from 
        foreign languages so the element symbol and the English name do not always 
        match (ex. the symbol for silver is Ag from the Latin &quot;argentum&quot;).

Chemical elements combine together to form chemical compounds.  There are over 27 million
substances identified by Chemical Abstracts Service. (<a

just the sheer volume of possible compounds that makes chemistry so challenging, it's also

Molecular formulas describe what elements, and how many of each, make up a

to have the same formula.  Almost all chemistry handbooks and databases provide an index by 
molecular formula; however most non-chemistry handbooks/databases do not.

Searching molecular formulas in databases can be tricky.
<P>
<ul>
<li>In chemistry databases, look for a field, index or search box specifically designated for 
molecular formula searching.  The numerical subscripts are usually typed on the same line, e.g.,
"c6h12o6".  When carbon (C) is present, the formula should be entered with the carbon (C) and 
hydrogen (H) first,  and with all other elements in alphabetical order.  When carbon (C) is not 
present, the elements should be entered in alphabetical order.  Be aware that some databases 
require <i>mixed case</i>,  e.g., "Si2Sr" instead of "si2sr".
<P>
<li>In non-chemistry databases, it is best to search for both the molecular formula and the 
common name of the compound. The formula should be entered in lower case with the numerical 
subscripts in-line, and the elements in the order that would most commonly 
be written e.g., "srsi2", unless the database's help page indicates differently.

      <P>
Because molecular formulas may not be unique, structure diagrams are used to identify specific 
compounds.  The diagrams show not only what elements are present, but how they are arranged
and connected.  Structure diagrams may be written in a line or displayed in 2- or 3-dimensional

<P>
Some databases contain structure drawing programs that allow for searching by structure.  
Because each program may have it's own set of rules and because structure diagrams can be 
draw in various ways, it is not always obvious how to draw a structure so that it will be 
correctly interpreted by the database.  For those without training in structure drawing, it may 
be more beneficial (and time economical) to translate the structure into a molecular 
formula and search by the formula.

no 
way to tell a head of time which name(s) will be used.  Names for
chemicals are grouped into 3 categories: tradenames, common names (also called generic or

<li><b>Tradenames</b>
<P>
Tradenames are given to specific products by a manufacturer and appear on the packaging and 
advertisement for that product.  They are usually simple (one or two syllables) so they can be 
easily remembered, may convey their purpose (ex., "Allegra" is a medication used to control 
allergy symptoms), and/or may be followed by a number that seems to indicate a specific 
formulation. Tradenames sometimes can be difficult to distinguish from 
common names.  Tradenames are indexed in handbooks or databases as follows:  
<P>
<ul>
<li>Almost always found in pharmaceutical resources.
<li>Frequently found in resources geared toward a specific industry.
<li>Sometimes found in resources geared toward the consumer.
<li>Very seldom found in resources geared toward chemists or chemistry students.
</ul>
<br>
For handbooks or databases that do not contain tradenames, use the following resources to find 
the common or scientific name.

<li><b>Common Names</b>
<P>
Common names, sometimes called generic or trivial names are usually the best way to locate 
compounds.  These names are generally short and almost every resource indexes them.
<P>
<li><b>Chemical Names</b>
<P>
The chemical or scientific name is designed to convey the exact structure of the compound in an
unambiguous manner. It is not uncommon for inorganic compounds, which are relatively simple
structures, to have chemical and common names that are the same.  Many organic compounds,
however, are big and complicated strutures and their names follow suit.  Naming conventions for
organic compounds have changed throughout the years and an "official" set of nomenclature rules
was not universaly adopted until the last half of the 20th century.  Consequently, a compound
with a complex structure can have several "scientific" names.
<P>
The association that produces the official nomenclature rules is the International Union of 
Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).   Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), for the purposes of 
producing <i>Chemical Abstracts (CA)</i>, has a naming system that is based on IUPAC so the 
CA names are usually similar, if not identical.  Some recent chemistry resources list the
CAS name as the "official name".  If the "official name" is followed by (XCI) were "X" is a
number from 1-13, then this is the CAS name -- the CI designation indicates what Collective
Index period of Chemical Abstracts that version of the name was first used.  For example, (9CI)
indicates that the name was first used during the 9th Collective Index period which is 
1972-1976.

<P>
Complex chemical names are filed by two different methods, direct order and inverted order.  The
inverted method is used by Chemical Abstracts and in Chapter 3 (Organic Chemistry) of the CRC 
Handbook of Chemistry and Physics; this method has the advantage of arranging compounds in a 
heirarchical, structure-based order.  The direct method (used by IUPAC) is found in many 
handbooks and databases.  Except for Chemical Abstracts and Chapter 3 of the CRC, expect to 
find the names indexed in direct order but be prepared to use the inverted version if the 
handbook/database appears to index by that method.  Compare these lists of the same 9
compounds.

Note that in both cases, the names are filed alphabetically by the <i>name segments</i>.  The
alpha-numeric characters (arabic numerals, roman letters, or greek letters) are ignored in the

There are many chemcial registries that exist, mainly for toxicological/hazard reporting to 
governmental agencies. The most prominent of these registries is the Chemical Abstracts 
Service Registry.  Most recent chemical handbooks and databases index CAS registry numbers.

</dl>
      <P> A CAS registry number is assigned to each <i>specific</i> chemical compound 
        that appears in the chemical literature or as requested by chemical manufacturers 
        to comply with regulatory procedures. Each number always has 3 segments 
        separated by hyphens. The first segment consists of 2 or more numbers 
        which are assigned more or less sequentially; a lower number indicates 
        the compound was registered towards the begininng (1965) and a higher 
        number is more recent. The second segment always is composed of 2 numbers 
        and the third segment is always composed of one number. CAS has a formula 
        to determine if a registry number is plausible, see: <a href="http://www.cas.org/EO/checkdig.html">Check 
        Digit Verification of CAS Registry Numbers</a> at http://www.cas.org/EO/checkdig.html.
      <P>
Sometimes CAS registry numbers are followed by P, D, DP or *.  
<P>
<ul>
<li>Unless you are searching the 
<i>Chemical Abstracts</i> database, ignore the P, D and DP indicators.  These are "limiting
codes" that restrict searches to the preparation (P), unspecified derivatives (D) or preparation of
unspecified derivatives (DP) for the compound represented by that registry number.
<P>
<li>The * indicator, however, is important whether searching Chemical Abstracts, handbooks 
or databases.  In the United States, chemical manufacturers are required by law to maintain a
<a href="#msds">"Material Safety Data Sheet"</a> on the substances they produce.  A MSDS
must include the CAS Registry number for that substance.  But some substances are a mixture 
of unknown/unspecified compounds or have a formulation that may change with each batch or
with 
manufacturer(for example, gasoline); in these instances, Chemical Abstracts Service
assigns a registry number with an *  so that the substance can be registered but the number 
is not generally used for searching purposes. Consequently, it may be futile to use this number
when
searching chemical resources; if anything at all is found, it's usually only to indicate that 
the substance is a mixture of unspecified compounds. The best place to find information on an *
compound is usually the manufacturer's <a href="msds.htm">MSDS</a> or go directly to the
manufacturer.       
</ul>
<P>
Because a number is easier and less time consuming to search in an index than a long list of 
variant names or a complex chemical name, use CAS registry numbers to search more efficiently. 
CAS registry numbers are found in 
many chemistry resources including Chapters 3 (Organic Compounds) and 4 (Inorganic
Compounds) 
of the CRC Handbook and Chemical Abstracts. There are two caveats 
when using registry numbers for searching purposes.  Sometimes Chemical Abstracts Service 
changes the registry number - handbooks and databases do not always record these changes. 
Also, 
numbers are easily misinterpreted - they could be copied wrong, have numbers transposed, or be 
written illegibly (1 mistaken for 7, 9 mistaken for 4, etc.).   Always be prepared to back up a 
search by registry number with a search by name or molecular formula.
