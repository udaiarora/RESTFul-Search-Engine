			<h2>Wireless Deployment and Management Policy</h2>

			<p><strong>WIRELESS DEPLOYMENT AND MANAGEMENT POLICY 
			(<acronym title="WIRELESS">WDMP</acronym>)</strong></p> 
				
			
			<p>Topic: Policy for Deployment and Management of IEEE 802.11 and Related Wireless 
			Standards (Wireless Policy)</p>
		
			
			<p>A. Rationale and Purpose of Policy:</p> 
			
			
			<p>To ensure the technical coordination required to provide the best possible wireless 
			network for the Arizona State University, the University's Information Technology 
			 will be solely responsible for the deployment and 
			management of IEEE 802.11 and related wireless access points at ASU. No other departments may deploy IEEE 802.11 or related wireless access points without coordination with and approval by Information Technology.</p> 
			
		
			
			<p>This policy provides the structure for a University-wide solution for the implementation 
			of wireless technology, which includes centralized determination of identity and 
			authentication to the end of the provision of the appropriate levels of security.</p>
		
			
			<p>Wireless in the Local Area Network using the IEEE 802.11 standards is a fast emerging 
			technology. IEEE 802.11 wireless technology is by nature easy to deploy, but highly 
			sensitive to overlapping frequencies. Because of these characteristics, all wireless 
			use must be planned, deployed, and managed in a very careful and centralized fashion to 
			ensure basic functionality, maximum bandwidth, and a secure network.</p>  
		
			
			<p>Current IEEE 802.11 wireless technology deploys a very low power signal in a frequency 
			band divided into multiple non-overlapping channels.  The primary purpose of these channels 
			is not so much to provide separate networks, but to ensure that adjacent access points 
			with slightly overlapping areas of coverage do not interfere with each other. In the 
			normal case, it is necessary to use all  channels in an integrated fashion as a single 
			unified network in order to achieve an optimal design. It is therefore not feasible to 
			allow individuals to install their own access points without centralized coordination, 
			due to the resulting signal interference and greatly degraded performance to the common 
			wireless network.</p>
		
			
			<p>B. Scope:</p>
			
			 
			<p>The Wireless Policy provides guidelines regarding the following:</p> 
			<ul>
			<li>The central deployment by IT of IEEE 802.11 and related wireless access points.</li>
			<li>The provision of wireless service by IT for campus departments.</li>
			<li>The management by IT of IEEE 802.11 and related wireless standards access.</li>
			</ul>
			
		
				
			<p>C. Policy:</p>	
				
				<p>1. IT deployment of IEEE 802.11 and related wireless access points</p>
				 
				<p>Arizona State University's Information Technology  
				will be solely responsible for the deployment and management of IEEE 802.11 
				and related wireless access points at ASU. No other departments may deploy 
				IEEE 802.11 or related wireless access points without coordination with IT.</p>
				
				<p>2. Provision of wireless service by IT</p>
				
				<p>IT will offer a standard wireless deployment plan that will meet the needs of 
				most ASU departments wishing to construct and operate departmental wireless 
				services.</p>  
				
				<p>3. Management by IT of IEEE 802.11 and related wireless standards access points</p>
				
				<p>IT will ensure that all wireless services deployed at ASU will adhere to University-wide standards for access control. IT will manage the wireless spectrum in a manner that ensures the greatest interoperability and roaming ability for all departments wishing to use wireless technology, and, using ASURITE authentication, will centralize the process of determining identity, authentication, and appropriate levels of security for access to and use of wireless technology. IT reserves the right to minimize interference to the common wireless network, and will work with departments to reconfigure or shut down any departmental wireless networks that interfere with the common wireless network.</p>
		
					
			<p>D. Procedures and Guidelines:</p>
				
				<p>IT will advise <a href="http://asu.edu/uncel/">UNCEL</a> on wireless plans, deployment strategies, and management issues.</p>
				
				<p>Any department wishing to work with IT to deploy wireless access must contact IT by 
				phoning 965-5911 to begin the process. IT will provide cost quotes, design, purchase and install the wireless hardware and any wiring necessary to achieve the departmentâ??s desired wireless coverage. (<a href="http://www.asu.edu/wireless/">www.asu.edu/wireless</a>)</p>  
				
				<p>In the case of existing wireless technology deployments that use the same or interfering 
				spectrums, IT will work with the departments in question to minimize interference to 
				the common wireless network where possible or remove the offending equipment from the 
				ASU network as a last resort.</p>
				
				<p>All sensitive data being transmitted across a wireless network should be encrypted. 
				(e.g. Using VPN technology)</p>
				
				<p>Additional guidelines and best practices relating to the deployment and use of 
				wireless technologies can be found at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/wireless/">www.asu.edu/wireless</a>.</p>

			<p>F. Responsible Organization:</p>
		
					
				<p>The Office of the CIO and Vice Provost will be responsible for this policy and for any 
				appeals of IT decisions relating to wireless deployments.</p>
		 
				
				<p>This policy will be reviewed yearly by the Office of the CIO. IT will review LAN 
				wireless access standards on a yearly basis and recommend changes to this policy 
				as appropriate.</p>
		 
				
				<p>Changes will be authorized by recommendation of the Office of the CIO and approval 
				of the Provost.</p> 
				
		
		
			
			<p>Policy was last revised October 5, 2005.</p>
			
			<p>Approved<br />
