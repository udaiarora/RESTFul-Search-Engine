Compressing and Uncompressing Files
</center></h2>
<p>
To compress a file, the UNIX command "compress" can be used.  For 
example, to compress the raw data file "sipp93t3.xxx" the command used is:
<p><blockquote>
compress sipp93t3.xxx
</blockquote><p>
This creates a compressed file with the name "sipp93t3.xxx.Z".  The
compression can be quite substantial.  For example in an actual case,
the uncompressed file "sipp93t3.xxx" was approximately 68.5 MB,
whereas the compressed file "sipp93t3.xxx.Z" was only 2.6 MB.
<p
To uncompress a file, first use the "fs listquota" command to check  
whether you have sufficient AFS space and then use the "uncompress" 
command.  If case of insufficient space in your account, copy the 
compressed file to the system temporary storage area such as "/save" 
and then uncompress the file there.  Using the above mentioned file 
as an example, simply enter the following to uncompress:
<p><blockquote>
uncompress sipp93t3.xxx.Z
</blockquote><p>
For more information on the compress and uncompress commands, please 
enter "man compress" at the system prompt.
<p>
Note:  	Some UNIX applications such as 
<a href="../../statistics/gentips/index.html">
SAS and SPSS</a> can read compressed data files.  Hence in such cases, 
there is no need to uncompress.
