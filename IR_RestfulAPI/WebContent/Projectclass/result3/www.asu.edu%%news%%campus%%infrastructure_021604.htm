      <h2>ASU's long-term infrastructure planning efforts take shape </h2>
      <p>The long-term roadmap for the physical development of ASU's four campuses is moving to its next stage. ASU's Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP) process, up to this point, has involved intense community input on the future physical needs of the university's campuses. </p>
      <p>"For the first five months we have been in an issue discovery mode for each of the campuses," says Steve Nielsen, ASU's director of campus planning. "In the next few months we will apply that knowledge and develop a series of concepts illustrating how the university may evolve." </p>
      <p>The plan, following ASU President Michael Crow's vision for ASU, will provide the steps needed to physically support the university's goals for its students, research and academic efforts. The CDP is being developed concurrently to the University Design Team (UDT) report, which will lay out the key programmatic needs of the university. </p>
      <p>The two efforts will be merged late this summer, with a proposed presentation to Crow and, ultimately, the Arizona Board of Regents in late fall. </p>
      <p>Nielsen says the CDP will cover every physical aspect of the university, from buildings to accommodate students and research, to infrastructure needs for electricity and utilities, to aesthetic needs such as landscaping. </p>
      <p>Between now and June, the planning team will host three-day open community workshops on each of the campuses to begin to develop concept plans for future growth. During the first day of the workshop, the team will present a summary of the information that has been gathered to date and ask for input to further refine it. Nielsen says the team will literally walk each campus with the workshop audience to get "a feel" for the physical surroundings. </p>
      <p>"The current student population, faculty or staff member has a unique experience that may not have been visible to the planning team," he says. "A faculty member may point out the buildings are too far apart in terms of classrooms and research. A student may let us know more shade is needed for the malls. A community member may have an idea where to put a parking structure in terms of reducing local traffic." </p>
      <p>After that session, the team will gather to address all of the comments with specific concepts for each campus, which will be presented during the second day. By the third day, Nielsen expects that a number of concept plans will emerge. </p>
      <p>The key to the effort, Nielsen says, is flexibility. All of the plans are being designed without specific knowledge of the programmatic needs of each campus. Those will be added later based on the recommendations of the UDT. </p>
      <p>"This is the physical land-use planning," he says. "We are building the framework. It won't become a complete plan until we incorporate both planning and programming." </p>
      <p>The planning team will be at ASU West Feb. 24 - 26; ASU Downtown March 23 - 25; and ASU East April 27 - 29. Sessions will be held for Main Campus in May and June. All specific times and locations are yet to be determined. </p>
      <p>For information on the complete CDP process, including specific dates and times for upcoming meetings, visit (www.asu.edu/planning). </p>
