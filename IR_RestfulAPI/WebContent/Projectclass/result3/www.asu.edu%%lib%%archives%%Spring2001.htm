<p><b><a name=CERAMIST>Ceramist Lonewolf Dedicates her New Work, "Three Sisters"</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rosemary Apple Blossom Lonewolf, Santa Clara, New
Mexico, formally dedicated her latest work of art in the Heard Museum's
garden of Native plants, located in the Thunderbird Children's Courtyard,
on Saturday, December 9, 2001.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lonewolf, who has been depositing her papers in
the Labriola Center, was joined by the students who worked with her during
her tenure as artist-in-residence at the Heard Museum. She is becoming
well known for her innovative and massive public art projects. Readers
can view photographs of her Chandler, YMCA project in the Summer 2000 Labriola
Newsletter at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/labriola.htm">http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/labriola.htm</a>,
and this latest work at the same site, in the Spring 2001 newsletter.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes referred to as the "American Triumvirate,"
the "Three Sisters" is a metaphor for corn, beans, and squash. Native to
the Americas, the vegetables have an interconnected relationship: the corn
stalk provides a sturdy stalk for the beans, while the squash plants hug
close to the ground keeping the weeds out and moisture in.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lonewolf mural honors this relationship ending
with the image of Quetzalcoatl, the serpent who brought corn to America.
Colorful images represent the Paiute sun, water, corn fields, a hogan,
while Corn Beetle Girl oversees the ripening fields, and a Navajo wedding
basket is filled with the season's harvest.

<center><b><a name=PEOPLE>People of the Blue-Green Water Enter 21st Century</a></b></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supai, Arizona, is the only place in the United States,
where mail is delivered on mule back. The small village is located in Cataract
Canyon, 11 miles down into the Grand Canyon out of Peach Springs, Arizona.
One gets there by foot, horse, muleback, or by helicopter. This has been
home to the Havasupai Indians for hundreds of years.
<table WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They call themselves "People of the Blue-Green Water,"
which refers to the waters of Cataract Creek, that cascade over travertine
bluffs as Navajo, Havasu, and Mooney Falls. It is one of the most remote,
but beautiful places on earth, a veritable Shangri-la.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to Northern Arizona University, the Havasupai
are now connected to the Internet. It has installed 6 wireless bi-directional
satellite systems over mini-dishes so they can receive instruction from
NAU or Coconino Community College and be connected through the Internet
to the world around. In addition, the same Wireless Internet service is
available to all 110 Navajo Nation Chapter Houses and to the Hopi Police
Department.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who might want to journey to the past,
we suggest you check out the C. F. Shaffer Collection, LAB MSS-148, in
the Labriola Center. Shaffer and his wife were school teachers in Supai
between 1937 and 1941. There are photographs, scrapbooks, a guest book
showing Josef Muench was among the visitors, paintings by Popovi-da, son
of Maria Martinez, and letters.</td>

<b><a name=NEW>NEW! One-stop Database to Native American History and Culture</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Labriola Center has purchased the Facts on File
multi-media encyclopedia,
<b><i><a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/db/aihc.htm">American
Indian History and Culture</a></i></b>, and has made it available online
for students at all three ASU campuses.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users can access entries on tribes in both the United
States and Canada including information on religious and spiritual beliefs,
migrations, wars and battles, land and land rights disputes, legislation
and court cases, and more.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, there are some 1,700 biographical entries,
over 300 primary source documents, 450 historic photographs, 110 maps and
charts, 120 legends, a 1,700-word glossary, and a 5,000 year time line.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All content can be printed, copied and saved for
personal use via Internet browser. Maps can be printed and saved using
Adobe Acrobat.
<p><b><a name=WAUNEKA>Wauneka Biography Due Soon</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carolyn Niethammer, author of <i>American Indian
Food and Lore</i> (1974) and <i>Daughters of the Earth: Lives and Legends
of Indian Women
</i>(1977), has completed a definitive work of biography
on the life of Navajo politician, Annie Dodge Wauneka. It is to be published
by the University of Nebraska Press and will be available this spring.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Niethammer writes that "Wauneka served her people
during more than four decades of public life. Equally at home in a remote
sheep camp and the halls of the U. S. Congress, where she gave many speeches
to appropriations committees, Annie Wauneka has been described as a 'one-woman
Peace Corps' to the Navajo People."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wauneka served on the Navajo Tribal Council for
more than twenty years, and during that time, as Chairman of the tribal
council's Health and Welfare Committee. She ultimately became recognized
as a vital force in the field of Indian Health, working hard to bring tuberculosis
under control. She has received numerous awards for her work, one being
the Medal of Freedom, bestowed by President Lyndon Johnson in 1963. Annie
Wauneka is the only Native American to have received this award.

<p><b><a name=JAMES>James Otto Lewis' Aboriginal Portfolio</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently received from the University of Cincinnati
Digital Press, the CD-ROM publication is available in the Labriola Center.
Lewis lived in Detroit in the 1820s and was retained by the U. S. Government
to paint portraits of Native Americans. The first edition, published 1835-1838,
was the first compilation of portraits of North American Indians and represents
one of the finest, and rarest, efforts of 19th century American lithography.
One of the two known complete copies is included in this publication.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CD-ROM publication includes a catalog of images
linked to a locator map, images of the colored lithographs in four resolutions,
all texts and indexes, and bibliography of over 1000 citations including
web links.
<p><b><a name=CAPTIVITY>Captivity of Cynthia Ann Parker</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adding to its collection of captivity stories, the
Labriola Center has purchased the first edition of James DeSheild's 1886
volume, <b><i>Cynthia Ann Parker: The Story of Her Capture at the Massacre
of the Inmates of Parker's Fort, of her Quarter of a Century Spent Among
the Comanches as the wife of the War Chief, Peta Nocona, and of Her Recapture
at the Battle of Pease River</i></b>. She was the mother of famed Chief,
Quanah Parker.

<b><font size=+1><a name=HOT>Hot Topics -</a></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Labriola Center is committed to supplying resources
covering numerous topics for research papers required of our students.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We find that there are certain "hot topics" that
students like to write about. For example, gaming; the American Indian
Movement; stereotypes; sovereignty; origin stories; biography; and education
and boarding schools are among the favorites.
<br>We are going to use boarding schools and education as an example to
show the variety of material the Labriola staff is able to offer our students.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to recommending books on the chosen
topic, we will help the student look for information in journals and newspapers,
manuscript and photograph collections, utilize material from the National
Archives, look for maps if needed, read biographies and autobiographies,
research Government Documents, video recordings, and locate oral history
interviews. They are also encouraged to use information from statistical
reports, pamphlets, small manuscript collections, and more. How, and where
do they find these sources?
<p><b>BOOKS ON BOARDING SCHOOLS</b>
<p>A search of the ASU Online catalog will turn up a number of books on
the topic and these books often list bibliographies that can be helpful.

school experience.
<p><b>EPHEMERA</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Labriola Center also has an extensive collection
of ephemera dealing with education, schools, and boarding schools. For

BIA reports, "Interim Guidelines Affecting School Boards of Bureau of Indian
Affairs;" testimony from the Shoshone/Bannock Tribes Tribal Education Committee;

Indian Boarding School Experience, 1879-2000.</b> The published catalog
