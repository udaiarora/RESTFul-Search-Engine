      <h2>Commencement to honor 1,700 graduates</h2>
      <p>        Almost 1,700 students will graduate this summer from ASU's three
      campuses.</p>
      <p>ASU President Michael Crow will speak to the graduates from
          ASU's main and east campuses during summer commencement at 4 p.m.,
        Aug. 8, in the
        Wells Fargo Arena. Almost 1,400 students will graduate from the two campuses.</p>
      <p>ASU
        West will graduate 220 students at their summer commencement ceremony
        scheduled at 6:45 p.m., Aug. 12, in La Sala of the University Center
        Building. <br>
        Melissa Werner, program coordinator senior with ASU Summer Sessions &amp; Commencement,
        said despite the smaller number of participants, summer commencement
      is a festive occasion for graduates and their families.</p>
      <p>"We typically
          have about 200 students attending summer commencement," Werner said.
          "Many students complete coursework in first summer session
          and opt to participate in spring ceremonies, which reduces the number
        of participating students at the summer ceremony.</p>
      <p>"Summer graduates do
          have the unique situation of being part of a small number of students
          graduating at a large institution," Werner said. "The
          ceremony itself is a bit shorter in the summer because of the smaller
        number of graduates."</p>
      <p>Among this summer's graduates are two students
          who exemplify ASU's spirit and leadership.</p>
      <p>Victoria Olson is graduating from ASU's Walter Cronkite
        School of Journalism &amp; Mass
        Communication, with a bachelor's degree in broadcasting. Frederic Leigh,
        associate director with the Cronkite School, said Olson has proven to
      be an outstanding student at ASU.</p>
      <p>"Ms. Olson has vigorously pursued professional
          experience opportunities outside the classroom," he said. "She has
        completed an internship with
          Metro Source, a broadcast traffic report service in the Valley. She
        was part of the student news staff at the campus radio station over the
        past
          year and is currently doing an internship at KTAR News Radio in Phoenix.
        Victoria is an excellent student representative of the Cronkite School."</p>
      <p>As
          an active ASU student, Olson was a member of the Order of Omega Honors
          Society, Society of Collegiate Scholars and a member of the Alpha Delta
          Pi sorority. <br>
        Steve Yazzie is graduating with a bachelor of science in environmental
          technology management. Phillip Huebner, director of American Indian
          Programs, says Yazzie's leadership skills have been beneficial to American
          Indian
        Programs and ASU.</p>
      <p>Yazzie maintained a 3.4 GPA, is a Gates Millennium Scholar
          and a member of the Barrett Honors College. Yazzie also helped establish
          the American
        Indian Programs student organization, the One Nation Club.</p>
      <p>"Mr. Yazzie
          is an accomplished student who is recognized by his peers, faculty,
        deans and the provost not only for his academic standing, but
          also for his leadership and commitment to the university community,"
          Huebner said. "As the group's president and vice president, Yazzie
        recruited students, wrote the bylaws, initiated activities focusing on
        community
          outreach and also established the annual Student Recognition Banquet,"
          Huebner said. "In 2001, the One Nation Club was recognized as ASU's
        Outstanding Student Organization of the year due in large part to Mr.
        Yazzie's efforts."</p>
