      <h2>ASU, Tempe to host final 2004 debate</h2>
      <p>        The eyes and ears of the nation will turn to ASU and Tempe as Gammage
        Auditorium hosts the final presidential debate Oct. 13, 2004.</p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/gammage_debate_111403.jpg" width="288" height="189" align="right">In reaction,
            Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano said the university and Tempe had landed
            the "Super Bowl of Politics" by getting the debate. She also
          said hosting the debate will help make Arizona a bellwether for the
        coming national election.</p>
      <p>"It's not by accident that the commission selected
          university sites for these historic debates because of our principle
          focus on free and open
          speech, our focus on learning, our focus on discourse," said ASU President
          Michael Crow. "It's for that reason that we are tremendously excited
          that ASU will be able to serve as the host for this debate. This is
        the kind of thing that represents the best our democracy has to offer."</p>
      <p>Tempe
          Mayor and ASU Director of Community Relations Neil Giuliano was ecstatic
          that ASU has been chosen as a host site.</p>
      <p>"Tempe and ASU have
          worked hard to attract the debate and the fact that it will be the
        final debate preceding the election makes the event even
          more important," he said. "It draws the attention of the world and
        the nation to Arizona, Tempe and ASU. ASU is the largest university campus
          and Tempe the first non-California city in the western United States
        to ever host a presidential debate."</p>
      <p>Paul G. Kirk, Jr., and Frank J. Fahrenkopf,
          Jr., co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), said
          the sites of four debates (three
          presidential and one vice presidential) were chosen from 14 formal
        proposals submitted to the CPD last March.</p>
      <p>The other debates will be Sept. 30, at
          the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Fla., and Oct. 8, at Washington
          University in St. Louis. The
          vice presidential debate will be held Oct. 5 at Case Western Reserve
        University in Cleveland.</p>
      <p>Members of the university community and the general
          public are expressing great interest in attending the debate, but Giuliano
          said ticket arrangements
        have not been completed.</p>
      <p>"The Commission on Presidential Debates has the
          full responsibility to determine and coordinate all issues with regard
          to tickets for the actual
          debate," he explained. "These decisions are made once the format of
        the debate is agreed upon. Further information regarding tickets will
        be
        available from the commission in September 2004."</p>
      <p>Giuliano added that
          a Presidential Debate at ASU Coordinating Committee would be appointed
          soon to begin discussing ideas to engage the students,
          faculty and community in a variety of events and activities leading
        up to the debate on Oct. 13. Ideas include an MTV Rock the Vote concert
        the weekend prior to the debate and academic events.</p>
      <p>"I would encourage
          every academic area to think of how their field connects to the policies
          of our federal government," he said. "Electing a U.S.
          president impacts every area of life in some way, and ASU will play
        a significant role in the history of the 2004 election. This is an event
          that will spread far beyond the confines of Gammage and the boundaries
        of the university."</p>
      <p>Security is expected to be the tightest ever for an
          event in Arizona, involving ASU, the City of Tempe and other local
        law enforcement agencies.
        The U.S. Secret Service will coordinate security for the actual debate.</p>
      <p>The
            Tempe Mission Palms Hotel will serve as the headquarters hotel for
          the CPD, which will have more than 100 staff on-site for up to a week
            prior to the event. The Buttes, Arizona Biltmore and other Tempe,
        Phoenix and Scottsdale hotels will be designated to host the political
        party
            delegations and over 2,000 members of the national and international
            media. The CPD is the non-partisan, non-profit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3)
            corporation that has sponsored presidential and vice presidential
        debates since 1988. The CPD Web site is (<a href="http://www.debates.org">www.debates.org</a>).</p>
