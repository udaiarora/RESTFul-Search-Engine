      <h2>Greater Phoenix resale market posts strong sales in January</h2>
      <p>The new year started out strong for the Greater Phoenix resale housing 
        market, with 4,220 recorded sales in January, according to the Arizona 
        Real Estate Center. This is down from the 6,095 total in the previous 
        month, but ahead of the 3,345 sales recorded in January 2002. The median 
        home price of $147,950 was lower than the monthly record of $148,900 set 
        in December, but well ahead of the previous January's $140,000. </p>
      <p>"The record activity of 2002 was well beyond expectations, given a very 
        weak economic environment," said Dr. Jay Q. Butler, director of the Center 
        at Arizona State University's W.P. Carey School of Business. "The 2003 
        resale housing market continues to exist in a struggling economy, low 
        consumer confidence, job layoffs, and a grim international scene. The 
        only real positive note is that mortgage interest rates are expected to 
        remain at current low levels for at least the first half of the year. 
        There is considerable concern as to how the remainder of 2003 will play 
        out in such an uncertain environment. However, the month of January frequently 
        gives misleading signals and cannot be considered a good harbinger of 
        the remaining year."</p>
      <p>The resale townhouse/condominium housing sector also improved from last 
        year, recording 885 sales in January compared to 810 the previous month 
        and 1,290 in December 2002. For the first time, the median home price 
        was at $100,000, compared to $97,000 in December and $94,000 the previous 
        January. </p>
      <p>The median square footage for a single-family home recorded sold in January 
        2003 was 1,650, which is slightly larger than the 1,635 square feet reported 
        a year ago. In the townhouse/condominium sector, the median square footage 
        was 1,160, slightly smaller than the 1,165 square feet reported a year 
        ago. </p>
      <p>&middot; In comparison with January 2002, recorded sales in the city 
        of Phoenix increased from 1,000 to 1,230, and the median sales price rose 
        from $115,000 to $120,000. In the townhouse/condominium sector, sales 
        activity increased slightly from 240 to 245 sales and the median sales
