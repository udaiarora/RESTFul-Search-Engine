HELP LISTDSD

FUNCTION
          5740-XXH  (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 1987

  The LISTDSD command is used to list the RACF description of generic
  and/or discrete data set profiles.  In order to list a
  descriptor:
        - You must be the owner of the profile, have the SPECIAL or
          AUDITOR attribute, or your userid must match the first-level
          qualifier of the profile name, or
        - If you are explicitly authorized to the profile, you must
          have at least READ authority, or
        - If your current connect group is explicitly authorized to
          the profile, the authority must be at least READ, or
        - The universal access of the profile must be READ, or
        - You must have the AUDITOR attribute, or
        - You must have the group-SPECIAL or group-AUDITOR attribute
          and (1) the profile must be owned by the group or by a user
          owned by the group or (2) the high-level qualifier of the
          profile name must be the group name or a userid owned by the
          group.


SYNTAX

          LISTDSD  DATASET(data-set-name...) | ID(name...) |
                     PREFIX(character-string...)
                   STATISTICS
                   HISTORY
                   AUTHUSER
                   ALL
                   GENERIC | NOGENERIC
                   VOLUME(volume-serial...)

   REQUIRED - None.
   DEFAULTS - If neither DATASET, PREFIX, nor ID is specified, the
              default is: ID(your-userid).
              If neither GENERIC nor NOGENERIC is specified, the
              default is to list both generic and discrete profiles.
   ALIAS    - LD


OPERANDS

  DATASET(data-set-name...)
      One or more discrete and/or generic data set names that are to
      be listed.

  ID(name...)
      Specifies one or more RACF-defined userids and/or group names.
      All data sets with the userid or group name as the first-level
      qualifier will be listed.

  PREFIX(character-string...)
      Specifies one or more character strings.  All data sets whose
      names begin with one of the character strings will be listed.

  STATISTICS
      The number of times that the data set has been opened for the
      RACF access intent (ALTER, CONTROL, UPDATE, and READ) will be
      listed along with all non-optional information.

  HISTORY
      The date that the data set was defined to RACF, the date that
      the data set was last referenced, and the date that the data set
      was last updated are listed along with all non-optional
      information.

  AUTHUSER
      A list of all users and groups authorized to the data set
      (including each one's access and access count) is listed along
      with all non-optional information.  In order to use this
      operand:

            (1) You must have the group-SPECIAL or group-AUDITOR
                attribute and (a) the profile must be owned by the
                group or by a user owned by the group or (B) the
                high-level qualifier of the profile name must be the
                group name or a userid owned by the group, or
            (2) You must be the owner of the data set, have the
                SPECIAL attribute, or your userid must match the
                first-level qualifier of the data set, or (for
                discrete names only)
            (3) If you are explicitly authorized to the data set, you
                must have at least ALTER authority, or
            (4) If your current connect group is explicitly authorized
                to the data set, the authority must be at least ALTER,
                or
            (5) The universal access of the data set must be ALTER.

  ALL
      All possible information for the data sets is listed.

  GENERIC
      Only generic names will be listed.  This operand is ignored if
      generic command processing is inactive.

  NOGENERIC
      Only discrete names will be listed.  This operand is ignored if
      generic command processing is inactive.

  VOLUME(volume-serial...)
      Indicates that, when listing discrete RACF data base profiles,
      only those that pertain to the specified VOLUME(s) will be
      listed.  This operand will be ignored for generic profiles.

  ICH35001I COMMAND ENDED DUE TO ERROR

            Explanation:  A RACF manager error occurred.  This message
            is accompanied by a message explaining the error.

  ICH35002I NOT AUTHORIZED TO LIST data-set-name

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to the
            data set indicated in the message and cannot list the data
            set.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            data set.

  ICH35003I NO RACF DESCRIPTION FOUND FOR data-set-name

            Explanation:  The data set indicated in the message could
            not be found on the RACF data base.

  ICH35004I NOT AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE LISTDSD

            Explanation:  You are not defined to RACF and cannot issue
            the LISTDSD command, or RACF is not active.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH35005I NO DATA SETS LISTED

            Explanation:  No data sets were found that you are
            authorized to list.

  ICH35006I INSTALLATION EXIT FAILED LIST REQUEST FOR data-set-name

            Explanation:  The command preprocessing exit routine
            ICHCNX00 issued a return code of 4, indicating that RACF
            should fail the LISTDSD request for the indicated data
            set.

            System Action:  Processing of the LISTDSD command
            continues with the next data set specified.

            User Response:  Report this message to the system
            programmer.

  ICH35007I NO RACF DESCRIPTION FOUND ON THE SPECIFIED VOLUME(S)
            FOR data-set-name

            Explanation:  The RACF data base does not contain a
            discrete profile for the indicated data set for any of the
            volume serials given in the LISTDSD command.
