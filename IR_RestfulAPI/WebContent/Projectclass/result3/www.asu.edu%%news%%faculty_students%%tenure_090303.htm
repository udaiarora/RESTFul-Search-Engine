      <h2>President says tenure candidates display scholarly excellence</h2>
      <p>        The promotion and tenure process at ASU had an extra set of eyes this
          year, as President Michael Crow took an active part in evaluating applications
      and making decisions.</p>
      <p>"Nothing is more crucial to ASU's success in becoming
            the 'New American University' than the quality, hard work and contributions
            of faculty
        in the areas of teaching, research and service," Crow says. </p>
      <p>"The overwhelming
          majority of tenure cases were successful, and some candidates were
        absolutely outstanding," he says. "The majority of promotion
          cases were successful as well. Overall I came away with a very positive
        view of the candidates and of the current process."</p>
      <p>Twenty-nine ASU faculty
          have been awarded tenure, and 48 have been promoted, which is about
        the same number as last year. They represent some of the
        finest teacher-scholars at the university, Crow says. </p>
      <p>In recognition
          of the hard work required for promotion and tenure, Crow and Executive
          Vice President and Provost Milton Glick doubled the standard salary
    increase for all faculty who received promotions. </p>
      <p>"Because I so firmly believe
    in the importance of promotion and tenure decisions as the foundation for
        ASU's continuing and future excellence, I believe it
    is vital that I accept the responsibility of making those final decisions,"
    Crow says.</p>
      <p>In reviewing tenure cases, Crow says he looks to see that the standards
    used are, at a minimum, comparable with the standards of peer institutions
    whose
    student bodies, size and institutional mission most closely resembles ASU.
    More importantly, tenured faculty must be effective teacher-scholars, engaged
    in research and/or creative activities that inform teaching and teaching
        in a manner that informs research and creation.</p>
      <p>"I am fully committed to the premise
    that teaching is our prime directive, and scholarship is our pathway to better
    teaching," he says.</p>
      <p>The process of
    promotion and tenure at ASU has room for improvement, Crow says. There was
    a wide variation in the quality of submissions, with some files missing
    information or containing inadequate documentation or other serious flaws. </p>
      <p>In most cases President Crow's decisions were consistent with departmental,
    college and/or university-level recommendations. Most of the candidates who
    were denied tenure may reapply later, including a handful who received promotions
    without tenure.</p>
      <p>"Tenure represents such an enormous, long-term institutional
    investment that I am not willing to make positive promotion and tenure decisions
    unless files
    are complete and persuasive," Crow says.</p>
      <p>Nine academic professionals also received
    promotions or achieved continuing status, which is different from tenure
        but has similar employment security
    provisions. </p>
      <p>For the 2003 - 04 academic year, the Provost's Office has revised
    procedures and guidelines for promotion and tenure and supplied more detailed
    instructions
    for personnel actions. The office will be conducting workshops for department
    chairs and faculty to assist in improving the quality of promotion and tenure
    packages.</p>
      <p>In addition the Provost has appointed a Promotion and Tenure Task
    Force of faculty and administrators from all three campuses to examine policies
    and
    procedures and make recommendations for long-term changes. The faculty will
    be fully engaged in these discussions before any final recommendations are
    issued.</p>
