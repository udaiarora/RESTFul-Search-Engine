                  This bibliography is intended for those who need to know salary information for job interviews and for those who need to set salaries, wages and benefits of employees. This is NOT a comprehensive list. This covers those titles that ASU Libraries receive on a regular basis for frequently requested professions or fields of employment and web sites for similar information. Several works included in the list do provide citations to more specific professions or subject fields. The abstract after each title will indicate which of these titles can be used to find surveys of specific professions. For more information on job titles, job descriptions, general salary ranges and company specific information, please use the <B>CAREERS</B> Bibliography. <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Compensation</i></B> is the newer all encompassing term for all forms of pay and perquisites, but many sources still use the older, more popular terms of <B><I>Salaries</i></B> or <B><I>Wages</i></B> for the fixed amount of monetary pay and <B><I>Employee Benefits</i></B> to mean the supplemental pay and additional programs such as insurance, retirement plans, and leave programs. When searching in library online catalogs, on the Internet or in the indexes, these terms have yielded the best results. For specific types of compensation, use the more specific term such has <I>401(K)</I>, <I>health insurance</I>, <I>retirement plans</I>, <I>sick leave</I>, etc.

    This is really an annotated encyclopedic dictionary of the specialized jargon of human resources and employee benefits. While it is a very good dictionary, there are many references to various US laws, codes, and regulations, which are constantly under revision, so it is wise to verify that the rules haven&rsquo;t changed since this work was published. <BR>

Most indexes to periodicals do have some salary information. For the<U> electronic versions of indexes</U> (<A 
href="http://www.lib.asu.edu/lib-bin/journal.cgi"> http://www.lib.asu.edu/lib-bin/journal.cgi</A>), try using the major subject index for a profession and search by job title and the words "salary" or "wages". If too many articles are found, add the word "survey" to the search. In the paper copies of indexes, look under the job title and also look under the headings "salary surveys", "salaries" or "wages". <BR>

Employee Compensation is the term for all forms of pay to employees. The cost of hiring training and keeping employees is an important factor in employment decisions. There are a few important works that help employers make decisions in hiring and in contract negotiations. <BR>

    By using the geographical outline, which is arranged by state and then city, it is possible to get a range of wages for specific occupational titles. Not all occupations are covered for each city. The main body of the work is arranged by occupational title. For each item, the level of experience, geographic location, wage pay period, and a low, median, and high wage is given. The source and date of the information is also provided. For those who are interested in the occupation more than the location, use the outline of contents, which is a subject approach to the occupational titles. There are several useful appendices. The two most useful ones are the list of sources and the salary conversion table. The list of sources can be used to get a complete citation to the salary survey of a particular profession, then check the <A href="http://catalog.lib.asu.edu/">ASU Libraries Online Catalog</A> to see if we own the latest edition. The salary conversion table gives the hourly, weekly, monthly and annual salaries. This is critical since the main section has no consistency in the pay period used for the wages. <BR>

    This is an index to statistics published by international intergovernmental agencies such as United Nations, OECD, UNESCO, OAS, among others. The best access to information available is to use the subject entry "earnings, general" or "earnings, specific industry". The items under these headings are arranged by continent and country. At the end of the list of items under each earnings term is a list of additional terms. The actual statistical publications may be owned by ASU in paper format or in the IIS microfiche collection.

    These various types of wage and compensation surveys cover hourly wages, employee benefits, paid holidays, and vacations. Most of the individual occupational titles covered are for production workers, office workers and transportation workers. General categories are done for each of the major industries and some reports have been issued on professional jobs. The wage surveys are usually arranged by geographic AREA, mostly metropolitan areas, by INDUSTRY, or OCCUPATIONAL group. The title <U>Area Wage Surveys</U> has about 5 different versions and call numbers. There are also <U>Occupation Compensation Surveys</U> and the <U>Occupation Pay Compensation series</U>. These last two will eventually merge into the National Compensation Survey. Ask for help at the Government Documents Reference Desk. <BR>

    These sites are run by the group America's Job Bank. They provide links to state employment offices and allows searches for jobs by state, occupation, job titles, job classification codes, and education or skills required. You actually need to view the job listing to get any salary information. The sorting capabilities make it fairly easy to build a current salary survey for yourself. <BR>

    These pages provide links to all the city county and state offices and agencies that have web pages. Most of the personnel or human resources offices of these governments provide job postings or listings for the week. Since most of the governments use a civil service classification system for jobs, salary range information is included in the job posting. Remember that governments tend to pay less than companies do for the same job, but these salary figures can be used to gauge salaries paid in an area. Some human resource departments actually do put their civil service code manual of job titles and pay ranges on a web site. </LI>
