The primary campus sponsor must be a university employee (not a student employee) and must require that all advertising, sponsorship, and promotional activities adhere to these regulations.</li><p><li>Advertising, sponsorship, and promotion activities and materials may not promote the excessive use of alcohol and shall make reasonable efforts to avoid demeaning, sexual, and discriminatory portrayal of individuals or groups.</li><p><li>All advertisements for an event at which alcohol is being served or consumed shall be restricted to the residence of the guests or members who are invited to the event. No general posting of limited invitation events is permitted. Exceptions may include sharing of philanthropic information with the general campus community. These advertisements must not, however, imply that the general public may attend an event that is a limited invitation event.</li><p><li>Student organizations, individual and organizational sponsors, and campus units shall not allow, promote, or cooperate with retail licensees, wholesalers, or suppliers in the promotion of the following on university property:<br><p><ol type="a"><li>activities that are not in compliance with state laws, this policy, and other university policies</li><p><li>activities that promote use of alcohol as a solution to personal or academic problems or as necessary for social or academic success</li><p><li>activities that promote large quantities or excessive frequency of alcohol use<p>and</li><p><li>activities that promote the performance of tasks requiring skilled reactions, such as the operation of motor vehicles, and the use of alcohol. (Exceptions would include monitored educational or research programs.)</li></ol></li></ol><p><ol start="5"><li>The primary purpose of any sponsorship on university property shall not be the promotion of the retail licensee&#146;s, wholesaler&#146;s, or supplier&#146;s product or organization. The intent must be to endorse and support alcohol education programs that provide for informed and responsible decision-making on the part of the individual to consume or not to consume spirituous liquor. The primary campus sponsor must identify and assure that educational reasons for the activity or event receive prominent display on any material or announcements. Pictures of spirituous liquor products shall not be permitted; however, nonspecific artistic graphics may be used and the retail licensee&#146;s, wholesaler&#146;s, or supplier&#146;s logo or trademark is acceptable for use in print material.</li><p><li>The use of pneumatic or air-inflated replicas of cans, bottles, blimps, or balloons shall not be permitted.

Grant or contract employees must notify the employer of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days after the conviction. Any employee who violates the Drug-Free Workplace policy is subject to prosecution and punishment by the civil authorities as well as to disciplinary procedures by the university, which may result in termination of employment.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Illegal Drugs and Controlled Substances&#151;Drug-Free Schools and Campuses</b></font><p>ASU is committed to providing a drug-free environment for all university students and employees. To achieve this goal and to comply with federal law, ASU prohibits the unlawful sale, manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and use of controlled substances on its property or as part of any of its activities.<p>Sanctions are imposed on a student who violates a Board of Regents&#146; or university drug or alcohol policy; those sanctions may include suspension or expulsion and may also include the requirement that the student participate in a drug education or assessment program. Sanctions are imposed on an employee who violates this policy; those sanctions may include progressive discipline, termination of employment, and the requirement that the employee participate in a drug education or assessment program.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Alcohol and Other Drugs&#151;Health Risks</b></font><p><b>Alcohol</b><p>Alcohol consumption causes a number of marked changes in behavior. Even low doses significantly impair the judgment and coordination required to drive a car safely, increasing the likelihood that the driver will be involved in an accident. Low to moderate doses of alcohol also increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, including spouse and child abuse. Moderate to high doses of alcohol cause marked impairments in higher mental functions, severely altering a person&#146;s ability to learn and remember information. Very high doses cause respiratory depression and death. If combined with other depressants of the central nervous system, much lower doses of alcohol will produce the effects just described.<p>Repeated use of alcohol can lead to dependence. Sudden cessation of alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and convulsions. Alcohol withdrawal can be life threatening. Long-term consumption of large quantities of alcohol, particularly when combined with poor nutrition, can also lead to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and the liver.<p>Mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome. These infants have irreversible physical abnormalities and mental retardation. In addition, research indicates that children of alcoholic parents are at greater risk than other youngsters of becoming alcoholics.<p><b>Illegal Drugs</b><p>A description of health risks associated with the use of illegal drugs is reprinted in the <i>Schedule of Classes.</i><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Alcohol and Other Drugs&#151;Education and Treatment Programs</b></font><p><ol><li>Education is the primary focus of the university, and substance abuse prevention is a goal of this policy. The university provides honest and factual information through organized educational programs in an effort to assist individuals to make decisions regarding the use of alcohol and other drugs.
