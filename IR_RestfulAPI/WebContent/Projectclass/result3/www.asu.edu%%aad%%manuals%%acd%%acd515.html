Each individual must be hired on his or her own merits and not because the individual is related to a person whom the university wishes to recruit.  Hiring officials must determine that both individuals are qualified and suitable hires for the university.<P>However, no employee of the university may hire, appoint, review, supervise, direct, promote, or participate in decisions involving hire, renewal, retention, supervision, promotion, evaluation, or compensation of a <A HREF="acd002.html#relative" TARGET="New">relative</A>, or a member of the employee&#146;s established household (referred to collectively as &#147;relative&#148;).<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B> Hiring Procedures </B></FONT><P><B> Relatives Who Are Recommended for Hire Independently </B><P>If both individuals are recommended as finalists in independent searches, by search committees for example, for regularly advertised positions, and the hiring officials agree with the recommendations, the individuals may be hired.

If offer letters are given, they must be accompanied by written documentation from the appropriate dean, director, chair, or coordinator of the unit in which the relative is being hired.  This documentation must describe the process of evaluating the credentials of the <A HREF="acd002.html#candidate" TARGET="New">candidate</A> and must provide a recommendation from the unit head.<P><B> Relatives of Employees Who Desire University Employment </B><P>Individuals who are related to current university <A HREF="acd002.html#employees" TARGET="New">employees</A> may apply for and be considered without prejudice for any advertised positions at ASU.

The responsibility for key decisions must be assigned to another individual who is higher in administrative rank than either relative (an <A HREF="acd002.html#alternateadministrator" TARGET="New">alternate administrator</A>).  In some cases, it may be necessary to assign the responsibility to someone of an equal rank (e.g., another dean, director, chair, or coordinator), but the responsibility for key decisions cannot be given to someone whose own evaluation will be supervised by one of the relatives.<P>The arrangement must be put in writing and placed in the personnel file of each relative.  The appropriate dean or director is responsible for establishing administrative review and for responding to complaints or concerns about the review process.  If a dean, director, or <A HREF="acd002.html#vicepresident" TARGET="New">vice president</A> is one of the related family members, then the provost or the <A HREF="acd002.html#president" TARGET="New">president</A> (if the provost is one of the related family members) will be responsible for arranging alternate administrative review.<P><B><A NAME="Day-to-Day Assignments">Day-to-Day Assignments</A></B><P><A HREF="acd002.html#daytodayassignments" TARGET="New">Day-to-day assignments</A> normally will be handled by the person assigned such responsibilities (the <A HREF="acd002.html#supervisingadministrator" TARGET="New">supervising administrator</A>) whether or not he or she is a relative of an individual who is subject to such assignments.  The alternate administrator should do periodic monitoring to avoid either actual or perceived biases.  Individuals perceiving a conflict of interest or bias may discuss it with the alternate administrator.  The identity of the alternate administrator may be obtained from the supervisor of the higher ranking family member.  If the alternate administrator agrees that there is a problem, he or she should consult with the dean, director, or vice president about how to remedy the situation.  If a dean, director, or vice president is one of the relatives, then the alternate administrator should consult with the provost or president (if the provost is the relative).  If a satisfactory solution is not provided, a complaining party may file a grievance.<P><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Cross-References</B></FONT></CENTER><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><P>For further information, see:<P><OL><LI><A HREF="acd509-02.html">ACD 509&#150;02</A>, &#147;Grievance Policies and Procedures for Faculty&#148;<P>and</LI><P><LI><A HREF="acd509-03.html">ACD 509&#150;03</A>, &#147;Grievance Policies and Procedures for Academic Professionals.&#148;</LI></OL><P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><HR><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">ACD</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="acd001.html">contact</A> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="provost.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
