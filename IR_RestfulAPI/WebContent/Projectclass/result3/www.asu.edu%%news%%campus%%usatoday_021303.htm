      <p> Sarah Auffret, (480) 965-6991, <a href="mailto:sauffret@asu.edu">sauffret@asu.edu</a><br>
        February 13, 2003</p>
      <h2> ASU seniors on USA Today list of top undergraduates, setting record</h2>
      <p> An Arizona State University senior who spent a year in Mongolia working 
        on bank reform has been chosen one of the top 20 undergraduates in the 
        United States by USA Today. Collin Raymond has been named to the 2003 
        All-USA College Academic first team in the Feb. 13 issue.</p>
      <p> Esther Ellsworth, a biology and society senior, is among 20 named to 
        the second team. Both came to ASU in 1999 as freshman National Merit Scholars. 
        They are the 12th and 13th ASU students to earn the newspaper&#146;s recognition 
        in this national award in the past 11 years.</p>
      <p>Eight ASU students have earned prestigious first team honors, the best 
        record of any public university in the nation. Only Harvard and Yale have 
        more. </p>
      <p> Raymond is a math whiz who plays saxophone and piano in his own jazz 
        combo, leads a scout troop at Pappas school for homeless children and 
        edits both an undergraduate research journal and a campus literary magazine. 
        He has even participated in ASU student government as a senator.</p>
      <p> &#147;Collin has been a pleasure to work with,&#148; says Glenn Hurlbert, 
        math professor who worked with Raymond on his Goldwater-award winning 
        undergraduate math research. &#147;He is a most engaging, curious and 
        insightful student, and always has one eye on some real-world application. 
        His breadth of abilities and interests make for an encouraging mix of 
        possibilities in his future.&#148;</p>
      <p> Raymond went to Mongolia on a National Security Education Program fellowship 
        to study the language and developmental economics. He also ended up documenting 
        the ruins of 1,000 Buddhist temples, volunteering at an orphanage and 
        documenting AIDS victims in Tanzania.</p>
      <p> In December he won the prestigious Marshall Scholarship for two years 
        of graduate study in Great Britain, and he has also been a Goldwater Scholar 
        and Bank One Scholar. An economics and math major, he grew up in Eagan, 
        Minn.</p>
      <p> Like Raymond, Esther Ellsworth is well-known in the College of Liberal 
        Arts and Sciences and the Barrett Honors College for her breadth of activities 
        and her commitment. She is a biology teaching assistant and has developed 
        K-12 curricula for the Southwest Center for Education and the Natural 
        Environment. She is also a longtime volunteer for Andre House homeless 
        shelter and the All Saints Catholic Newman Center.</p>
      <p> Ellsworth, who grew up in Prescott, also won a Truman Scholarship, the 
        nation&#146;s highest undergraduate leadership award, and a national Udall 
        Scholarship for environmental policy students. She is also a Flinn Scholar.</p>
      <p> The USA Today award winners were chosen from almost 500 top students 
        nominated from their schools. Each year a team of judges chooses 20 outstanding 
        students for the first team, each of whom receives a $2,500 award and 
        a trophy. Twenty are named to a second team and 20 to a third team.<br>
        The judges considered grades, leadership, activities and most of all, 
        how students extend their intellectual talents beyond the classroom. </p>
