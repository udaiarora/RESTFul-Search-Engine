<P><I>Art and Poetry: Being Thoughts Towards Nature</I>. No. 3 (Mar 1850)
and No. 4 (Apr 1850). London: Dickinson, 1850. Literary organ of the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood. In tan morroco pull-off case by Sangorski and Sutcliff with
The Germ as spine title. This journal began under the title The Germ: Thoughts
towards Nature In Poetry, Literature, and Art. However, after the first
two issues the title was changed &quot;in consequence of some misapprehension
of its intent&quot; to Art and Poetry: Being Thoughts towards Nature. This
particular volume contains the first four issues, Nos. 1 &amp; 2 (January,
1850 and February 1850) under the original title and Nos. 3 &amp; 4 under
the revised title. The journal contains &quot;original Poems, Stories to
develope thought and principle, Essays concerning Art and other subjects,
and analytic Reviews of current Literature--particularly Poetry. Each number
will also contain an Etching; the subject to be taken from the opening
article of the month.&quot; The journal is intended to &quot;claim for
Poetry that place to which its present development in the leterature of
this country so emphatically entitles it.&quot; The journal is also designed
to encourage the adherence to the simplicity of nature in all art. The
etchings are designed to further this aim. Additional notes are found at

<P><I>Art and Poetry: Being Thoughts Towards Nature</I>. No. 3 (Mar 1850)
and No. 4 (May [i.e. Apr] 1850). 2 vol. London: Dickinson, 1850. Rpt. London:
Elliot Stock, 1901. In case with The Germ, rpt. London: 1901. Literary
organ of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Includes a separately bound Preface
by William Michael Rossetti which explains the aims of the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood as well as the purpose fot this journal. Rossetti surmises
on the reasons for the journal's failure after only four issues. He also
discusses the contents of each issue and includes reviews which appeared
at the time of the journal's publication. The first two issues appeared
under the title The Germ and then the title was changed so the journal
was continued by Art and Poetry (reprint 1901) for its remaining two issues.

Preface by William Morris. London: Longmans, 1899. First published 1893.
Printed at the Chiswick P. Morris's preface discusses the way in which
he feels &quot;we ought to face the present position of that revival in
decorative art of which our Society [Arts and Crafts Exhibiton Society]
is one of the tokens.&quot; Morris states that the present position is
that &quot;the lack of beauty in modern life (of decoration in the best
sense of the word), which in the earlier part of the century was unnoticed,
is now recognised by a part of the public as an evil to be remedied if
possible; but by far the larger part of civilised mankind does not feel
that lack in the least, so that no general sense of beauty is extant which
would force us into the creation of a feeling for art which in its turn
would force us into taking up the dropped links of tradition, and once
more producing genuine organic art.&quot; The essays contained in this
volume cover such diverse topics as textiles, wall papers, fictiles, metal
work, stone and wood carving, furniture, stained glass, table glass, printing,
bookbinding, mural painting scraffito work, stucco, cast iron, dyeing,
embroidery, lace, book illustration and decoration, designs and working
drawings, intarsia and inlaid woodwork, materials, colour, and stitches
and mechanism. These essays have a number of different authors as well,
including Morris himself, May Morris, F. Madox Brown, Walter Crane, G.
T. Robinson, Stephen Webb, Somers Clarke, and Alan S. Cole, among others.
