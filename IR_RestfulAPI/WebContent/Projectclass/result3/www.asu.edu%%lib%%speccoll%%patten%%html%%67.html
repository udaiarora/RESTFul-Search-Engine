<P>
This herbal, one of the earliest herbals in the collection, describes the medicinal properties of plants, and differs from others in that it is written in Latin hexameter verse.  The original edition of this work was completed around 1373.  Some texts identify the Macer listed in the opening line of the book as Aemilius Macer, whose herb lore is referred to by Ovid, but internal references to medieval sources cast doubt upon his authorship.  Instead, it is commonly believed that the author might have been Odo, Bishop of Maung.  Odo's name appears on a manuscript of 13th century origin, containing the words "of the power of herbs, the author being Odo, called Macer of the Flowers."  The first printed edition of 1477 contains many discrepancies which are compounded in subsequent editions.
 The text is derived from Pliny, Galen, Dioscorides, Hippocrates, and other classical writers.  Some remedies are based on sound observations, while others allude to magic or witchcraft.  Physicians loved it because the rhymes served as an aid to memory.
