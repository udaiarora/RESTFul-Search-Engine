      <h2>Researchers enter comparative genomics age with large-scale study</h2>
      <p> An ASU researcher is part of a group of scientists reporting the first 
        large-scale comparison of the human genome to 12 other vertebrates. The 
        work is an important step in understanding how vertebrate species are 
        genetically similar or different from one another, and provides a glimpse 
        into the evolutionary past of humans. </p>
      <p>For example, the work shows that humans are more closely related to rodents 
        than to dogs or cats. <br>
        The team, which includes Jeff Touchman &#151; an assistant professor of 
        biology and director of the sequencing facility at the Translational Genomics 
        Research Institute in Phoenix &#151; published its findings in the Aug. 
        14 issue of Nature. </p>
      <p>The report, &#147;Comparative analyses of multi-species sequences from 
        targeted genomic regions,&#148; details the comparison of one targeted 
        region of the human genome (a segment of the human chromosome 7, which 
        includes the gene mutated in cystic fibrosis) to the same region of other 
        vertebrates ranging from chimpanzees to zebrafish. Touchman directed the 
        sequencing effort of this work while he was at the National Institutes 
        of Health in Bethesda, Md.</p>
      <p>&#147;This is a significant genomic achievement,&#148; Touchman said. 
        &#147;We can learn a lot about the human genome by comparing it to the 
        genomes of other species.&#148; </p>
      <p>The team, which included 71 researchers from 10 institutions, made the 
        comparisons of the human genome to that of the chimpanzee, baboon, cat, 
        dog, cow, pig, rat, mouse, chicken, two species of puffer fish and zebrafish.</p>
      <p>Touchman said the work is both a technical achievement in the amount 
        of the genome sequenced (1.8 million base pairs in each of the 12 species), 
        as well as for what will be learned by comparing these genome sequences 
        together. It could provide clues as to how each vertebrate evolved. <br>
        &#147;One of the things we examined was how much of the genome sequence 
        was &#145;conserved&#146; across organisms,&#148; Touchman said. </p>
      <p>As organisms evolved into species, specific sequences were conserved, 
        or selected for retention in the genome, over millions of years of evolution. 
        The sequences that were conserved are thought to be strong candidates 
        for being biologically significant to the survival of that species. </p>
      <p>&#147;We already know that genes are very highly conserved across vertebrate 
        species, but what we are finding now is that not only are genes conserved, 
        but other anonymous sequences are conserved as well,&#148; Touchman said. 
        &#147;These regions are likely to control important functions such as 
        gene expression.&#148;</p>
      <p>Also, by studying the differences in the genome of humans compared to 
        other vertebrates, the researchers could determine when organisms split 
        off and headed in different evolutionary directions.<br>
        The work shows that humans are genetically more closely related to mice 
        and rats than to dogs and cats. </p>
      <p>&#147;This has been a controversial issue,&#148; Touchman said. &#147;We 
        determined this by looking at the ancestral repetitive sequences that 
        are in these genomes and compared them to each other to infer phylogenic 
        relationships.&#148;</p>
      <p>Touchman added that the real significance of the work might lie in the 
        paradigm of comparing large regions of genomic sequence together, from 
        multiple species to explore functional similarities and differences in 
        the genetic code of those species. Because sequencing is an arduous and 
        costly task, scientists do not have complete sequences of the genomes 
        of many species. But they are eager to begin the comparative study of 
        genomes. </p>
      <p>&#147;The work provides a first glimpse of the type of genomic studies 
        that will occur in the future as more and more whole genomes are sequenced,&#148; 
        Touchman said.</p>
