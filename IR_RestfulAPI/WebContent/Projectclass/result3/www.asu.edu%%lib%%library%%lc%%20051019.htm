            <br>
                  <p> Meeting was called to order at 3:02PM</p><br>

                  <h2>I. Approval of Minutes (<a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/library/lc/20050921.htm">September 21, 2005</a>) &ndash; Minutes were approved as amended</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>In the Dean&rsquo;s Report, AP Promotion and Tenure was corrected and changed to AP Promotion and Continuing Appointment. </li>
                    <li>In the Academic Senate report, BSC was corrected and changed to BCS. </li>

                  <br>
                  <h2> II. Chair &amp; Executive Committee Report</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The Executive Committee appointed Mimmo Bonanni to serve the remainder of Sandy Chen&rsquo;s term (through June &rsquo;06) on the Research and Professional Development Committee</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  <h2> III. Dean&rsquo;s Report &ndash; Sherrie Schmidt <br>
                  </h2>
                  <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Vicki Coleman reported that President Crow recently met with the Deans and he asked the Deans to find external sources of funding for their units. This includes the library. Dean Schmidt proposed bringing in speakers to give grant writing workshops. The first speaker will be Cheryl Conover from the Office for Research and Sponsored Projects Administration. This meeting is opened to all AP&rsquo;s and they are encouraged to attend. Dean Schmidt is also interested in bringing in someone from outside ASU, who can talk about grant writing for libraries, to give a workshop. If anyone knows of someone we should invite, please email Vicki Coleman with the name. </li>
                      <li>Kurt Murphy gave an update on the issues with the ACD 507 revision. A revised copy of the ACD 507 will be distributed to AP&rsquo;s. The latest draft is scheduled to go to the Academic Senate for a first reading on October 24.
                          <ul>
                            <li>The section about rolling contracts has been revised to include an opportunity for improvement following an unsatisfactory review. ASU Libraries may not even use rolling contracts, as they apply better to other types of AP&rsquo;s. </li>
                            <li>It was asked if there was any clarification on the 3rd yr versus 2nd/4th yr probationary review cycles. The faculty have gone to a 3rd yr probationary review and the administration would like to see AP&rsquo;s do the same. The faculty have revised their annual review criteria to provide more feedback on progress towards tenure. The library may need to look at doing this. The ACD 507 leaves the details to the units on how to handle reviews, but the Provost&rsquo;s Office only requires a 3rd yr. review. It is uncertain when the ACD 507 will be voted on and approved, but when it is, the library will go to a 3rd yr probationary review cycle. Those who are already on a cycle will remain on that cycle. New hires will go on the 3rd yr. cycle. </li>
                            <li>Post-continuing reviews and annual reviews for those with continuing appointment are two different processes. If an AP receives an overall unsatisfactory review, it will trigger a Performance Improvement Plan and a post-continuing review. There will be no formal post-continuing review &ndash; only if an overall unsatisfactory review is received. </li>
                          </ul>
                      </li>

                      <li>The Committee has not met since the last Librarians&rsquo; Council meeting, so there is no report. They will meet again on October 20. They are waiting for the ACD 507 to become official, and then they will begin working. </li>

                      <li>The Review Committee is done with this year&rsquo;s packets. It was asked if the response had been good for external letters of support. The response was good and they received almost all the letters that were requested for the packets.&nbsp;</li>

They are taking a preliminary look at the possibility of having a single governing body for AP&rsquo;s across all the ASU campuses. The Fall Spotlight Series will feature Marjorie Zatz, who will address ACD 507 and the status of post-docs. There will also be an open forum for questions and answers. </li>
