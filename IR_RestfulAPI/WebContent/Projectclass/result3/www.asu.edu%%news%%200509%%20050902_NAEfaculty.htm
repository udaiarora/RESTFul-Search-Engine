              <p class="storyhead">Gaining prominence &ndash; National academies taking note of ASU </p>
              <p> An important element of ASU&rsquo;s rise to research prominence is the ability to draw top researchers to the university. </p>
              <p> In the last several years ASU has made strong additions to the faculty in a wide range of science and engineering fields, such as anthropology, electrical engineering, evolutionary biology, sustainability and vaccinology. </p>
              <p> Among these significant additions, are researchers who have reached the pinnacle of their profession, earning entry into the prestigious National Academy of Engineering and its counterparts, the National Academy of Sciences and Royal Society of London. These organizations represent the recognized leaders in the science and engineering fields. </p>
              <p> With these recent additions, ASU can now claim 18 total members of these prestigious groups. Here are brief profiles of ASU&rsquo;s newest national academy members:</p>
              <p align="center"><strong> NAE faculty</strong></p>
              <p><strong> <img src="200509_images/20050902VittalVijay.jpg" alt="Vijay Vittal" width="108" height="144" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="0" align="right">Vijay Vittal</strong>, professor with the Fulton School of Engineering. Joined ASU: 2004. </p>
              <p> Vittal&rsquo;s research aims to prevent power blackouts through a better understanding of power system dynamics and improved technology. He is researching new control methods for power systems and prevention of catastrophic failures. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of excitement and vibrant energy here at ASU,&rdquo; Vittal says. &ldquo;The focus on sustainability appealed to me.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong> <img src="200509_images/20050902_RittmanBruce.jpg" alt="Bruce Rittmann" width="108" height="144" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="0" align="right">Bruce Rittmann</strong>, civil and environmental engineer. Joined ASU: 2005 </p>
              <p> Rittmann is turning another man&rsquo;s trash into treasure by taking garbage and using microorganisms to convert it into electricity. Rittmann is trying to create a microbial fuel cell that runs on waste materials. The research fits into his goal of improving the environment through biotechnology. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;This is an exciting, forward-thinking university,&rdquo; Rittmann says. &ldquo;What appeals to me is the link between engineering and the Biodesign Institute. It&rsquo;s just a really special opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong> <img src="200509_images/20050902MahajanSubhash.jpg" alt="Subhash Mahajan" width="108" height="144" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="0" align="right">Subhash Mahajan,</strong> professor in the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering. Joined ASU: 1997 </p>
              <p> Mahajan&rsquo;s research has applications across a wide array of public concerns, such as solid-state lighting, information recording, water purification and combating bioterrorism. Mahajan looks at integrating dissimilar materials into new technologies, such as salt growth on sapphire. </p>

              <p><strong> <img src="200509_images/20050902_AdrianRonald.jpg" alt="Ronald Adrian" width="108" height="144" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="0" align="right">Ronald Adrian</strong>, professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Joined ASU: 2005. </p>
              <p> Adrian is no stranger to explosives. You&rsquo;ll never see them on the big screen, but his research into miniaturized detonations will help in the refinement of propulsion technologies, as well as other applications of small explosions. Adrian also works with fluid mechanics, studying the dynamics of fluid motion. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;I was attracted to ASU because it seemed like a good environment for beginning new activities,&rdquo; Adrian says. &ldquo;I like the openness of the thinking to new ideas at this university.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong> <img src="200509_images/20050902_CrittendenJohn.jpg" alt="John Crittenden" width="108" height="144" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="0" align="right">John Crittenden</strong>, Richard Snell Presidential Chair in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Joined ASU: 2004 </p>
              <p> Crittenden is committed to sustainability. His research focuses on water quality and environmental engineering with an emphasis on urban development. One research project he is working on studies the effects of treatment of drinking water on nanomaterials present in the water. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;What we&rsquo;re focusing on is sustainability on an urban scale,&rdquo; Crittenden says. &ldquo;At ASU, there are something like 100 faculty members working on sustainability issues from a variety of angles. The Valley represents a laboratory where we can develop new applications and concepts for our research.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>NAS faculty</strong></p>
              <p><strong> <img src="200509_images/20050902_RoyCurtiss.jpg" alt="Roy Curtiss III" width="108" height="144" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="0" align="right">Roy Curtiss III</strong>, co-director of the Center for Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology with the Biodesign Institute. Joined ASU: 2004. </p>
              <p> Curtiss studies the biological and chem ical processes of infectious bacteria such as salmonella. He hopes his research will lead to a better understanding of the genetic component to bacterial attachment and growth on surfaces. He also is studying how salmonella survives outside of a warm-blooded host.</p>
              <p><strong> <img src="200509_images/20050902_hoelldobler.jpg" alt="Bert Hoelldobler" width="108" height="144" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="0" align="right">Bert Hoelldobler</strong>, professor with the School of Life Sciences. Joined ASU: 2004. </p>
              <p> Hoelldobler looks to insects to understand social networks of other species, including human beings. He uses social insects to model behavioral systems while studying the organization and communication systems of ant societies. He combines this with his research of population genetics and the evolution of social systems. </p>
              <p> &ldquo;During several visits, I sensed that ASU had a very modern vision of the biological sciences,&rdquo; Hoelldobler says. &ldquo;They seem to understand that modern biological research is not just molecular or cellular biology, but also organismic biology, biodiversity, population biology, integrated neurobiology, behavioral biology and all the important aspects of evolutionary biology. ASU demonstrated an impressive commitment to further strengthen biological research and to foster cross-disciplinary research centers. It is exciting and very challenging to be able to play an important role in building this international group.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong> <img src="200509_images/20050902JaneBuikstra.jpg" alt="Jane Buikstra" width="108" height="144" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="0" align="right">Jane Buikstra</strong>, director of the Center for Bioarchaeological Research. Joined ASU: 2005. </p>

              <p><strong>RSL faculty</strong><br>
                  <br>
                  <img src="200509_images/20050902GeorgePoste.jpg" alt="George Poste" width="108" height="144" hspace="2" vspace="2" border="0" align="right"><strong>George Poste</strong>, director of the Biodesign Institute. Joined ASU: 2003.               
              <p>Poste, at the turn of the millennium, had a plan for easing into retirement 
  following a 38-year career in academia, industry and government. But, in 2003, Poste received a call from President Crow, who asked him to join ASU as leader of the Biodesign Institute, a bold initiative intended to launch ASU into the ranks of premier research universities. Poste says he 
  recognized an opportunity to more directly impact the challenges for which his expertise was so often being sought &shy; and to contribute to building a vibrant research culture in Arizona. 
              <p>
&quot;The vision of ASU President Michael Crow for a New American University is compelling, and echoes many of my own ideas about the transformation needed within our academic and research institutions,&quot; Poste says. &quot;But, what convinced me that I had to be part of the vision was the incredible progress that had been made in what, at the time, was Michael Crow&sup1;s first year at 
the helm of ASU. With that type of leadership, I knew we could create a program to produce profound benefits in my lifetime. It's also an 
opportunity to chart a more integrated course for future generations of scientists.&quot;</p>
