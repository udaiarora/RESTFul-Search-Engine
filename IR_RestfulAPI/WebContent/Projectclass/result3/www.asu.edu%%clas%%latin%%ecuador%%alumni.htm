  <h2>ECUADOR: The Amazon and the Andes Field School: Alumni News</h2>
	<h3>Chronicles of the Ecuador Field school</h3>
	<p><strong>Jarrett Levine?s time in the Ecuadorian Amazon</strong></p>
	<img src="images/jarret.jpg" class="imagefloatleft">
	<p><cite>?I now often think the past summer in Ecuador. Living in the jungle with fellow classmates,
	 instructors and the Andi ayllu (community) was a remarkable and educational experience. My mind 
	 is filled with thoughts of the warm hearted Quichua families who opened their homes to the group 
	 and were always willing to help. Touring Ecuador while studying in Dr. Swanson?s Ecuador Field School 
	 will have a permanent impact on my life, and my future. I hope that this program continues for years 
	 to come so that other students can participate and gain the insight that I did this past summer.?</cite></p>
	 
	 <p>This is a quote from Jarrett Levine?s field journal. Jarrett is a Political Science senior at Arizona 
	 State University. In the summer of 2003, he participated in the Ecuador Field School sponsored by the Center 
	 for Latin American Studies at ASU. Jarrett enrolled in this program with the desire to learn Spanish, but never 
	 imagined that he will come back to ASU with a newfound appreciation for native Ecuadorian culture and its 
	 application to his field of study, International Relations. While attending the Field School, Jarrett was deeply 
	 touched not only by the members of the community where the Field School is located, but by all the elements that 
	 compose this unique place. Jarrett was quick to recognize the immense socioeconomic pressure that exists in the 
	 Amazon. He quickly became aware of the fragile environment he came to visit. He later wrote in his field 
	 journal:</p>
	 <img src="images/clip_image002.jpg" class="imagefloatright">
	 <p><cite>?I envision the youth of the Oriente (Ecuador?s Amazon Basin) gaining an education, so that a majority 
	 of the young people will be literate in Spanish while maintaining their traditional language as well. Attaining 
	 literacy will open doors for individuals to attend universities and receive professional training. This will 
	 provide more opportunities for financial success?.</cite></p>
	 
	 <p>Jarrett?s goodwill and genuine appreciation for the experience he was afforded at the Field School was so 
	 great; so much in fact, that after the program ended, he met his parents who came from Michigan to Quito and 
	 made the trek across the Ecuadorian Andes and into the jungle. Jarrett and his parents arrived at the Fundacion 
	 Cotococha, where they were welcomed by the members of the community and Dr. Tod Swanson, Director of the Field 
	 School and the Center for Latin American Studies at Arizona State University. This experience led to very 
	 positive results for both parties. Like Jarrett earlier had, the Levines learned a great deal from the people in 
	 this place. They were so appreciative of the quality time they had spent there that they made a donation for 
	 $5,000 dollars to the children?s school system. One of the main goals of the Field School is to continue to 
	 preserve and exchange cultural knowledge, traditions, languages, and forest conservation techniques among others. 
	 The Levines? generous donation will have a very positive impact on improving the children?s school system; 
	 Jarrett?s vision of education for the youth in the Oriente is now more attainable than before his arrival.</p>
	 
	 <p>I had the pleasure of meeting Jarrett at the Field School. What struck me about Jarrett is his deep interest 
	 in helping others, in always learning about life as it takes place in other places of this planet, his ease to 
	 communicate with people, even if he does not speak Quichua, and his charisma towards all those around him.</p>

	 <p><strong><cite>?Hopefully, with proper conservation and protection of the forest, others will be able to enjoy the experience 
	 that I did this summer.?</cite>---Jarrett Levine</strong></p>

	<p><strong>Tiffany Hardy</strong> (Summer 2000) writes that she is getting married in Spain next January to 
	Luis Cuenca, her boyfriend of four years.  "It is going to be a unique wedding," she writes.  "Sixty people 
	from the United States are coming over.  My grandparents who are around 90 years old are thrilled to be going 
	also.  We are getting married in Luis's small home town.  It will be great to have everyone out here, but I 
	have a lot of planning to do to keep them busy for a week or so.  A lot of people who are coming have never 
	left the United States before.  I am really looking forward to it."  Tiffany has been admitted to the M.A. 
	program in Sociology at Arizona State University for January of 2003.  For those of you who would like to 
	contact Tiffany, her e-mail is <a href="mailto:tiffinspain@hotmail.com">tiffinspain@hotmail.com</a>.  Date: 05/06/02.</p>
