<p><font size=+0><b>1. Call to Order</b>.</font>

<p><font size=+0>The meeting was called to order at 3:24 p.m. by Senate

President Doug Johnson.</font>

<p><b><font size=+0>2. Acceptance of Previous Minutes of May 1, 2000.</font></b>

<p><font size=+0>The minutes of May 1, 2000 were approved as published

on the Academic Senate web site and distributed by email. If there are

further editorial corrections, please contact Darby Shaw at the Senate

office (965-9245vm).</font>

<p><b><font size=+0>3. Announcements and Communications.</font></b>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.A. Senate President's Report</b> (Douglas Johnson).</font>

<p><font size=+0>I urge senators to be prompt at future meetings, although

we do start at 3:15 p.m. due to a class that meets here before we do. I

appreciate your cooperation on that.</font>

<p><font size=+0>We will begin with a forecast. As I tell my students,

this will be a short class; we might get out by 4:30 p.m.</font>

<p><font size=+0>I want to share with you some of the things we face in

the coming months as a university and as a Senate. There are some things

I feel are important to accomplish in the coming year.</font>

<p><font size=+0>The University has a lot of positive momentum. If you

look at our record, we are getting better in almost every measurable dimension.

The university enterprise is doing very well. However, we have a number

of external threats that we will have to deal with in the coming year.

I ask you to join with me and the other officers of the Senate in advancing

the University causes. If we look at these issues right now, we know that

the Task Force on Promotion and Tenure began meeting last year?the new

guidelines will make our practices more consistent with our rhetoric. In

similar fashion, the Task Force on the Status of Non-Permanent faculty

(non-tenure track faculty) has been working and will report to us very

soon. In many places at the university, lecturers make a contribution by

delivering important classes, activities and services. We wish to provide

those individuals with more stability and recognize their long-term commitment

to the university.</font>

<p><font size=+0>This year will be different than recent years when there

was little construction on campus. This year there are already several

major buildings planned, there are trenches being dug and wire fences going

up. One project is the expansion of Memorial Union, and in conjunction

with that, the faculty/staff locker room facilities in PE West will be

updated and opened at a nominal fee to those that wish to take advantage

of those lockers. Thanks to Provost Glick and Vice Provost Harrison for

assisting in the negotiation of that upgrade on behalf of the faculty.</font>

<p><font size=+0>In the coming elections, ASU needs to get the attention

of legislators from all the districts. To do so we must get faculty, staff

and students to vote. There are many opportunities to participate before

the election. Please attend the legislative forums that are coming up,

and attend the coffee in your voting district.</font>

<p><font size=+0>I wish I could tell you there are big budget improvements

and wonderful things in our future, but we will have to earn those possibilities

by trying to influence our legislative processes.</font>

<p><font size=+0>I found the Council of Deans Retreat to be very informative

this summer. Thanks to Provost Glick for inviting me to attend and to represent

the Senate. His analysis of the important issues, the threats to the university,

and the trends was beneficial to my understanding of the path we must take

as a Senate this year. The Executive Committee talked about those issues:

technology, distance learning, corporate universities, a range of new entities

that want to take our lunch, so to speak. They have taken on graduate education

as a business, and they want a piece of our action. It is a little uncomfortable

for faculty to examine this trend, understanding the potential that technology

will bring to higher education must be on our agenda this year. One of

the things we will try to do this year is foster a conversation on critical

issues, particularly technology and learning. With Learner Centered Education

(in the vernacular used by the Regents), we are looking at how we go about

achieving educational outcomes using technology. This may mean distance

learning courses and degree programs, and supplementing traditional courses.

It may mean we choose not to enter the game, but in the meantime, we do

need to promote a more in-depth conversation and develop greater familiar

with these issues. We have planned a series of demonstrations, workshops,

and conversations to look at the best of technology on campus today and

then try to address emerging issues in a thoughtful way. My objective this

year is to have special discussions under the open forum portion of the

Senate agenda on issues of importance to the faculty. I promise you more

than just a chance to vote on curriculum issues this year (which are in

themselves very important). So, look at the agendas and come prepared.</font>

<p><b><font size=+0>3.B University President?s Report</font></b><font size=+0>

(Lattie Coor).</font>

<p><font size=+0>It is always a pleasure to get the academic year underway.

Even though the University has become increasingly a year-round entity,

there is something about the opening of the Fall term. The surf washes

the sand clean and we start all over again. Those who can barely stand

to meet in May greet one another with open arms in August (much laughter

here).</font>

<p><font size=+0>Doug promised early adjournment and I agree to be brief.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Regarding Proposition 301, I believe it is the most significant

moment for Arizona that I have seen since I came here. We and our sister

institutions have done quite well with the somewhat modest support afforded

by the state legislature. Now, for the first time, by a vote of the people,

we have a chance to get a significant increase in our funding. The lion?s

share will go to K-12 but it is a great chance for the citizens of Arizona

to vote and show the legislature that they care about education by their

vote. When we succeed, and it will take the diligent effort of everyone,

we will at least have created the opportunity for serious and significant

consideration of the role of the universities in the future of the state.

If Prop 301 fails, I am still optimistic, and I think it will not reinforce

the opinions of the naysayers, but rather put salt in the wound. There

are some candidates that will be speaking over the next couple of weeks

in forums and I know you will receive more information on them prior to

each event. I do not want to diminish the effect of that, but every one

of us must take that extra step and vote.</font>

<p><font size=+0>The Governor?s Task Force on Higher Education should report

in November and there are still two critical meetings in October. The work

of that task force has been extraordinarily valuable. It has set the stage

in terms of the economic future of Arizona?in arguing the point about the

need for great universities in Phoenix and great universities in Arizona.

I believe it was that which evoked the Governor to take a strong step in

getting this proposition on the ballot. At the same time, this task force

is looking very soberly at how Arizona is going to handle a very substantial

growth in enrollment. We will have a set of recommendations on that which

are still being given final consideration: the balance between community

colleges and the universities, mission standards, governance and financing.

I will see that the Senate is kept fully informed as we move toward the

final recommendations; all three university presidents sit on this task

force and I think their work represents a promising path for us to take.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.C University Provost?s Report </b>(Milton Glick).</font>

<p><font size=+0>Starting off optimistically is always fun. We have largely

delivered on that optimism. I believe we are one of the few universities

in the country that gets better every year. I spoke to the Chairs and Directors

at their retreat and used 131 slides in my presentation. I know you do

not want that handout because it is too cumbersome, but I thought I would

try to sum up some of the things that we will keep on or add to the institutional

agenda this year.</font>

<p><font size=+0>First with the help of the faculty this year, we were

able to put in place the streamlining that President Coor initiated two

years ago and that a faculty committee had worked out as far as university

requirements and the General Studies requirements go. This year that program

has to be carried forward to every major. We will need a lot of faculty

help and support to implement the principles that we adopted with the Senate?s

concurrence two years ago.</font>

<p><font size=+0>You have heard that the Board of Regents is very concerned

about Learner Centered Education. A group which includes Bill Davey, past

president of the Arizona Faculties Council, his counterparts at NAU and

the UofA, two Regents and a member of the Board of Regents Staff, worked

at a conference on LCE and came back with an ambitious strategic agenda

which requires us to do a number of things differently.</font>

<p><font size=+0>This year I hope to speak to you, as I tried to last year,

on a number of issues, one at each meeting. I would like you to suggest

at your convenience any issues you may want explored at the Senate meetings.</font>

<p><font size=+0>The third issue is one that we keep talking about. We

are a very fragile Research university. Funding for research will be doubled

once again over the next three to four years nationally. Instead of that

meaning more research universities, it will mean fewer, because a number

of things will have to be invested to compete for this much bigger pie,

for us to be not only the kind of university most of us want to be, but

that the valley and the state need. We will have to find ways to expand

external research funding. You will be hearing about this more and more.

We believe that the best shot we have to do is to seed multi-disciplinary

efforts across the campus, to take on important problems that have societal

significance and where we have the capability to accomplish.</font>

<p><font size=+0>As Doug mentioned, we have had two task forces at work:

one on how to bring our promotion and tenure policies and practices in

line with our rhetoric, and I think that has gone well. We hope to have

some clear, broadly endorsed recommendations. The other has focused on

the status of non-permanent faculty on this campus? They are very important

to us. It is a misnomer (non-permanent) because all of us are non-permanent.

These are our lecturers and instructors and faculty associates in that

category. The answers to the questions are not as clearly agreed upon,

so there will probably be a series of options brought to you as senators

to consider later this year.</font>

<p><font size=+0>On the mission statement, the Regents have asked each

university to refine their mission with the intent of both integrating

Learner Centered Education policies into the institution, while differentiating

the missions of the three universities. We all understand that we have

much in common with our sister institutions, but nevertheless, there are

distinguishing characteristics. Obviously, the most distinguishing characteristic

of this university is its location and its special relationship to the

Phoenix metro area. It is not clear whether it will be a mission statement,

which the President makes, or a true mission statement that requires all

of our participation. We will talk to you further about that.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Now, an initiative that President Coor and Doug have mentioned

previously. The Governor and a coalition of Democratic and Republican moderates

put a proposition on the ballot, saying this is what the people of Arizona

believe in: "A" for education. The speaker of the House and the president

of the Senate think we are misreading that. This will be people?s chance

to help to make sure which story gets attention.</font>

<p><font size=+0>The Information Technology Policy does not refer to computer

science. It means that we have to find ways that all those students who

wish to, can come out of their degree program with a knowledge of complete

information management; that is, how to deal with the demand for knowledge.

We right now do not have the capacity to deal with that kind of intense

training for each and every student.</font>

<p><font size=+0>The Undergraduate Consolidated Accountability Report I

will talk about in depth some other time. This is the old Hurwitz measures

in new clothes. The important feature is one new measure that has not been

on there before. That new measure is the percent of our lower division

students who have two or more classes each semester with tenured or tenure

track faculty. In the past, there has been a measure of lower division

students having two or more courses each semester with ranked faculty.

We will be asking for your ideas on how we can increase that number (which

is a reasonable expectation from the students? viewpoint, even if it may

not seem reasonable from our resource viewpoint).</font>

<p><font size=+0>You heard that at the Deans Retreat we spent quite a bit

of time with a person who has put together fathom.com (Columbia University?s

e-learning portal). They have put twenty million dollars of their own money

into it and they are raising sixty million dollars of other venture capital,

in a commercial endeavor. Where we will fit into this new e-learning world

is still to be determined (most of us are rather schizophrenic); we know

it is real and we know we have to deal with it. We also look at all these

core needs of the institution, and the core needs of our students who are

our core business, some 40,000 students. It is a real issue. Education

enterprise in this country amounts to a trillion dollars. It is the largest

single-funded agency outside of health care and three times that of defense.

It is the only part of our enterprise that has been owned by the not-for-profit

sector. We will have to make sure that we do deliver to our traditional

student body the very best in education and at the same time meet other

needs. At the Center for Learning and Teaching Excellence we have had a

very good year. An analysis and in-depth study was conducted of the best

teaching practices in the country, the models that we should adopt. This

year we will be looking at the results of that study in reshaping the Center

for Learning and Teaching Excellence.</font>

<p><font size=+0>A recent examination was done of who our future students

may be. They will get most of their information about this university from

the web?what kind of a web face we put forward is very important. It has

to be consistent, it has to reflect the university, it has to reflect quality

and it has to be user friendly. We will be developing a framework with

the help with a number of faculty.</font>

<p><font size=+0>We have not built new buildings of significance since

1990. What has happened? During that time it was wise to have a moratorium

on buildings, after the enormous building effort that went on in the 80?s.

But now, we have two buildings on the books to be built. We must re-examine

the campus master plan, and look at it in the perspective of the year 2000

rather than the year 1990. There will be a committee with substantial faculty

input working with a master planner at this task.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Finally, perhaps most importantly, we must make sure that

we sell to students what they think they receive. If you don?t deliver

what you sell, you won?t be selling much longer. We have during this last

decade gone from having 10 National Merit Scholars to 132 last year, and

this year over 120. We have gone from 624 entering students who are in

the top ten percent of their high school class, to 1400 students in the

top ten percent of their class. We have gone from 1200 students in the

top 25% of their class, to 2700 students in the top quarter of their class.

If students are not getting what they came for, then that is a disparity

that we must deal with. We are going to be doing some surveys and trying

to understand the feedback that we get from these students. We will ask

each unit to look at what they as a unit or we as an institution can do

to remove some barriers that hamper student success. We will continue to

provide the very best possible education for our students. These are the

key elements that we will deal with out of the Provost Office this year.

Recognizing that 90 % of what goes on at the university goes on independent

of anything we do; we will carry forward? We need to count on you to do

all those good things where the action is at the faculty, staff, and student

level. We are only dealing with those areas where by doing something differently,

centrally; we can actually make differences happen for our various constituents.

The fact that we can show this kind of improvement shows in our University?s

research profile, it shows in the teaching profile of this University,

and in the quality of service that we get and the quality of service we

provide to the community. All this happens because of the faculty and staff

who are willing to stretch and do better.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Salaries will continue to be our agenda. Through substantial

reallocation, 17 million dollars over the last decade, we have managed

to prevent salaries from falling further behind the market, and actually

improved our situation relative to the market. But we are still a substantial

distance away from those market targets. We have to continue to tell the

story and make the effort because we need the kind of resources that will

pay productive faculty and staff what our competition pays. We must be

competitive in salaries. If we do not do that, it will be real hard to

do the other things we need to do. I will be happy to take your comments,

questions, or if you want to, let me know of any topic that you would like

to hear in a report to the Senate. Just send me an email at </font><font size=-1><a href="mailto:glick@asu.edu">glick@asu.edu</a></font><font size=+0>.

I am very appreciative of Doug for taking the leadership of creating the

conversation about Learner Centered Education, and in particular about

e learning and what our place in that galaxy ought to be.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Mayer: You spoke about the number of National

Merit Scholars among our freshmen. How big is that count?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Provost Glick: The freshmen class is not 6,000 yet. We

have gone from about 25% in the top ten percent of their class to 30% in

the top ten percent of their class. We have gone from about 51% to about

60% in the upper 25% of their class. I believe this raises the quality

of education for all students. A decade ago we started out to have a stronger

and a more diverse, freshman student class. We have remained consistent

on all three of those components. It is easy to do two of them but even

harder to do all three, but we have.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: So, that gives you an idea of

the magnitude of our agenda this year. Yes, we have been slow to change.

In the Senate, we have developed procedures that slow the decision process

enough to be sure that everyone got full opportunity for input into the

decision. Maybe it is time now to facilitate the decision process. Perhaps

now the question is how can we speed the decision process up and be more

responsive to the markets and the external parties as stakeholders? Being

responsive is a real challenge for us because our mechanism leans the other

way.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Brown: I think the Provost should know that we

would all like to view the 130 slides if he would hold the meeting in St.

John?s or somewhere like that (much laughter here).</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.D ASASU President?s Report</b> (Alex Bainbridge).</font>

<p><font size=+0>Welcome from the Associated Students. It is good to be

back on campus. I want to give you the "state of the student" report. We

are trying to get tangible items for students, things that serve the greater

good. A tangible item would be something like what Provost Glick talked

about, web based email. Better email is something that we really need to

have on campus. With better email, attachments can then be hyperlinked

to documents. Another example would be pencil sharpeners in all the classrooms

for the students. Parking is another big concern, which is an example of

the greater overall good for students. Parking lines during registration

should be cut down so they do not wrap around the Tower Building. Those

are small but tangible items that I will be working on this year for students

across the campus</font>

<p><font size=+0>We are promoting our services in a new brochure that I

distributed to you. These services are also available to faculty and staff

and students. The Safety Escort Service assists at night on campus and

there is the Bike Co-op for day students.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Funding higher education is a big concern for us this

year. We are supporting proposition 301. Associated Students has joined

with the Parents Association, the Alumni Association, and we are working

with faculty and staff. I encourage you to talk to your colleagues and

your students, and encourage them to become involved in supporting higher

education.</font>

<p><font size=+0>We all need to work on a master plan for our campus. We

need to make sure that our classrooms are up to par for the new technology,

more mediated classrooms, renovation of classrooms and at the same time

we need more technology for our faculty so they might teach more of the

Learner Centered Education. Tech literacy is what we are trying to give

our students; we need to bring them up to a certain level of tech literacy

before they graduate. It is a very big concern among our graduates and

our new students coming to our campus; do we have the capability of giving

graduates a level of technology that will help them succeed in this day

and age?</font>

<p><font size=+0>For my weekly report, ASASU just held its annual retreat

at Camp Tontozona. At the same time, that we have launched our new brochure,

we will be distributing a poster on campus that advertises those service

contact phone numbers. On this Wednesday, we will have our "Rock the Vote"

activity. Prop 301 needs voter support; spread the word to all your colleagues,

staff, and students to attend this event and support higher education.

We will be set up by the Palo Verde bridge. Please stop over in between

classes.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.F President-Elect/Past President?s Report</b> (David

Burstein).</font>

<p><font size=+0>Let me add my voice to those who have previously asked

how many of you are registered to vote. I hope that each citizen and faculty

member is registered to vote because this election will affect us all in

higher education. If we as citizens do not get out and vote in this election,

it could be very bad for us. As a community, we have to look at ourselves

as leaders within the community, and encourage everyone to vote by informing

them on the issues for the state. The first Alumni Association candidate

forum is going to be held tonight at ASU West. The second one will be held

Wednesday night at the Downtown Center. The third one is at ASU East on

September 6. The fourth and last one is here at the Law College is on September

7; in other words, the same day that we have the faculty breakfast we will

have a candidate forum in the evening.</font>

<p><font size=+0>You have a yellow card in front of you that asks you to

log yourself onto the ZsunDevils.com web site. Please do so, and establish

a free email account to send communication to your legislators. What we

hope to do is communicate with everyone who is a part of this university.

This way to communicate is separately financed apart from our university

computer system. It is against state law to proselytize on your ASU computers.

You cannot use your university computer to send emails to your legislators,

but the ZsunDevils page is funded privately through Alumni donations and

can be used for this purpose legally.</font>

<p><font size=+0>How many of you, just for information?s sake have already

requested an early ballot in the next election? It is probably a similar

fraction in the state. The problem is that they now estimate that 40% of

those voting in the next election have requested an early ballot for the

primary. We should campaign and talk about our message now?any idea that

we may want to get out during the election to our candidates-- attend these

candidate forums, and speak out now, because many voters are voting early

in this election.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Brown: I mention Proposition 106, which is the

one on redistricting. It is a very important one to vote on because we

now have an opportunity to correct our political mistakes through redistricting,

and a truly bipartisan committee will do it.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Past President Burstein: What happened to us in the past

is that following the last two census takings, the redistricting was <u>not</u>

done by a bipartisan committee. If you look at some of those districts,

you will note that they in fact look like a gerrymander. As a result of

drawing these safe districts for incumbents, 30 out of 90 seats will not

be contested. That is not what I call representative democracy.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.G ASU West Senate Report</b> (Vince Waldron): We

have begun our meetings with an Academic Senate meeting on Thursday last

week, and an Executive committee meeting on Wednesday. There are a number

of issues that are getting attention in the Senate this year. As some of

you may have heard, there is an action before the Board of Regents to have

the West Campus teach an experimental core of lower division courses and

our faculty are planning for this event. We are continuing the process

of revising our promotion and tenure guidelines that we began last year.

We also have put a lot of effort on getting the faculty and staff involved

in the political issues that are happening this year. I look forward to

working with you, Doug this year. David and I have already worked together

last year.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.H ASU East Senate Report</b> (Andy Jackson).</font>

<p><font size=+0>We have a couple of initiatives that we are beginning

to work on. A committee this week was working on what we want to be when

we grow up! One report on enrollment said that we are up 25%. (This is

probably not as high as the Provost would like to advertise but we are

quite happy with it).</font>

<p><font size=+0>It has become clear that without the passage of the education

initiative we are considering in this election, that we will not be able

to complete our infrastructure as planned. We need to have local and active

involvement in the political process; we need to take ownership of that

in this election.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>4. Open Forum</b>.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: I have asked Allan Price to

attend and talk to us today briefly about the politics of education because

this is crucial in this election year.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Allan Price: The University has always prided itself in

standing back from the political process and commentating on the outcomes.

We did not want to dig in and get dirty. What has become very clear to

me over the years, is if the University wants to do well in this political

environment, then the University will have to have increase grassroots

action in the political process. If we do not recognize that our power

lies in creating interest among our elected officials, then the legislators

will weigh the issues and we may become an item that does not have to be

dealt with based on the fact that others got the legislators involved and

interested in supporting their issues.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Prop 301 is an important one. This is similar in importance

to the ACE initiative in the early 90?s. ACE was a conglomerate of education

issues that would have provided some billion dollars in annual funding.

Think what that would have been worth today if the business community had

not come out against the ACE Initiative. The ACE Initiative lost badly

at the polls. For the next ten years, the loss of the ACE Initiative was

used by the legislature as a reason not to invest in education K through

Ph.d. Every time we tried to talk about more money, the ACE Initiative

defeat was thrown in our face. That is why Prop 301 is so important, because

it will be taken by the legislature as the referendum on the people?s interest

in funding education. We have to make sure that the legislators that are

listening to the outcome of that vote are inclined to support higher education

and education in general. The rest of us should try to get involved in

the front end.</font>

<p><font size=+0>That is why there are four candidate forums scheduled

before the election. In district 17 there are four candidates running.

Whoever wins will be in the legislature in January. Many of these candidates

have come out and said that they support increased funding for education.

There are also candidates who have said that an average university system

will meet the state?s need for higher education. One candidate in that

race has said that they don?t understand all the fuss about the New Economy;

after all their constituents all have telephones. We can stand back and

watch this happen, or do we take a bigger role in seeing about who makes

the state?s decisions. We have taken the position that it is important

for us to be involved. No matter what your view is, be sure to vote. This

election will have a large bearing on the fight that is now going on, over

whom will be the Speaker of the House. The Speaker will have a huge influence

on how far the state will go in the New Economy. Who gets the Speaker of

the House position will determine who is going to Chair the house committees.

I know we have talked in the past about the legislative forums in legislative

districts. Vote with your feet this year. Let people see that you are interested.

Many activities that get people to participate are also important, but

just showing up passes a message about ASU. We need to have you participate

and let our legislators know that they must go home to their district and

be with the people that will hold them accountable for their voting record.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Many important people in the business sector have uprooted

and relocated in the last couple of years. If we do not become good at

politicking, others will, and then we will not be the priority at the legislature

that we should be. I can?t stress this enough about our "new tradition"

of calling, emailing, and influencing our legislative process as private

citizens to support education.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: I want to talk for a moment

about responsibility. Getting to meetings on times is a good start. Another

is to take the word back to your department; please communicate in your

department. I encourage you to summarize the topics from the Senate meetings

via an email to your department distribution list. If you are the senator-at-large

try to meet with the dean and be active in all business of the university

at the college level. Another type of responsibility as a Senate member

is to work on our Senate committees. If you are not yet a member of a standing

committee, please contact Brent Brown, chair of the Committee on Committees.</font>

<p><font size=+0>I want to introduce you to Stephanie Smith who is the

Alumni Association legislative liaison. She is involved with our ZSunDevil.com

site and coordinates our Alumni Legislative Candidate forums.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Stephanie Smith: The ASU administration has entered into

an agreement with the ZSunDevils.com, which is an Internet portal provider

that is similar to Yahoo.com but focused on the university community. It

is a very easy way to sign up for a non-ASU email account. I will attempt

to show you the process on the overhead. Logging on is a simple process

and takes thirty seconds. You can also forward the mail that you get in

this account to your ASU email account. You cannot send political emails

from your university account. You must do this from a non-ASU site.</font>

<p><font size=+0>A Senator: Will this involve establishing a new user id?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Stephanie Smith: Yes, you would get a new email account

id with ZsunDevils.com. You can forward the mail that you receive to your

ASU account. That will not be effected.</font>

<p><font size=+0>A little more of what I do in my work is that I send those

Sun Devil alert messages that you receive from time to time. I use private

funding outside of ASU, and it is sent through the ZsunDevils webmail.

Receiving forwarded notes on political/informational events, that is considered

legal and this is considered part of the educational process (and appropriate

use of state property).</font>

<p><b><font size=+0>5. Unfinished Business.</font></b>

<p><font size=+0><b>5.A Executive Committee</b> (Doug Johnson).</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>5.A.1 Revisions to the Academic Constitution (ACD 112-01).</b>

The revised document highlighted the recommended changes in the document

and on the Academic Senate web site. You can review the document at <b><u><font color="#0000FF">http://www.asu.edu/provost/asenate</font></u></b>.</font>

<p><font size=+0>The revisions include conformance language that is necessary

to comply with the Supreme Court Ruling that allows full representation

by legal counsel in grievance hearings, and gives the right of subpoena

to the hearing committee chairs.</font>

<p><font size=+0>One other change of importance is the inclusion of lecturers

as full members of the Academic Assembly. The Academic Assembly will be

asked to vote the changes by electronic ballot in the near future (after

the Academic Assembly breakfast on September 7).</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>5.A.2 The Revised Acceptable Use Policy</b> (TPAC policy

that was approved by the Senate last spring). I have invited Vice Provost

Bill Lewis to speak to the document.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Vice Provost Lewis: Last spring the TPAC document was

brought to you for a first reading. I want to give you some background

on this document. About one and one half years ago, President Coor, Paul

Ward and myself formed a committee to look at electronic information, security

systems, information retrieval, and use of the web via ASU computers. This

document was provided to you last semester and it is now posted on the

web for review. It has been passed on the East and West campuses. We will

consider it now by a vote of the ASU Academic Senate.</font>

<p><font size=+0>This policy does have implication for the use of email.

For example it tells us that we are not to engage in political activity

using email that ASU provides. It is against the state law. This will be

considered the first reading of the revised document. Are there questions

or comments?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Chaudhuri: By this policy do you mean any political

activity, because I am in a department that is doing much of this already.

Or do you mean only this election process?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Vice Provost Lewis: Within your discipline and your department

communication of political events is inevitable. However the use of email

to influence the political processes of the state legislature is not.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Burstein: On number 4, item 8, this keeps coming

up. Do we want to enforce something here?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Vice Provost Lewis: We are trying to put together some

guidelines for what are "official university documents" in this case to

be retained as the public record of the university. It is a situation that

we may be asked to retain every email that this university generates. Anybody

who wants to right now can set up an server on their desk top and I will

never know about it. We are trying to find some mechanisms that help to

protect us and to define what is official communication. Is it when a faculty

member is answering a question of a student? I think those are questions

still need answered. The Secretary of State is working to clarify this

very issue for state government. What is an official state record--and

now it has been talked about that the state will become a repository for

this information. That scares us to death.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Brown: I want to make sure that everyone understands

that we can back either party and become involved with political activities.

Just don?t use state property or write letters on university letterhead.

That is now translated to computers and faxes.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator McNeill: Are we not doing this already at this

meeting, using university resources, this building, this room, for a Senate

meeting to talk about political involvement?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Past President Burstein: This is a mode of education.

In other words, we haven?t told you whom to vote for.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Vice Provost Lewis: And I will add that is not an information

technology issue.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator: Rice: Can you use email to advocate passage of

a certain bill?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Vice Provost Lewis: I will leave that up to Allan Price

to inform you, but my feeling is the answer is probably no.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Allan Price: If what you are doing is writing to a legislator,

if you are just sharing your view on an issue, I think you are ok. But

if you get to the point of saying, vote no on John Jones as a senator,

then you are not ok. The electoral process is where you have to draw the

line. Putting into an email note that there is a forum where all the candidates

from District 6 will be, and they will be discussing their views on higher

education is ok, but if you say John Jones is going to be there and John

Jones is the ASU candidate then you are out of line. That is the distinction

that we wish to make.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Vice Provost Lewis: In going along with that, if one person

expresses one on one to another individual, rather than to a distribution

list of 101 people, the distribution list is a problem.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Allan Price: Brent touched on this. We say, I don?t understand

email influence because it has the word illegal attached to it now. If

this is the case, then I am just not going to do anything. The important

thing is that we have a policy and we have informed people about that policy,

people of good faith are going to try to follow that policy. I think that

is the important thing.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Brown: They are not going to take you out and

shoot you.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: Thank you Bill for the good

introduction. The technology is more and more a part of our lives and having

a current thoughtful policy on computer use is critical to the University.</font>
