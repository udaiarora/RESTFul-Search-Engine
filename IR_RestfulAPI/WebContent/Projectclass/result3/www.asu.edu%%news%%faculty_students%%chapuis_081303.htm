      <h2>Hobby looms large for researcher Chapuis</h2>
      <p>        By day he examines cells under a microscope. By night - and on weekends
        - his attention is focused on fibers.</p>
      <p>Charles Chapuis isn't a workaholic
            forensic pathologist, but a scientist who weaves.<br>
        Chapuis, an associate research professional in the Cancer Research
            Institute, studies cancer cell biology. He is devoted to discovering
            new anticancer
          drugs that may become, ultimately, treatments for cancer patients.</p>
      <p>He
          hadn't considered weaving until he met a young woman in his native
        Switzerland who had just started taking classes in the ancient art.</p>
      <p>"I
          knew what I wanted to do for a career - I wanted to be a biologist,"
          Chapuis said, "but I thought I needed a new hobby." </p>
      <p>Chapuis was drawn
          to weaving both by Chantal, the young woman, who now is his wife, and
          the beauty of the loom.</p>
      <p>"I love wood, and most looms
          are made of wood," he said. </p>
      <p>The Chapuises
          now own three looms, and in fact, purchased their current home to accommodate
          their biggest one. "It's huge, nearly a professional
          one," he said. "We also have a spinning wheel."</p>
      <p>And, they have shelves
          full of fibers - rich colors in silk, wool, cotton and linen.<br>
        "There are so many colors, fibers and patterns," Chapuis said.</p>
      <p>Chapuis
          and his wife, who have been weaving for 15 years, belong to a local
        weaving guild and continue to learn from the other weavers. And,
          they both teach at the Fiber Factory in Mesa. </p>
      <p>Chapuis finds teaching
          the most rewarding part of weaving, he said. </p>
      <p>"In
          my latest class, the students range in age from 7 to 85 years." He
        said. "Some people have wanted to weave for many years, and some take
          the class because they've just retired. The classes bring the generations
          together."</p>
      <p>Setting up the loom is the most time-consuming part of weaving,
          according to Chapuis, so he tries to plan two or three projects that
          can be made
          with the same warp.</p>
      <p>There's no family competition over who's going to
          sit down at the big loom and weave, since "one weaver should work on
          one project," Chapuis
          said. "The fabric is created by inserting a second thread in place
        using a shuttle. The thread is then set in place with a beater," he explained.</p>
      <p>"A
          good weaver will beat with an even pressure all along his project and
          get an even pattern. No two weavers will beat exactly the same, so
          they would have to measure constantly, or the transition from person
          to person would be visible."</p>
      <p>Chapuis has no plans to quit his "day job"
          to concentrate on the loom, and weaving is simply a shared interest
        for the couple. "It's not an
          inexpensive hobby," Chapuis said. "It would be quite hard to make a
        living at it."</p>
      <p>Most of their projects, such as a lace-like baby blanket trimmed
          with pink ribbon, are destined to be gifts for friends.</p>
      <p>"We just enjoy doing
          it," Chapuis said.</p>
