      <h2>ASU faculty members receive international Fulbright awards </h2>
      <p align="left">Faculty from the College of Public Programs and ASU West are recent recipients of Fulbright awards that allow for travels and studies in Lithuania, Morocco and Poland during the academic year. </p>
      <p align="left">Established in 1946 under legislation introduced by the late Senator J. William Fulbright, the Fulbright Scholar Program aims to build mutual understanding between the people of the United States and 140 other countries. A new program, the Fulbright Senior Specialists Program, was created to complement the traditional Fulbright Scholar Program and offers two- to six-week grants. </p>
      <p align="left">Dan H. Fellner, a faculty associate at ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, has received a grant through the new Fulbright Senior Specialists Program and will teach an intensive course in public relations this summer in Lithuania. </p>
      <p align="left">Fellner will be teaching a five-week course called "Public Relations Management and Planning: A Global Perspective" to master's degree students in the Department of Journalism at Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, Lithuania. In addition, he will conduct seminars for journalism and public relations professionals in Lithuania. </p>
      <p align="left">This is Fellner's second Fulbright grant. In 2001 - 02, he spent three semesters teaching journalism and public relations at universities in Riga, Latvia, as a participant in the Fulbright Scholar Program. </p>
      <p align="left">"After decades of Soviet control, the field of public relations in Lithuania is still in its early stages of development," says Fellner. "This is an exciting time to be involved in journalism education there." </p>
      <p align="left">Fellner has taught courses in journalism and public relations at ASU since 1998. He also owns a public relations consulting business that provides media training and writing support for major corporations. </p>
      <p align="left">Management Professor Gary Anders and Mathematics Professor Victor Pambuccian of ASU West received Fulbright appointments to spend a semester in Morocco and Poland, respectively. </p>
      <p align="left">"Living and working in Morocco will broaden my understanding of other cultures, especially Islamic cultures," says Anders, who previously has traveled to China, Japan and Mexico. "I look forward to sharing what I learn with my colleagues and students when I return." </p>
      <p align="left">Anders recently departed to spend the spring semester at Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, Morocco, where he is conducting research that focuses on World Bank-supported economic development projects in smaller communities. </p>
      <p align="left">He also will present lectures at workshops and conferences. </p>
      <p align="left">Pambuccian, associate professor of mathematics in the Integrative Studies Department within ASU West's College of Arts and Sciences, spent the fall semester at the University of Bialystok in Bialystok, Poland. He conducted research into hyperbolic geometries. </p>
      <p align="left">"Having two professors selected for the 2003 - 04 Fulbright Scholar Program is indicative of the excellence of ASU West's faculty," says Mark Searle, vice provost of academic affairs. </p>
      <p class="style1">The Fulbright Program is sponsored by the United States Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and managed by the Council for International Exchange of Scholars (CIES). For information, visit (www.cies.org). </p>
