Finding options to urban issues through design helps communities make well-informed decisions about the physical form of their cities and can create a thriving, successful urban core that adds exuberance and quality to city life. Staffed by design professionals, PURL projects synthesize real-world situations to offer informed alternatives to actual problems. PURL is a conduit through which applied research, public policy, and scholarly investigation flow to create practical applications and implemented projects. Located in downtown Phoenix and using metropolitan Phoenix as a laboratory, PURL research addresses the heat island effect on cities, transportation and urban planning, and shade structures and water use, among other topics. Not only does PURL serve as a catalyst for progressive urbanism in this city, it is also a model for others to emulate.

The center gives priority to scholarship and field-based work relating to educational equity and the systematic usage of heritage languages and cultures. The aim is to integrate these resources into the educational experience of all children and youth.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-2202954"></a>The center&#8217;s scope of work is driven by a need to merge several related topics into one articulated conversation: biliteracy; promoting the role of public education to strengthen communities; and enabling binational collaboration among educators. The long-term vision is to help develop a new pedagogy tailored to the needs of the bicultural region the center serves. The integration of these themes shapes the scope of work for the center in the following areas:</p><p class="List-Num-1-lead"><a name="pgfId-2202955"></a>&nbsp;1. Within the broad scope of educational policy research, the center focuses on scholarly inquiry that contributes to informed and enlightened discourse on language policy for schools and society, especially on the harmonious coexistence of English, the national language, and Spanish, the second most used language in our society.</p><p class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-2202956"></a>&nbsp;2. Life in the American Southwest is bicultural and increasingly binational. In this Pan-American context, bilingualism will gain in importance. Equally important will be the collective ability of residents on both sides of the border to work harmoniously in pursuit of a common destiny that will be ever more intertwined. Schools must help children and youth develop skills and predispositions to face this challenge.</p><p class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-2202957"></a>&nbsp;3. Mexico and the United States are becoming more interdependent. In this context, Mexican educators should have opportunities to contribute to improving education for Mexican immigrant children in U.S. schools. To enable this, schools must create pilot projects and an infrastructure for collaboration among institutions and individuals on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.</p><p class="Body-6-above"><a name="pgfId-2202958"></a>For more information, visit the center in ED 440, call 480/965-7134, or access the center&#8217;s Web site at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/educ/sceed" class="URL">www.asu.edu/educ/sceed</a>.</p><p class="FM-B-Heading"><a name="pgfId-2202964"></a><a name="marker-2202960"></a><a name="marker-2202961"></a><a name="10614"></a>IRA A.

Since 1995, it has been funded by the Office of the Vice President for Research and Economic Affairs and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The center consists of about 90 students, postdoctoral associates, and research scientists led by 15 faculty members in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the School of Life Sciences. These research groups share a common goal: understanding the process of photosynthesis, which is responsible for producing all of our food and filling the vast majority of our energy and fiber needs. The impetus for development of the center was the premise that photosynthesis is a complex problem that will only yield to an investigation using a wide variety of approaches and techniques. Thus, the center serves as an infrastructure supporting individual ASU scientists and fostering multidisciplinary cooperative research projects.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-2203191"></a>The ultimate objective of the research is the elucidation of the basic principles governing the biochemical and biophysical processes of photosynthetic energy storage. This goal is being realized via investigation of the early events of photosynthesis, including light absorption and excitation transfer in photosynthetic antennas; the mechanism of primary photochemistry in plant and bacterial systems; secondary electron transfer processes; structure and assembly of photosynthetic antennas, reaction centers, and electron transfer proteins; pigment-protein interactions; artificial and biomimetic photosynthetic solar energy conversion systems; and mechanisms of biological electron transfer reactions.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-2203192"></a>The center is equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation that allows students to do frontier research in a broad range of disciplines.
