<P>SAS/GRAPH  software provides
several methods for generating graphics output that can be displayed on the
World Wide Web. Most of these methods enable you to create graphs in which
the user clicks on areas of the graph to "drill  down" to additional graphs
or reports. 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>The ODS HTML statement enables several SAS/GRAPH
procedures to produce GIF graphics and a variety of HTML files for creating
Web pages with tables of contents, multiple frames, and drill-down functionality.<P>

<LI>New device drivers automatically  generate various combinations
of HTML and GIF files. <P>

<LI>The GANNO, GCHART, GMAP, GPLOT, and GSLIDE procedures have new
options that provide drill-down functionality with Web output. If a graph
is created with drill-down, the drill-down capability is retained any time
the graph is replayed using the GREPLAY procedure. (See the individual procedures
for details.) In addition, these procedures can generate a special data set
that contains area and link information for creating custom HTML files with
drill-down graphs.<P>
</UL>

<BR><H3>Device Drivers</H3>


<P>New device drivers automatically generate one or more HTML and GIF files
that can be viewed with a Web browser. These drivers provide a quick and easy
way to produce output for use on the Web:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>The GIF driver generates GIF graphics files from SAS/GRAPH
procedures. These files can be referenced in an HTML file and viewed with
a Web browser.<P>

<LI>The HTML driver creates a series of graphs in GIF format and an
HTML file that displays them.<P>

<LI>The WEBFRAME driver also creates graphs in GIF format and HTML
files, but it produces a Web page whose table of contents contains thumbnail
depictions of each graph, plus links to the full-sized versions of the graphs.<P>

<LI>The GIFANIM driver enables you to use SAS/GRAPH
procedures to create GIF animations for your Web pages.<P>
</UL>
 
<P>
<IMG border="0" align="bottom" src="./images/01329051.gif" alt="[IMAGE]">New
in Version 8, you can also use the ACTIVEX and JAVA device drivers. Both drivers
can only be used with procedures GCHART, GCONTOUR, GMAP, GPLOT,
and G3D, and both must be used with the Output Delivery System (ODS). The
ACTIVEX driver generates an HTML file that defines graphics output as ActiveX
controls, and the JAVA driver generates an HTML file that defines graphics
output as a Java applet. Both the ActiveX controls and the Java applets are
interactive when displayed in a browser. For example, they let you change
the chart type from a bar chart to a pie chart.
<BR><H3>Output Delivery System</H3>


<P>SAS/GRAPH  procedures that generate
graphics output support the Output Delivery System (ODS).  You can use the
ODS HTML statement or special  SAS/GRAPH
device drivers to  produce ODS output.  When used with  SAS/GRAPH
procedures, either method uses a default ODS template to produce HTML files
and graphics output that can be viewed with a Web browser.
<BR><H3>Long Variable Names</H3>


<P>SAS/GRAPH  supports long variable
names in data sets. Catalog entry names are still limited to 8 characters.
If longer names are specified, they are truncated.
<BR><H3>SAS/GRAPH  Fonts</H3>


<P>SAS/GRAPH  has added support
for specifying long font names that appear in the Charrec window of the GDEVICE
procedure.
<BR><H3>SAS/GRAPH  Colors</H3>


<P>SAS/GRAPH  has added support
for CMYK and HSB (or HSV) color types.
<BR><H3>Features That Are No Longer Supported</H3>


<P>A few SAS/GRAPH  windows are
no longer supplied: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>PATTERN, AXIS, LEGEND, and SYMBOL windows<P>

<LI>GRAPH manager window<P>
</UL>

<P>A new file requestor
window is provided for the Graphics Editor and
the Graph window.
