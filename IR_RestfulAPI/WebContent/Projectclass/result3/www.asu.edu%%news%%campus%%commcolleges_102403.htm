      <h2>ASU, Maricopa Community Colleges form new partnership to benefit students </h2>
      <p>        ASU and the Maricopa Community Colleges are forming an unprecedented
          partnership to enhance and increase the number of associate and baccalaureate
        degrees awarded in metropolitan Phoenix. </p>
      <p>The new "ASU-Maricopa Alliance"
            will move the institutions far beyond the traditional "2 + 2" transfer
            model by offering new options to eligible
          students for where and how they learn. By working collaboratively,
        the institutions will provide these co-enrolled students with programs
        and
          flexibility that take advantage of the benefits of each institution. </p>
      <p>The direction for the expanded partnership evolved out of discussions
          between Maricopa Community Colleges Chancellor Rufus Glasper and ASU
          President Michael Crow. </p>
      <p>"We are bringing the forces of both institutions
          together to enhance higher education opportunities for all Arizonans,
          particularly the residents
          of Maricopa County," says Crow. "We live in a unique setting, where
        we have the nation's most innovative community college district and a
        growing
          dynamic university. Working together will dramatically increase productivity." </p>
      <p>"Despite the good work that ASU and the Maricopa Community Colleges
        do, there are still a number of students whose academic needs are not
        met
          due to program availability, access and affordability," explains Glasper.
          "Together, we want to increase educational options and make it financially
        feasible for students to earn degrees." </p>
      <p>Although the partnership is still
          in the development phase, the initiative could include a variety of
        academic programs available at education sites
        that are operated by either institution, or both. </p>
      <p>"Embedding an accessible
          baccalaureate education in every community throughout the Valley will
          enhance the quality of the work force that Arizona businesses
        demand," says Crow. </p>
      <p>As teams of educators are brought together, discussions
          will explore how students can earn associate degrees as they strive
        for a baccalaureate
        degree. </p>
      <p>"We already know that 54 percent of all students who earn a baccalaureate
          degree from ASU have attended one of the Maricopa Community Colleges,"
          says Glasper. "The ASU-Maricopa Alliance will provide new opportunities
          for advanced learning while students move smoothly through a program
        administered by both institutions." </p>
      <p>Both Crow and Glasper agree there
          is a lot of work and consensus building to be done before the initiative
          is officially launched. An "ASU-Maricopa
          Alliance Steering Committee," co-chaired by Christine Wilkinson, senior
          vice president at ASU, and Anna Solley, vice chancellor of academic
        affairs at the Maricopa Community Colleges, is working to identify pilot
        programs
          to advance the program from concept to implementation. The steering
        committee also is working to develop a timeline and establish working
        teams to
        get the pilot running by fall 2004. </p>
      <p>The two institutions also will prepare
          joint principles to address common concerns and goals, focusing on
        encouraging student retention and success,
          offering learner-centered degrees and programs, meeting the needs of
          a diverse student population, making higher education accessible and
          affordable and expanding opportunities for students that will support
        the new economy and work force needs. </p>
