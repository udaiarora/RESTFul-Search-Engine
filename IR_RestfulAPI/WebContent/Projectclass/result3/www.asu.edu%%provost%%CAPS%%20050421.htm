<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:windowtext">Topic:</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:windowtext">

Approximately 40 people<o:p>

</span></p>
<p><font size="3">The forum included informal presentations by Barbara Kerr,
outgoing president of the Academic Senate, and Susan Mattson, the incoming
president. George Watson, a former Senate president, joined them later in the
meeting.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Susan Mattson began by describing the Senate?s current
agenda, which includes new provisions for the representation of nontenure-track
faculty as well as academic professionals; the implementation of the anticipated
multiple-year contracts; and the implementation of the state-required background
checks for new hires. She noted that academic professionals are full voting
members of the Senate and are eligible for Senate office. She suggested that the
chair of CAPS could sit on the executive committee of the Senate and that if
this proposal requires a change in the bylaws she would introduce such a change.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Barbara Kerr reported on the work of the healthcare task
force. The task force has proposed creating a walk-in clinic on campus for
faculty, academic professionals, and staff, including a dispensary for low-cost
prescription drugs. President Crow has appointed an implementation task force to
proceed with this proposal. It will include both research and education
components. She also reported that proposals are being prepared for the
legislature that would allow a one-time opportunity to change retirement plans,
the delay of a decision on retirement plans, and the creation of a voluntary
employee benefit association that would allow retirees to receive accumulated
sick leave to buy health insurance or pay for medical care with pretax dollars,
rather than a cash payment.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3">A lively discussion ensued about the conversion of lines that
had provided the opportunity for continuing appointment to one-year and
multiple-year contracts. The need for better explanations and continuing
discussion of the university?s operation on a business model was also raised.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3">In concluding, Barbara Kerr noted that the university
administration and the Academic Senate have a long and fruitful record of
cooperation but reminded us that the university is not a democracy.</font><span style="font-family:Arial"></o:p>
