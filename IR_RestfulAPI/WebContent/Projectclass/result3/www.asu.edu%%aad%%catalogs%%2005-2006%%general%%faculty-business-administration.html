<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The Real Estate faculty offer a unique, integrated, one-year program designed for the student&#8217;s last year of college.

With broad interdisciplinary perspective, emphasis on team work, and involvement in projects, students may pursue careers in land development, investment analysis, appraisal, property management, brokerage, and mortgage finance.</p>
<p>
Successful completion of the program satisfies the requirements of the major based on the following courses:</p></div>

<p>
In addition to the courses listed for the major, students in the program also satisfy the requirement for BUS 301 Fundamentals of Management Communication (listed in the business core) and BUS 451 Business Research Methods (listed as a major support course). These courses are integrated into the major, not taken separately.
