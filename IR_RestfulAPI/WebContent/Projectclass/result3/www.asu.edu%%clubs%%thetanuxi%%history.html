    <p align="center"><font color="#ae9dff" face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="5">In the spring of 1996, Founding 
    Monarch Melissa Jo Murchison-Blake was in search of sisterhood. She wanted 
    to be part of a family that openly embraced all women and crossed cultural 
    boundaries. As a bi-racial woman, she did not want to choose between 
    historically Caucasian or African-American sororities. Founding Monarch 
    Murchison-Blake felt that if she did choose one, she would be denying half 
    of her heritage. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#ae9dff" face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="5">Still wanting to be part of a 
    strong sisterhood, Founding Monarch Murchison-Blake recruited six other 
    women to join hands in her quest to found Theta Nu Xi Multicultural 
    Sorority. At first, the Founding Monarchs were discouraged from fulfilling 
    their vision. The Director of Greek Affairs advised them to consider joining 
    an existing organization, expressing his concern that a new Greek 
    organization, based on the principal of multiculturalism, would not survive 
    at UNC-CH. However, the Founding Monarchs believed there was a need for such 
    a sisterhood. Their efforts set the stage for Theta Nu Xi's presence in the 
    Greek, non-Greek, and surrounding communities. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#ae9dff" face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="5">After much work and dedication, 
    the Founding Monarchs built the foundation for Theta Nu Xi. Finally, the 
    University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill officially recognized Theta Nu 
    Xi Multicultural Sorority as the Alpha Chapter on April 11, 1997. With the 
    collaborative efforts of the Founding Monarchs and the Sisters of Spring 
    1998, the organization grew beyond our expectations. The Sorority 
    incorporated on April 29, 1999, and with the participation of the Alpha 
    Chapter and Beta and Gamma Colonies, the National Organization was founded 
    at the first annual National Convention on August 21, 1999. </font></p>

    <p align="center"><font color="#ae9dff" face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="5">When Founding Sister Rekha 
    Muddaraj came to Arizona State University in the Fall of 2001, she looked to 
    join an extra-curricular organization that promoted leadership, community 
    service, and her own personal interests. However, being at a school whose 
    population rivaled a small country, she found that the organizations lacked 
    the close-knit environment she was hoping to find. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#ae9dff" face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="5">Interested in Greek life, Rekha 
    found that ASU housed over 25 sororities, but none of them offered the 
    diversity she longed for in a sisterhood. After hearing about Theta Nu Xi 
    Multicultural Sorority, Inc. from some friends at the University of Arizona, 
    she requested an interest packet from Nationals. At that time, Founding 
    Sister Sharon Candappa had also been looking to join a group that promoted 
    unity through multiculturalism, and along with Rekha and four other girls, 
    began the arduous journey of establishing TNX at ASU. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#ae9dff" face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="5">The group did not go without its 
    share of resistance, struggle, and disappointment. The Greek Life director 
    did not believe that such a small sorority would survive on a large campus. 
    In addition to that, four out of the six women in the initial interest group 
    decided they could no longer be a part of the process. Since a minimum 
    number of five members were required to establish a student organization, 
    Rekha and Sharon had to put their dreams on hold. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#ae9dff" face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="5">In the Spring of 2003, Founding 
    Sister Onika Patel felt that TNX was a sisterhood that catered to her 
    passions, goals, and beliefs so she soon joined Rekha and Sharon in their 
    efforts. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#ae9dff" face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="5">Later that semester, in attempts 
    to recruit more women who shared the same vision, sisters from the Epsilon 
    and Mu chapters hosted an informal interest meeting. The response was 
    ONEderful. Founding Sister Poonam Patel saw that TNX embodied and nurtured 
    the ideals of a strong and capable woman and Founding Sister Lori Dennehy 
    was ecstatic to find a sisterhood that worked so closely with National 
    Conference for Community and Justice. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#ae9dff" face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="5">The five women composed the 
    ?Holla Back as ONE? line and the Tau Colony was founded on November 8, 2003. 
    It attained chapter status in February 2004. </font></p>
