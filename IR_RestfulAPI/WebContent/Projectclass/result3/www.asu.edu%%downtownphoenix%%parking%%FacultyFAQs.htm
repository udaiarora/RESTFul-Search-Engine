      <p class="Header" style="margin-bottom: 0">For Faculty and Staff: </p>
      <p class="Header" style="margin-top: 0;">Frequently Asked Questions About Parking <br />
      </p>
      <p>If you have a&nbsp;parking decal and access card for the University Center Garage, please note: you may not park&nbsp;in any of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>ASU Reserved</strong> or <strong>Tenant Reserved</strong> stalls, located on&nbsp;the first and second floors and garage roof. Violators will be ticketed.</p>
      <p>If you need to acquire a decal,  please&nbsp;refer to the information below:</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Subheader" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How can I purchase a faculty or staff decal?</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">If you intend to buy a Downtown Phoenix campus parking permit, send an e-mail to Cherie Hudson at <a href="mailto:Cherie.Hudson@asu.edu">Cherie.Hudson@asu.edu</a>. Include your ASU ID number and identify the kind of decal you would like to purchase: moveable style (hanging from rearview mirror) or permanent style (affixed to the windshield). Include the license plate, make, model and color for each vehicle that will be assigned to the decal. Your decal will then be delivered to your Downtown Phoenix campus office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="Subheader" style="margin-bottom: 0;">What if I am teaching - and will teach classes on both campuses?&nbsp; </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">First, you will need to buy a Downtown Phoenix campus decal.&nbsp; Second, you will need to contact&nbsp;either Nancy Gwilliam, College of Public Programs;&nbsp;Fred Corey, University College; or Jacalyn Askin, College of Nursing &amp; Healthcare Innovation,&nbsp;for instructions about obtaining a parking decal for the ASU Fulton Center garage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Subheader" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Can I buy both a Tempe parking decal and a Downtown Phoenix parking decal?</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">Yes. You can purchase a parking decal for both campuses, just not  online. Online Parking Services allows customers to buy - online - only one decal per year. To buy multiple decals, you must do so in person at the PTS Tempe Decal Sales office (525 S Forest Ave., Tempe).&nbsp; All decals are sold based on availability.</p>
      <p class="Subheader">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Subheader" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Do I need to buy two decals?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">You can buy more than one decal - but you only need one! </p>
<p>If you elect to keep your Tempe decal for 2006-2007, you may park in the Reciprocal Parking Lot at the Downtown Phoenix campus, where Tempe campus decals are valid. The Reciprocal Parking Lot for the Downtown Phoenix campus is located at 320 N. 4th Ave.<br />
              <br />
              If you elect to buy only a Downtown Phoenix campus parking decal, you may park on the Tempe campus in Lot 59 East - the Reciprocal Parking Lot on the east side of Rural Road between Rio Salado and University Drive. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Subheader" style="margin-bottom: 0;">What if I already own a Tempe campus decal and want to exchange it for a Downtown Phoenix decal?</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">You may exchange a Tempe decal purchased for the 2006-2007 academic year for a Downtown Phoenix campus decal. All exchanges must be completed in person at the Downtown Phoenix Campus Cashiering Office. Please bring the ASU Tempe decal and gate access card (if applicable) you wish to exchange.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Subheader" style="margin-bottom: 0;">What do I need to do with my &ldquo;old&rdquo; gate access card?</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">You must return the gate access card you were issued to Parking in order to avoid a $25 charge. You can either mail the gate access card or drop it off: Downtown Phoenix Campus Cashiering Office, Room 112, University Center Building, 411 N. Central Ave., Phoenix, AZ., 85004. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Subheader" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Where is reciprocal parking located at the Downtown Phoenix campus?</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Subheader" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Is disabled parking at the Downtown Phoenix campus all-access, as on the Tempe campus?</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">Downtown Phoenix campus disabled decals &nbsp;provide access&nbsp;to disabled parking stalls in&nbsp;only
        the following ASU-controlled downtown parking locations:</p>

      <p class="Subheader" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Will Tempe campus parking validation stamps be valid at the Downtown Phoenix campus?</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">Yes, visitor validation stamps  cost
        the same as those on the Tempe campus - $2 per hour, $8 day. </p>
      <p>You can buy validation stamps at the Downtown Phoenix Campus Cashiering Office.&nbsp; ASU&nbsp;Colleges and Departments can order quantities with a PO number, and stamps&nbsp;will be&nbsp;delivered within 24 hours or on the next business day. </p>

            desired time.</p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Subheader" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Are electric vehicles permitted downtown? </p>
