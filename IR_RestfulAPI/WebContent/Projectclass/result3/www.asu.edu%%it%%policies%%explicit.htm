			<h2>Law Restricts Employee Use of University Equipment
			to View Sexually Explicit Materials</h2>
			
			
			<p><strong>Arizona Law.</strong><br />
			 
			Effective September 18, 2003, Arizona law will allow for the dismissal or discipline of 
			state employees who use state-owned equipment to view material or services that depict 
			nudity or sexual activity, unless the employee has the authorization of the agency head. 
			The statute governs all ASU employees, including student employees.</p>
			
		
			<p>Under <a href="http://www.azleg.state.az.us/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/38/00448.htm&Title=38&DocType=ARS">A.R.S. - 38-448</a>, 
			unless an ASU employee has authorization from the university President, the employee is 
			prohibited from knowingly using ASU owned or leased computer equipment to access, download, 
			print or store any files or services that depict nudity, sexual activity, sexual excitement, 
			or ultimate sex acts.</p>
			
		
			<p><strong>Limited Uses Approved.</strong><br />  
			In a document titled <a href="http://www.asu.edu/counsel/presapproval.pdf">"Approved Use of 
			University Computing and Communication Equipment</a>," President Crow has authorized 
			certain employees to access these materials in connection with their academic duties or 
			university administrative functions. Uses outside of this scope may result in sanctions.</p>
			
		
			<p>Under the current Presidential Approval, the following individuals may access otherwise 
			prohibited material, but <strong>only</strong> to the extent that the access is related 
			to their academic appointment or job duties at ASU:</p>
		
			<ol>
			<li>All employees with academic appointments, student research and teaching assistants, 
			and employees performing duties related to university academic functions, as authorized by 
			a department chair, dean or director or provost;</li>
			<li>All employees whose job duties include the provision of physical or mental health 
			services;</li>
			<li>All employees whose job duties include the monitoring, management, or servicing 
			of ASU computing or communication media, systems or devices;</li>
			<li>All employees whose job duties include the analysis of legal issues or the 
			investigation of allegations of misconduct; and</li>
			<li>All employees of campus museums, media services, libraries, and ASU Public Events.</li>
			</ol>
		
			
			<p>Procedures for responding to allegations of misconduct and applicable sanctions are those 
			set forth in existing ASU employment policies. <em>Approval granted pursuant to A.R.S. - 
			38-448 does not authorize any person to perform any act that is otherwise illegal under 
			federal or state law.</em></p>
			
		
			<p><strong>Additional Approval.</strong><br />  
			Employees who are not covered by this approval may seek approval from the head of their 
			academic or administrative unit for activities related to their job duties. Any approval 
			must be on a <a href="http://www.asu.edu/counsel/addapproval.pdf">form</a> approved by the 
			ASU Office of General Counsel (OGC), and a signed copy of the form should be filed with 
			the OGC.</p>
			
		
			<p><strong>Spam.</strong><br /> 
			The university recognizes that employees may receive an unsolicited e-mail (spam) that 
			depicts nudity, sexual activity or other content restricted by this statute. The university 
			does not intend to impose sanctions against employees who delete or ignore unsolicited 
			e-mail when they recognize that the content is not related to legitimate university 
			business or is otherwise regulated by this statute. Employees may wish to enable 
			<a href="http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/insideit/2003/08/article1.html"> spam filtering</a> 
			available through ASU Information Technology	</p>
