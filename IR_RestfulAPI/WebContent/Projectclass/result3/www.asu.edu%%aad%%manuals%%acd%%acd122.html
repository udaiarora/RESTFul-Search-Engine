<font size=+1><b>Prohibition of Controlled Substances</b></font>

<p>
It is the goal of ASU to provide a drug-free environment for all university <a href="acd002.html#student" target="New">students</a> and <a href="acd002.html#employees" target="New">employees</a>.  To achieve this goal and to comply with federal law, ASU prohibits the unlawful sale, manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and use of controlled substances on its property or as part of any of its activities.

<p>
Every ASU student and employee must abide by the terms of this statement, abide by applicable policies of the Arizona Board of Regents and Arizona State University, and abide by local, state, and federal laws regarding the unlawful possession or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol.

<p>
ASU students and employees are subject to all applicable drug and alcohol policies, including policies set forth in the university&#146;s <i>Academic Affairs Policies and Procedures Manual,</i> the <i>Department of Public Safety Policies and Procedures Manual,</i> the <i>Environmental Health & Safety Policies and Procedures Manual,</i>the <i>Staff Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual,</i> and the <i>University Student Initiatives Policies and Procedures Manual.</i>  The following drug and alcohol policies also apply to students and employees:  the Arizona Board of Regents&#146; <i>Code of Conduct</i> and <i>Rules for the Maintenance of Public Order;</i> Arizona State University&#146;s <i>Alcohol Consumption Policy and Regulations;</i> <i>Alcohol Advertising, Sponsorship and Promotions Policy and Regulations;</i> and <i>Arizona State University&#146;s Position on Substance Abuse.</i>

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Sanctions</b></font>

<p>
Sanctions under federal and state law for the unlawful possession or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol are set forth in each semester&#146;s <i>Schedule of Classes.</i>

<p>
Sanctions will be imposed on a student who violates a Board of Regents&#146; or university drug or alcohol policy; those sanctions may include suspension or expulsion and may also include the requirement that the student must participate in a drug rehabilitation program.  Sanctions will be imposed on an employee who violates university drug or alcohol policy; those sanctions may require that the employee must participate in a drug rehabilitation program.

<font size=+1><b>Health Risks</b></font>

<p>
<b>Alcohol</b>

<p>
Alcohol consumption causes a number of marked changes in behavior.  Even low doses significantly impair the judgment and coordination required to drive a car safely, increasing the likelihood that the driver will be involved in an accident.  Low to moderate doses of alcohol also increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, including spouse and child abuse.  Moderate to high doses of alcohol cause marked impairments in higher mental functions, severely altering a person&#146;s ability to learn and remember information.  Very high doses cause respiratory depression and death.  If combined with other depressants of the central nervous system, much lower doses of alcohol will produce the effect just described.

<p>
Repeated use of alcohol can lead to dependence.  Sudden cessation of alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and convulsions.  Alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening.  Long-term consumption of large quantities of alcohol, particularly when combined with poor nutrition, can also lead to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and the liver.

<p>
Mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome.  These infants have irreversible physical abnormalities and mental retardation.  In addition, research indicates that children of alcoholic parents are at greater risk than other youngsters of becoming alcoholics.

<p>
<b>Illicit Drugs</b>

<p>
A description of health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs is set forth in each semester&#146;s <i>Schedule of Classes.</i>
