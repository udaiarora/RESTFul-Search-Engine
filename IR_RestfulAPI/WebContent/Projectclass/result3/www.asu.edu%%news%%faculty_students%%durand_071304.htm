      <h2>Durand retires after 12 years as dean </h2>
      <p align="left">After nearly 12 years of service to ASU, Barbara Durand retired as dean of the College of Nursing in June. Under Durand's leadership, the college formed important innovative community partnerships with regional health care agencies, schools, churches and other organizations, and took important steps to address the national nursing shortage. </p>
      <p align="left">"The years I spent at ASU have been the highlight and pinnacle of my career in nursing and nursing education," Durand said. "To have found a college and a university that fit so well with my interests and abilities was truly a gift - but to have also found colleagues of such superior caliber has been the source of wonderful motivation and satisfaction." </p>
      <p align="left">Durand was recruited by ASU in 1992 when she was chairperson of the Department of Maternal-Child Nursing at Rush Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, Rush University, Chicago. </p>
      <p>"Never in my wildest dreams did I ever contemplate becoming a dean," Durand said. </p>
      <p>Then-president Lattie Coor thought differently, offered Durand the position, and she started her new role as dean Jan. 1, 1993. </p>
      <p>Durand received her B.S. degree in nursing from the College of St. Teresa in Winona, Minn.; her M.S. degree from the University of California, San Francisco; and her doctorate from the University of San Francisco. </p>
      <p>During her professional career, Durand filled a range of nursing roles including staff nurse, clinical nurse specialist, pediatric nurse practitioner, educator, consultant and administrator. </p>
      <p>In 1970, Durand co-founded the Pediatric Nurse Practitioner program at the University of California, San Francisco - the first such program in California. She stayed for 18 years and directed an award-winning program ranked best in the country. During this time, she played a significant role at national levels in advocating for and promoting the nurse practitioner movement and advanced practice in nursing. </p>
      <p>In 1979, she was awarded a Robert Wood Johnson nurse faculty fellowship in primary care. She also served for six years on the board of directors of the Ambulatory Pediatric Association, the only nurse ever elected to office in that medical organization. </p>
      <p>In 1986, Durand co-authored the editorial, "Specialization in Advanced Nursing Practice," which sparked the debate on the similarities and differences between clinical nurse specialist and nurse practitioner roles. She is co-author of "Handbook of Pediatric Primary Care," an American Journal of Nursing "Book of the Year" award winner. </p>
      <p>With Durand as dean, the 1998 <em>U.S. News and World Report </em> survey of America's best graduate schools ranked the ASU College of Nursing's master's program as one of the best schools for the first time in the college's history. Since then, the college has consistently been included in the rankings and is currently ranked 39th in the nation. </p>
      <p>"I am especially proud of our national ranking," said Durand. "It is a notable achievement and something our entire college is proud of." </p>
      <p>Durand established the college's first Dean's Council, consisting of Arizona professional, business and civic leaders who wish to assist the college in fulfilling its mission. Other achievements during Durand's tenure include the establishment of the college's first endowed faculty position, the Guy M. Hanner Nursing Professorship. </p>
      <p>One legacy Durand will leave behind is a number of key faculty who were strategically and successfully recruited from top ranked schools of nursing. These faculty are well-prepared and productive scholars who have increased extramural funding for the college. </p>
      <p>Durand was also influential in the founding of the Barbara Browne Connors Nursing Scholarship, made possible by a very generous gift from Thomas Connors in memory of his wife, a registered nurse. </p>
      <p>Perhaps Durand's most notable achievement is the recent approval of a doctor of nursing science (DNS) program that will begin fall 2005. The degree, which was approved by the Arizona Board of Regents in January, will be geared toward nurses interested in leadership roles in teaching, research and health policy. </p>
      <p>"With this program, we will contribute significantly to the university's research mission and to the nursing profession's need for leaders in all areas," Durand said. </p>
      <p>Durand was honored at a memorable and fun-filled retirement dinner May 7. </p>
