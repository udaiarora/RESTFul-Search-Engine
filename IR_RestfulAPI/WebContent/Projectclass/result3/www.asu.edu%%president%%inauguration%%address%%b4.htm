But in this era of rapid advances         in knowledge, in a knowledge-driven economy, the key to economic development         is economic diversification. Diversification is only possible with the         presence of an educated work force&#8212;with the presence of what one         cultural observer has termed a &#8220;creative class.&#8221; </p>      <p>In a recent study, Richard Florida, a Carnegie Mellon University professor         of regional economic development, describes the emergence of a new social         sector&#8212;more than 30 percent of the national work force&#8212;comprised         of artists, musicians, writers, designers, architects, engineers, scientists,         and others for whom creativity is an essential dimension of their livelihood.         In this usage, creativity is a driving force in the growth of the economy,         and almost without exception, I assume that education is a key determinant         to inclusion in the occupations that comprise this group. </p>      <p> I think of members of the creative class as knowledge workers&#8212;in         the arts and humanities, in the sciences and technology, in the professions,         in business, industry, and government. There is a demonstrable correlation         between the availability of knowledge workers in a local economy and its         success. Knowledge workers comprise the educated and flexible work force         that will allow a diversified economy in Arizona to flourish in the decades         ahead. </p>      <p>A striking example is the economic growth associated with science and         technology. Every year 60 to 75 percent of economic growth is driven by         technological advances, and since 1990, nearly all major technological         advances have been driven by fundamental academic scientific discovery.         Universities produce the knowledge workers that drive the economy. If         Arizona is to thrive, it must support institutions that promote the emergence         of a strong class of knowledge workers. </p>      <p>Arizona must be a place where upward mobility over successive generations&#8212;call         it the American dream&#8212;is still possible. Our K-12 school districts         and community colleges play a fundamental role in the task of producing         an educated work force, a work force that makes upward mobility possible.         Our research universities must collaborate with our school districts and         community colleges, and I see ASU as a driving force in this collaboration.       </p>      <p> Our responsibility to our students begins long before they arrive on         campus, and I want ASU to be an influence in their lives long after they         have graduated. As I hope to make clear today, I also want ASU to be an         influence in the lives of all those in our community&#8212;not only those         who are part of our academic community.</p>      </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="top"><a href="b3.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="b5.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="b5.htm"><img src="images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
