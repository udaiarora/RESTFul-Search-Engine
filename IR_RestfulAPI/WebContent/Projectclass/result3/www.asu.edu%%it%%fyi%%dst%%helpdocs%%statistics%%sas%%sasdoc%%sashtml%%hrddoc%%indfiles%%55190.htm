Progressing from the elementary to the advanced, the numerous examples     and exercises included in this book make it an ideal training guide for
new users. Informal and conversational in tone, this book starts with      the very simple and basic principles of information processing and goes
on to explore more advanced applications. The first part of the book       covers basics such as using DATA and PROC steps for data manipulation,
reporting, and basic analysis. The second half of the book, covering       more advanced features, serves as a "how-to" reference guide. An
introduction to SAS/FSP and SAS/GRAPH software is also provided. Numerous  topics covered in this comprehensive book include read-in, storage, and
maintenance of data; working with SAS Display Manager; SAS macro language; accessing SAS data sets; and using the SAS System on various platforms.
