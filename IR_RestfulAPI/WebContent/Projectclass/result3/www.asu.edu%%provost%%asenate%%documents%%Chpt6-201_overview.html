<h1>Proposed new professorial titles for nonacademics</b></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an effort to provide for professorial appointments of individuals with considerable 
  expertise, achievements, and reputation who nonetheless may lack academic experience, 
  President Crow has proposed the creation of faculty appointments for two new 
  designations: the professor of practice for distinguished professionals whose 
  principle mission would be instruction and the research professor with a multiple 
  year appointment of a distinguished scholar and researcher whose primary responsibility 
  would be engagement in a significant area of research or scholarship. The president's 
  proposal calls for appointments of up to three years on a non-tenured, non-tenure 
  track line. </p>
<p>The proposal further establishes the clinical professor on a multiple year 
  appointment that similarly is available for an individual who, while perhaps 
  lacking academic experience, has established himself or herself over a sustained 
  period of time to be qualified to teach or manage practicum, internship, or 
  practice components of degree programs. This would also be a non-tenured, non-tenure 
  track position.</p>
<p>Finally, the president also proposes eliminating the current 4% cap on the 
  number of lecturers and senior lecturers who may be employed, that being no 
  more than 4% of the number of tenured and tenure-eligible faculty.</p>
<h3>Issues</h3>
<p>While generally favorable to the proposal, the Senate Personnel Committee and 
  others have expressed some concern over the elimination of a cap, recognizing 
  that 4% is too limiting but that no cap is undesirable. The administration would 
  prefer to see no cap in Board policy while accepting one in the ACD policies 
  of the university. </p>
<p>The term of an appointment remains an issue. The originally proposal called 
  for five year appointment periods. The Senate Personnel Committee recommended 
  consistency between these appointment terms and those of other non-tenure track 
  full-time faculty, currently set at a three year maximum. However, this three 
  year period is itself being questioned in another resolution before the Senate 
  (SR#3). So the question remains open regarding the desirability of appointments 
  of up to five years or whether it might be preferable to have three-year rolling 
  appointments for senior lecturers as well as for these newly defined multiple 
  year professor lines.</p>
<p>Also at issue is the extent to which faculty and academic units will have a 
  say in the appointment of these special professorial positions. It remains the 
  case that Board policy specifies that &quot;Each university president shall 
  establish written procedures through which faculty, heads of academic units, 
  and deans shall have an opportunity for effective participation in deliberations 
  leading to recommendations for appointment of faculty members.&quot; The ASU 
  administration assures that such will be the case and that subsequent to the 
  adoption of the Board of the proposed policy, any necessary additions to ACD 
  policy will be made to ensure faculty input.</p>

  to Board policy.</p>
