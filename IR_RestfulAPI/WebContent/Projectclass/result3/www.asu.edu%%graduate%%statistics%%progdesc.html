<P>Statistical analysis is one of the primary tools of modern scientific reasoning.  Since the need to draw
 correct and defensible conclusions from data collected in the presence of uncertainly arises so widely,
 statistical techniques are useful in almost all disciplines.  There is a consequent demand for
 well-educated statisticians, and the demand is growing.</P>

<P>The Committee on Statistics offers a program leading to the Master of Science in Statistics.
   The program is interdisciplinary in the sense that it draws upon resources from several academic units.
   The program prepares students for careers in business, education, industry, and government.
   Graduates understand the theory that is fundamental to proper use of statistics, are knowledgeable
   about the tools of applied statistics, and are familiar with computer software packages available
   for doing statistical computations.  In addition, students interested in research in statistics
   can obtain the background needed to begin a doctoral program.
   (There are Ph.D. programs in Business Administration, Industrial Engineering, and 
Mathematics and Statistics with specialization in
             Statistics.)</P>

<P>One of the factors behind the demand for statisticians is the dual nature of statistics: it is both
 theoretical and applied.  Applied statisticians work closely with scientists and managers in the
 interpretation and control of stochastic phenomena.  Theorists study new procedures often suggested
 by such applications, using advanced mathematical and computational methods.   The interaction
 between theory and application is so important that many statisticians do both theoretical and
 applied work.</P>

<P>The requirements for the Master of Science in Statistics reflect this dual interactive 
nature.  The Committee on Statistics is composed of faculty from the Departments of 
Economics, Health Management and Policy, Information Systems, and Supply 
Chain 
Management in the W. P. Carey
College of Business, the Department of Industrial Engineering in the 
Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in the College of 
Liberal Arts and 
Sciences.  The program relies primarily on courses offered by these departments.  </P>

<P>Completion of the degree requires 30 semester hours of graduate credit (ten three-hour courses).
  The degree can be earned under an applied project option or under a thesis option.</P>

<P>Both programs include three required theory courses: theory of probability, mathematical statistics,
 and theory of statistical linear models.  These courses are fundamental to the education of any
 statistician and are necessary for more advanced graduate study.</P>
</FONT>
<P>The elective courses, chosen by the student with the approval of supervising faculty, allow the
 student to emphasize an area of special interest.  Possibilities include, but are not limited to,
 the following: theoretical statistics, applied statistics, statistical modeling, business statistics,
 industrial statistics, statistical computing, or sampling and survey research.</P>

<P>The remaining hours culminate in an applied project report or a master's thesis on a topic in the
 student's specialty area.  The student must defend the report or thesis in an oral examination.
 No foreign language or written comprehensive examinations are required.</P>

</FONT><B><P><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=NAVY><I>Admission Requirements</I></P>
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>The Division of Graduate Studies requires a grade point average of 3.0 or 
better (4.0 =A) in the last two years
 of work leading to the bachelor's degree.  All applicants whose native language is not English must
 submit a TOEFL score of at least 550.  Other requirements are specified in the Graduate Catalog.</P>

<P>Application forms are available from the Graduate Admissions Office, (480) 965-6113.  Application
 can also be made via the internet. A completed application form, official transcripts of all postsecondary 
 academic work, and the application fee must be received by that office.  Unofficial photocopies
 of transcripts and scores will be accepted initially to expedite processing of admission files.
  Applicants to this program must, in addition, submit a brief statement of goals and arrange to
 have three letters of academic recommendation submitted to the
 Director of the Committee on Statistics.</P>

<P>Most applicants have earned the bachelor's degree in a quantitative area such as statistics,
 business analysis, mathematics, engineering, or computer science, but this is not required for
 admission to the program.  However, applicants should have completed an introductory calculus
 sequence and one course each in advanced calculus, linear algebra, computer programming,
 and introductory applied statistics.  Applicants who lack any of these prerequisite
 courses should expect to complete the prerequisties before being considered for 
admission.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><P><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=NAVY><I>Financial Needs and Assistance</I></P>
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>Graduate scholarships, graduate 
assistantships
 (including teaching and research assistantships), loans, and work-study 
aid are available to well-qualified students
 admitted with regular status.  The amount of scholarship or assistantship aid ranges from a waiver of
 registration fees or out-of-state tuition to a stipend for the academic year, or a combination of
 this support.  Applications for scholarships, and assistantships should be 
submitted to the
 Statistics program.  Loans and college work-study support are available through Student Financial
 Assistance, (480) 965-3355, and require filing the Singlefile (or similar type) form.</P>

<P>Graduate assistantships, which normally include waivers of nonresident tuition, involve duties in
 the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and carry competitive salary.  Applicants for 
assistantships whose
 native language is not English must have a TOEFL score of 600 or better and must demonstrate their
 skill in speaking English, either by scoring 230 or better on the Test of Spoken English (TSE),
 which may be taken in the student's home country, or by passing the SPEAK test administered at ASU.</P>
