IP Address when Using PPP with Windows (3.1 and 95)

Question:<dd>
How do I find out which address has been assigned to my home 
Windows machine when I use PPP?
<p>
<dt> 
With Windows95:<dd>
you can go to Start and Run.  Open 'winipcfg'.  If this
doesn't work try 'c:\windows\winipcfg.exe'.  This should tell you what
your IP address is as well as other relevant information.  If you have
other questions or problems, please send an email message to comm-q@asu.edu.
<p><dt>
With Windows 3.1:<dd>
There are 2 ways to find your IP number when dialing in
with PPP. 
</dl><ol> 
<li>Watch your screen very carefully while you are connecting - it
will show up briefly - but long enough to read.
 
<li>Open the little Trumpet Winsock icon that shows up at the
bottom of your screen when you dial in.  This is a running script of the
communications that are going on - and in this script will be the
IP number that you were assigned. (It's usually near the bottom)
</ol> 
 <p>
Also, when setting the display variable with Korn shell, the syntax is:<ul>
export DISPLAY=ip_address:0</ul>
