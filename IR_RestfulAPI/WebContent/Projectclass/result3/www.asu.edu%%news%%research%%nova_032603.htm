      <p>PRESS RELEASE NO.: STScI-PR03-10 </p>
      <h2>ASU gets second Nature cover in March: new kind of nova discovered</h2>
      <p>Astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope are keenly watching
        a wave of light sweeping though space from a mysterious star that unexpectedly
        brightened, like a camera flash popping off. The changing shapes of swirls
        and arcs in the object show that this is not a permanent feature in the
        sky, but a rare and ghostly event in our effervescent galaxy.</p>
      <p>This unique outburst is revealing the netherworld of black interstellar
        space as light continues to reverberate off black dust clouds, like an
        echo off canyon walls. The observations of this so-called &quot;light
        echo&quot; promise to provide astronomers with a unique CAT-scan-like
        probe of the three dimensional structure of shells of dust surrounding
        an aging star. Light echoing off circumstellar dust in our Milky Way
        galaxy was last seen in 1936, long before Hubble's exquisite view could
        uncover remarkable new details.</p>
      <p>The results appear today in the British science journal Nature and images
        are featured on the magazine's cover. &quot;The light echo gives us a
        recording of the star's unusual eruption and allows us to follow a detective
        hunt to figure out how this star is evolving. Hubble's view is so sharp
        that we can also do 'astronomical tomography' of the space around the
        star,&quot; says the lead observer, astronomer Howard Bond of the Space
        Telescope Science Institute.</p>
      <p>Other authors on the report are the Space Telescope Science Institute's
        Zoltan G. Levay, Nino Panagia and William B. Sparks; the U.S. Naval Observatory's
        Arne Henden; Arizona State University's Sumner Starrfield; R. Mark Wagner
        from the University of Arizona's Large Binocular Telescope Observatory;
        R.L.M. Corradi from the Issac Newton Group of Telescopes in Canarias,
        Spain; and U. Munari from the INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Padova
        in Asiago, Italy.</p>
      <p>The petulant star that created the light echo, called V838 Monceros,
        flared up in early January 2002. Bond and his team have use the Hubble
        images to determine that V838 Mon is at least 20,000 light-years from
        Earth. In spite of this large distance, it was so bright at the peak
        of its explosion that it was visible through a small pair of binoculars.
        In fact, it was temporarily the brightest star in our Milky Way galaxy,
        shining with the brilliance of 600,000 Suns. This tidal wave of light
        put out enough energy to illuminate surrounding dust, like taking a camera
        flash to momentarily illuminates a long, cavernous tunnel.</p>
      <p>The light is bouncing off dust shells that were presumably ejected by
        the star in previous outbursts. Some of the light from the latest outburst
        travels to the dust and then is reflected to Earth. Because of this indirect
        path, the light arrives at Earth long after light coming toward Earth
        directly in a straight line from the star itself.</p>
      <p>The outburst of V838 Mon was somewhat similar to that of a nova. A typical
        nova a normal star dumps hydrogen onto a compact white dwarf companion
        star. The hydrogen piles up until it spontaneously explodes by nuclear
        fusion -- like a titanic hydrogen bomb. This exposes a searing stellar
        core, which has a temperature of hundreds of thousands of degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
      <p>By contrast, however, V838 Mon did not expel its outer layers. Instead,
        it grew enormously in size, with its surface temperature dropping to
        temperatures not much hotter than a light bulb. This behavior of ballooning
        to an enormous size, but not losing its outer layers, is very unusual
        and completely unlike an ordinary nova explosion.</p>
      <p>"We don't know of any other star that's ever done this kind of double-peaked
        outburst," said ASU astrophysicist Sumner Starrfield. "The first light
        peak was red and blue then a strong red peak followed... it just got
        very, very cool at the maximum energy emission."</p>
      <p>&quot;Previously, some stellar evolution theories would have proven
        this strange outburst impossible,&quot; says Bond. &quot;It may represent
        a rare and unobserved stage of stellar aging.&quot; The star is so unique
        it may represent a transitory stage in a star's evolution that is rarely
        seen. The star has some similarities to highly unstable aging stars called
        eruptive variables, which suddenly and unpredictably increase in brightness.</p>
      <p>"We can tell from the picture that this is probably a recurring event,&quot; said
        Starrfield. "The fact that there's material around the star means that
        it has probably been ejected in previous outbursts. </p>
      <p>"This is not a single phenomenon - whatever models we make have got
        to work for something that recurs. And it has to be energetic and it
        has to eject a lot of material cold and slowly. At the present time,
        we don't know how to make a model to explain this. It's a mystery star,
        and very exciting," he said.</p>
      <p>The circular light-echo feature has now expanded to twice the angular
        size of Jupiter on the sky. Astronomers expect it to continue expanding
        as reflected light from farther out in the dust envelope finally arrives
        at the Earth. Bond predicts that the echo will be observable for the
        rest of this decade.</p>
