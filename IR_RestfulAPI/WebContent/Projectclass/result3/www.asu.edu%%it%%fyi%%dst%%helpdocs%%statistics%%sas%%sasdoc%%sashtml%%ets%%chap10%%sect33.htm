<H2>OUTEVENT= Data Set</H2>
<P><A NAME="idxdat0209">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxdat0208">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxdat0210">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxdat0212">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxdat0211">&#13;</A>The OUTEVENT= data set is used to output event-oriented time
series data.  Events occurring at discrete points in time
are recorded along with the date they occurred.
Only CRSP stock files contain event-oriented time series
data. For all other types of files, the OUTEVENT= option is
ignored.
<P>The OUTEVENT= data set contains the following variables:
<P><UL>
<LI> the BY variables, which identify cross-sectional
dimensions when the input data file contains time series
replicated for different values of the BY variables.
Use the BY variables in a WHERE statement to process the OUTEVENT= data
set by cross sections.
The order in which BY variables are defined in the OUTEVENT= data set
corresponds to the order in which the data file is sorted.
<LI> DATE, a SAS date-, time- or datetime- valued variable that
reports the discrete time periods at which
events occurred.  The format of the DATE variable
depends on the INTERVAL= option, and should accurately report the date
based on the SAS YEARCUTOFF option.
The default value for YEARCUTOFF is 1920. The dates used may span up to
250 years.
<LI> EVENT, a character variable that contains the event group name.
The EVENT variable is another cross-sectional variable.
<LI> the event variables, included in the OUTEVENT= data set only
if they have data in at least one selected BY group,
are not discarded by a KEEPEVENT or DROPEVENT statement.
<P></UL>
<P>Note that each event group contains a nonoverlapping set of event
variables; therefore, the OUTEVENT= data set is very sparse. You
should exercise care when selecting event variables to be included
in the OUTEVENT= data set.
<P>Also note that even though the OUTEVENT= data set can not contain
any periodic time series variables, the OUT= data set can contain
event variables if they are explicitly specified in a KEEP statement.
In other words, you can specify event variables in a KEEP statement, but
you cannot specify periodic time series variables in a KEEPEVENT
statement.
<P>While variable selection for OUT= and OUTEVENT= data sets are
controlled by a different set of statements (KEEP versus KEEPEVENT
or DROP versus DROPEVENT), cross-section and
range selections are controlled by the same statements.
In other words, the WHERE and the RANGE statements are
effective for both output data sets.
