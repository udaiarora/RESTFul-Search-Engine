This work is a translation of Dioscorides, who was the most
 authoritative writer in
 botany for 16 centuries.  The first folio edition was published in
 1516.  Dioscorides, born in a small town near Tarsus, was a product
 of the classical world of Greece and Rome.  He flourished during
 the time of Nero.  Travelling widely, he studied plant life wherever
 he journeyed, eventually writing what became the most influential
 herbal ever written.  For over 1,500 years his work was considered
 the final authority on the pharmaceutical use of herbs and plants.
  The modern science of pharmacology can be traced to Dioscorides'
 efforts to systematize the knowledge of material medicine.  His
 work describes roughly 500 plants, but as no contemporary version
 survives, our study must be based on later printed editions.
  Early illustrations were decorative rather than realistic.
  It is important to remember that this herbal, as well as many
 others in this collection, pre-dates the current Linnean botanical
 classification scheme, which further complicates any comparison
 with modern plants.  Once this work was printed, pirated editions
 and translations appeared everywhere, usually undated, with sources
 not acknowledged.  Dioscorides' studies, which served as the basis
 for many of the herbals described in this catalog, have retained
 popularity throughout the centuries.  A reprint of his work was
 issued in Barcelona as recently as 1970.  When Dioscorides described
 the Nasturtium (nose-twister) he did not categorize it as an
 ornamental flower, but as a kind of cress, from the mustard family.
  The seeds were recommended as an aphrodisiac, and were also used
 in potions to drive out worms and to stop hair from falling out.
