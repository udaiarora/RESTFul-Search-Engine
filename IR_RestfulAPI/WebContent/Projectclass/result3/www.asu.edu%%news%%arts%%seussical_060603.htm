      <h2>'Seussical' takes Gammage stage</h2>
      <p>        The national tour of "Seussical the Musical" is making its way to ASU's
        Gammage Auditorium on June 3 and will run through June 8.</p>
      <p>Cathy Rigby
          stars as The Cat in the Hat in this family musical by Tony Award-winners
          Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty, the team that brought
          to the stage the critically acclaimed musicals "Ragtime" and "Once
        On This Island."</p>
      <p>"Seussical the Musical" explores the witty and whimsical
          world of Dr. Seuss as it's never been seen before. Audience members
        will have a chance
          to travel back to their childhoods to the land of the Who's and the
        Jungle of Nool and re-discover the zany characters created by one of
        the most
          beloved storytellers of all time. </p>
      <p>Kids and accompanying adults will be
          treated to a special show on June 3 as the 2003 Kids' Night On Broadway
          makes its way to Gammage. The program,
          a national effort of the League of American Theaters and Producers,
        is designed to introduce the magic of live theater to children ages 6
        -
          18. Kids can attend "Seussical the Musical" for only $15 with the purchase
          of an accompanying full-priced adult ticket.<br>
        Along with the discounted ticket offer, there will be activities based
          on "Seussical the Musical" for children to participate in, such as
          the Horton the Elephant inspired create-your-own-elephant trunk activity.
          All activities begin at 7 pm in the main lobby at ASU's Gammage Auditorium. </p>
      <p>Rigby received a Tony Award nomination as best actress in a musical
        for her role in the 35th anniversary production of "Peter Pan" in 1991.
        Rigby
          reprised the role of "Peter Pan" several years later, in a lavish production
          that received a best musical revival Tony Award nomination. She made
          her theatrical debut in 1981 as Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz." </p>
      <p>Subsequently,
          Rigby's multiple talents have been lauded in "Annie Get Your Gun,"
        "The Unsinkable Molly Brown," "Meet Me In St. Louis" and "They're
          Playing Our Song." Her dramatic television movie credits include "The
          Perfect Body," "Daddy Can't Read," "The Great Wallindas" and "Triathalon." </p>
      <p>A two-time Olympic gymnast, Rigby is the first American woman to win
          a medal in the World Gymnastics competition and holds 12 international
          medals, eight of them gold. She is the mother of four children and
        a recipient of the 1992 Mother of the Year Award. In 1994, Rigby and
        her
          husband Tom McCoy assumed the responsibilities as executive producers
          of the McCoy-Rigby Series at the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing
          Arts in California, allowing them to produce first-class theatrical
        productions and mount national tours from their own backyard.</p>
      <p>In "Seussical the Musical,"
          many of the best-loved characters from a bevy of Dr. Seuss books meet
          for the first time. When chaos erupts in
          the Jungle of Nool, it will take The Cat in the Hat, Horton the Elephant,
          Gertrude McFuzz, Mayzie LaBird and a gaggle of characters to bring
        harmony back to their world. </p>
      <p>Kenneth Gentry is executive producer of "Seussical
        the Musical," and the tour direction is by the Booking Group. For information,
        visit (www.seussical.com).<br>
