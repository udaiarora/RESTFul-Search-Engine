are used to determine whether an arc, constraint slack, surplus,
or nonarc variable should have a flow or value change.
The <A HREF="sect15.htm#netflowarcout">ARCOUT</A>= and <A HREF="sect15.htm#netflowconout">CONOUT</A>= data sets each have a variable called 
<SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">_RCOST_</SPAN>
that contains reduced cost values.
<A NAME="idxnet1396">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet1397">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet1398">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet1399">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet1400">&#13;</A>In the <A HREF="sect15.htm#netflowconout">CONOUT</A>= data set, this variable also has the reduced costs
of nonarc variables.
For an arc, the
reduced cost is the amount that would be added to the total cost
if that arc were made to convey one more unit of flow.
For a nonarc variable, the
reduced cost is the amount that would be added to the total
cost if the value currently assigned to that nonarc variable
were increased by one.
<P>During the optimization of a minimization problem, if an arc has a
positive reduced cost, PROC NETFLOW takes steps to decrease the flow
through it.
If an arc has a
negative reduced cost, PROC NETFLOW takes steps to increase the flow
through it.
At optimality,
the reduced costs of arcs with
flow at their respective lower bounds are nonnegative;
otherwise, the optimizer would have tried to increase the flow,
thereby decreasing the total cost.
The <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">_STATUS_</SPAN> of each such nonbasic arc is LOWERBD NONBASIC.
<A NAME="idxnet1401">&#13;</A>The reduced costs of arcs with  flow at capacity
are nonpositive.
The <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">_STATUS_</SPAN> of each such nonbasic arc is UPPERBD NONBASIC.
Even though it would  decrease total cost,
the optimizer cannot increase the flows through such arcs because
of the capacity bound.
Similar arguments apply for nonarc variables.
<P>The reduced cost is
also the amount that would be subtracted from the total cost
if that arc was made to convey one less unit of flow.
Similarly, a reduced cost is
the amount subtracted from the total cost
if the value currently assigned to that nonarc variable
is decreased by one.
<P>The dual variables and reduced costs can be used to detect whether
multiple optimal solutions exist.
A zero reduced cost of a nonbasic arc indicates the
existence of multiple optimal solutions.
A zero reduced cost indicates, by definition,
that the flow through such arcs
can be changed with zero change to the total cost.
(Basic arcs and basic nonarc variables
technically have zero reduced costs. A missing value is used
for these so that reduced costs of nonbasic
arcs and nonbasic nonarc variables that are zero are highlighted.)
<P>The range over which
costs can vary before the present solution becomes
nonoptimal can be determined through examination of
the reduced costs.
For any nonbasic
arc with assigned flow  equal to its lower bound,
the amount by which the cost must be decreased before it
becomes profitable for this arc to convey additional flow is the
value of its reduced cost.
The cost reduction necessary for a nonbasic
arc currently assigned capacity
flow to undergo a worthwhile flow decrease is the absolute value of
its reduced cost.
In both cases, this minimum cost reduction changes the
reduced cost to zero.
Any further reduction promotes a possible basis change.
<P>The reduced cost of an arc <SPAN CLASS="mathfont">(<I>t</I>,<I>h</I>)</SPAN> is
