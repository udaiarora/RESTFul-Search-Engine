<P>Crow, Gerald H. <I>William Morris, Designer</I>. The special winter
number of the Studio, C. G. Holme, ed. London: The Studio, 1934. Bound
in printed wrappers. The author states in his introduction that his thesis
is that &quot;in Morris the artist subserved the necessities of the man,
to assuage his horror of impermanence and constraint, to quiet his restlessness,
to solace loneliness and kinship with failure, to appease his sense of
social responsibility, to satisfy his longing for heroic exploit on the
one hand and tenderness on the other, and to embody the varous stages of
the conflict which shaped his faith into its ultimate form.&quot; While
the book is arranged in biographical order, it is not designed as a comprehensive
biography or a complete study of Morris's work. However, it does portray
the relationship of Morris's art to his personal development. This work
contains many illustrations not only of Morris's art, but also of his homes,
as well as related objects. There are also illustrations from Rossetti
and Burne-Jones. PRB-106 </P>
