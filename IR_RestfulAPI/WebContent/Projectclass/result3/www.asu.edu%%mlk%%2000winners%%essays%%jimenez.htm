        Extraordinary Woman</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Her name is Sophia, 
        and she is what I call an extraordinary woman. She is a very good friend. 
        She is a very good friend. She is always demonstrating random acts of 
        kindness. She started a program called &quot;Mothers Against Gangs,&quot; 
        and its building is located around 12th Street and Thomas. She first called 
        it &quot;Mothers Against Gangs&quot; because her son got killed by a gang. 
        She made it for kids and teens to go to and play fun activities instead 
        of being out on the streets causing trouble.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In this place called 
        &quot;Mothers Against Gangs&quot; or M.A.G., you can play pool, video 
        games, computer games, indoor, and outdoor games. It's a lot of fun to 
        go there. She also takes kids and teens everywhere for free. Like a Diamondback 
        game, the circus, video arcades and other really fun places. She takes 
        kids on &quot;strikes&quot; around streets to help stop violence and gangs. 
        Even though people might think community service is boring, it's actually 
        fun. Like when you paint over graffiti and clean up abandoned homes and 
        small territories. I know it's fun because I've done it before. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sophie has all of 
        the qualities an excellent person could have, and more. She is just great 
        once you meet her. She does a lot of good things for kids and teens and 
        it all comes out of her budget. I really look up to her because she is 
        a very good role model. I hope she can continue her dream of peace.</font></p>
