<h2><a name= "keywords">Use of Keywords</a></h2>

The Help Facility allows for keywords that may be used to 
point directly to topics of interest.  The command to skip 
directly to a help topic without navigating through the main 
menu, is:
<p>
<center>help &lt;topicname&gt;</center>
<p>
replacing &lt;topicname&gt; with the topic that interests you. 
For example, to skip directly to the section on General UNIX 
Commands, simply enter: help commands.  For the section 
on C language, simply enter: help c, for SAS enter: help sas, 
and so on.  The current list of available keywords includes: 
<pre>
afs                
bmdp           	
c, commands, communications     
database, dqs, editing            
editor, emacs, email, e-mail, eqs, essl
fortran, ftp		
gis
help
imsl
languages
mail               
osl                 
pascal, pico, pine, printing, pvwave

<h2><a name= "print">How to Print Text-version of Help Material</a></h2>

While viewing a document, first press the "p" key (lowercase) to
save the document to your AFS space and then from outside the help
facility use the "lpr" command to send the file to one of the ASU 
printers.  Under Printing, the help facility has more instructions 
on how to print files.  You may also "help printing" for more 
information.<br><br>
<hr><p>
<h2><a name= "must_read">Must-read Section</a></h2>

<li>The "help" command uses a UNIX version of a web browser 
called "Lynx" which like any other interactive UNIX application
behaves differently when used with a different combination of
telnet clients and UNIX operating systems.  For example, with a 
Windows telnet client called "EWAN", when Lynx is executed on 
"general.asu.edu", there appears to be some shifting of 
highlighted lines.  However with EWAN, and with Lynx on 
"stats.asu.edu" or on "research.asu.edu", there is no obvious 
"shifting".  Whereas, with a Kermit or a Hummingbird telnet client,
Lynx appears to work well on all the above mentioned servers.
<p>
<li>In the "help" menu, there are some selections which point 
to pages on the World Wide Web.  The selections include 
Electronic Mail and Electronic Forum.  It is possible that by 
going through several levels of selections from either of these 
pages, one may easily feel lost in the World Wide Web system.  
In this case, it is better to press "m" to go back to the main 
menu.  It is also possible that one of the selections may experience 
problems connecting to a server and in this case, it is better 
to press "z" to cancel the request.<br><br>     
<hr><p>
<h2><a name= "man_pages">Use of the UNIX man pages</a></h2>

The help facility contains a brief summary on using man
pages.  To see this information, enter "help unix" and then 
from the options displayed, select "General Unix Commands" and 
then "man".<p>
For more information on man pages, enter "man man".  To search 
for keywords in the man pages, use the "man -k" command which is
described in the output from "man man".  These commands must be 
entered at the system prompt.
