Are you ready to move to the next level of programming?  ... to develop    more complex programming problems or even complete software systems?  If
you're ready for that next step, you can develop your software building    skills with this informative book. It teaches you to apply classical
software principles of structured programming to the development of        complete SAS-based systems. You will experience all phases of the
software life cycle, which are described and demonstrated by SAS           techniques that apply to each stage of the process. You can confidently
develop complex systems with code that is easy to test, debug, and         maintain, even when user requirements change.  Written for a wide range
of users with programming skills from novice to advanced, this book is     packed with examples, exercises, illustrations, and references--tools
you can use to help you assemble software systems.
