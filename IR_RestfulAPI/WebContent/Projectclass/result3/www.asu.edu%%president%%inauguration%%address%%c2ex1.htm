Among these is an innovative outreach         program to deliver, package, and extend our community engagement initiatives         called ASU On the Move! Building on the success of our Patterns in Nature         van, the program calls for ASU vans, trucks, and buses to deliver mobile         education programs to school children and teachers in metropolitan Phoenix         and beyond. </p>      <p> For example, ASU will bring the excitement of our <a href="http://msip.asu.edu/">Mars         imaging program</a> to area schools. In an innovative program called Red         Planet Express, a 45-foot trailer will be equipped with a miniature Mars         landscape and a miniature Mars rover. Students will form Mars landing         mission control teams and plan and execute missions. Mobile computer terminals         and instructional materials wheeled into classrooms will facilitate instruction.       </p>      <p> The program targets middle school students who frequently lose interest         in science. Other programs, intended for children of all ages, include         computer training for the children of migrant workers, a fully-equipped         mobile newsroom that can bring print and broadcast journalism to life         for students, and the <a href="http://www.asugammage.com/">Gammage</a>         Theater on wheels, bringing costumes, stage props, and make-up stations         to facilitate schoolyard performances of plays. <br>      </p></td>    <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
