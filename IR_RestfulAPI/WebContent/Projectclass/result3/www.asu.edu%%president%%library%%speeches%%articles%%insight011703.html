                    Investing in People and Programs Necessary Even in Tough Times</P>
                  <P class="indenttxt"><em>The following column from ASU President 
                    Michael Crow appeared in the January 17, 2003 edition of ASU 
                    Insight. See also the <a href="invfactsheet.html">Strategic 
                    Investment Fact Sheet</a>.</em></P>
                  <P class="indenttxt"><strong>Message from the President: </strong><strong>Investing 
                    in people and programs necessary even in tough times</strong></P>
                  <P class="indenttxt">When I joined Arizona State University 
                    as president last summer, I knew it was a great university 
                    with immense potential to be even greater. Something I didn&#8217;t 
                    know, but that I learned very quickly, is that ASU is beloved.</P>
                  <P class="indenttxt">ASU has made remarkable progress during 
                    the past decade. Many talented individuals have contributed 
                    to that success. My predecessors have laid a great foundation 
                    from which we can launch a new era.</P>
                  <P class="indenttxt">At my inauguration November 8, I outlined 
                    a vision for ASU that, hopefully, will be embraced by the 
                    internal ASU community, as well as by our external supporters 
                    who recognize that a strong, high quality research institution 
                    is imperative to the Valley&#8217;s economic future. Also 
                    imperative is our strong commitment to ensure all of our students 
                    receive the high quality education they expect and deserve.</P>
                  <P class="indenttxt">The looming state fiscal crisis certainly 
                    puts added stress on our momentum, but we can&#8217;t stand 
                    still under any circumstance. We are obligated to take our 
                    fair share of cuts while trying to protect, to the extent 
                    possible, our core academic mission. We have made selective 
                    budget reductions targeted primarily at the margins of the 
                    University. At the same time &#8211; and perhaps this is difficult 
                    to comprehend during a time of tight budgetary constraints 
                    &#8211; we have continued to make strategic investments: investments 
                    in people and investments in programs. This is part of our 
                    effort to move from an agency model to an enterprise model 
                    &#8211; something we must do, given the fiscal stress and 
                    reduced contribution from our principle investor &#8211; the 
                    state of Arizona.</P>
                  <P class="indenttxt">Make no mistake, I am painfully aware that 
                    the impact of the cuts we&#8217;ve made has landed squarely 
                    on the shoulders of faculty, staff, and administrators, who 
                    are being asked to do more with less. We have committed to 
                    address, within these fiscal constraints, the salaries of 
                    our most critical faculty and administrators, and to provide 
                    some relief to our lowest paid staff. Still, this doesn&#8217;t 
                    solve the larger problem of underpaid productive faculty and 
                    staff that has plagued ASU for the past decade. More than 
                    $15 million of internal resources were reallocated during 
                    Fiscal Year 95 through Fiscal Year 2001 into faculty and staff 
                    pay raises to address market issues and general salary needs. 
                    This investment has not closed the market gap, but, until 
                    recently, kept us from falling further behind our peers.</P>
                  <P class="indenttxt"> It is during times like this that a university 
                    is most vulnerable to raids from other institutions targeting 
                    our best and brightest. We cannot let this happen. It is far 
                    more expensive to respond to external offers for our most 
                    competitive faculty and staff than to address issues preemptively. 
                    To that end, we will have addressed the salaries of more than 
                    100 faculty. We also are aggressively competing in national 
                    markets to recruit more top faculty to ASU. In some cases, 
                    we are using resources from the Capital Campaign, such as 
                    endowed chairs and professorships, to reward, retain, and 
                    recruit the most competitive faculty.</P>
                  <P class="indenttxt"> As part of a comprehensive reorganization 
                    of my administration in July, some positions were eliminated 
                    and some were newly created or greatly enhanced, while the 
                    total operating budget for executive compensation remained 
                    the same. As part of this effort, the salaries of some key 
                    administrators were adjusted following a national salary survey 
                    of comparable positions. The result is that the total cost 
                    for the executive leadership of the University remains constant 
                    over a two-year period. Some media accounts of this reorganization 
                    and the associated salary increases give the impression we 
                    are somehow moving large amounts of the University&#8217;s 
                    budget into executive salaries to the detriment of core academic 
                    teaching or research programs. This simply is not true.</P>
                  <P class="indenttxt"> We must find ways to move ASU into as 
                    competitive a position as possible. This will happen if we 
                    make strategic investments in selected programs, but only 
                    if we have the best leadership and the strongest faculty and 
                    staff possible.</P>
                  <P class="indenttxt"> With the help of Proposition 301 revenue 
                    and other funds, we are making key investments even while 
                    we make difficult budget reductions and reallocations. Some 
                    of the selective investments include:</P>
                  <ul  class="indenttxt">
                    <li> $30 million of Prop 301 funds invested during FY02 and 
                      FY03 into economic drivers such as biosciences, bioengineering, 
                      information science, materials science, manufacturing, technology 
                      transfer and workforce development.</li>
                    <li>More than $8 million from indirect costs and other state 
                      and local funds invested or to be invested during FY02 and 
                      FY03 in strategic initiatives such as, <br>
                      religion and conflict resolution, K-12 teacher preparation 
                      and improvement, creative writing, and a new school of life 
                      sciences.</li>
                    <li>Other states are investing in their research capacity 
                      to position themselves competitively to leverage research 
                      dollars into high value jobs. It is imperative that Arizona 
                      is positioned to do the same.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="indenttxt">As president of ASU, I accept that many of my decisions will 
                    be questioned and challenged and I will enjoy meeting the 
                    challenges. In addition, I am committed to joining with the 
                    faculty and staff in the pursuit of excellence for ASU and 
                    the state of Arizona. <BR>
