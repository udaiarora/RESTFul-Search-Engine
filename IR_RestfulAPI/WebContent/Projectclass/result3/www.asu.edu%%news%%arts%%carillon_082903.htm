      <h2>Beautiful music - Society refurbishing long-lost carillon, plans melodious
        return</h2>
      <p>        After spending 35 years or so gathering dust in the Matthews Center stacks,
        ASU's Symphonic Carillon is getting cleaned up and tuned up.</p>
      <p>It soon
            will be ready to make music, bringing back an almost-forgotten ASU
            tradition.<br>
        Maas-Rowe Carillons, manufacturer of the 148-bell Symphonic Carillon,
          moved the instrument out of ASU storage Aug. 6 and trucked it to Escondido,
          Calif., to begin modernizing and refurbishing it.</p>
      <p>Associated Students
          of ASU bought the carillon in 1966 for $25,000, using surplus activities
          funds that had accumulated over a period of years.</p>
      <p>There
          was a grand dedication and concert, at which University President Homer
          Durham spoke, as well as Robert McConnell, that year's student
          body president.</p>
      <p>The carillon, housed in Matthews Center near the Art Museum,
          was used for several years, but after a time, no one really cared about
          it, said
          Rudy Turk, former director of the museum (who was accused of playing
          the carillon late at night and spied upon to see if he was doing so).</p>
      <p>When
          Matthews Center was remodeled, the carillon was placed in storage,
        where it languished, covered with cloths, sitting amidst mop buckets
          and vacuums.<br>
        When the instrument was rediscovered last December, a small group of
          carillon lovers banded together to bring the carillon back.</p>
      <p>Today, the
          Symphonic Carillon, with a walnut keyboard that is in pristine condition,
          is worth more than $100,000, and is one of just 100 such instruments
          manufactured by Maas-Rowe. It's also the only one of the 100 that is
          not in use.</p>
      <p>ASU Main currently has music playing daily, thanks to a small
          carillon loaned to ASU by Maas-Rowe. It plays music recorded on the
        company's Grand Symphonic Carillon (including the ASU Alma Mater and
        fight song,
          which are played every day at 5 p.m.) The carillon also plays music
        at noon and 6 p.m., and the Westminster Chimes on the quarter-hour.</p>
      <p>Doctoral
          organ performance student Homer Ferguson says he and other students
        are anxious to play the instrument, and undergraduate music student Jacob
          Adler is poised to compose music for it.</p>
      <p>The ASU Carillon Society plans
        to host a series of concerts by professional carillonneurs, such as Lindsay
        Arthur Lafford, former carillonneur at
        the University of Miami and Hobart &amp; William Smith Colleges, who
        now lives in this area, and various ASU students.</p>
      <p>The ASU Carillon Society
          has begun raising the $50,000 needed for restoration, and hopes to
        place it in Old Main, says Tedde Scharf, director of Disability
          Resources for Students (DRS) and secretary of the ASU Carillon Society.</p>
      <p>The
          society is optimistic that the ASU community will step forward to help
          with the restoration. "No donation is too small," says carillon
          supporter Penny Caslake, DRS receptionist. "Donations so far have ranged
          from $5 to $500, with some people giving through payroll deduction.
        We want everyone to participate."</p>
      <p>Those wishing to contribute to the fund
          may send checks, payable to the ASU Foundation, and marked for the
        ASU carillon restoration, to ASU Public
          Relations, Mail Code 1002. </p>
      <p>Gifts may be made in memory of or in honor
          of individuals or organizations. For information, call (480) 965-0456.</p>
      <p>Smith, with Public Relations, can
          be reached at (480) 965-4821 or (jps@asu.edu).<br>
