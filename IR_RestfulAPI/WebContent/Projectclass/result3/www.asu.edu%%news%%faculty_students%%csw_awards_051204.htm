      <h2>Works raise awareness to improve status of women </a></h2>
      <p>The Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) held its fifth annual Outstanding Achievement and Contribution Awards April 26, recognizing men and women who have helped improve the status of women locally and globally. Arizona Board of Regent Lorraine Frank was the keynote speaker at the awards ceremony. </p>
      <p>In February, nominations were accepted and the six-person committee, made up of CSW members that represent a cross-section of faculty and staff, reviewed the 26 nominations. </p>
      <p>This year's award recipients are: Mary Anderson-Rowland, associate dean for student affairs in the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering; Peter Crouch, dean of the Fulton School of Engineering; Robin Haarr, criminal justice and criminology associate professor; Joanne Martens, president Gamma Rho Lambda Sorority; Retha Warnicke, history professor; and the ASU Charter Chapter of the American Business Women's Association. </p>
      <p>Anderson-Rowland was chosen for her efforts promoting various programs for high school, undergraduate and graduate female students, including the ASU chapter of the Society of Women Engineers at ASU; the Women in Science and Engineering Center; and the Graduate CareerChangeProgram. "Through dedication and hard work, Mary provides caring and inspiring leadership for women engineering students on campus," writes nominator Subhash Mahajan, chair of the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering. </p>
      <p>Crouch has worked hard toward improving the advancement of women during his tenure as the dean of the Fulton School. The number of female faculty has nearly doubled and the enrollment numbers of female students has increased dramatically. Sandra Houston, chair of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, noted that he is good at "listening and supporting women in the engineering profession." </p>
      <p>Through her work in criminal justice and human rights, Haarr has focused on helping women and children who have suffered violence locally and globally. Her nominators noted that she has worked to bring attention to the problem of wife abuse in China and the former Soviet Republic of Tajikistan. She recently coordinated a workshop to bring refugee youth to the West campus for the United Nation's 2003 World Refugee Day. </p>
      <p>Martens created Gamma Rho Lambda, the first lesbian-focused sorority to be officially recognized by a university's Greek Life organization. ASU became the first university in the nation to ever recognize such a group, according to nominator and student Sam Holdren. "Joanne not only broke through stereotypes and provided a unique opportunity for the women of ASU, but she also paved the way for change," he wrote. </p>
      <p>For 35 years, Warnicke has worked to make ASU a better place for women and minorities. Warnicke was the first female faculty member to be hired in the History Department and taught the first course offered in women's history. Through her efforts, the History Department began to add women and minority men to the department. "Retha's solid, ongoing, daily work on behalf of women has helped to transform ASU in an incredible way," said her nominators. </p>
      <p>And finally, ASU Charter Chapter of the American Business Women's Association provides networking opportunities for young women just entering the business arena. "The association provides hope and determination.and truly motivates members to work toward their goals," noted nominator and student Erica Dermer. </p>
