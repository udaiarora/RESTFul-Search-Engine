PAPERS.&nbsp; CALL NUMBER: Microfilm 6780&nbsp; NUMBER OF REELS/FICHE: 5 R&nbsp; INDEX OR GUIDE: Reel 1 contains a listing of the contents of each reel; detailed notes on the scope of the collection; and a biographical note.&nbsp; SCOPE AND CONTENTS: Papers from the Library of Congress collection donated by Susan B. Anthony and Harriot Stanton Blatch. Along with Susan B. Anthony, Stanton waged a campaign to gain political rights for women, teaching generations of women the importance of political power. Her career illustrates how the women&rsquo;s suffrage movement grew out of the abolitionist movement. She organized the first Woman&rsquo;s Rights Convention (1848) and was President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. She wrote History of Woman Suffrage (1881-1886). These papers deal primarily with the period 1840-1902 and contain correspondence, copies of articles, speeches, drafts of books, scrapbooks and other printed matter relating to Mrs. Stanton and the woman&rsquo;s rights movement. They reflect her role as social reformer and leading proponent of women&rsquo;s rights for more than fifty years, during which she spoke and wrote about the political, economic, religious and social wrongs perpetrated against women. She was married to an abolitionist and was active in the anti-slavery movement in the decades preceding the Civil War and worked for Negro rights during Reconstruction. She also advocated higher education for women. She sought the right to vote as basic to all other rights and worked for state laws and a constitutional amendment to that effect. The collection elucidates the goals, tactics and activities of many of the men and women associated with the movement and depicts the external opposition as well as the internal divisions. The papers also illustrate how she balanced family life with the demands placed on her as a leader. Some of her correspondents were: Susan B. Anthony; Daniel Cady; William Henry Channing; Lydia Maria Child; Frederick Douglass; William Lloyd Garrison; Julia Ward Howe; Lucretia Mott; Emmaline Pankhurst; Wendell Phillips; Elizabeth E. Pike; Gerrit Smith; henry B. Stanton; Lucy Stone; Edith Roosevelt; Thurlow Weed and John Greenleaf Whittier.&nbsp; SUBJECTS: Women &ndash; United States; Stanton, Elizabeth; 19c; Woman Suffrage; Abolitionists; Antislavery; Feminists </P>
