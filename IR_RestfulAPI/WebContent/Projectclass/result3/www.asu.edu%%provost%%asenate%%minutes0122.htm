<p><b><font size=+0>3.&nbsp; Announcements and Communications.</font></b>
<br><font size=+0><b>3.A Senate President?s Report </b>(Douglas Johnson).</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the beginning of the semester,
we have a variety of announcements?a lot of good news, a couple things
that I want to share with you, and a little bit of actual business that
we need to take care of. Mostly, this is an information meeting and we
hope you will add and contribute to that process as we go along.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will start with the good news. The
good news is that the Parking Newsletter that came out saying that our
parking fees are going to double is probably a bit premature. Mernoy Harrision
says that really was not what we intended. The parking rates will probably
be going up in the next few years, but certainly not doubling next year.
There will be a lot of hearings on campus to allow faculty input before
anything like that materializes.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bad news is the health insurance
RFP process.&nbsp; We have talked about that before. The Arizona Department
of Administration is in the process of seeking bids on two contracts to
become effective next October.&nbsp; I hate to tell you this, but it does
mean that we will have higher copays. I hope we get some flexibility to
go out of HMO service networks.&nbsp; I hope we get opportunity to get
better coverage while we are traveling away from home on sabbatical. It
is hard for us to accept the idea that we have not been paying enough for
health insurance, but that is a conclusion one could reach after looking
at the financial statements of those providers. Stay tuned, you will hear
a lot more on that in the next month or so.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have good news from the legislature.
Tom Trotter will speak to you about that later on.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would first like to remind you that
the Academic Assembly Breakfast is next Tuesday, January 30, at 7:30 a.m.
It is a full breakfast and a good place to start contacts and have discussion
with people that you do not get to see every day. I would encourage you
to come and hear the President and to be involved with the University community.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Power of Technology Workshops</i>
are starting up again. We are planning a series of events trying to address
the difficulties that faculty face when adding technology to their courses.
The web page for the Center for Learning and Teaching Excellence contains
the list of topics and times and dates. There is a way to register for
these events on the web page. They will cover intellectual property rights,
pedagogy, resource restraints, and a vision of the future session with
a number of influential people involved. We ask you to participate in these
events as you wish. One of the things that we encourage you as senators
to do is to pass along information to the faculty and academic professionals
in your unit after each meeting.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>3.B University President/Provost?s Report</b> (Tom
Trotter for Milton Glick).</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Glick asked me to share with you
some preliminary information about the biennial budget (referring to his
overhead as he spoke). As many of you already know, there are two budget
proposals; one comes from the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (JLBC)
of the State Legislature and one from the Governor?s office. The two are
in disagreement at almost every level. The numbers do differ. Frankly,
the Governor?s budget is more conservative and the JLBC less to our advantage.
We can feel reasonably confident that through a complicated political process,
the JLBC recommendations will come closer to what the final decision turns
out to be. So, these are the numbers we are sharing with you today. The
good news is that the JLBC recommendations are for 5% salary raise pools
for each of the two years, beginning on January 1. Why is this good news?
Remember that we had this sliding window in terms of the date by which
these adjustments are made. There was some very real possibility that by
sliding the date back just a little bit more, we could actually lose a
whole year?s worth of salary adjustment. So, this will come about seven
or eight months after the April 1 adjustment of this year. Given the scenario
we are dealing with, I think this is pretty good news and I hope it strikes
the faculty this way. Notice that the JLBC recommendation includes a minimum
threshold of $1,500 for any ASU employee with a satisfactory performance
rating. Beyond that I cannot give you further information because it is
not available at this time.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the operating budget side there
are about 30 lines on the chart, and we will address the ones that we hope
have the most meaning to you. The good news is that the merit adjustments
are going to be annualized into the budget. There is always the inherent
danger that when you raise salaries that you might not get the allocation
to cover it from the legislature. There is an anticipated figure for enrollment
growth. Remember how this works, if the enrollment growth does not materialize
then you wind up in a compromising situation. So, we are going on record
in this complicated negotiation of expressing intent to seek enough enrollment
growth to justify that 4.5 million-dollar figure. There are smaller amounts
for eminent scholars. For risk management we will lose a little money out
of the general fund and even more under the collections due to the transfer
of programs from Main Campus to East Campus; the Exercise and Wellness
Program is going out there. We hope the salaries and then later the tuition
revenue that is associated with that will be correctly budgeted.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me call your attention to the
zero (for decision packages) under both general fund and collections. Decision
packages are the mechanism through which the University requests new funds
for initiatives that we would like to undertake during the current budget
cycle. This year we did not put a lot of energy into crafting, justifying,
and fighting for decision packages because we knew it was going to be a
lost cause from word one. Why? Because of Prop 301. At the moment we are
seeing the first new revenue entering the University in many years. The
chances of getting an additional 1, 2, or 3 million dollars to address
some of the other initiatives we felt were zero and that feeling is justified
because that is what we got.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significantly, the JLBC is recommending
100% funding for our building renewal estimates. If that holds up that
would be truly significant. We have had almost no money in this category
for a number of years. Taken as a package, the news on salary and the news
on the operating budget itself and the news on Prop 301 have got to be
the most significant, positive news on the budget during the last fifteen
years that I have been at ASU.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: It is refreshing
to listen to the legislators. They are actually apologetic. They are saying,
"What do we need to do to prove ourselves in your eyes again?" I think
it means we did have some impact by being more politically active this
last year. I don?t think it means we ought to be quiet. This is a very
opportune time for each of you to communicate with your legislators and
to encourage them, thank them for what they are doing, and see if what
we are doing will actually count. It is a long time between when we introduce
bills and they are finally voted on. Next week is the last time to introduce
bills before they actually finish up on the budget. They may discover that
they actually do not have as much money as they think they do now. So,
I would encourage reinforcing our message between now and then. I would
encourage you to use your ZsunDevil.com account to accomplish that.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>3.C Special Announcement on Scholarly Awards </b>(Laura
Burgis, Parents Association, and Alex Bainbridge, President, Associated
Students).</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex Bainbridge: First off, you have
the announcement about the Centennial Professorship in front of you. This
represents two twenty-thousand-dollar awards, for two professors this year
on campus. The first ten thousand dollars is to go with what you would
wish. The next ten thousand dollars is to either give back to the students
(hint: ASASU programs) or to help yourself out in the classroom by finding
new and improved ways of teaching your students (technology in the classroom
included). Hopefully, a lot of professors will apply for it or be nominated
in this year. You will have to give a few speeches about how you are encouraging
your students to be better students, and at the same time how you are including
your students in your research. Are there any other questions?</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean Bernstein: I do have a question,
but I want to congratulate you on this award. It really shows the appreciation
of our students for our faculty.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex Bainbridge: Tomorrow we go down
to the legislature to argue for paying our professors hopefully a little
bit more money and also give them a little merit money too. The Arizona
Students Association is in favor of increasing building renewal to 100%
and also raising our professors? salaries to market value on our campus.
I will be encouraging the students to write their legislators and say,
"We support our faculty."</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laura Burgis: We wanted to bring this
opportunity to your attention for several reasons. Alex mentioned the ASASU
professorships, and there are two of them. In addition, you should also
be familiar with the ASASU Parents Association Professorship, which is
for $10,000 for the professor and another $10,000 for student wages. The
timeline is close for nominations. We are asking that all applications
be received within this next month. The deadline for the Parents Association
Professorship is February 23. Our professorship is going to be awarded
based on a community of people participating in the selection process.
It is quite vigorous, and we hope to get many nominations from students,
staff, etc. The selection will culminate in an award banquet on April 17
in Old Main. All of the finalists will be recognized, and all former recipients
are invited to participate in the award ceremony. Please pay attention
to the timeline, and we wish you all a lot of luck. Thanks for getting
the word out to your units because it is a real opportunity to showcase
the talent we have on this campus.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Misra: Will the awards be
available to all categories, assistant, associate, and full professors?</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laura Burgis: Thank you for bringing
that up. For the Parents Association Scholarship, while the criteria are
somewhat all-encompassing, we are looking for someone who really sends
enthusiasm throughout their classroom; anyone who instructs can be nominated.
It is very inclusive rather than exclusive. The way to distinguish the
awards is that the ASASU Professorship has opportunities for graduate professors
as well as law professors, whereas parents of undergraduate students created
the Parents Association Professorship, so they are really looking to award
undergraduate instructors.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A senator: Does the ASASU award include
former alumni or recent graduates?</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laura Burgis: We have not made the
award specifically to alumni, but it may be the case that someone who teaches
at ASU could be an alumnus as well. Thanks for bringing that up.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>3.D ASASU President?s Report</b> (Alex Bainbridge).</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Arizona Students Association will
be supporting full building renewal funding, at the same time increasing
professor salaries up to market value and at the same time asking each
of the faculty that in exchange for supporting you in your endeavors, that
you support us for a bill for Arizona Financial Aid Trust, the AZ AFAT
Bill. We are going to try for two to one funding. This will help many students
who because of the tuition raise may not be able to afford to attend ASU.
The Arizona Financial Aid Trust may help them continue to go forward with
their education at ASU. We have quite a few sponsors for the bill now,
but we need your support in the next couple of weeks. Thanks very much.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: It is refreshing
to see new professorships come available and opportunities to recognize
people who do outstanding things. I would encourage you to be involved
and get an application in for those opportunities.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>3.E. Past Senate President?s Report</b> (David Burstein).</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me say welcome back to all of
you. On February 19, the annual Statehood Picnic will be held at Wesley
Bolin Plaza. It is on Presidents? Day and because it is a holiday the cafeteria
in the Statehouse is closed. The Alumni Association provides a nice lunch
in the park and invites the legislators to come, and then we are given
the invitation to come and meet with our legislators. I would like to see
a lot of us out there talking with our legislators, one on one, and discussing&nbsp;
issues</font>
<br><font size=+0>which are important to us. It will be at 12:00 noon on
February 19<sup>th</sup>. It happens once a year. You?ll be there about
two hours including your travel down there. If you intend to come, please
email either Doug or me and we will send your name to the Alumni Association.
We can also provide directions.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Dan Landers: Will there be
tables set up by districts?</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past President Burstein: I think it
will be set up by districts, as it was last year. Last year they also had
a very nice graphic which they will be updating for this year which gives
a breakdown of the number of students, alumni, and faculty and staff that
live in each district, showing the impact that we actually have on these
legislators in the district that they represent. If you look at the current
leadership of the Senate and House committees, of the legislator, District
27 and 28, naturally, Randell Gnant as president of the Senate, and Tom
McGowan as majority leader of the House, hold very influential positions
on those committees. I hope that those of you who live in those two districts,
which I dare say is the majority of us here today, would contact their
legislators and thank them for this particular legislative session, in
terms of salary raises, in terms of 100% building renewal, and in terms
of their general support of the university. It is quite a nice thing to
say to you, please send a nice email to your legislators on behalf of what
they have done, but it is true and I hope many of you will do just that.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: The picnic
is a nice way to get to know them. It is an easy thing to do, to go down
and spend an hour in a nice relaxed environment, and talk about things
that you were interested in. One of the things that I thought we did much
better this last year was to provide good information to our legislators.
If you have information about how ASU programs impact Arizona (e.g. things
we do would influence the economy) this would be a good time to remind
legislators that ASU does enrich Arizona.&nbsp; I encourage you to get
involved.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean Bernstein: Some good news to
share with our legislators would be that 60% of our graduate students stay
in the state upon graduation from ASU, so an investment in our ASU graduate
programs is an investment in the State of Arizona.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>3.F President-elect</b> (Mort Munk).</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you. I am pleased to be here
and fully participating with you now. I spent the coldest months at the
University of Michigan. You and I both were extremely glad that David Burstein
filled in for me in my absence this fall. Thank you Dave, I am grateful
for that. As you may know, I will be serving on more committees, ex-officio,
than I can name right now. I have also been asked to serve as a member
of the committee that is revisiting the Campus Master Plan. The Provost
also asked me to chair a search committee for a new dean of the College
of Liberal Arts and Sciences. I do not have much else to tell you at the
present time, but I want to encourage all of you to email me with nominations
for the positions of President-elect and Secretary of the Academic Senate.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>3.G ASU West Senate Report </b>(Afsaneh Nahavandi).</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are working on our lower division
courses. We have, I understand, about 80 admissions and our goal is about
200. So we should be ok.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will have learning communities,
and we are currently discussing their organizational grouping and what
opportunities will be made available to them.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are planning for a new building
on our campus with the money from Prop 301. It will have a huge classroom,
which will assist with our night student population.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last item to mention is our MLK
Week events on campus. They were very well attended. We even had a town
hall going on throughout the entire week.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: Quite a
bit of excitement creating new classes. We need to retain our freshman
better, making sure that they stick around to become sophomores and to
graduate. We will be watching your learning community experience very carefully.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>3.H ASU East Senate Report</b> (Andy Jackson).</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a couple of things going on
at East that you need to be aware of. First of all, we have energized our
Master Plan process. The core of the bulk of our Master Plan was completed
last Friday. This information has gone forward, and a workgroup should
be in place by the first of February. I have been asked by the Provost
to chair the committee on the Master Plan proccess.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are very excited about Prop 301.
There is some infusion of capital improvements, one new building as well
as some significant modifications to several existing buildings. We hope
to see radical change at the East Campus in the next three years.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our next Assembly meeting is scheduled
for Thursday at 12:00 Noon, February 15<sup>th</sup>. I hope that all of
you who are interested will attend.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, CAPC (the campus academic policy
committee) has a full agenda going; several curriculum actions for spring
so far, and some for the next fall are being planned.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>4.&nbsp; Open Forum.</b> There were no items to consider
under open forum.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>5.&nbsp;</b> <b>Unfinished Business </b>(Motions for
second reading). There were no items of unfinished business.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>6.&nbsp; New Business </b>(New Motions and Committee
Reports).</font>
<br><font size=+0><b>6.A Committee on Committees </b>(Brent Brown).</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate to be like a broken record
and stand before you every meeting saying send in your surveys. However,
lots of committees can only be filled by members of the Senate, so I encourage
you to send in your application. A hard copy was sent to everyone, and
you can also download it from the Senate web page on your computer (</font><font size=-1><a href="http://www.asu.edu/provost/asenate)">http://www.asu.edu/provost/asenate)</a></font><font size=+0>.</font>
<br><font size=+0>Thanks.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: It is the
responsibility of each senator to serve on at least one Senate committee.
If you are not so engaged as yet, see Brent so you do not get appointed
to something that you are not really interested in. Get in quick.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Carleton Moore: When I was
on the Committee on Committees, nominations could be made on the Preference
Survey for President-elect and Secretary. Now Professor Munk is suggesting
that we send those names to him. Has there been a change in this procedure?</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: The Committee
on Committees will consider all nominations. Mort is just helping them
by soliciting nominations.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>6.B Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee </b>(Michael
Mayer).</font>
<br><b><font size=+0>6.B.1 Information Items:</font></b>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Mayer read the information
items approved by CAPC on December 6, 2000:</font>
<br><font size=+0>Curricular Proposal from the College of Education, Division
of Curriculum &amp; Instruction</font>
<br><b><font size=+0>To disestablish a concentration: MA, M.Ed., Ed.D Curriculum
&amp; Instruction Multicultural</font></b>

<br><font size=+0>Curricular Proposals from the College of Liberal Arts

<br><b><font size=+0>To change the name of a minor: Family Resources &amp;
Human Development to</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+0>Family and Human Development</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+0>To change the name of a concentration (academic specialization)</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+0>BAE Secondary Education to Family &amp; Human Development</font></b>
<p><font size=+0><b>6.B.2 Action Items</b>.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Mayer read the action items
which were approved by CAPC on December 6, 2000:</font>
<br><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate Motion #7 (2000-01)</b>:
"The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate
approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences
to change the name of a department from Department of Family Resources
and Human Development to the Department of Family and Human Development.
Rationale: This request is due to the recent changes in the department,
effective July 1, 2000. The Nutrition program in the department transferred
to ASU East and became an independent department. As a result of this transfer,
the department is requesting a name change for the constituted department
on the main campus. The name change to the Department of Family and Human
Development more accurately and clearly reflects the work of the faculty,
students, and programs that will remain in the department. Because the
faculty and programs that will remain in the department focus on the study
of families and individuals across the life span, the name Family and Human
Development is appropriate and accurate. Thus, it is requested that the
name of the department be changed to Department of Family and Human Development.
This change involves dropping the word ?Resources? from the current title
(this term was used to include nutrition)."</font>
<br><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate Motion #8 (2000-01): </b>"Request
from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to Change the Name of Degree
Program. Rationale: As a result of the name change of this department,
the Department Of Family and Human Development is requesting that all degree
titles that include the name "Department Of Family and Human Development"
be changed to "Department of Family and Human Development." This includes:
(1) the BS degree, (2) the minor, (3) the B.A.E. Secondary Education degree,
and (4) the MS degree.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate Motions #7 and #8 must be approved
by the Academic Senate as a whole.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>6.C Personnel Committee </b>(Jose Cobas).</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: Jose Cobas,
the chair of the Personnel Committee was called away by a family emergency,
but I will report for him that the University Committee on Insurance and
Retirement is being reactivated and Jose will represent the Senate on that
group. I hope that they will be able to give close scrutiny to the many
developments that are occurring in the benefits area, which do affect our
faculty significantly. There are a variety of bills in the legislature
this year that will make a big difference to many of us. We hope to monitor
these as well as the health insurance and dental insurance coverage that
will all have changes in the coming year. Jose has a significant job coming
up.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Carleton Moore: Could you
expand on your allusion to those with gray hair?</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: The variety
of bills in the legislature again propose Arizona State Retirement System
multipliers of 2.5, or graduations that would reach that level. We hope
these will receive favorable treatment in the legislature.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Carleton Moore: But then,
last year they put an 80% cap in place.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: That cap
is also the current bill.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Carleton Moore: And some of
us would not like that at all.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: For some
of us it is not a problem, but I understand your issue.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Carleton Moore: Can that be
grandfathered, say for people like Jack Fuchs who has been here about 48
years?</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: The legislature
could receive a comment on the constraint of 80%.&nbsp; Perhaps a recommendation
that the cap be relaxed would be an appropriate thing to do. By the way,
the legislature has a new web page that makes tracking bills much easier.
I would encourage you to take a look at the state web page and take a look
at the kind of things that are getting into the legislative process this
year. We have been to the committee hearings and have looked at the type
of support that is drawn. It is refreshing to see the kind of bills that
are <i>not</i> there also. To start the legislative season without seeing
the budget proposal get knocked down 20% is good. We have a lot to be thankful
for in that respect.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>6.D Student-Faculty Policy Committee </b>(Craig Allen).</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student-Faculty Policy Committee will
meet tomorrow, and we will look at the mentoring system for graduate students,
and we will be talking about plans for ASASU?s Course Evaluation Program.</font>
<p><font size=+0><b>6.E University Affairs Committee </b>(Renu Sharma).</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have not met yet but are planning
a meeting very soon. We will appoint a member to serve on the ASU Beautiful
Board.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: One of the
things that this committee will also be doing is monitoring the Master
Plan for parking.</font>
<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will have a Board of Regents meeting
on our campus this Thursday and Friday. They will cover issues that affect
us directly. Learner Centered Education continues to be a hot topic. The
Arizona Regents University will be a topic for a special workgroup. Proposition
301 and the allocation of those grants will tell us a lot about what is
going to happen in the near future. The Whistleblower Bill that we will
be working on this legislative session will come on board. I will try to
keep you informed about new developments. A newsletter should come to you
in the next couple of weeks to keep you updated on these issues. If you
have items that you would like to get into the newsletter, if you have
an issue that you would like to go to the legislature with, send me an
email or call me.</font>
