      <h2>'Museum Store Collects' exhibition offers snapshot of museum collection</h2>
      <p>        The ASU Art Museum highlights the value of its wonderful team of store
          docents when it opens the summer exhibition, "The Museum Store Collects,"
          on May 10. The exhibition, featuring works purchased using funds from
          the museum store, is on display through Sept.13, when a public reception
        will mark its close.</p>
      <p>"The Museum Store Collects" will present work purchased
            throughout the museum's history, using what senior curator Heather
            Lineberry describes
          as the museum's only consistent source of acquisition funds. The work
          purchased runs the gamut of the museum's collecting emphases and parallels
          its history as those emphases have shifted.</p>
      <p>Lineberry said the exhibition
          offers a good overview of the museum's collection, indicating that
        store funds have been well used to build
          broad strength in the collection.</p>
      <p>"This is a way for our patrons to walk
          into the museum and get a sense of the breadth of our collections,"
        Lineberry said. "Proceeds from the
          museum store have enabled us to build our collection, and the exhibition
          will be a snapshot of the history and mission of the ASU Art Museum's
          collection, with strong emphasis on each of our collecting areas."</p>
      <p>Important
          pieces in each of the museum's major areas of collecting - contemporary
          art, ceramics, Latin American art, prints (both historic
          and contemporary) and regional art - have been purchased using store
          funds. </p>
      <p>The exhibition will feature prints by artists from 18th-century
          artist Francisco Goya to recent Valley resident Kim Cridler. Likewise,
          the ceramic
          pieces in the collection vary from crocks to important works by contemporary
          ceramists such as the Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Art's
        Kurt Weiser. </p>
      <p>Artists in other fields who will be represented in the exhibition
          include Cuba's Los Carpinteros and Abel Barroso, sculptor John Ahearn,
          painter
          Hung Liu and the Valley's own Jon Haddock, whose computer game-style
          images have been exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art in
        New York. </p>
      <p>The ASU Art Museum Store is and always has been run completely
          by volunteers - an increasingly rare situation today. ASU Art Museum
          director Marilyn
          Zeitlin said that the docents have supported the museum since its inception,
          creating continuity with the museum's past and acting as partners in
          building its future.</p>
      <p>"The museum store is one of its most valuable projects
          in support of the museum, enabling us to purchase works of art that
        reflect the museum's
          overall mission of illuminating the relationship of art to society,"
          Zeitlin said. "The docents work entirely as volunteers, giving hours,
          advice, wisdom and good cheer to us every single day. It is a love-love
          relationship and we are so grateful to know these wonderful people."</p>
      <p>Started
          by Tempe resident Astrid Thomas and now run by Scottsdale resident
        LaReal Eyring, the store features a wide range of high quality art, craft,
          toys and cards from around the world. Eyring, who has volunteered in
          the store for 30 years and run it since 1989, has always ensured that
          it carries items in a range of prices, so children as well as adults
          can find and purchase a treasure.</p>
      <p>Eyring credited a commitment to the
          university and the pleasure of working with other volunteers and the
          staff of the museum as the reason she and
          other docents have stayed so long. The quality of her staff, she says,
          is the reason ASU Art Museum's store is the only one she knows of that
          is still completely volunteer-run.</p>
      <p>"We have several docents in the museum
          who have been here 25 or 30 years. They are extraordinarily loyal,"
        Eyring said. "They are knowledgeable
          - they have attended classes and traveled the world. They give their
          services - they always turn up, they fill in for each other. You can't
          hire people like that."</p>
