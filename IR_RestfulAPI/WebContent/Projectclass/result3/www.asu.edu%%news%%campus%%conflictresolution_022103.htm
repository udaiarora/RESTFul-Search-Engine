      <h2>ASU responds to global tension by providing conflict resolution</h2>
      <p> With the threat of war looming and the nation on heightened alert for 
        terrorist attacks, ASU has been taking steps to make people feel safe, 
        promote tolerance and provide healthy outlets for free speech.</p>
      <p>While the ASU Department of Public Safety concentrates on the nuts and 
        bolts of campus safety, a group of administrators and key campus coordinators 
        has begun meeting regularly through the Provost's Office to discuss the 
        campus environment and plan ways to foster communication in difficult 
        times.</p>
      <p>And as a direct response to the anxiety many on campus are feeling, the 
        Intergroup Relations Center (IRC) has scheduled an innovative educational 
        dialogue session, "Community Voices: Campus Lives - Global Tensions," 
        4 - 6 p.m., March 10 in the Memorial Union Ventana B room. It is open 
        to students, staff and faculty.</p>
      <p>The event will start with a "fishbowl" discussion in which designated 
        people from different groups will share their perceptions and experiences 
        related to the current global conflict. Participants will then break out 
        into small, facilitated discussion groups, and later will be given information 
        on involvement opportunities and campus free speech.</p>
      <p>The Muslim Student Association and Hillel, the Jewish student organization, 
        are among the sponsors. Others include the Asian/Asian Pacific American 
        Students' Coalition, the Interfaith Council and a number of minority organizations, 
        academic groups and Student Life offices. </p>
      <p>"It's not a debate, or a search for solutions, but an attempt to understand 
        each other's perspectives," says Kathy Wong, program coordinator. "In 
        a time of crisis, we all react differently based on our experiences and 
        backgrounds. As we continue to study, work and live together at ASU, having 
        a deeper understanding of how we and those around us are impacted is important."</p>
      <p>Instructors may encourage their students to attend as a way of applying 
        their related course material to campus and global events, she says. Participants 
        will sign attendance sheets and complete a brief online survey afterwards, 
        and those responses can be forwarded to instructors. </p>
      <p>The Campus Environment Team will respond to a U.S. declaration of war 
        by offering forums so people can express their opinions and concerns in 
        a constructive way, says Barbara Mawhinney, a member who also heads up 
        the Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action (EO/AA) office. </p>
      <p>The provost's coordinating group is promoting these kinds of discussions, 
        to encourage a productive response that will help students learn.</p>
      <p>"We're a university, after all, and our goal is to promote critical thinking 
        and learning," says Gail Hackett, vice provost. "Differences are something 
        we must learn to embrace. But we would like any expression of opinions 
        to take place responsibly and with respect toward others."</p>
      <p>ASU has compiled a list of resources within the university to assist 
        people who may be feeling uneasy or in need of services, found on the 
        ASU home Web page, under "Security Update." </p>
      <p>In an e-mail memo to the entire ASU community last week, President Michael 
        Crow called attention to these resources and encouraged people to support 
        one another. "I am extremely proud of the culture at ASU, which embodies 
        acceptance, tolerance and a willingness to embrace and appreciate the 
        diversity among us," he said. </p>
      <p>Resources include Counseling &amp; Consultation, which helps students 
        individually or in groups. For faculty and staff, the Employee Assistance 
        Office provides counseling, the Ombudsperson Committee can help resolve 
        workplace grievances and the EO/AA investigates complaints of illegal 
        discrimination.</p>
      <p>Other avenues include Student Advocacy &amp; Assistance, to help students 
        who are in crisis navigate the system of university policies. Student 
        Judicial Affairs oversees Code of Conduct violations.</p>
      <p>Information and registration for IRC's new dialogue group are available 
        online at (www.asu.edu/provost/intergroup) under the "Community Voices" 
        link. Registration deadline is March 7.</p>

        at (480) 965-6991 or (sauffret@asu.edu).<br>
