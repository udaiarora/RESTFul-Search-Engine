			<h2>History/Planning</h2>
		   <p>As you enter the <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> Computing
		  Commons, you are experiencing the culmination of a major team
		  effort that was initiated in October of 1988. Information Technology
		  set upon this venture with great enthusiasm, aspiring to create
		  and design a new building type as significant to the life of
		  the campus community as a library or a student center.</p>
		  <p>By fall of 1989, project funding
		  had been approved ($15.2M total) by the Arizona Board of Regents,
		  as well as the project scope and objectives, including: </p>
		  <ul>
			<li> To provide a building that supports
			   excellence in education and research through technology; </li>
			<li> To facilitate the integration
			   of information technologies with teaching, learning, research,
			   and student services support activities; </li>
			<li> To provide for operational and functional change; and </li>
			<li> To consolidate existing Information Technology services and functions. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <p> The firm of Anderson DeBartolo
		  Pan, Inc. (ADP) provided architectural and engineering services
		  for the project through all phases. Other consultants included
		  3D/I as construction managers throughout the project, and Gensler
		  and Associates Architects (Irvine, CA), as the initial interior
		  design consultant. The architectural and interior consultants
		  worked hand-in-hand from the beginning of the design process
		  to ensure that spaces were properly sized and designed to accommodate
		  human and functional requirements, furniture, and power and communications
		  to support equipment. This provided a level of collaboration
		  which frequently does not occur in the critical early phases
		  of design. The general contractor was Joe E. Woods, Inc. Finalization
		  of interior plans and finishes, bidding, furniture installation,
		  and custom furniture design was provided by Lendrum Associates. </p>
		  <p> Architectural design was completed
		  in December 1990. Bidding was extremely competitive for both
		  construction and furnishings, and allowed the project to set
		  aside $1M for new equipment for the computing site and classrooms.
		  Construction took place from February 1991 through June 1992.
		  The Computing Commons opened at the beginning of the fall semester
		  of 1993. Building dedication by ASU president Lattie Coor took
		  place on December 1, 1993. </p>
		  <p> Overall building and furniture
		  quality is high, yet the Computing Commons is an extremely cost-effective
		  project. Construction of 121,000 gross square feet cost $10.6M
		  or $88/SF (most buildings of this type cost from $100 to $200/SF).
		  The 75,000 net assignable SF were furnished for $1.6M or $21/SF.
		  The building and furnishings have tremendous flexibility (e.g.,
		  computer access floor throughout, furniture that can be reconfigured),
		  and will enable Information Technology to meet changes in technology
		  in teaching methodologies well into the 21st century. Every effort
		  has been made to eliminate physical barriers with respect to
		  furnishings and the building design. Likewise adaptive technology
		  hardware and software is provided as recommended by ASU Disability
		  Resources for Students. </p>
		  <p> The Computing Commons is located
		  in the heart of the campus--not far from the library and the
		  student union. This site is significant as it establishes the
		  Computing Commons as the &quot;technological hub&quot; of the
		  campus. </p>
		  <p> The building is almost two buildings,
		  one on top of the other: the first two floors have all facilities
		  programmed for use by students and faculty; the upper two floors
		  provide office and support facilities for Information Technology
		  staff and the Faculty Development group. </p>
		  <p> It is significant that the words
		  <em>common</em>, community; and communication share the same Latin
		  root - communis. The Latin conveys not only the notion of sharing
		  among everyone, but of serving and obliging. This Commons will
		  serve us and oblige the larger community beyond the boundaries
		  of this University. </p>
