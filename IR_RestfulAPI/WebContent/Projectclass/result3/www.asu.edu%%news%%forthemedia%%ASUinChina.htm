              <h2>China initiatives key to ASU's global engagement efforts </h2>
              <p>The concept of global engagement has been a key concept in the vision of Arizona State University President Michael Crow, an idea reinforced with several recent strides in China. Since May, ASU has made several extremely high profile visits to the country and opened up numerous opportunities for greater academic and cultural exchange. </p>
              <p>Following is a look at some of ASU's key connections with China.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
              <h2 class="style12" style="margin-top: 0;">Crow serves as U.S. host for forum on higher education design</h2>
              <p> <img src="images/china_forum1.jpg" width="175" height="140" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">As the People&rsquo;s Republic of China looks to build its universities into world-class teaching and research institutions, it is seeking advice from innovative public university leaders in the United States, guided by Arizona State University President Michael Crow.</p>
              <p>Crow served as co-host with Sichuan University President Xie Heping the first China-U.S. Forum on University Design June 1-2. This first roundtable of public university leaders focused on the role of higher education in the 21st Century. The theme covered &ldquo;social embeddedness and regional economic development,&rdquo; and took place at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, Phoenix&rsquo;s &ldquo;sister city.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Vice Minister Wu Qidi of the Chinese Ministry of Education led the meeting, with more than forty Chinese university leaders as well as officials for the Ministry of Education, the leadership of Sichuan Province, and Mayor of Chengdu Ge Honglin attending.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0;"><span class="style15">ASU graduates first Shanghai MBA class</span></p>
              <p>An elite group of top-level executives and government leaders will mark a historic moment in Shanghai on June 4 when the class of 2005 graduates from the groundbreaking W. P. Carey MBA Shanghai. The class of 64 high-level business and government leaders will emerge from the two-year program and continue critical leadership roles as China increases its position in world markets.</p>
              <p>The W. P. Carey School of Business at ASU is the first U. S. business school to partner with the People's Republic of China (PRC) to establish a first-of-its-kind MBA program for senior government officials and executives who oversee Shanghai's financial markets and large state-owned businesses. The impact of the program will have far-reaching effects, as China moves its global trade agenda forward. The class represents a cross-section of China's most prestigious executives and government leaders, including CEOs from Shanghai Airlines and Baosteel, as well as executives from financial institutions, utility companies, high-ranking government and regulatory agencies and Shanghai city government. </p>

              <h2 class="style12" style="margin-top: 0;">Mars research opens doors to world&rsquo;s fastest-growing economy </h2>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><img src="../research/research_images/Mars-China.jpg" width="200" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0;">ASU&rsquo;s Mars research team took center stage at China&rsquo;s national celebration of science and technology, and tens of thousands of Chinese citizens &ndash; including schoolchildren, scientists, engineers and senior members of government &ndash; took notice. </p>
              <p> ASU is the first university outside of China invited to stage an exhibition as part of that nation&rsquo;s annual national celebration of science and technology. The ASU exhibit &ndash; titled &ldquo;Welcome to Mars!&rdquo; &ndash; occupied 5,000 square feet at the Haidian Park Exhibition Hall in Beijing. </p>
              <p> The exhibit was the latest in a series of efforts designed to increase ASU&rsquo;s presence in China since President Michael Crow came to ASU in 2002.</p>

              <h2 class="style12">Crouch to lead ASU&rsquo;s global engagement efforts</h2>
              <p>ASU President Michael Crow has appointed Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering Dean Peter Crouch to lead the university&rsquo;s global initiatives. Crouch will remain dean of the Fulton School while an accelerated search for a permanent successor takes place.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a href="Newsmakers.htm"><img src="images/PeterCrouch.jpg" width="100" height="135" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="left"></a></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Crouch, who has been at ASU since 1984 and a dean for the past 10 years, will serve as vice provost for global engagement and report directly to University Provost and Executive Vice President Milton Glick.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
  Global engagement, originally noted as one of Crow&rsquo;s eight key design imperatives during his 2002 inauguration, is considered vital to the university&rsquo;s evolution.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0;"><br>
&quot;Dean Crouch has shown the strength and vision needed to lead this initiative &ndash; one that is critical to the future of the university,&rdquo; Crow says. &ldquo;His experience in fostering international efforts, in terms of students and faculty members, will be vital as we move forward. He fully understands that there is no aspect of our teaching, research or public service that does not possess global implications.&rdquo;</p>
