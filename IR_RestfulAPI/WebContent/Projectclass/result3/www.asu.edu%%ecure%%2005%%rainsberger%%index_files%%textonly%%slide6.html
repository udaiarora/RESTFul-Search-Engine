        <ul>
          <li value="0">
            <p>ANY RECORD, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, MAINTAINED BY AN INSTITUTION THAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO A STUDENT OR STUDENTS. FROM WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT CAN BE PERSONALLY (INDIVIDUALLY) IDENTIFIED </p>
          </li>
          <li value="0">
            <p>THESE RECORDS INCLUDE: FILES, DOCUMENTS, AND MATERIALS IN WHATEVER MEDIUM (HANDWRITING, PRINT, TAPES, DISKS, FILM, MICROFILM, MICROFICHE, ELECTRONIC STORAGE) WHICH CONTAIN INFORMATION FROM WHICH STUDENTS CAN BE PERSONALLY (INDIVIDUALLY) IDENTIFIED.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is the FERPA definition of an "education record."  It is important to start with this definition since you must determine if a piece of information is an "education record."  If the record can be identified as an "education record," it is subject to FERPA.</p>
        <p>Notice how broad the definition is; not only in the information covered but also in the variety of media in which such a record can be found.</p>
        <p>This definition basically tells us that an education record is not just a record that can be identified by a student's name; nor is it just a paper document found in the Registrar's Office.  </p>
        <p>This is a pervasive definition that draws most, if not all, academic and administrative offices of an institution under the FERPA umbrella.</p>
