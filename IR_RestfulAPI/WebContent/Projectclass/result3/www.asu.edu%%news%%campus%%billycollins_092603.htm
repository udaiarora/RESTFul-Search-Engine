      <h2>Two-time U.S. poet laureate continues ASU Distinguished Visiting Writer
        Series </h2>
      <p><img src="campus_images/billycollins_092603.jpg" alt="Billy Collins" width="150" height="150" align="right">Poetry may be a quiet art, but some poets are undeniably stars, and
        command a lot of public attention. Billy Collins, in his own subtle,
        funny way, is one of those poets.</p>
      <p>In an age when only a very small percentage of the reading public have
        ever bought a book of poetry, publishers fight publicly over the right
        to print Collins' strong-selling books. A recent story in the New York
        Times said matter-of-factly: "It can be argued that with his books selling
        briskly and his readings packing them in, Mr. Collins is the most popular
        poet in America."</p>
      <p>The two-time US Poet Laureate will be in the Valley on October 3, reading
        from his work at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts. (For more event
        information, see the end of this release.)</p>
      <p>Collin's reading is part of the Distinguished Visiting Writers Series,
        a major new reading series created by ASU's new Virginia G. Piper Center
        for Creative Writing. Presented in collaboration with the Scottsdale
        Center for the Arts and aimed at broadening the public reach of ASU's
        exceptional creative writing program, the series will bring visiting
        writers of the highest caliber to the Phoenix area. </p>
      <p>Billy Collins recently served two terms as U.S. Poet Laureate from spring
        2001 to spring 2003. As poet laureate, Collins' job was to raise the
        national consciousness to a greater appreciation of the reading and writing
        of poetry. He created the Poetry 180 program to promote the reading of
        daily poems in high schools across America. His work has appeared in
        The New Yorker, The Paris Review and The American Scholar. He is a distinguished
        professor of English at Lehman College, City University of New York,
        where he has taught for more than 30 years.</p>
      <p>Collins is the author of seven books of poetry including, Sailing Around
        the Room (new and selected poems, 2001) Picnic, Lightning (1997), The
        Art of Drowning (1995) and Questions About Angels (1991, selected for
        the National Poetry Series), The Apple That Astonished Paris (1988),
        Video Poems (1980), and Poker Face(1977). He also has recorded a CD of
        his poetry, The Best Cigarette (1997).</p>
      <p>Though there superlatives abound in reviews of Collins' work, many critics
        also cite his approachability, his humanity and the humor in his poetry.
        New York Times Reviewer Cynthia Magriel Wetzler wrote: "Billy Collins
        writes funny poems, poems in which a dog barks out a solo with the oboes
        in a Beethoven symphony or in which the writer spends the morning shoveling
        snow with Buddha. Luring his readers into the poem with humor, Mr. Collins
        leads them unwittingly into deeper, more serious places, a kind of journey
        from the familiar or quirky to unexpected territory, sometimes tender,
        often profound." Renowned poet and John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation
        President Edward Hirsch said of The Art of Drowning: &quot;Billy Collins
        is an American original, a metaphysical poet with a funny bone and a
        sly questioning intelligence. He is an ironist of the void and his poems--witty,
        playful, and beautifully turned--bump up against the deepest human mysteries.&quot;</p>
      <p>Collins has received fellowships from the New York Foundation for the
        Arts, The National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation.
        He has also won a variety of awards from America's oldest and most prestigious
        poetry publication, Poetry magazine: the Bess Hokin Prize, the Frederick
        Bock Prize, the Oscar Blumenthal Prize, and the Levinson Prize. In 1992
        he was chosen by the New York Public Library to serve as &quot;Literary
        Lion.&quot; </p>
      <p>Collins' reading will be held on Friday, October 3 at 7:30 p.m. at the
        Scottsdale Center for the Arts. Admission is $20. For more information
        on this and other lectures in the series, email clasevents@asu.edu &lt;mailto:clasevents@asu.edu&gt; or
        call 480-965-0051.</p>
      <p>Future visiting writers in the inaugural 2003 series will include the
        novelist and Arizona native Janet Burroway on Thursday, October 16, C.
        D. Wright on Thursday, Feb. 12, and novelist Alexs Pate on Friday, April
        9. Locations and ticket prices will vary.</p>
