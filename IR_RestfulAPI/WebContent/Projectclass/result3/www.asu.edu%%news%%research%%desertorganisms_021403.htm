      <h2>Common desert organisms may help in search for life in space</h2>
      <p>ASU geomicrobiologist Ferran Garcia-Pichel doesn't just study microorganisms, 
        he studies how they interact with and change their inanimate surroundings. 
        In his work he searches for clues about the first type of organism to 
        dominate the early earth continents - clues he says lead him to believe 
        their descendants, still standing in the deserts of the Southwest, could 
        be similar to the last ones standing in the case of a drastic change.</p>
      <p>Well, maybe not standing. These tough little critters, which thrive in 
        desolate places and extreme conditions, have no legs. </p>
      <p>They are the microscopic, single celled cyanobacteria - one of the oldest 
        life forms on Earth. While they may no longer dominate the planet, they 
        are well known from their marine fossil stromatolites, and they still 
        live with us here, forming soil crusts in the Arizona desert.</p>
      <p>Along these lines, Garcia-Pichel and his collaborators will be presenting 
        several papers and posters at the 2003 NASA Astrobiology Institute General 
        Meeting at Arizona State University. These are on the topics of cyanobacterial 
        community structure, microbial mats, desiccation under different conditions, 
        molecular analysis of calcifying cyanobacteria, comparisons of rDNA sequences 
        from cyanobacteria, as well as the analysis of microbial nitrogen cycling 
        in desert soil crusts.</p>
      <p>The Earth is about 4 billion years old. Fossilized stromatolites (large 
        deposits left by aquatic communities of cyanobacteria), the most common 
        fossils from the Precambrian period, are known for about 3.5 billion years. 
        That's more than 75% of the earth's history. The size and number of these 
        fossils indicate that cyanobacteria once formed the major ecosystems of 
        the Earth. They were witness to nearly every stage in the earth's evolution.</p>
      <p>Geochemical evidence shows that cyanobacteria also seem to have played 
        a major role in transforming the early earth into the earth we know today. 
        They invented oxygenic photosynthesis and through this turned the earth's 
        biosphere from reducing to oxidizing. <br>
        <br>
        Studying fossilized cyanobacteria allows us to study what life was like 
        and how it evolved on what was in many ways a different planet. But there 
        may be more to the story. According to Garcia-Pichel, their role in the 
        transformation of early life on land has not been duly recognized, perhaps 
        because terrestrial cyanobacteria do not fossilize as readily as their 
        marine counterparts.</p>
      <p>Scientists might have to look at indirect evidence - a unique sort of 
        chemical or mineral signature (known as a biosignature) that an organism 
        leaves in its environment. The study of living cyanobacteria and the chemical 
        biosignatures they leave in their environment is essential for the task 
        of looking for past-life evidence on other planets and our own.</p>
      <p>According to Garcia-Pichel, if we can learn how to recognize the signatures 
        left behind by living terrestrial cyanobacteria on our planet today, we 
        will soon be able to look for them in our geologic record, as well as 
        on other planets. The key to finding their evidence is in figuring out 
        their signatures. </p>
      <p>Garcia-Pichel hypothesizes that, because they lacked competitors, the 
        early earth's surface may at one time have been completely covered with 
        cyanobacteria. But, as the diversity of life increased, things changed. 
        The advent of plants with leaf-litter blocked much needed sunlight from 
        hitting cyanobacterial communities in the soil. In short, they were crowded 
        out. </p>
      <p>And this brings Garcia-Pichel and his colleagues to the deserts of the 
        Southwest, where aridity limits plant development, soils are usually bare 
        and cyanobacteria still thrive in communities known as soil crusts.</p>
      <p>In some of the more pristine portions of the Arizona desert, cyanobacteria 
        essentially lead an existence of withstanding desiccation and the insults 
        of the environment, living one or two millimeters under the surface. From 
        time to time, every monsoon or so, they get wet and come to the surface 
        for a couple hours of activity. In these wet periods they multiply through 
        cellular division and repair all the damage from the dry period. </p>
      <p>During dry spells, the cyanobacteria (as well as other microbes that 
        live within their community) just lay dormant and suffer what Garcia-Pichel 
        calls "the slings and arrows of the Southwest." To minimize the effects 
        of these slings and arrows, they secrete slime. This slime creates a crust 
        that holds the soil of the cyanobacterial ecosystem in place. This slime 
        essentially cements the desert crust and stabilizes the soil, keeping 
        it from blowing away in the wind. </p>
      <p> Though cyanobacteria are too small to see with the naked eye, we definitely 
        see their effects. Dust storms in the urban Arizona, as well as the unacceptably 
        high particulate matter count, are enhanced by the loss of cyanobacterial 
        soil communities from agriculture and construction.</p>
      <p>Garcia-Pichel and his colleagues plan to study modern desert soil crusts, 
        a common and important remnant of cyanobacterial ecosystem, and how they 
        undergo diagenesis - the chemical transformations that occur after burial.</p>
      <p>Cyanobacteria may be old, but the science and methodologies Garcia-Pichel 
        and his colleagues incorporate in geomicrobiological research are new. 
        According to Garcia-Pichel we are just beginning to understand how microbes 
        can and probably do drive biogeochemical cycles. "This area of geomicrobiology 
        is really, in the Western world, a novelty," says Garcia-Pichel, "people 
        still are amazed that microbes can do things with minerals and rocks." 
      </p>
      <p>Novelty or not, Garcia-Pichel and his colleagues believe geomicrobiology 
        will help scientists understand the evolution of the earth, and the possible 
        evolution of other planets in this solar system and beyond.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the applications of their research to the question of Mars, 
        Garcia-Pichel said, "If we postulate that water was not always relegated 
        and then became relegated, and that microbial life was present, what kind 
        of ecosystem would have been the last to be on the surface soils of Mars? 
        It would have been something like desert crusts today. So just there our 
        chances of finding some indirect evidence of life are highest, if we just 
        know how to track, how to teat and how to recognize possible biosignatures 
        from these ecosystems."</p>
      <p>The NASA Astrobiology Institute is composed of over 700 researchers distributed 
        at more that 130 research institutions across the United States. Its central 
        offices are located at NASA Ames Research Center, in the heart of Silicon 
        Valley, California. Additional information about the NAI can be found
