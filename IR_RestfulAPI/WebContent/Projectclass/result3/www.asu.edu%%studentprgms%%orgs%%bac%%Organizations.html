            In 1908, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority became America's first Greek-letter organization established by Black college women. Her roots date back to Howard University, Washington, D.C. Alpha Kappa Alpha was founded to improve and enhance the college experience, to cultivate high scholastic and ethical standards, to promote unity &amp; friendship among college women and to be of service to all mankind. After her incorporation as a perpetual body in 1913, Alpha Kappa Alpha gradually branched out and became the channel through which selected college-trained women improved the socioeconomic conditions in their city, state, nation, and the world. <br />

            Since its founding on December 4, 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has supplied voice and vision to the struggle of African-Americans and people of color around the world. Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for African-Americans, was founded at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York by seven college men who recognized the need for a strong bond of Brotherhood among African descendants in this country. The Jewel founders and early leaders of the Fraternity succeeded in laying a firm foundation for Alpha Phi Alpha's principles of scholarship, fellowship, good character, and the uplifting of humanity. <br />

            On Friday evening, November 17, 1911, three Howard University undergraduate students, with the assistance of their faculty adviser, gave birth to the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. From the initials of the Greek phrase meaning, &quot;friendship is essential to the soul,&quot; the name Omega Psi Phi was derived. The phrase was selected as the motto. Manhood, scholarship, perseverance and uplift were adopted as cardinal principles. Omega Psi Phi Fraternity was incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia on October 28, 1914. <br />

            Three young African-American male students founded Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. at Howard University in Washington, D.C. on January 9, 1914. The founders wanted to organize a Greek letter fraternity that would truly exemplify the ideals of brotherhood, scholarship, and service. The founders deeply wished to create an organization that viewed itself as &quot;a part of&quot; the general community rather than &quot;apart from&quot; the general community. They believed that each potential member should be judged by his own merits rather than his family background or affluence...without regard of race, nationality, skin tone or texture of hair. They wished and wanted their fraternity to exist as part of even a greater brotherhood which would be devoted to the &quot;inclusive we&quot; rather than the &quot;exclusive we&quot;. <br />

          <p align="left" class="style18"><br />
            Founded January 16, 1920, Zeta began as an idea conceived by five coeds at Howard University in Washington D.C. These five women, also known as our Five Pearls, dared to depart from the traditional coalitions for black women and sought to establish a new organization predicated on the precepts of Scholarship, Service, Sisterly Love and Finer Womanhood. It was the ideal of the Founders that the Sorority would reach college women in all parts of the country who were sorority minded and desired to follow the founding principles of the organization. <br />
