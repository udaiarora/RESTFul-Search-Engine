SASTip: that may increase Windows NT performance.

<P>
SAS Note E022 or 14022, V6-SYS.SYS-E022, USAGE NOTE
Product:  BASE
<P> 
One way to increase Windows Performance is to make more memory available.
This does not necessarily mean that you have to add physical ram to the
system.  Any services that you are not using can be turned off therefore
making more memory accessable to the NT operating system. This memory can
then be used by your applications and to cache files. To stop a service,
click Start then Settings.  Select Control Panel and then Services.  Click
on the Service you want to start and then click Stop.
<P> 
Caution: Close only those services that you know what it does and those
that you know you are not using.
<P><ul> 
The following are some services that are not crucial to systems operation.
<li>Messenger (sends/receives pop-up messages) uses 49KB
<li>Telephony Server (telephone dialing Remote Access connections) 200KB
<li>Schedule (runs programs in background at specified time) 1.2MB
<li>Clipbook Server (shares files accross Network) 1.3MB
<li>Spooler (Manages printing, won't be able to print without it) 1.3MB
<li>Network DDE and Network DDE DSDM (allows dynamic data exchange across
network applications) 1.6MB
</ul>
