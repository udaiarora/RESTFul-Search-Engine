<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">TYPE= specifies the chart statistic as the mean value
of the summary variable SALES for each site. MIDPOINTS= selects the two sites
and the order in which they appear. GROUP= creates a separate row of blocks
for each different value of DEPT. SUBGROUP= divides each block into separate
segments for the four quarters. LEGEND= assigns the LEGEND1 statement to the
graph. NOHEADING suppresses the default heading that would otherwise appear
above the chart. CAXIS= colors the grid black. COUTLINE= specifies the outline
color for the blocks.
