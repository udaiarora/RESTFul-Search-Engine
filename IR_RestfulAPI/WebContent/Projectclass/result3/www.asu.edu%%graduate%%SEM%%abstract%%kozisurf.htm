<i>Abstract:</i>  The behavior of Pb overlayers deposited on Si(100)-(2X I) at room temperature was investigated by scanning-tunneling microscopy and low-energy electron microscopy. Surface reconstructions of (2 X 2), c(4X8), (2X 1), and c(4X4) were observed as Pb coverage increased from 0.5 to 1.5 monolayers. After the appearance of the c(4X4) phase, Pb islands with threefold-symmetric (111) orientation were observed on the twofold- or fourfold-symmetric Si(100) surface. The transformation of the island shape during growth can be broadly categorized as hexagonaltriangularhexagonal. An internal structure of stepped-down depression was formed on all islands. As deposition continued, the depression was gradually filled by a step-flow growth mechanism. Our observations suggest that the initial growth of the islands is dominated by diffusion of Pb atoms on the substrate to the island edges; later, when the islands become sufficiently large, growth is determined mainly by atom diffusion on the Pb(111) islands.<p>
