      <h2>ASU pianists receive Memorial Award in arts</h2>
      <p>        Pianists Margarita Denenburg and Mark Fuksman were presented the Joan
          Frazer Memorial Award in the Arts by Hillel at ASU. In the spring 2004,
          the award winners will showcase their artistic projects in American
        premiers of works by two Jewish composers. </p>
      <p>Denenburg will explore Gideon
            Klein's 1943 sonata for piano, which was composed during his years
            in the concentration camp Terezin and later
          discovered after he perished.</p>
      <p>"The sadness, horror and sense of taken
          lives have been felt in his piano sonata, which contains three movements,
          each with a different meaning,"
          Deneburg says. <br>
        She will perform this sonata and share her research on the composer
          and his music written during the Holocaust. </p>
      <p>Denenburg, a Russian born Israeli,
          is a sophomore attending ASU on a full scholarship from the ASU School
          of Music. She is pursuing a degree
          in piano performance and is under the mentorship of Assistant Professor
          of Piano, Baruch Meir for this project. <br>
        Fuksman will bring to light selected sonatas by Russian-Jewish composer
          Samuel Feinberg, whose work was neglected during the Communist regime.</p>
      <p>Fuksman
          says, "Feinberg had a tremendous impact on various realms of musical
          culture and art in Russia. He was a formidable pianist, teacher
          and writer of music essays, but was virtually unknown as a composer."</p>
      <p>Feinberg's
          12 sonatas were published in limited quantity and are scarce. With
        the exception of the Piano Concerto and some transcriptions, by
          the composer himself, none of Feinberg's compositions have been recorded. </p>
      <p>"After listening to the concerts and studying his other scores," Fuksman
          says. "I was struck by the depth of his emotional and intellectual
        power. As Feinberg was an astounding pianist and virtuoso, he projected
        his
          possession of piano technique into his compositions, which demand transcendental
        virtuosity."</p>
      <p>Fuksman is a doctoral candidate of musical arts in piano
          performance. Robert Hamilton, music professor, says, "Mark is truly
        a treasure. He
          is one of the very rare students we find with all of the pieces in
        place for a significant concert career."</p>
      <p>The Joan Frazer Memorial Award in the
          Arts at Hillel was created in the memory of Joan Frazer who loved the
          arts and was deeply committed to
          Hillel. Community members interested in attending the musical performance
          in the spring of 2004 may call Hillel to receive an invitation. ASU
        students interested in applying for the award for the 2004 - 05 school
        year can
          pick-up a brochure from Hillel, the Jewish Student Center, located
        at 1012 S. Mill Ave., in Tempe.</p>
      <p>Shapiro, with Hillel, can be reached (480)
          967-7563 or (linda@hillelasu.org).<br>
