                  <br>
                  <p>In the world of assessment the words "published" and "unpublished" have special significance. Published tests are those available from commercial publishers. Unpublished tests are not <i>commercially</i> available. Use of published tests is highly restricted. In most cases users are required to contact the publisher or author of a test instrument to obtain a copy of the test or to obtain permission to use the test. <br>
                      <br>
  Tests that have not been published commercially can be very difficult to locate. Sometimes they are available from the individual author, either directly, or printed as part of a book, article or research report. Tests found in this way can be incorporated into academic reports such as term papers, provided a proper credit is given. Those wishing to administer an unpublished test will need to deal with possible copyright restrictions. Contacting the author for permission to use the test is advisable and often required. </p>

Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, ERIC blends two files: Resources in Education (RIE), covering the fugitive document literature, and Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE), covering journal literature. Both of these sources contain some instruments, which ERIC generally notes in the abstract. There is also a "Document Type" field that can be used to limit to "Questionnaires."</p>
                            <p>The ERIC database (1966-July 2004) contains 1.1 million bibliographic citations to a broad collection of education-related resources, from government reports to journal articles (EJ). Other materials, called ERIC Documents (ED) include conference papers, project and program descriptions, curriculum guides, etc. The Documents are full text 1993-. Many of the journal articles are also full-text.
