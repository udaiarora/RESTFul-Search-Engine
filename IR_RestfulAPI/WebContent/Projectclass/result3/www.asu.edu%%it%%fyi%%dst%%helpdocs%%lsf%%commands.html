How to check Batch System status:

<p>
<h4>
1. bqueues
</h4>
Displays information about batch queues in the LSF Batch System.
<p>

<h3>
How to submit Batch Job:
</h3>
<p>
<h4>
2. bsub
</h4>
Submits a job for execution in the LSF Batch system. If no commands are
given then it will read job commands from the standard input.  If the 
standard input is a controlling terminal, <b>bsub</b> will prompt for 
commands. 
<p>
Some of its options are:
<p>
<blockquote>
-q QUEUE_NAME<br>
This submits the job to the queue assigned to QUEUE_NAME.  The default
is short.
<p>
-m HOST<br>
This submits a job to a specified cluster/host.  Where HOST can be 
"stats" for the Stats cluster and "compute" for the compute cluster.
This option is only needed when submitting jobs from one cluster to
another. 
<p>
-o OUTFILE<br>
Writes the standard output of the job to the specified file. The default
sends it via email to the user.
<p>
-e ERRORFILE<br>
Writes the standard error output of the job to the specified file.
<p>
-b START_TIME<br>
Starts the job at a specific time after moving it from the Pending 
state.  The START_TIME is in "military-time", e.g., 5:00 for 5am,
16:30 for 4:30pm and 5:25:18:50 for May 25 at 6:50pm.   
<p>
-N -u YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS<br>
-N notifies you by email when the job finishes and -u sends email to 
your_email_address.
<p>
-J JOB_NAME<br>
Assigns JOB_NAME as a character string to the job.
</blockquote>
<p>
If <b>-o</b> is used and <b>-e</b> is not, then the standard error 
output will be sent to the file specified for standard output.
<p>
If both <b>-o</b> and <b>-e</b> are not used then the standard 
output and standard error output are merged and sent via email to 
the user.   
<p>

<h3>
How to track Batch Job:
</h3>
<p>
<h4>
3. bjobs
</h4>
Displays the status and other information about jobs in LSF.
<p>
One of its options is:
<p>
<blockquote>
-u all<br>
This displays jobs for all users.  The default is to display jobs 
submitted by the user who invoked this command.
</blockquote>
<p>
There is a local created command called "<b>q</b>" that can also be use 
and it displays more information about current jobs.
<p>
<h4>
4. bkill JOB_ID
</h4>
Sends a signal to kill the specified job.
<p>
