<p><font size="+1" color="#FF6600"><a name=PRESERVING>Preserving Our Language, Memory and Lifeways: 
  Tribal Archives, Libraries and Museums</a></font><br>
  The national conference was held in the Mesa (Arizona) Centennial Center from 
  May 7 to 10, 2002 and brought together some 300 participants representing tribal 
  archives, libraries, and museums from the Continental United States and Alaska, 
  Canada, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>
  There were representatives from the Library of Congress, the National Museum 
  of the American Indian, Smithsonian Institution, American Library Association, 
  Gilcrease Museum, Bill Gates Foundation, Minnesota Historical Society, National 
  Park Service, and the Arizona State Library and Archives. Alyce Sadongei, Assistant 
  Curator for Native American Relations at the Arizona State Museum, did a masterful 
  job of arranging, promoting, and directing a most successful conference.<br>
  In addition to representatives from Arizona and New Mexico tribes, conference 
  attendees were able to network with colleagues from many Native nations: Squamish; 
  Lummi; Ilisagvik, Mashantucket Pequot, Karuk, Makah, Blackfeet, Muckleshoot, 
  Miami,Catawba, Ktunaxa Kinbasket, Fond du lac, Alutiik, Maori, and more. <p>
  Participants were treated to an outdoor feast at the Mesa Cultural Center followed 
  by traditional dances by representatives from the Salt River Pima Indian Community, 
  Gila River Indian Community, Ak-Chin Indian Community, and the Tohono O'odham 
  Nation. They also visited a number of local tribal museums and enjoyed an evening 
  reception at the Heard Museum.<br>
  The conference topics were stimulating and varied, and included discussions 
  on cultural sovereignty, language retention, developing tribal archives, digitization 
  of photograph collections, a discussion of pesticide residues on NAGPRA objects, 
  the application of technology and telecommunications in Indian country, and 
  fund raising strategies.<br>

  N. Scott Momaday, Pulitzer Prize
  winning author and Regents Professor of 
  English at the University of Arizona, delivered 
  the Barrett Honors College 2002 Centennial Lecture at Gammage Auditorium on 
  March 4. He read from some of his writings, which have included poetry, plays, 
  essays, and paintings. He is particularly noted for his novel, House Made at 
  Dawn.<p>
  Donald Fixico, distinguished professor of American Indian History and director 
  of the Indigenous Nations Studies program at the University of Kansas, was in 
  residence at ASU Barrett Honors College as the Rhodes Chair during February 
  and March. During his tenure at ASU, he taught a course on &quot;American Indian 
  Leadership, Community and Place.&quot;
  His Rhodes lecture on February 11 in the Katzin Concert Hall also dealt with 
  leadership: &quot;American Indian Leadership Throughout History.&quot;</p>

  The Center receives a great many gift books every year that are duplicated in 
  both the circulating stacks and the Center. During the past year, we have distributed 
  some 482 books to 16 Native libraries in Arizona.
<p>
  The Center also donated some books to the Red Crow Community College in Alberta, 
  Canada, after a fire destroyed its library. We mentioned this in our spring 
  newsletter, and learned that a number of our readers were able to help out with 
  donations. I understand that the University of Cincinnati Digital Press responded 
  with a copy of the CD version of George Catlin's Printed Works. We wish the 
  library the best of luck in its recovery efforts and thank those readers that 
  helped out.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#CC3300" size="+1"><a name=VISITORS>Visitors from San Juan Pueblo </a>
  </font><br>
  Some twenty children from the Ohkay Owingeh Community School, San Juan Pueblo, 
  New Mexico, paid a visit to the Labriola Center on April 15. They were guests 
  during Native American Culture week at ASU and performed traditional dances 
  on Hayden Lawn. The ASU Community enjoyed a rare opportunity to see the &quot;Green 
  Corn Dance,&quot; &quot;Spring Social Dance,&quot; and the traditional &quot;Buffalo 
  Dance.&quot; 
<p>
  The students toured the Labriola Center and were shown books and other materials 
  in the collection that dealt with their own pueblo. They were particularly fascinated 
  with two volumes: Southern Pueblo Pottery: 2,000 Artist Biographies and Pueblo 
  Indian Pottery 750 Artist Biographies. A number of the young people were quite 
  excited to discover many of their own family members represented in the books. 
  The attractive volumes were written by Gregory Schaaf, in 2000, and 2002 respectively 
  and published by CIAC Press, Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p>

  A Wyoming reader searched the ASU Online Catalog to learn that the Labriola 
  Center had a copy of the 1917 Carlisle Indian School Yearbook. She E-mailed 
  the Center asking us to see if there was a photograph of her grandmother, Winnifred 
  LaJeunesse, who attended Carlisle between 1914 and 1917.

  <font color="339966" size="+1"><a name=SANTAFE>Santa Fe Indian School Records</a></font><br>
  The Labriola Center has recently purchased Bureau of Indian Affairs Records 
  Created by the Santa Fe Indian School, 1890-1918. Opened in November 1890, the 
  Santa Fe School superintendent was assigned responsibility for the Indians in 
  Northern New Mexico, which included the pueblos of Cochiti, Jemez, Nambe, Picuris, 
  Pojoaque, San Ildefonso, San Juan, Santa Clara, Santo Domingo, Taos, Tesuque, 
  and Zia. There were also some Navajo, Apache and Pima students.<p>
  At first, the school accepted pupils from all grades, but enrollment was later 
  limited to the sixth grade and above. The children devoted half of each day 
  to school work, the other half to vocational training, which might include the 
  labor of the school such as working in the fields. Later, the curriculum included 
  native crafts such as pottery, beadwork, and basketry.<p>
  The collection includes letters by the Superintendent and others to the Commissioner 
  of Indian Affairs, Indian agents, agency employees, territorial officials, individual 
  Indians, and private individuals. They concerned personnel, school activities, 
  Pueblo lands, and the welfare of individual Indians.<p>
  Also included are letters sent by day school teachers and the superintendent's 
  correspondence with employees. In addition to school activities, they dealt 
  with personnel, individual Indians, and the general administration of the school. 
  The 38 reels of microfilm are available in the Center.<p>
  A bibliography of microfilm publications on the American Indian and held by 
  the University Libraries, is available on the web site <a href="films.htm">www.asu.edu/lib/archives/films.htm</a></p>

  The Labriola Center is presently designing a digital exhibit featuring the photographs

  seminary, Fr. Schwarz asked to be sent to China. Instead, the Bishop sent him 
  to Arizona.

  In the beginning, the object of this newsletter was to keep the Labriola family 
  and the ASU Community informed of our activities. As time went on, our mailing 
  list grew and now goes out to some 900 individuals and organizations. The Center 
  would appreciate our readers' input on the effectiveness of our newsletter and 
  any suggestions we might consider for improvement. A pre-addressed form is enclosed.</p>

  <font color="#FF0000" size="+1"><a name=ANOTHER>Another Note from Down Under and Thanks to the 
  Internet</a></font><br>
  In the Spring 2002 Newsletter, we wrote about an Australian patron who found 
  her grandfather, Charles F. Shaffer, on our web site. The Center had purchased 
  the Shaffer collection, which consisted of scrapbooks, photographs, letters, 
  and guest book kept by Shaffer and his wife, Mildred. They taught school in 
  the Havasupai village of Supai, Arizona, ten miles below the rim of the Grand 
  Canyon between 1930 and 1940.<p>
  We heard from another Aussie member of the Shaffer family in April. She told 
  us 
  that she had no photographs of her grandfather and other relatives and asked 
  for copies of some of the photos. We scanned selected Shaffer photographs on 
  CD-ROM so she could distribute these to family members around the world. 
<p> At the same time, our Australian patron suggested that her 86-year-old Auntie 
  in Reno might be able to assist in identifying the photographs taken so long 
  ago. As a result of her help, I was able to expand the biographical sketch in 
  the Shaffer Finding Guide and fill in some blanks in our photograph list. A 
  special &quot;thank you&quot; to all the Shaffers. <i><font size="-1">- Joyce

<p> <font size="+1" color="#339966"><a name=REGENTS>Regent's Professor Iverson Donates Personal 
  Papers</a></font><br>
  Peter Iverson, Regent's Professor of History and scholar of American Indian 
  history at ASU, has donated some 16 boxes of research material including notes, 
  reports, letters, and more to the Labriola Center. We hope to begin inventorying 
  and processing the material very soon so that it can be available for research.<p>
  Professor Iverson is author or editor of numerous books including Indians in 
  American History: An Introduction (1998); When Indians Became Cowboys: Native 
  Peoples and Cattle Ranching in the American West (1995); Major Problems in American 
  Indian History: Documents &amp; Essays (with Al Hurtado, 1994); and We Are All 
  Still Here: American Indians in the 20th Century (1998). He has recently completed 
  a major historical work on the Navajo, which will be published in the very near 
  future.</p>
<p> <font color="#FF6633" size="+1"><a name=RESEARCH>Research Project? Help is Here </a></font><br>
  The Labriola Center has prepared a number of bibliographies on a variety of 
  topics to help our students and researchers. In addition to books, the listings 
  include ephemeral materials, sound and video recordings, oral histories, online 
  databases, and selected web sites. All of the items listed are held in the Labriola 
  Center or the University Libraries.<br>
  These bibliographies are available in hard copy and can also be printed from 
  the Labriola web page
  <a href="labriola.htm">www.asu.edu/lib/archives/labriola.htm</a>
<p> The guide, <a href="codetalkers.htm">&quot;American Indian Veterans with an Emphasis on Code Talkers,&quot;</a> 
  lists both general works on Native veterans as well as primary sources. Nearly 
  all the general works were written in the past ten years, part of a burgeoning 
  interest in the topic. The bibliography does not include works on Indian scouts 
  of the nineteenth century. The Labriola Center also features a GI Joe Navajo 
  Code Talker doll. Dressed in the uniform of the United States Marines, it speaks 
  seven Navajo phrases along with their English translations.<p>
  The <a href="repatriation.htm">&quot;Bibliography on Repatriation&quot;</a> lists reference material dealing 
  with repatriation of Native American remains and grave goods. There are books, 
  journals, ephemeral materials, video recordings, and selected internet sites. 
  Of particular interest is Mending the Circle: A Native American Repatriation 
  Guide, 1996.
<p> The <a href="boardingschools.htm">&quot;Bibliography 
  of Indian Boarding Schools, 1875-1940&quot;</a> has been a hit with students. 
  It includes reference material dealing with boarding schools during the late 
  19th and early 20th centuries. In addition to books, there are photographs, 
  oral histories, manuscript collections, video recordings, government documents, 
  and ephemera. The Center can offer some early publications from many schools 
  such as Indian School Journal, 1905-1977 (Chilocco Indian School); The Red Man: 
  An Illustrated Magazine Printed by Indians, 1909-1917; or The Phoenix Redskin,1900-1940s) 
  Phoenix Indian School. 
<p> <a href="gaming.htm">&quot;Historical and Contemporary American Indian Gaming&quot;</a> covers the 
  rapidly growing issue of Indian gaming. Historically, Native Americans have 
  had both games of chance and games of skill and their long history is discussed 
  in Games of the North American Indians by Stuart Culin. Gambling Music of the 
  Coast Salish Indians is an interesting addition, and of special note, there 
  is the slick publication, Indian Gaming: The National Magazine of the American 
  Indian Gaming Industry.</p>
