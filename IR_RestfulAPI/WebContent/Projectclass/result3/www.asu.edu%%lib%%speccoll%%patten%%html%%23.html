<P>London: Printed by J. G. for Nath. Brook, 1656. "Perspicillum microcosmologicum,
or A prospective for the discovery of the lesser world." (p. [125]-175)
has a special t.p. and running title: <I>A Discovery of the Lesser World</I>.
Pt. [1] has running title: <I>An Introduction to the Knowledge of Plants</I>.
ASU copy matches the first edition, second issue, except that the a gathering
is inserted between A<SUP>8</SUP> and B<SUP>1</SUP>. Cf. Hunt 266. References:
Hunt 266; Wing C5089. Simpling teaches the "knowledge of all Druggs and
Physicall Ingredients, but especially of Plants, their Divisions, Definitions,
Differences, Descriptions, Places, Names, Times, Vertues, Uses, Temperatures,
&amp; Signatures."
<P>Coles begins with a brief history of his subject, detailing its importance
since ancient times, and then discusses the topic in depth. He covers such
issues as the sub-division of herbs, juices of plants, differences of roots,
leaves, stalks, flowers, and seeds, and the various uses of these plants.
<I>A Discovery of the Lesser World</I> gives a theological, philosophical,
and anatomical description of man. It describes the soul as having three
parts: Vegetative, which is responsible for nourishment, growth, and procreation;
Sensitive, which deals with both internal and external senses; and the
Rational soul, which encompasses both understanding and the will.
