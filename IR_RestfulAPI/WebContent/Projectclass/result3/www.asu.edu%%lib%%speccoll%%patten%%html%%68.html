<P>This first edition of a popular work on florist's flowers, contains
6 engraved plates at the end.&nbsp; According to the preface, Maddock wrote
this book "at the particular request of many respectable Florists, who
have sufered repeated losses, and have been discouraged in their favourite
pursuit of cultivating the finer flowers; as well as of others, who have
been deterred from
<BR>entering with spirit into this most rational and pleasing amusement,
for want of a suitable guide, or director, to instruct them in the rudiments
of the art."&nbsp; The finer flowers which the author discusses include
the Hyacinth, the Tulip, the Ranunculus, the Anemone, the Auricula, the
Carnation, the Pink, and the Polyanthus.&nbsp; Maddox begins with an introduction
giving background information and definitions of botanical terms.&nbsp;
This is followed by a section on each of the finer flowers.&nbsp; The next
section is a supplementary dissertation on soils and manures.&nbsp; The
work then concludes with 6 plates with explanations.
