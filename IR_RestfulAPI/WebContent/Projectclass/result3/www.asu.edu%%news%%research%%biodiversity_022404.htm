      <h2><strong>Biodiversity research helps countries find solutions to environmental, economic challenges </strong></h2>
      <p>David Pearson, an ASU research professor in the School of Life Sciences, has brought together government officials, educators and environmentalists in several Latin American countries to participate in workshops that bring biodiversity to the forefront of their country's economic and environmental focus. </p>
      <p>Biodiversity is all the life around us, and even though the emphasis is different for every country, Pearson says, the concept remains the same. </p>
      <p>"To understand biodiversity, you have to see it from the big picture - the people, the culture, the resources and their knowledge," he says. "Recognizing this, you then seek out the best, most efficient ways of using available resources to augment your community's current and future economic and environmental state." </p>
      <p>Pearson, currently teaching BIO 100 at ASU, also works with students from participating countries and mediates debates and small group discussions during workshops. Topics focus on biology, sociology and economics, and for students Pearson says, "The sessions allow the students to speak openly and offer an opportunity for them to learn from and teach each other." </p>
      <p>Last year, Pearson presented seven biodiversity workshops in Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and at three universities in Brazil. He says many questions are asked, but the most essential question is hardly thrown into the discussion by many of the adult participants. </p>
      <p>"'Why' is the most important question to be asked and that's not always an obvious thing for many people," he says. "Knowing 'why' something happens is the key to meeting any challenge, because you go to the source of the problem instead of putting a band-aid on it, by answering 'how' to fix it. It's a learning process for everyone involved, including myself." </p>
      <p>The exchange of ideas doesn't stop once the five-day workshop ends. A Web site (http://www.ibiologia.unam.mx/~jcmr/ibunam2/posgrado/cursos.htm) was developed to continue the communication and exchange of ideas among international colleagues through el Instituto de Biologia de UNAM Posgrado. </p>
      <p>The Web site, written mostly in Spanish, provides an e-mail contact list for the more than 200 participants from Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and Peru. Pearson says, "It has allowed for the continuation and expansion of projects involving biodiversity." </p>
      <p>One of these participants is Jon Paul Rodr&iacute;guez, a researcher with the Ecology Center of the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Investigation (Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cient&iacute;ficas or IVIC). </p>
      <p>Rodriguez coordinated the workshop Pearson taught at IVIC in August 2003. There were 24 participants from academia (undergraduate and graduate students), governmental organizations and government agencies. </p>
      <p>"During their formal training, students are often taught how to complete exams, write essays, or fulfill the contents of lesson plans, but rarely taught how to really think," he says. "This is what distinguishes a successful, innovative scientist from professionals that apply scientific principles without significantly advancing the frontiers of science. Due to his vast professional experience, first-hand knowledge on the study of tropical biodiversity, and willingness to listen and moderate discussions without imposing his point of view, David is an ideal instructor for this kind of course." </p>
      <p>Rodriguez says Venezuela's conservation efforts have been challenging and says the biodiversity workshops have helped bring experts together who have shared information that has been beneficial. </p>
      <p>"The main limiting resource is well-trained, updated personnel," Rodriguez says. "These workshops help create a critical mass of professionals dedicated to biodiversity research and management. David's workshop last year allowed me to meet the next generation of students and young professionals with interest in biodiversity conservation. Since IVIC is the only institution in Venezuela that offers graduate training in conservation biology, knowing who is out there is key. Contacts made during the course have already resulted in the establishment of joint projects and/or information exchanges." </p>
      <p>Even though biodiversity has an important effect on the way people live, not many people are aware of it and don't often support continuing education and workshop projects, such as these. Pearson hopes more people will make the effort to become aware of biodiversity and spread the word about its importance in every society. </p>
      <p>"You have to help them prepare for their own future," Pearson says. "There really isn't anyone to fund this type of environmental education because it's not as obviously technical as other research projects. Even so, biodiversity affects everyone, everywhere." </p>
      <p>Pearson has five biodiversity workshops scheduled for fall semester in Paraguay, Peru, Panama, Ecuador and Brazil. For now, Pearson is working on his latest book, "Field Guide to the Tiger Beetles of North America," which will be published in Canada and the United States by the end of the year. He says, "This book also incorporates the use of biodiversity in North America. You can't escape it (biodiversity)." </p>
