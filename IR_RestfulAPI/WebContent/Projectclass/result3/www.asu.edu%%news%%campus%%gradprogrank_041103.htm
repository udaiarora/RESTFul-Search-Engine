      <h2>ASU graduate programs earn place among nation's best</h2>
      <p>The master of fine arts program at the School of Art in ASU's Katherine
        K. Herberger College of Fine Arts catapulted to 13th place in the recently
        released U.S. News &amp; World Report "America's Best Graduate Schools
        2004" list. The program, which ranked at 45th when last reviewed by the
        magazine in 1997, was among several ASU graduate programs listed among
        the top programs in the nation.</p>
      <p>The MFA program ranked eighth among public
          institutions nationally. The magazine evaluated 213 visual arts programs.</p>
      <p>Three of the school's specialty
          programs also received individual recognition. The School of Art's
        photography program ranked fifth overall and second
          among public institutions; printmaking ranked third; and ceramics ranked
          14th overall and 11th among public institutions.</p>
      <p>"This is a reflection
          of our accomplished faculty and outstanding programs in these areas
        and the college's momentum in recent years," said J. Robert
          Wills, dean of the Herberger College of Fine Arts. "These rankings
        will further distinguish the Herberger College as one of the nation's
        leading
          centers for the study, practice and development of the arts."</p>
      <p>Visual arts
          was the only fine arts area evaluated by the magazine this year. Still
          in effect are the School of Music's ranking as 19th nationwide
          and the theater department's ranking as 35th, with playwriting recognized
          as 20th.</p>
      <p>U.S. News &amp; World Report's national rankings of graduate
        programs in education, once again listed ASU's College of Education among
        the
        top ranked programs in the nation.</p>
      <p>ASU's College of Education is ranked
          as the 9th best public graduate college of education in the nation,
        and the 16th best overall among public
          and private institutions offering graduate degrees in education.</p>
      <p>The college
        was also recognized this year for having top 20 graduate programs in
        the following specialty areas: Counseling Psychology, ranked
        15th; Educational Psychology, ranked 15th; Education Policy, ranked 15th;
        Curriculum &amp; Instruction, ranked 16th; and Higher Education Administration,
        ranked 18th. </p>
      <p>"These rankings are a testament to the vision the College
          of Education has, that our reputation will be based on studying the
        problems of education
          as we attempt to solve them - the Pasteur Principle," said Jim Middleton,
          associate dean for research with the College of Education. "In other
          words, being part of the solution is a legitimate academic enterprise,
          and ASU is at the forefront of socially responsible academic research
          - a model for the nation."</p>
      <p>For the third consecutive time, ASU's College
          of Nursing ranked as one of America's best graduate schools. The 2004
          guide ranks the College
          of Nursing 39th in the nation. </p>
      <p>Rankings are based on surveys from deans,
          faculty and administrators of the nation's accredited schools of nursing
          with graduate programs. </p>
      <p>"I am especially proud of our national ranking," said Barbara Durand,
          dean and professor in the College of Nursing. "It is a notable achievement,
          given the diminished resources for higher education in Arizona and
        the number of highly endowed private schools of nursing among the competition.
          It is also gratifying that our score increased from the last ranking
        period in 2000."</p>
      <p>The ASU College of Nursing is the largest educator of
          nurses with Bachelor of Science in nursing degrees, Master of Science
          degrees and advanced
          nurse practitioner certifications in the state. The college is also
        home to the American Museum of Nursing. </p>
      <p>The U.S. News &amp; World Report survey
        of full-time MBA programs ranks the W. P. Carey MBA supply chain management
        specialization 5th in the
        nation, and two others are top 25 - accounting at 15th and information
        systems at 17th. The W. P. Carey MBA - Evening Program was listed at
      22nd in the nation.</p>
      <p>"This is the first time that 'U. S. News' has ranked
          the supply chain management field, and we see it as recognition of
        the critical importance
          of this field to global businesses," said Joseph Carter, chairman of
        the supply chain management department.</p>
      <p>The W. P. Carey course of study
          follows Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Sloan), Michigan State
          University, University of Pennsylvania (Wharton),
        and Stanford University in the survey.</p>
      <p>"The W. P. Carey School has dedicated
          24 full-time faculty to teaching and research in the area of supply
        chain management - an unusual concentration
          of expertise," Carter said. "Our goal is to be ranked first in this
        category - we are well on our way to realizing this accomplishment."</p>
      <p>Ranked overall,
          the W. P. Carey MBA is 17th among the master of business administration
          programs offered at public universities, and 37th among
        365 graduate business programs accredited by the AACSB - International.</p>
      <p>"Since
          this survey data was collected last October, the quality of business
          education at Arizona State University has been validated by a $50 million
          gift endowing the W. P. Carey School of Business," said Dennis Hoffman,
          associate dean of graduate programs. "This vote of confidence allows
        us to further improve our program.</p>
      <p>Specialization in fields like supply
          chain management will continue to be the essential ingredients of the
        W. P. Carey MBA."</p>
      <p>The U.S. News &amp; World Report survey "America's Best
        Graduate Schools 2004" ranks ASU's College of Engineering and Applied
        Sciences among the
        top engineering schools in the nation. This year the college came in
      at 56th out of 185 colleges surveyed.</p>
      <p>"This is a very competitive assessment,
          and we improved our results in several categories, notably in research
          expenditures," said Peter Crouch,
          dean of the college. "We are especially pleased that the ranking of
        our programs by experts, the deans of other colleges and recruiters,
        is so
          strong. We are continuing to progress toward our goal to reach the
        Top 25."<br>
