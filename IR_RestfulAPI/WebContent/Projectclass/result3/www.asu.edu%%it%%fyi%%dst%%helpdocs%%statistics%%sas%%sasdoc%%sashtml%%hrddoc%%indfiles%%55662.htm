Learn day-by-day and have fun doing it! This perpetual calendar will       carry you through the year with a tip every day, some providing useful
SAS System information and some just helpful advice on planning your       time and using your skills to their best advantage. SAS users at all
levels will benefit from the tips included in this calendar; tips cover    such areas as inputting data, debugging, using functions and formats,
making the most of the SAS display manager, finding SAS information on     the web, ordering SAS documentation, and keeping up with SUGI and the
regional conferences. Use it as a reference tool with the help of its      extensive index, or just take it a day at a time. The calendar stands on
your desk, pages flip easily because of colorful spiral binding, and       Oscar, the cartoon character, illustrates the tips with humor that will
keep you smiling.
