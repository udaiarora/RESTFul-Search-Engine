          <h2>Grants fuel engineering distance learning initiative</h2>
          <p> Online courses and programs have created an enrollment boom at universities. But for online offerings in engineering, duplicating the hands-on tinkering and experimentation so vital to learning in the lab hasn&rsquo;t experienced the same rate of growth. </p>
          <p> To address this discrepancy, electrical engineering professor Andreas Spanias has spearheaded efforts to develop a multi-disciplinary distance learning initiative at the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering. The initiative is designed to attract and train the next generation of signal processing engineers. </p>
          <p> Spanias just received two new grants totaling $700,000 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to continue ASU&rsquo;s efforts as a leading university in the creation of innovative Java technology to educate engineering students in emerging digital signal processing techniques. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;We will be the lead university in a team with four other universities to disseminate this technology,&rdquo; Spanias says. </p>
          <p> The first grant will support a combined research and curriculum project that uses the software to introduce undergraduates to signal processing and communications research. The other grant is a collaborative endeavor with four other universities: the University of Texas at Dallas, the University of Central Florida , the University of Rhode Island and the University of Washington. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;ASU will create new software for distributed collaborative laboratory activities, and these universities will act as test sites,&rdquo; Spanias says. &ldquo;About 25 other universities, including MIT and the University of Michigan , obtained copies of the software from us to set up mirror Web sites.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> The grants have further raised the profile of Spanias&rsquo; research team efforts. In 2003, his Java-based digital signal processing software package (J-DSP) garnered national recognition from the National Engineering Education Delivery System (NEEDS), which ranked J-DSP as one of the top three educational resources of 2003. Because the J-DSP program was chosen as one of the best, the software also has been distributed to deans and chairs of engineering colleges across the country. </p>
          <p> Basic DSP design touches every technology that graces today&rsquo;s market, from fashionable MP3 players to cell phones crammed with the latest video and Internet communication features. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;This software was built from the ground up for education and research,&rdquo; Spanias says. &ldquo;The original idea was to develop a technology that will enable distance learners to perform computer laboratories over the Internet.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Using the software, students can manipulate the basic building blocks of DSP design &ndash; which, in addition to cell phones, are vital components in music synthesizers, and the booming MP3 player market. MP3 (MPEG1-Layer 3) is the core compression algorithm at the heart of every MP3 player that drastically reduces the audio file size while preserving a high-quality listening experience for the user. </p>
          <p> It took Spanias&rsquo; group a year &ndash; and about 30,000 lines of Java code &ndash; to create simulation models for MP3 that enable undergraduates to experiment with complex algorithms that include filter banks, linear prediction, multiresolution transforms, psychoacoustic models, vector quantizers and huffman codes. </p>
          <p> These methods previously were taught individually in different courses and contexts, and they sometimes were difficult for students to grasp. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;But now, when presented jointly in the context of MP3 and with the aid of J-DSP, they intrigue them,&rdquo; Spanias says. &ldquo;That is how one of my former students got involved in the area and after graduation became a key member of the team that developed the compression software for the (Apple) iPod.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> In addition to MP3, wireless applications such as cell phones are the single biggest unit of the consumer electronics industry, with more than 500 million units sold every year and consumers showing an unquenchable thirst for smaller, more powerful devices demonstrating the need for more research to support these real-life applications. </p>
          <p> By creating such widespread and useful software to teach students the inner workings behind the technology, Spanias intends to help meet the needs of this market by providing the research technology and engineering intellectual talent necessary for success. </p>
