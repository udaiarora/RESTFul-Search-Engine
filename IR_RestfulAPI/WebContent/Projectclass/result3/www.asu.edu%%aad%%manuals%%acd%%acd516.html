The fact that an individual is a permanent resident and not a citizen of the U.S. cannot be considered in making a hiring decision.  Courts have also determined that individuals who hold temporary permanent resident status or other legal status that will soon be converted to permanent resident status may also not be discriminated against in hiring decisions.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Proof of Authorization to Work</b></font><p>All alien nonstudents are required to show proof of authorization to work in the U.S. within three working days after the hire date.  In the event an <a href="acd002.html#employees" target="New">employee</a> is unable to provide evidence of employment eligibility within the time limits required by law, the employee will not be continued. Employees will be required to submit evidence that expiration dates have been extended or that the employees are otherwise eligible to continue employment during the course of their employment.<p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>Employees who are not eligible to continue employment will be terminated.</td></tr></table><p>Further information on the employment of alien nonstudents may be obtained through the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University.<p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>For related information on employment of alien students, see:<p><ol><li><a href="acd517-02.html">ACD 517&#150;02</a>, &#147;Employment of Nonimmigrant International Students&#148;</li><p>and<p><li>the <i>University Student Initiatives Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i><a href="../usi/usi304-08.html" target="NEW">USI 304&#150;08</a>, &#147;Employment of Nonimmigrant International Students.&#148;</li></ol><p>&#160;<p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
