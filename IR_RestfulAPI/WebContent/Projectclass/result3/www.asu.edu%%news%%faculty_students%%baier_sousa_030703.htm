      <h2>Colleges of Law, Nursing add to leadership teams</h2>
      <p>The ASU colleges of Law and Nursing have named Christopher Baier and
        Karen Sousa to their leadership teams, as assistant and associate dean,
        respectively.</p>
      <p>Baier, deputy director of the Arizona Department of Commerce,
          has been named assistant dean for institutional operations at the ASU
          College
          of Law.</p>
      <p>Sousa has been appointed as interim associate dean for Graduate
        Programs &amp; Research
        in the College of Nursing. Sousa replaces Pamela Kidd who passed away
        last December. </p>
      <p>Baier has been deputy director of the commerce department
          since January 2001. He was responsible for directing, managing, and
        leading an agency
          of more than 100 employees in such diverse programs as Business Development,
          Small Business Assistance, Community Development and Planning, Economic
          Policy and Research, Workforce Development and Energy.</p>
      <p>Previously Baier
          served as assistant deputy director for administration and director
        of sports development at the department. At the College
          of Law, Baier will assume the duties generally assigned to a chief
        financial officer of a corporation.</p>
      <p>College of Law Dean Patricia White said, "Chris
          will be an enormous addition to the law school. He is a sophisticated
          financial analyst and lawyer."</p>
      <p>Baier
          received a bachelor of science degree in accounting from Villanova
        in 1986 and a juris doctor in 1992 from the University of Arizona College
          of Law, where he received the Order of the Coif. He clerked for the
        Arizona
          Supreme Court and received the fourth highest score in the state on
        the entrance examination for certified public accountants.</p>
      <p>"I am pleased to
          be part of Dean White's team and look forward to working with the faculty,
          staff and students toward continued excellence at the
        College of Law," Baier said.</p>
      <p>During her five years at the College of Nursing,
          Sousa has shown outstanding leadership and willingness to contribute
          to the mission of the college.
          Her knowledge of research is extensive and she has become a familiar
        figure to many across campus, said Dean Barbara Durand.</p>
      <p>Sousa received
          a Ph.D. from the University of California, San Francisco, in 1996,
        following an extensive career in hospital management. After
        spending two years establishing a program of research at UCSF</p>
      <p>School of
          Nursing, she accepted a position at ASU College of Nursing.<br>
        Sousa's research focuses on nursing systems and health outcomes with
          a particular interest in health-related quality of life. During her
          career, Sousa became intrigued with structural equation modeling as
          a statistical
          approach to answer challenging nursing research questions and has been
          using this approach. She has received several research grants and in
          2000 was awarded a major research grant from the National Institutes
          of Health to study health-related quality of life in arthritis and
          AIDS patients.<br>
