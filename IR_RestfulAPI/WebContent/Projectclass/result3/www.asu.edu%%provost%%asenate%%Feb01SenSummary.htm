President's Report</font></b> (Douglas Johnson).</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The legislature is once again considering the AAUPs most recent version

of the Whistleblower Bill (HB 2617). This bill would seek to take the tenure

decision out of university hands. The bill was passed by the House Retirement

Government Options Committee last Tuesday. As your Senate President, I

urge you to work to defeat this bill as it threatens the way we award tenure

at this university. The Board of Regents at their May 2 meeting intend

to pass a whistleblower policy for all three universities, which has been

drafted based on the ASU policy. I will update you as new information becomes

available, and remind you to contact your legislators through your ZSunDevil

account, to express your views on important legislative bills such as HB

2617. Again, your faculty leaders at NAU, ASU, and UofA (the Arizona Faculties

Council) are working to defeat HB 2617.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Wait, there?s more bad news. The health insurance RFP process will result

in an increase in our premiums in October. The good news is that a new

contract may give us better coverage in out of region/out of network service.

Stay tuned. Espect a significant increaase in premiums and higher copays.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

ASU Cares Project is a worthy cause for any staff member, faculty, student,

or other member of the ASU Community to participate in. The Academic Senate

Office has a dropoff box established for non-perishable goods and other

donations. As there are already sufficient volunteers, we ask that faculty

do participate by either dropping off their food donations at the Senate

Office, or by senad a check to the ASU Foundation for the St. Mary?s Food

Bank. The ASU Cares work project will be held next Saturday, March 3, from

8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the Food Bank (2831 North 31<sup>st</sup> Avenue,

near 35<sup>th</sup> and Thomas Road). The volunteers plan to paint, refurbish,

landscape the grounds and building, and sort and repack food products for

soup kitchens and shelters.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The <i>Power of Technology</i> series is continues this spring. The presentation

I attended on intellectual property was a very good one. There was another

session cancelled last week, due to lack of faculty interested in identifying

and solving problems. The next presentation is on this Thursday, and it

will cover good online pedagogy. We also plan a session with Tom Trotter

and Bill Lewis and others that will address the future visions for e-learning.

Please check the web site for the Center for Learning and Teaching Excellence

to register for these sessions.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>3.B&nbsp; University Provost?s

Report </b>(Milton Glick).</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

At the legislature, they are discussing two opposing versions of the two-year

biennial budget for the universities (the JLBC?s and the Governor?s proposals).

In both proposals, there is a salary increase of 5% beginning on January

1, 2002, and then an additional 5% beginning on January 1, 2003. Because

the revenue numbers are looking soft at this point, its is likely that

the JLBC recommendations will be trimmed back somewhat. However, at this

juncture, the JLBC is still recommending full funding for building renewal,

while the Governor?s proposal recommends renewal funding at the 50% level.

We are still fighting for some growth money for operations at East Campus.

The legislature, if they determine the revenue forecast is too uncertain,

could pass a one-year budget instead of a biennial budget. We have had

a two-year budget for awhile now, but that might change. Anything that

you can do as faculty members to influence this decision process at the

legislature, I recommend that you try to do so.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As Doug Johnson told you, the ASU Cares Project is a worthy cause, and

one way to show that we do take the health of our communities seriously.

I encourage you to participate.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

On Friday the Board of Regents will consider the universities plans for

Proposition 301 money. The funding targets particular for each of the universities

needs to be reaffirmed in this discussion. Two million dollars have been

earmarked for the establishment of an Arizona Regents University (ARU).

We want the ARU to become a mechanism for online learning, but not become

a separate degree granting university. It looks like the Regents will agree

with us. The idea of the A.R.U. is that the student has a home campus,

but also may take any online course that the three campuses offer. They

plan online advising for courses, articulation between the campuses, and

even an online payment system. They want to develop a seamless admission

process. They do not plan to offer degrees, have a separate faculty, or

separate student services.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In ten years, it is expected that there will be many education consortiums

in the higher education market. The ARU is an experiment in this type of

e-learning delivery. The want to be able to market courses at ASU, NAU,

and UofA, for our students, any time and anywhere. We will continue to

offer distance learning at ASU, and we will continue to emphasize the importance

of the campus experience, and how that adds value to a student?s education.

We wish to add value to society overall by increasing the cultural and

social growth of all our students that come to ASU.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Questions from the Senate:</font></b>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Senator Yao: Why in the pursuit of online courses and the new Arizona Regents

University, does the university not take greater interest in the condition

of some of its classroom buildings, which are deterioriating.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Provost Glick: That is a good question. The legislature in recent years

has not allocated sufficient money to refurbish classrooms or do maintenance

work. We have a five-year classroom mediation plan that will depend upon

the level of building renewal funding allocated this year by the legislature.

We plan to use that money to fix the most pressing problems in the classrooms,

and to update the mediation/technology in others.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This year we have an ongoing dialogue with our student leaders in the state

about whether students could tolerate a higher tuition rate increase, if

they had input into how their tuition dollars would be spent. The students

will agree to raise tuition if 1) they have increased access to technology

and 2) the classrooms are better maintained.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Senator Yao: I want to say that since the mediated classrooms will be updated,

may I suggest that to save time and effort, each instructor should have

a Notebook computer so that they could come to class and connect to a projection

system.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Provost Glick: The Classroom Committee 2001 is looking at what is acceptable

mediation in the classroom. At NAU, there is a proposal backed by the deans

to have students come to the university with computers. Our Deans Council

is discussing the same issue but they don?t agree yet. The cost of equipment

and training to insure student access to technology is a big part of that

decision.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Senate President Johnson: There is a full cluster of issues being worked

on by the Regents concerning the Arizona Regents University, related to

distance learning. A great deal of technology is needed to enhance e-learning

for our students in the classroom setting. The <i>Power of Technology Series</i>

will have a Future Visions session, including ARU, on March 23<sup>rd</sup>.

There are other problems to consider, such as articulation between campuses

and the acceptance of credit for courses from other institutions.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For example, there are issues in exam administration to insure that a person

attending the class or taking an exam is in fact the person who is registered

for the class. These are issues of academic integrity that the Senate Student-Faculty

Policy Commttee and the University Affairs Committee will be discussing

this spring. If you have interest or suggestions on any of these issues,

please email them to me, and let me know if you want to participate in

committee discussions.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>3.C&nbsp; ASASU President's Report</b>

(Alex Bainbridge). Alex had to be at the legislature this afternoon and

he sends his apology.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>3.D&nbsp; Past President?s Report</b>

(David Burstein).</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I see that many of you here today attended the annual Statehood Picnic

at the Capital on President's?Day. It was in fact the best event we have

had over the years. Even the Governor was in an ASU Moon buggy traveling

around to greet everyone and wearing SunDevil horns. Our entire faculty,

students, alumni, staff, and administrators, had a good opportunity to

meet and talk with the legislators. We were able to get to know one another

better, and also to make our case clear to the legislators that the AAUP

does not represent the entire faculty at the campuses. We, your elected

representatives, your Senate Presidents, and Senate President-elects and

Past Presidents (members of the Arizona Faculties Council) do represent

the faculty of the three universities in all matters politic.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Our own General Studies program at ASU has worked with the issue of quality

control for the past 12 years. Now, the university and the regents plan

an online marketing structure (the Arizona Regents University) that will

emphasize choosing ASU over, say for instance, the University of California.

We will be working to establish agreement on quality control for online

delivery of courses by faculty at ASU, NAU, and Uof A, through the Arizona

Regents University. The trend has already been established that the Regents

intend to appoint more work groups and joint university committees, to

work on issues of importance for the state and its universities. The ARU

will require a lot of faculty involvement.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Senator Cobas: I would like to comment on the legislative picnic, that

we need to do more pairing of legislators with faculty and other individuals

who live in their district. It appeared to me that several important people

were often sitting together at the same table.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

David Burstein: Attendance was high. There were 50-60 legislators present

and 600 other visitors. It?s true that people did end up sitting where

they wanted, although we did try to seat them strategically by district.

I just want to congratulate those of you who did attend the picnic. That

was a major accomplishment just to be there.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I recommend that senators continue their outreach to legislators by using

their zSunDevils.com email address. If you participate, please remember

to thank our legislators for what they have already done for the universities,

and communicate your ideas. There is still time to influence the state

government budget process.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Doug Johnson: I just want to reinforce what David said, next year, we plan

for an even better outreach that will engage more faculty. My only disappointment

about the picnic this year was that they did not give out free sunscreen

samples! But importance of faculty thanking legislators for their support

cannot be emphasized enough. They may give us what we want or they may

not be able to, but they will listen to our words better if there is some

encouragement and thanks for their efforts.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>3.E&nbsp; ASU West Senate Report</b>

(Vince Waldron).</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

West will have to update us next time. There were several conflicting meetings

today. Jane, Afsaneh, and Vince send apologies.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>3.F&nbsp; ASU East Senate Report</b>

(Andy Jackson).</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We had our Assembly meeting last Thursday. We were updated on the status

of legislative processes. We continued our Learner Centered Education dialogue

and discussed the integrated technology that will be required by the establishment

of an Arizona Regents University.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I have a suggestion to pass along to the Doug regarding any future sessions

of the <i>Power of</i> <i>Technology</i> series, and that is that they

should capture each session on video for viewing, in another time frame.

There are off campus audiences that should hear these presentations. We

are very interested in the discussion of intellectual property issues as

they relate to the integration of technology at our campus. We also want

to make sure that East Campus participates with Main Campus Committee on

Committees nominating process, to appoint faculty for service on university

committees and boards. Ernie Hirata from East is participating on the CoC

as an ex-officio member this year.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>3.G&nbsp; Annual Report/Faculty

Athletic Representative</b> (Jerry Kingston).</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Normally this report is given in December to the Senate, but there were

unavoidable delays this time.&nbsp;&nbsp; (If you are a senator and were

not able to be present at this meeting, a handout was distributed and may

be obtained by contacting <font size=+0><u><font color="#0000FF">jerry.kingston@asu.edu</font></u>

.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I want to begin by pointing out the statistics in the reported summary

are 4-year average values, and only incoming freshmen on athletic scholarship

were included. The data does not include those students who transferred

into ASU.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Overall we are improving every year. The numbers continue to look better.

We feel this is in major part due to the ICA on recruiting efforts and

on the Board of Regents higher entrance standards. The GPA for all sports,

for men and women is higher (M 3.06 and W 3.47). The graduation rate has

remained about the same (M 40% and W 65% which can be compared to 47% for

all students), and should be improved. The Mean SAT Scores are higher for

students upon entry (M 0989 and W 1022 and for all students 1089).</font></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There is still a problem with graduation rates evident in the sports of

men?s baseball and football. One of the possible explanations is that students

transfer due to a "lack of playing time," rather than finishing their degrees

here. Professional baseball drafting opportunities in the junior year also

takes a toll.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Second cycle of the NCAA accreditation review at ASU is underway, and

there is progress to report. Last year, a group led by Milt Sommerfeld

(including 25 faculty and administrators) completed their campus review

for the NCAA accreditation process. Following the submission of their report,

the University then received a response in December from the NCAA, and

we were asked to provide additional information relating to gender equity

issues. We now have one year to prepare our response.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Our new athletic director, Gene Smith, is doing an excellent job and is

very involved in discussions about the academic performance of his student

athletes. He is bringing in all the coaches and meeting with them sport

by sport. He is trying to design and add additional academic services that

will strengthen academic performance and track student academic progress

as they move toward degree completion.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So I am pleased to report that there is some improvement in academic preparation,

performance and graduation rates for ASU student athletes. This is encouraging.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+0><b>3.H&nbsp; Dean of

ASU Libraries</b> (Sherrie Schmidt), "Serial Reductions."</font></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Be ready for a bit of bad news. Serials will continue to rise in cost,

and there is no increase in the funding for the purchase of publications

from the legislature. In fact, over the last ten years, the state operating

budget line item for libraries has been increased (8.3%) only once, by

allocations received from the legislature. During this period, we have

been able to increase searl spending by internal reallocation by the Provost

Office. The bad news is that the cost of serials has gone up 200%. This

past year, as many of you have noticed, we had to cancel over 120 subscriptions

to journals and other serial publications. Much of this price increase

in serials is due to the market power of a well-known foreign commercial

publisher, who provides most serious science journals. There are several

initiatives underway both at the university level and the national level,

to combat this serious threat to the library serials. A gathering of library

deans throughout the Pac10, who call their organinzation informally the

Big 12 Plus, have already had a conference at ASU this year to discuss,

among other things, guidelines for electronic publication. They developed

a set of guidelines last year at their conference, dubbed the "Tempe Principles"

because they held their meeting in Tempe. It may become necessary in the

future to encourage our faculty to do more and more electronic publication,

and to request that faculty refuse to publish, refuse to edit or review

work online, for pirate-like for-profit publishers who require them to

surrender their copyright privileges. As Senator Gooding of Economics so

aptly put it to me, Sherrie, the supply side has power to limit supply,

and there is inelastic demand! (much laughter here).</font></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The library is looking at many efficiency measures, to format and to add

value to our purchased information resources. The volume of materials is

also more complex in an information age.</font></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As a direct result of input received on our library survey last spring,

we have relocated our reference area in our libraries. We are studying

new ways to protect and archive resources online. As one senator suggested,

we are in the process of studying Library budgetary needs, hoping to profit

in the new economy, and working to build future collections. We need your

cooperation in trying to stem the flow of rising costs for our most serious

set of resouces, our published journals and subscriptions.</font></font>

Senate Motion #9:</b> A</font> request from the College of Business to

change the name of a degree program from: MS in Information Management

to: MS in E-Business and Information Systems (Motion w/rationale was distributed

and is available from the Academic Senate Office 5-9245).</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>

Senate Motion #10:</b> a request from the College of Fine Arts for the

disestablishment of a Degree Program: BFA Theatre (Motion with rationale

was distributed and is available from the Academic Senate Office 5-9245).

Regarding Senate Motion #10, the CAPC committee recommends a change in

the wording of the rationale as follows: "Previously, the request to disestablish

the Theatre Education concentration was approved. As a follow-up, it is

now requested that the BFA degree in the Theatre Department be eliminated,

as well. The Theatre department no longer will have any BFA degree or concentration."&nbsp;&nbsp;

The motion and revised rationale will be redistributed again at the April

2 Senate meeting.</font>

a lot of volunteers, we are told that faculty can donate non-perishable
