      <h2>Arizona Board of Regents approves new departments: W. P. Carey School
        of Business announces faculty leadership</h2>
      <p>  The Arizona Board of Regents today approved the establishment of the department
    of information systems at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State
    University. The board also approved a new name for the accounting program's
    home - the school of accountancy. Both of these actions will enable the school
    to strengthen its national leadership in the two fields.</p>
      <p>Dr. James Boatsman,
      the KPMG Professor of Accountancy, is the new director of the school of
        accountancy. Dr. Robert St. Louis chairs the department of
    information systems.</p>
      <p>"Since the early 1990s, the W. P. Carey School has been
    among the leaders in its emphasis on and integration of information systems
    into its accountancy
    and business programs " said Dean Larry E. Penley. "Today's decision to create
    a stand alone information systems department positions the school well for
    the anticipated recovery and ever-growing integration of information systems
    into management. This move also reflects the long time commitment to nationally
    ranked undergraduate and graduate accounting and tax programs."</p>
      <p>The disciplines
    of information systems and accountancy had been joined as the School of Accountancy
    and Information Management since 1996. Under the leadership
    of Professor Philip Reckers, the school grew in quality and reputation to
        become one of the leading programs in the country. The W. P. Carey MBA/Master
        of Science
    in Information Management was ranked 10th in the nation among information
        systems programs, and the graduate accounting program was listed 15th
        according to
    the latest US News &amp; World Report survey of 352 graduate management programs
    accredited by AACSB International. </p>
      <p>After soliciting input from its professional
    advisory board, the faculty of the school of accounting and information management
    pursued the reorganization
    in order to build from the strong foundation already established in both
        areas. This enables both units to focus more strongly on core competencies
        while continuing
    to infuse information technology throughout the W. P. Carey School.</p>
      <p>"Since the
    merger seven years ago, the information systems department has grown both
        in numbers of faculty and in quantity of research. With the energy originating
    in the Center for Advancing Business through Information Technology, these
    thinkers are among the leading innovators in the field nationally," Penley
    added.</p>
      <p>"Accountancy, which has been one of the foundations of excellence throughout
    our history, continues to anchor the W. P. Carey School. Accounting faculty
    members are respected for their research and for their leadership in professional
    policy formation, and our graduates are in key positions at the top firms."<br>
    <br>
    <font size="1">W. P. CAREY SCHOOL OF BUSINESS</font></p>
      <p><font size="1">The W. P. Carey School of Business provides quality undergraduate,
          masters and doctoral programs that draw upon a dynamic learning environment
          to
        prepare students at all levels for the future. Internationally recognized
        faculty enrich the curriculum with their latest research findings, and
        deliver this knowledge in a technology-rich environment. Ranked 25th
        in the nation by U.S. News &amp; World Report, the undergraduate program
        offers the Business Honors program to some of the best students at the
        university. The MBA, ranked 17th in the nation among public programs,
        combines business fundamentals with marketplace issues and trends, giving
        graduates the knowledge and experience to excel in a global economy.
        W. P. Carey School of Business alumni are lifelong learners connected
        to the school and each other through an active alumni community and executive
        education opportunities. <br>
