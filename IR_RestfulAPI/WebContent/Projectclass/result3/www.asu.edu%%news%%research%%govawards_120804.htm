      <h2>Governor&rsquo;s awards single out ASU innovators </a></h2>
      <p> The 2004 Governor&rsquo;s Celebration of Innovation Awards highlighted ASU researchers as some of the top innovators in the state. </p>
      <p> ASU&rsquo;s Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing (CUbiC) was named Innovator of the Year for Academia for its iCARE research project. The iCARE team received the award over two other finalists, both projects in the Biodesign Institute at ASU. </p>
      <p> The annual awards event is presented by the Arizona Technology Council, the Arizona Commerce Department, the High Technology Industry Cluster and the Southern Arizona Tech Council. More than 1,100 people attended the second annual event, which was held at the Arizona Biltmore on Nov. 18. The awards pay homage to companies, scholars, legislators and others with technological and business achievements. </p>
      <p> The ASU winners spanned several award categories in community service, academic innovation and entrepreneurship. </p>
      <p> Among them, Ira A. Fulton was named the William F. McWhorter Community Service Leader of the Year. The award is presented to an individual who contributes to Arizona &rsquo;s technology industry through community involvement, leadership and excellence in economic development activity. </p>
      <p> Fulton, the chief executive officer of Fulton Homes, was nominated for the award for his contributions to the technology development of the state, plus his dedication to investing in people and education. In the past year, Fulton has donated close to $60 million to ASU to invest in the schools of engineering, education and other university research efforts. </p>
      <p> CUbiC&rsquo;s flagship project is iCARE, which is developing several projects to help people who are visually impaired recognize text, people and environments. Sethuraman (Panch) Panchanathan, director of CUbiC and chairman of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, accepted the award on behalf of the iCARE research team. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;It is gratifying to see all the hard work and dedication of the students, researchers and participants who are blind being recognized in this manner,&rdquo; Panchanathan says. </p>
      <p> CUbiC is a research center within the Institute for Computing and Information Sciences and Engineering (InCISE), a collaboration of interdisciplinary research groups at ASU that share expertise in computing and informatics. The mission of CUbiC is to design and develop perceptive computers that are environmentally aware to serve people&rsquo;s needs and enrich their lives. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;CUbiC is one of the best examples of our ASU design principles,&rdquo; says ASU President Michael Crow. &ldquo;It is research that is linked to the people and their needs that fuses our intellectual cultures together in new ways that gives us a chance for unanticipated breakthroughs. This is ASU at its finest.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> The research challenges of the iCARE project were derived based on input from focus groups of individuals who are blind or visually impaired, and from researchers involved in disability studies. </p>
      <p> The Innovator of the Year in Academia award was a new category this year, presented to a department or office within a higher education institution that has achieved scientific achievement and success through research and development. ASU dominated this academic innovation category, as all three nominees were from the university. The other two finalists were the Center for Applied NanoBioscience, and the Center for Single Molecule Biophysics &ndash; both are from the Biodesign Institute at ASU. </p>
      <p> The Center for Applied Nanobioscience, led by Frederic Zenhausern, studies applications that provide a critical link between basic nano/biosciences and engineering research, improving the monitoring of health and the treatment of many diseases. </p>
      <p> The Center for Single Molecule Biophysics, led by Stuart Lindsay, centers its research on understanding some of the physical processes on which life is based using the simplest model systems, either a single molecule or a small number of interacting molecules. </p>
      <p> ASU researchers also played a role in the top Innovative Start-Up Company of the Year award, which was given to Kinetic Muscles Inc. (KMI). Tom Sugar, from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Jiping He from the Harrington Department of Bioengineering and Don Herring from the School of Design are co-collaborators on a National Institute of Health (NIH) grant in conjunction with Good Samaritan Hospital, KMI and ASU. </p>
