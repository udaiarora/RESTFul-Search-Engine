  In response to faculty requests, and in order to support numerous classes being
  taught at ASU, the Center has much new material in its collections. Some are
  gifts or are tucked away in manuscript collections, while other material is
  purchased with the generous endowment from the Labriola family. <p>
  In addition, we will announce a web site or two, and a collection in a California
  repository to which we can order copies on customer demand!<p>
  Research papers require primary resources and the Center has concentrated much
  of its collection activity in that area. <p>
  Some examples are: dissertations; oral histories; microfilm collections from
  the National Archives and elsewhere; published autobiographies; transcriptions
  of interviews; photographs; some rare books; and more.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000040" size="+1"><a name="DISSERTATIONS">Dissertations</a></font><br>
          In addition to dissertations published by ASU graduates, the Center
              purchases every dissertation dealing with a Native topic, which
              was produced during
        the previous year. A great help in this endeavor, is the Western Historical
        Quarterly, published for the Western History Association. Each year,
              it lists dissertations awarded by other institutions. Here are
              a few examples from
        our 2002 list of purchases:</p>

      <p><font color="#000080" size="+2"><a name="LAKE">Lake Mohonk Conferences</a></font><br>
  The Lake Mohonk Conference of Friends of the Indian, was held annually between
    1883 and 1916, to express the concern many felt about the condition and treatment
    of our aboriginal people by invading Euro-American culture. In 1929, after
    13 years of inactivity, a 35th conference was called to discuss many of the
    same topics as before: education; health care; job training, missionary activity,
    law and order on the reservation; and assimilation into American society.
    Eleven days after the adjournment of the 1929 conference, the stock market
    crash ushered in the Great Depression. The conference was not revived.<p>
  One hundred years from the first meeting, a conference on &#8220;Reform and
  the American Indians,&#8221; was called to celebrate the Mohonk Centennial
  on October 30, 1983. The conference was held in the now historic Mohonk Mountain
  House, at New Paltz, New York.<p>
  The Mohonk Mountain House began in 1869 when Albert and Alfred Smiley, twin
  brothers and Quaker school teachers purchased a 10-room tavern on land in the
  beautiful Shawangunk Mountains and converted the building to accommodate guests.
  Within a year, some 30 rooms were added and as the brothers&#8217; resort gained
  in popularity, many more changes were made. By 1983, the old Victorian house
  had become a rambling building an eighth of a mile long and capable of housing
  500 guests.<p>
  The Labriola Center is pleased to announce that it has received all but two
  volumes of the Annual Report from each Lake Mohonk Conferences beginning with
  1883. A gift of Regents&#8217; Professor Peter Iverson, the books are being
  cataloged and will soon be available for research.</p>

        The Center holds a number of collections of interviews and oral histories,
          with guides to each. Some are:              <blockquote>
        <p>
          <font color="#004080" size="+1">The American Indian Oral History Collection</font> contains
            thirty one-half hour interviews on audio cassettes. These offer a
          broad account of experience from recollections
            of 19th Century Indian-white relations and indigenous Indian culture
            to the experience of today&#8217;s young Indians struggling to survive
            in white America without sacrificing their ethnic identity.</p>
        <p>
          <font color="#0080C0" size="+1">American Indian Oral History Collection, 1967-1972</font>, contains transcripts from
            some 800 interviews, and include topics such as education, religion, politics,
            medicine, crafts, songs, land management, hunting, as well as personal histories
            and life stories on 11 microfilm reels. Reels 1 through 6 contain Navajo oral
            histories, while tapes 7 through 11 include oral histories from Pueblo Indians.
        Informants are identified along with the date of the interviewer.</p>
        <p>
          <font color="#0080FF" size="+1">University of South Dakota Oral History Collection</font>, from the American Indian
            Research Project, Vermillion, South Dakota, contains some 172 interviews conducted
            in the late 1960s and early 1970s with Plains Indians and those non-Indians
            working actively with them. Nearly all the Native informants belonged to the
            various bands of Sioux tribes. Most were elderly, thus providing first-hand
            accounts of events going as far back as the 1862 uprising to the 1972 presidential
            election. The interviewees are identified, along with date of birth and subjects
        covered in the interview.</p>
        <p>
          <font color="#FF80C0" size="+1">Ethnic Studies: Indian Urbanization Project</font>, from California State University
            at Fullerton, contains hundreds of taped interviews of Native people, most
            born in the early to mid-1900s. Many tribes are represented including Cherokee,
            Haida, Cahuilla, Arapahoe, Cayuga, Blackfoot, Chiricahua Apache, Paiute, Oneida,
              Kiowa-Apache, Navajo, Rosebud Sioux, Sauk and Fox, Pima, Choctaw, and Hopi.
              The Center will purchase
                  tapes
                  or transcripts
        on demand. There is a guide in the Center, or search: <a href="http://coph.fullerton.edu/NativeAmericanProject.htm">coph.fullerton.edu/NativeAmericanProject.htm</a></p>

  Stephen Kent Amerman, Ph.D., conducted ten interviews in association with his
  dissertation research for &#8220;&#8221;Making an Indian Place in Urban Schools:
  Native Americans and Education in Phoenix, 1941-1984.&#8221; The interviews
  yielded 26 audio tapes and corresponding transcriptions. There are interviews
  with eight former students, one community activist, and the minister for Central
  Presbyterian
            Church, a Native church in downtown Phoenix. <br>

          </table>          
          <p>Each history contains
            information on three generations: parents&#8217; boarding school
            experience; the interviewee&#8217;s experience in Phoenix elementary
            and high schools in the 1960s and 1970s; and their own children&#8217;s
            experience in Phoenix high schools.
          <p> The interviews touch on the issues of minority representation on
            the school board and in the classroom, and the interaction between
            various minority groups in the schools. Community life, activism,
            and the role of the Central Presbyterian Church are major themes.
            Speakers mention Indian Club (a student organization) and the Citizens
            Advisory Group/Committee that was formed as an addition to the school
            boards. Please see the American Indian Index through the Labriola
            web site for further details.

          <p><font color="#400040" size="+2"><a name="INDIAN">Indian-Pioneer Papers</a></font><br>
  The Indian Pioneer History Papers is a collection of interviews done in 1937
    and 1938, which includes biographical data on both living and deceased persons
    of Indian and pioneer heritage whose lives have been important in the history
    of Oklahoma. There is also a collection of information on family customs,
    tribal histories, social organizations, folklore, legends, cemeteries, old
    trails, ferries, forts, trading centers, and other unrecorded facts known
    only to oral tradition.
          <p> The original project, out of the Oklahoma Historical Society, was
            carried out under a Works Progress Administration (WPA) Writers&#8217; project
            grant. On completion, there were some 45,000 pages assembled in 112
            volumes. There are only two bound volumes of originals. The Center
            has the microfilm edition.</p>

          <p><font color="#400080" size="+2"><a name="PAPERS">Papers of the Society of American Indians</a></font> <br>
  Here is an extensive array of source materials generated by the Nation&#8217;s
  earliest Pan-Indian organization. It was first organized at Ohio State University
  in 1911. By 1913, there were some 619 members. Individual memberships were
  offered to American Indians, while Associate memberships were offered to non-natives.
  Many tribes were represented, particularly from the Great Lakes and Plains
  area, and New York. Members included
        BIA employees,
    academics, politicians, representatives of reform groups, clergy, along with
    a number of opinion-makers.<p>
    Some important Native women were among the society&#8217;s leaders, and included:
  Gertrude Simmons Bonnin; Emma D. Johnson Goulette; Marie L. B. Baldwin, Rosa
  B. LaFlesche, and Laura M. Cornelius Kellogg. The papers, therefore, become
  a significant source of history of early 20th -century Native American women.
    <p>
  The collection includes roughly 5,600 items of correspondence, minutes, memoranda,
  reports, legal documents and news clippings. In order to provide a comprehensive
  view of the Society, the papers were collected from some 45 institutions nationwide.
  The largest and most comprehensive part were found in the New York State Museum
  in Albany, with smaller portions coming from Rochester Museum and Science Center.
  The microfilm edition is in the Labriola Center call number FILM 9653. There
    is a printed index located in Labriola  call number E77 .S6 L3.<br>

    <font color="#800040" size="+2"><a name="WHAT">What Was Life Like In Those 1903
            BIA Schools?</a></font><br>
A little treasure in our collection was published by the U. S. Office of Indian
Affairs in 1903: Statistics of Indian Tribes, Schools, and Agencies. For the
most part, they were difficult to reach with downright miserable conditions. 
    <p>
  Let&#8217;s try and get there. For example. If one wanted to go to the Neah
  Bay Training School, 6 miles east of Cape Flattery, it would be necessary to
  catch a train to Seattle, then hop on a steamer for the last 188 miles. Now,
  the Lower Brule School is on the Missouri River, 35 miles North of Chamberlin,
  South Dakota. There is no railroad, telegraph, or telephone communication nearer
  than Chamberlin. On the other hand, Fort Belknap was easy to reach via the
  great Northern Railway; it was just four miles by stage to the agency. In stepping
  off the Rio Grande Western Railway in Price, Utah, one faced a 110-mile stage
  ride to the Unita-Ouray Agency.<p>

      <td width="87%" valign="top">Dr. Charles Newton was assigned to the Algert Training
        School on the Navajo Reservation, in 1903. &#8220;Ninety miles from nowhere,&#8221; he
        wrote. Stepping off the train at Winslow, he was met by a government
        wagon pulled by mules. On the first day, they made 12 miles, unloaded
        the food box, water, and made a fire. He slept on a tarpaulin using blankets
        for cover, &#8220;the tent was the blue canopy of heaven.&#8221; Night
        temperatures were down to freezing and he shivered all the way to Algert,
        where they arrived after three nights on the road.* </td>

  Now for the weather. At the Pima Training School, one was told to expect a
  mild climate &#8211; except for summers of &#8220;extreme heat.&#8221; At the
  Blackfeet Agency Boarding School some three miles from Browning, Montana, the
  school was built on the east side of the Rockies in a &#8220;high, windy, desolate,
  and extremely cold section of the country.&#8221; <p>
  On a visit to the Arapahoe School in Darlington, Oklahoma, a visitor would
  find a pure water supply, though hard, and though the well water came from
  the river, it dried up when the river dried up. At Fort Berthold, water came
  from the Missouri River into which all refuse was thrown.<p>
  Most schools were lighted by kerosene or oil lamps and heated by wood or coal
  stoves. Ventilation system was by means of windows and doors. The bathing facilities
  consisted of wash tubs and basins. Of fire protection, there was none except
  for pails of water in strategic places. Very often, there was no sewage disposal
  system except for nearby rivers. Need we say more?<br>
