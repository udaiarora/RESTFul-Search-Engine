<P><A name="z0552452">&#13; Several SAS system
options provide information that can help
you optimize your SAS programs. The STATS system option enables writes to
the SAS log. The FULLSTATS, MEMRPT, and STIMER system options can be specified
in combination to select the statistics that are written to the SAS log.</A>
<DL>
<DT>  STATS</DT>
<DD>specifies that statistics are to be written
to the SAS log. NOSTATS specifies that no statistics are to be written to
the SAS log, regardless of the values of STIMER, MEMRPT, and FULLSTATS. STATS
and NOSTATS can be asserted at any time during a SAS session.<P></DD>

<DT><A name="z0552453">&#13; STIMER</A></DT>
<DD>specifies that the CPU time statistic is
to be collected and maintained throughout the SAS session. If STATS and STIMER
are in effect, then the CPU time statistic will be written into the SAS log
for each task. If FULLSTATS, STATS, and STIMER are in effect, the statistics
listed under FULLSTATS below will be written to the SAS log. STIMER must be
specified at SAS invocation.<P></DD>

<DT><A name="z0552456">&#13;
MEMRPT</A></DT>
<DD>specifies that memory usage statistics are
to be written to the SAS log. If STATS and MEMRPT are in effect, then the
amount of memory used by each task and the total amount of memory used for
the SAS session will be written into the SAS log. If FULLSTATS, STATS, and
MEMRPT are in effect, then additional statistics will be written into the
SAS log, as specified below for FULLSTATS. MEMRPT and NOMEMRPT can be specified
at any time during a SAS session.<P></DD>

<DT><A name="z0552461">&#13;
FULLSTATS</A></DT>
<DD>specifies that additional statistics are
to be written to the SAS log. The actual statistics added are determined by
the values of STIMER and MEMRPT. If STIMER is in effect, then elapsed time,
vector affinity time, RSM hiperspace time, and EXCP count are displayed. If
MEMRPT is in effect, then for each task, both task and total memory are displayed,
including the amount of memory used for data and amount of memory used for
program. FULLSTATS and NOFULLSTATS can be specified at any time during a SAS
session.<P></DD>

SMF
statistics are generated by IBM's System Management Facility. If your system
is configured to enter the SMF exit, and if the SAS system options SMF and
SMFEXIT= are in effect, up to 20 SMF statistics can be written to the SAS
log for each task.</A>
<P>SMF statistics are written to the SAS log only when
the STATS system option is in effect.
<P>For further information on SMF statistics, see the installation
instructions for SAS in the OS/390 environment.
