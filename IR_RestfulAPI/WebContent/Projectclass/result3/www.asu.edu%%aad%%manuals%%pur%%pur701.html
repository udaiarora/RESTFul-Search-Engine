By authority of the regents, Arizona State University maintains ownership of any trademarks, service marks, marks, logos, insignias, seals, designs, or other symbols or devices associated with or referring to ASU.  Besides common law rights, &#147;Arizona State University,&#148; &#147;ASU,&#148; &#147;ASU West,&#148; &#147;ASU Polytechnic,&#148; &#147;Sun Devils,&#148; and &#147;Sparky&#148; (the ASU mascot) (see these marks on the <a href="purchasing.html">Purchasing and Business Services</a> Web site) are protected by trademark registrations with the State of Arizona and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in the Department of Commerce.<p>Regulation of all uses of ASU marks is essential to protect the university&#146;s trademark rights and image from liability and to protect against dilution of the marks. ASU approval is required for all noncommercial and commercial uses of ASU marks.  Unauthorized (noncommercial or commercial) use of a mark could effectively prevent ASU from retaining and enforcing its rights in legal and commercial contexts.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>The ASU Graphic Standards Manual</b></font><p>All formal and official graphic representations must adhere to the guidelines and specifications delineated in the <i><a href="gsm.html">ASU Graphic Standards Manual</a>.</i><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Trademark Management Office</b></font><p>The Trademark Management Office actively polices the market and the Internet to protect against unauthorized or unlicensed use of the ASU marks, names, and symbols and to protect licensees from unfair competition. The service mission of the Trademark Management Office is to assist licensees, vendors, manufacturers, students, staff, and any other persons regarding <a href="pur004.html#Trademark License">licensing</a> issues and uses of ASU marks on apparel and products.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Benefits of Licensing</b></font><p><b>Benefits to the Manufacturer</b><p>The ASU Trademark Licensing Program works closely with licensees, stores, Internet sellers, and the campus community and develops cooperative relationships with them to develop a stronger market for their products displaying the ASU name and trademarks.  In addition, ASU seeks opportunities to promote sales through marketing efforts.<p>The Trademark Management Office offers nonexclusive rights to use ASU marks to those persons or organizations who meet licensing requirements and who offer products or services deemed by ASU to be appropriate for sale or distribution.<p><b>Benefits to the Retailer</b><p>The ASU Trademark Licensing Program works with retailers carrying licensed merchandise to increase sales and keep unlicensed merchandise off the shelves of competing retailers. It also maintains lists of retailers to direct customers to their outlets. The program also works with Intercollegiate Athletics and licensing agencies to market promotional opportunities and merchandise in conjunction with ASU events.<p><img src="purhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Policy</b></font></center><img src="purhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Formal and Official Use</b></font><p>The <i>ASU Graphic Standards Manual</i> provides a system of graphic identity to be used for all formal and official representations of the university.  Any exceptions to the formal and official use must be approved by the university president.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Need to License</b></font><p>All uses of the ASU name and marks must be licensed or approved.<p>Any person or organization manufacturing a product or providing a service bearing or containing any of the marks belonging to ASU must, prior to such use of the mark, enter into a licensing <a href="pur004.html#Agreement">agreement</a> with an authorized agent of the university.  No use of any mark belonging to ASU shall be authorized without such a licensing agreement or a written exception.<p>Each licensing agreement shall provide for either a reasonable royalty to be paid to the university or other consideration deemed appropriate by ASU in exchange for permission to use the mark.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Use of Royalty Income</b></font><p>Royalty income should be used for support of the mission of the university.  Its uses will be determined by the president.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Noncommercial Use of Logos by Campus Organizations, Faculty, Staff, and Students</b></font><p><a href="pur004.html#Campus Organizations">Campus organizations</a> making items for their internal use are not required to be licensed.  University departments and official organizations may use &#147;ASU&#148; in their official operations and may also use &#147;ASU&#148; on products that are part of their normal operations.<p>University employees and students are not authorized to modify, change, or alter ASU marks protected by trademark.  In addition, they are not authorized to employ ASU marks that are unprotected by trademark.  Employees and students may not authorize any use of ASU marks without the prior approval of the Trademark Management Office.<p>Campus departments and student organizations producing items, having items produced, or buying goods for resale must either become licensed or purchase the items from a licensed manufacturer, unless a written exception is granted.<p><b>The University Seal</b><p>The official seal of ASU (see the seal on the <a href="purchasing.html">Purchasing and Business Services</a> Web site) is the official seal of the state of Arizona with the words &#147;Arizona State University 1885&#148; encircling it.  Use of the seal is reserved for formal and official documents, such as diplomas; legal and official records; transcripts; programs for formal academic ceremonies; and any legal agreements binding the university.  Use of the seal requires prior authorization from the Office of the President.<p><b>The Athletic Mascot</b><p>The official athletic mascot, Sparky the Sun Devil (see Sparky on the <a href="purchasing.html">Purchasing and Business Services</a> Web site), was developed in 1945 to reflect the energy and enthusiasm of athletics at ASU.  The official mascot is to be used primarily in association with athletic programs and events. Student organizations are allowed to use the mascot with permission from the ASU  Trademark Management Office.<p>The mascot is a copyright and trademark of ASU.  The mascot must not be redrawn or modified in any way without prior authorization from the Office of the President.  It must be reproduced from authorized digital files or reproduction masters. The president has delegated modification approval for retail goods to the trademark licensing coordinator.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Resale or Promotional Distribution of Items Displaying Logos</b></font><p>Organizations or persons intending to make items bearing the ASU name or logo for general distribution or resale, as opposed to limited campus use, must become licensed or buy merchandise from a licensed business.<p>Organizations or persons wishing to purchase a product bearing the ASU name or logo for general distribution or resale, as opposed to limited campus use, must obtain the product from a licensed manufacturer.<p>No organization, faculty member, staff member, or student may authorize any third party to produce merchandise bearing the ASU names or trademarks, or authorize or produce items that combine the ASU name with any third party name or logo unless approved by the Trademark Management Office.<p>ASU marks may not be used with anyone else&#146;s marks unless written approval of the owners of all marks has been secured.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Authority for Program Administration</b></font><p>The Trademark Management Office is responsible for the implementation and interpretation of the day-to-day operations, noncontroversial design approvals, appropriate modifications for retail, and control of the university&#146;s identifying marks for negotiating licensing agreements.  No other office, department, or agency is authorized to perform trademark licensing program administration.  Controversial product designs and sensitive issues will be reviewed at appropriate administrative levels.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Product Approval</b></font><p>Manufacturers or members of the university community wanting to expand the types of items bearing ASU marks must have each product approved by the Trademark Management Office or its legal agent.  Prospective licensees shall furnish, free of cost to ASU, a representative sample of each item to be approved for licensing. If there are many products, a representative sample and product catalog will suffice. All designs to be used on any product must be approved prior to sale and indicated clearly in the license agreement.<p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>If a finished product bearing ASU marks is not available, then a sample must be submitted.  A drawing may be required showing where and how the ASU marks are to be used.</td></tr></table><p>All product approvals by the Trademark Management Office and its agent must be in writing.  No verbal approval will be valid.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Logo Modifications</b></font><p>ASU recognizes that some creative designs may alter the traditional usage of marks.  Variations of these designs and product samples must be submitted to the Trademark Management Office for approval prior to their public release.  This includes product packaging, point of purchase displays, commercial Internet uses, and all forms of product promotional materials.  ASU reserves the right to require correction or alteration of any use of its marks deemed inappropriate by the university.<p>University employees and students are not authorized to modify official ASU marks protected by trademark.  University applications are governed by the <i>ASU Graphic Standards Manual.</i> For more information on ASU graphic standards, see <a href="pur402-05.html">PUR 402&#150;05</a>, &#147;ASU Graphic Standards.&#148; Commercial uses must be specifically identified and delineated in contracts rather than be broad and implied.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Prohibited Products</b></font><p>ASU will not license products that defame the university, or are medical, dangerous, harmful, shoddy, obscene, or otherwise deemed inappropriate for reasons of the item characteristics or manufacture.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>ASU Trademark Management&#146;s Fair Labor Philosophy</b></font><p>Arizona State University exhorts all licensees of ASU to maintain a fair, safe, and nonexploitive working condition for all of their employees. The university has the right to terminate this license immediately for failure to comply with these expectations.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Infringement</b></font><p>ASU actively protects its identifying marks and enforces its trademark rights. The ASU Trademark Management Office takes an active role in preventing trademark infringement by educating the ASU community and searching the internal and external market for infringers.  If a trademark infringement occurs, ASU may proceed to take legal action as the situation warrants.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Arizona State University Code of Conduct for Trademark Licensees</b></font><p>Arizona State University exhorts all ASU licensees and their contractors to maintain fair, safe, and non-exploitive working conditions for their employees. ASU may terminate licenses for failure to comply with this Code of Conduct.<p><b>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</b><p>ASU is committed to conducting its business in an ethical and socially responsible manner consistent with its educational mission. As a condition of being permitted to produce or sell licensed products bearing the name, trademarks, or images of ASU, each licensee must comply with this Code and ensure that its contractors comply with this Code. &#147;Licensee&#148; includes all persons or entities that have entered a written Licensing Agreement with ASU through its trademark licensing agent to manufacture products bearing the name, trademarks, or images of ASU. &#147;Contractor&#148; includes each contractor, subcontractor, vendor, or manufacturer engaged in a manufacturing process that results in a finished product for the consumer. &#147;Manufacturing process&#148; includes assembly and packaging. ASU may modify this Code to reflect changes in manufacturing conditions or developments relating to monitoring.<p><b>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards</b><br><p><ol type="A"><li><b>Legal Compliance.</b> ASU licensees and their contractors must comply with all applicable legal requirements in conducting business related to the production or sale of products bearing the name, trademarks, or images of ASU. If this Code conflicts with the applicable laws of the country of manufacture, the licensee must meet the higher standard.</li><p><li><b>Ethical Principles.</b> Licensees agree to adopt ethical standards to guide the operation of their business practices.  These standards must include honesty, integrity, trustworthiness, and respect for the unique intrinsic value of each human being.</li><p><li><b>Environmental Responsibility.</b> Licensees agree to make environmentally responsible business decisions.  Such decisions reflect a commitment to protect and preserve the global environment and the world&#146;s finite resources.  ASU requires its licensees to ensure &#147;do no harm&#148; manufacture of all products bearing ASU indicia.  For example, ASU requires that manufacturers not pose risks to human health through increasing exposure to negative environmental factors; not increase human vulnerability to environmental risks and natural disasters; and not damage the livelihood of the poor who depend on natural resources.  ASU encourages ecological soundness and sustainability policies that mitigate potential adverse effects to the environment and vulnerable populations.</li><p><li><b>Employment Standards.</b> ASU will do business only with licensees whose workers are present at work voluntarily, compensated fairly, not at undue risk of physical harm, and not exploited. In addition, licensees and their contractors must meet the following employment standards.<p><ol><li type="1"><b>Nondiscrimination.</b> Licensees must employ individuals solely on the basis of their ability to perform the job. No person shall be subject to any discrimination in employment, including hiring, salary, benefits, advancement, discipline, termination or retirement, on the basis of gender, marital status, reproductive status, race, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, nationality, political opinion, or social or ethnic origin.</li><p><li><b>Health and Safety.</b> Licensees must provide workers with a safe and healthy work environment. Any residential facilities provided to workers must be safe and healthy.</li><p><li><b>Harassment or Abuse.</b> Every employee shall be treated with dignity and respect. No employee shall be subject to any physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse. Licensees will not use or tolerate any form of corporal punishment.</li><p><li><b>Freedom of Association.</b> Licensees must recognize and respect the right of employees to freedom of association and collective bargaining.</li><p><li><b>Forced Labor.</b> No licensee or contractor may use forced labor, indentured labor, or bonded labor.</li><p><li><b>Labor Standards Environment.</b> In countries where law or practice conflicts with these labor standards, licensees agree to work with governmental, human rights, labor and business organizations to meet these standards. Licensees also agree to refrain from any actions that would diminish the protections of these standards. In addition to all other rights under the Licensing Agreement, ASU may refuse to renew any Licensing Agreement for goods made in countries in which: (a) progress toward implementation of   this Code is no longer being made; and (b) compliance with this Code is deemed impossible. ASU will make this determination based upon examination of reports from governmental, human rights, labor and business organizations and after consultation with the relevant licensee.</li><p><li><b>Wages and Benefits.</b> Licensees and their contractors shall pay wages which are the highest of (a) the legal minimum wage in the country(ies) of manufacture, (b) the prevailing wage in that industry in the country(ies) of manufacture, or (c) a wage that meets the basic human needs for the average family size of employees in that industry in the country(ies) of manufacture.  Basic human needs shall mean wages and benefits sufficient (when taking into account any governmental programs) to meet needs for nutrition, clothing, shelter, health care, transportation, children&#146;s education, and energy.</li> <p><li><b>Working Hours.</b> Except in extraordinary circumstances, employees must not be required to work more than the lesser of: (a) 48 hours per week and 12 hours overtime, or (b) the limits on regular and overtime hours allowed by the law of the country of manufacture.  Employees must be entitled to at least one day off in every seven-day period.</li><p><li><b>Overtime Compensation.</b> In addition to compensation for regular hours of work, employees must be compensated for overtime hours at the premium rate legally required in that country, but not less than at a rate equal to their regular hourly compensation rate.</li><p><li><b>Women&#146;s Rights.</b> Female workers shall have the same work opportunities as men, without restriction on the types of jobs or special limits on hours of work.  Licensees shall not use criteria related to marital or reproductive status (for example, pregnancy tests, the use of contraception, fertility status) as conditions of employment.  New mothers shall be entitled to leaves of absence (with the right to return to work) for childbirth and recovery from childbirth.  Workers who take maternity leave will not face dismissal, threat of dismissal, loss of seniority, or deduction of wages.</li><p><li><b>Child Labor.</b> No one may be employed at an age younger than 15 (or 14, as consistent with International Labor Organization practices for developing countries, if the law of the country of manufacture allows this exception). If the age for completing compulsory education is higher than the standard for the minimum age of employment stated above, the higher age for completing compulsory education applies to this section. Licensees agree to work with governmental, human rights, and non-governmental organizations, as determined by ASU and licensee, to minimize the negative impact on any child released from employment as a result of the enforcement of this Code.</li></ol></li></ol><p><b>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remediation</b><p>If ASU determines that a licensee or contractor has failed to remedy a violation of this Code, then ASU will consult with the licensee to determine the appropriate measures to be taken. At a minimum, the remedy will include taking all steps necessary to correct the violation, including paying any portion of back wages found due to workers who manufactured the licensed articles. If these measures fail to resolve the violations within a specified time period, then licensee will implement a corrective action plan on terms acceptable to ASU. ASU reserves the right to terminate its relationship with any licensee that continues to conduct its business in violation of the corrective action plan.  ASU will provide the licensee 90 days prior written notice of termination. <p><b>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance and Disclosure</b><p>Licensees will provide the following information to ASU or its trademark licensing agent at least 60 days prior to the date of the annual licensee renewal:  (a) the company names, owners and officers, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and nature of the business association for all of the licensees&#146; contractors and manufacturing plants that are involved in the manufacturing process of items which bear, or will bear, the name, trademarks or images of ASU; (b) written assurances that it and its contractors adhere to this Code (except that in the initial phase-in of the Code, licensee must also provide written assurances within six months of receipt of this Code); and (c) a summary of the steps taken or difficulties encountered during the preceding year in implementing and enforcing this Code at each site.<p>Licensee must immediately report to ASU if changes occur, such as the selection of a new factory, that materially affect the application of these labor standards.<p><b>V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verification</b><p>Each ASU licensee must ensure compliance with this Code and verify that its contractors are in compliance with this Code.<p><b>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal and External Monitoring</b><p>ASU and licensee have not yet defined methods of internal monitoring, training, and independent external monitoring. ASU and licensee agree to undertake efforts to define the obligations associated with training and monitoring and a reasonable time frame within which compliance measures, including internal monitoring and independent external monitoring, will begin.	<p><img src="purhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Procedures</b></font></center><img src="purhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p><hr><font size=+1><b>To Request a Trademark License</b></font><p>Contact the Trademark Management Office (480/965&#150;5499 and Fax: 480/727&#150;9800) or the ASU licensing agent:<p>USA:<p><blockquote>The Licensing Resource Group</blockquote><p><blockquote>Michigan Office<br>426 Century Lane, Suite 100<br>Holland, MI  49423<br>Phone: 616/395&#150;0676<br>Fax: 616/395&#150;2517</blockquote><p><blockquote>VJS Executive Park<br>2570 Holiday Rd., Suite 250<br>Coralville, IA  52241<br>Phone: 319/351&#150;1776<br>Fax: 319/351&#150;1978<br>Web site: LRGUSA.com</blockquote><p><hr><font size=+1><b>To Request Approval for a Specific Product</b></font><p>Send or deliver the product to the Trademark Management Office in the University Services Building or to The Licensing Resource Group address.<p><blockquote>Trademark Management<br>Arizona State University<br>1551 S.
