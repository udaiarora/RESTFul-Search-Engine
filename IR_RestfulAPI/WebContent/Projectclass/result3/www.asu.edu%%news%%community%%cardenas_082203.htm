      <h2>C&aacute;rdenas to host KAET's newest public affairs program</h2>
      <p>        Jos&eacute; A. C&aacute;rdenas, chairman of the law firm of Lewis and
        Roca LLP, is adding "television program host" to his repertoire as he
        begins his new duties with "Horizonte," the latest addition to KAET-TV/Channel
        8's public affairs programming. The new program provides a forum for
        Hispanic perspectives and helps educate all audiences about issues of
        particular interest to the Latino community.</p>
      <p>"I'm hopeful that people
        will not view this as just a Latino show," says C&aacute;rdenas, a 1977
        graduate of Stanford Law School. "It's a show about Latino issues and
        many of these issues affect Latinos and non-Latinos."</p>
      <p>C&aacute;rdenas
        will make his hosting debut on "Horizonte" at 7:30 p.m., Sept. 18, on
        KAET. "Horizonte" will air at 7:30 p.m., Thursdays.</p>
      <p>"Horizonte"
          will present public affairs issues in a setting similar to the "Horizon"
          television show, hosted by Michael Grant. Michael Philipsen,
          KAET news manager, says "Horizonte" will complement and enhance the
        educational efforts that have been set by KAET's "Horizon."</p>
      <p>"Like 'Horizon,' we will
        identify topics that impact people's everyday lives, taking enough time
        to present different sides of an issue so viewers
        can make informed decisions," Philipsen says. "We hope the stories and
        the discussions will bring attention to a variety of topics. Our goal
        is to share balanced, comprehensive information about an issue with viewers
        and hope it makes a difference in their lives."<br>
        C&aacute;rdenas is very active in state and local government and professional
        associations, as well as non-profit community-based organizations. </p>
      <p>He
          is a member of the Maricopa County, Arizona and American Bar Associations,
          as well as the American Law Institute and the Hispanic National Bar
        Association.</p>
      <p>C&aacute;rdenas
        has been a member of Los Abogados Hispanic Bar Association for the last
        25 years, having served on its board for several years and
        as president for three years. He is also admitted in California. C&aacute;rdenas
        is a member of the Ninth Circuit Advisory Board and he is a member of
        the ABA House of Delegates, representing the Arizona State Bar Association.</p>
      <p>C&aacute;rdenas
        has served for the last eight years as president of the Arizona-Mexico
        Commission under governors Symington, Hull and Napolitano.
        He has served as a member of the U.S. Delegation of the NAFTA Advisory
        Committee on Private Commercial Disputes, and as a member of the Arizona-Sonora
        Judicial Cooperation Project. He is a member of the Pacific Council on
        International Policy and has served throughout his career on boards and
        committees for various organizations.</p>
      <p>Stereotyping of Hispanics is an
          issue that continues to garner attention by the general public and
        the media. Cardenas says people often are surprised
          when they learn about a successful or positive story involving Hispanic
          citizens. He hopes "Horizonte" will change people's points of view.</p>
      <p>"It's
          amazing to see what people's expectations are of Hispanics," he says.
          "Many people either don't know about the successes or they expect
          Hispanics not to succeed. It surprises many people when they learn
        of someone who is Latino and of the first quality."</p>
      <p>Cardenas hopes to interview
          a variety of people who can provide insight and attention to Hispanic
          issues.</p>
      <p>"We have many people in the community
          who are very bright and active," he says. "I would like the opportunity
          to interview such people and possibly
          have local journalists participate in a roundtable discussion, similar
          to what is already being done by Michael. There are many topics that
          need to be explored." </p>
