<P>Until the configuration is properly specified,
it can be difficult to establish communications within an SNA network. The
APPC communication access method reflects failures as they are reported by
the operating system components with which it interfaces.  Often, this information
is in the form of operation codes, return codes, and sense data.  No attempt
is made to interpret these failures; rather, given the numerous possibilities
for failure that are a function of your particular environment, it is expected
that you will work with network systems and SAS support personnel at your
site to determine the problem and find the solution.
<P>For additional information to help with troubleshooting, see the IBM
publications that are listed in <A href="zconfenv.htm#z1refs">References</A>.
<P>Most failures are caused by configuration or network setup errors, or
they occur because the application that you are attempting to communicate
with is not currently running, or it has rejected your connection request.
<P>The following section describes some of the common messages that you
may receive under the HP-UX, the Solaris, or the AIX operating system. If
you cannot resolve your connectivity problem, call SAS Technical Support for
assistance.  You will likely be requested to generate traces to assist in
documenting the problem, so ensure that you or your site support personnel
are familiar with the tracing services available through the SNA component
that is used and VTAM.

<P>The following messages document some common failures when running under
the HP-UX operating system:  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASRMT (or SASVQEL) 
opcode = 0100  prc = F004  src = F0000001.</PRE>
<P>An ALLOCATE verb has failed because the communication subsystem is not
loaded.  With the snapmanage program, make sure that all links, connections,
and local nodes were successfully started.  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASRMT (or SASVQEL) 
opcode = 0100  prc = 0001  src = 00000018.</PRE>
<P>An ALLOCATE verb has failed because a value that was specified for a
partner lu_alias or partner mode was invalid or undefined. Make sure that
the REMOTE= option specifies a valid partner LU_alias and that the APPC_MODE
environment variable or the APPCMODE macro variable specifies a valid mode
name.  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASRMT (or SASVQEL)
opcode = 0100  prc = F004  src = F0000002.</PRE>
<P>An ALLOCATE verb has failed because a value that was specified for the
local LU_alias is invalid or undefined.  Make sure that the APPC_LU environment
variable or the APPCLU macro variable specifies a valid local LU_alias.  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure:
transaction program = SASRMT (or SASVQEL) 
opcode = 0100  prc = 0003  src = 00000005.</PRE>
<P>An ALLOCATE verb has failed because of an allocation failure. Make sure
that the network components and the remote partner are active. For example,
the remote partner application may not have an active control session with
VTAM (host APPL/ACB is not OPEN).  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure:
transaction program = SASRMT (or SASVQEL) 
opcode = 0B00  prc = 0003  src = 080F6051.</PRE>
<P>A RECEIVE_AND_WAIT verb has failed because the userid or the password
that was specified in the allocation request was not accepted by the remote
partner LU.  Make sure that the APPC_SECURE environment variable or the APPCSEC
macro variable specifies the correct userid and password.

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">Solaris Messages</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>The following messages document some common failures when running under
the Solaris operating system:  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure:
transaction program = SASLCL 
operation = TPStart  error code = 00020001. 
E_NOAPPC</PRE>
<P>A TPSTART verb has failed because the gateway name that was specified
is not in the APPC database.  Verify that you did not misspell the gateway
name in the APPC_GATEWAY environment variable or the APPCGATE macro
variable.  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASLCL 
operation = TPStart  error code = 00020005. 
E_HOSTNA</PRE>
<P>A TPSTART verb has failed because the gateway is not running.  It can
be started by issuing the following command at the UNIX prompt:  



<PRE>/opt/SUNWconn/snap2p/p2p_etc/bin/startp2p <I>gateway_name config_file</I></PRE>


  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure:
 transaction program = SASLCL 
operation = TPStart   error code = 00020007.
E_NOCONN</PRE>
<P>A TPSTART verb has failed because the connection to the gateway failed.
Make sure the peer-to-peer gateway is started.  It can be started by issuing
the following command from the UNIX prompt:  



<PRE>/opt/SUNWconn/snap2p/p2p_etc/bin/startp2p 
<I>gateway_name config_file</I></PRE>


  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure:
transaction program = SASRMT (or SASVQEL) 
operation = Allocate  error code = 000A0005. 
BAD_MODE_NAME</PRE>
<P>An ALLOCATE verb has failed because a value that was specified for the
REMOTE= option is not a valid unique session name that is defined in the configuration
file.  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure:
transaction program = SASRMT (or SASVQEL) 
operation = Allocate  error code = 00040004. 
ALLOCATION_FAILURE_RETRY}</PRE>
<P>An ALLOCATE verb has failed because of an allocation failure. One possible
cause of this error is an inactive remote partner. For example, the remote
application does not have an active control session with VTAM (the host APPL/ACB is
not OPEN).  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASRMT (or SASVQEL)
operation = Rec&amp;amp;Wait  
error code = 0004000B. 
SECURITY NOT VALID</PRE>
<P>A RECEIVE_AND_WAIT verb has failed because the userid or the password
that was specified in the allocation request was not accepted by the remote
partner LU. Make sure that the APPC_SECURE environment variable or the APPCSEC
macro variable specifies the correct userid and password.

<TR valign="bottom"><TD><HR></TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">AIX Messages</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>The following messages document some common failures when running under
the AIX operating system:  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure: 
connection establishment error (160) to partner <I>remote LU name</I>.</PRE>
<P>A connection attempt has failed because the SNA Server/6000 subsystem
is not active. To resolve this error, the SNA Server/6000 subsystem must be
started by the administrator.  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASRMT (or SASVQEL) 
operation = ALLOCATE  return code = 112.</PRE>
<P>An ALLOCATE verb has failed because a value that was specified for the
remote partner LU is invalid or undefined.  Make sure that you have specified
a valid partner LU name as the REMOTE= or SERVER= value.  If you are using
APPN, ensure that the APPC_NET environment variable or the APPCNET macro variable
correctly specifies the network name qualifier.  



<PRE>ERROR: APPC communication failure:
transaction program = SASRMT (or SASVQEL) 
operation = ALLOCATE  return code = 123.</PRE>
<P>An ALLOCATE verb has failed because a value that was specified for the
session mode name is invalid or undefined.  Make sure that you have specified
a valid mode name for the APPC_MODE environment variable or the APPCMODE macro
variable.  



<PRE>ERROR: Communication request rejected by partner: security
verification failure.</PRE>
<P>A connection operation has failed because the userid or the password
that was specified in the allocation request was not accepted by the remote
partner LU.  Make sure that you have specified the correct userid and the
password as the APPC_SECURE environment variable or the APPCSEC macro variable.
