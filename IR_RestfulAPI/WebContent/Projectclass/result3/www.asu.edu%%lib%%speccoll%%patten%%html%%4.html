 Alpini served as the Chair of Botany at the University of Padua in the

 Venetian Republic, and because he was a doctor, he was asked to accompany

 the Venetian consul, Giorgio Emo, to Egypt.  While there Alpini took full

 advantage of the opportunity to study the varied and unfamiliar plant life.

  In this publication describing plants of Egypt, Alpini was the first European

 writer not only to mention but also to illustrate the coffee bush, the banana,

 and the baobab (the baobab illustration is not in this book).  This small

 volume contains many woodcuts which are more decorative than realistic.

  On his return, Alpini brought back Egyptian plants and trees to the botanical

 garden at Padua; the palm trees still thrive there.  Later he became director

 of the garden, which is considered one of the outstanding botanical gardens of Europe.
