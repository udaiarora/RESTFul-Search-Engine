          <h2>New exemplars represent ASU&rsquo;s best teacher-scholars</h2>
          <p>ASU President Michael Crow has named four newly tenured faculty members as exemplars of the finest teacher-scholars the university has to offer. </p>
          <p> The four &ldquo;rising stars&rdquo; &ndash; all assistant professors who have earned promotion to associate professor status &ndash; are setting a standard of excellence for the entire ASU community, Crow says. They are: </p>
          <p> &bull; Sarah Brem, with the Division of Psychology in Education in the College of Education. </p>
          <p> &bull; Edward Garnero, with ASU&rsquo;s Department of Geological Sciences in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. </p>
          <p> &bull; Michele Moses, with Educational Leadership and Policy Studies in the College of Education. </p>
          <p> &bull; Alyssa Panitch, who works in the Harrington Department of Bioengineering at the Biodesign Institute at ASU. </p>
          <p> <img src="facstudents_images/Brem.jpg" width="108" height="178" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">For Brem, who came to ASU in 1999, her teaching and research interests focus on cognitive processes in science education, particularly evolutionary biology; the cultural, social and personal impact of scientific information; and the role of the lay person in the scientific community. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Sarah is indeed a unique and special colleague in the College of Education,&rdquo; says the college&rsquo;s dean, Eugene Garcia, who also is ASU&rsquo;s vice president for university-school partnerships. &ldquo;Her research on cognitive mechanisms involved in everyday reasoning and the effect that scientific information has on these processes has important implications for education. She is extremely well-regarded in the national cognitive science community for work on models of reasoning, where her ideas have attracted attention from philosophers of the mind and those creating computational reasoning systems, as well as everyday educational practitioners.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> <img src="facstudents_images/Garnero.jpg" width="108" height="169" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="left">Garnero, a seismologist, most recently has been focusing his attention on the inner workings of the highly active area where the Earth&rsquo;s mantle meets its molten core. This area is located halfway to the center of the Earth, about 2,900 kilometers below the surface of our planet. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Professor Garnero is an extraordinary teacher who brings out the best in our undergraduate and graduate students,&rdquo; says David Young, vice president and dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. &ldquo;He is an innovative, nationally prominent seismologist who has played a leading role in developing our geophysics program here at ASU.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> <img src="facstudents_images/Moses.jpg" width="108" height="162" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">Moses&rsquo; research agenda centers on issues of educational equality and social justice within education policies related to race and class. One component of this is a philosophical analysis of various race-conscious policies, such as multicultural curricula, affirmative action, bilingual education, and remedial education. Another related component is the nature of the moral disagreement over controversial education policy issues that profoundly affect equality of educational opportunity, such as affirmative action, welfare-to-work policy and high-stakes high school graduation testing. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Dr. Moses has distinguished herself as a scholar,&rdquo; Garcia says. &ldquo;She was named a Rising Scholar with the Kellogg Foundation National Forum on Higher Education for the Public Good for 2003 &ndash; 2004, and won the 2004 Critics Choice award by the American Educational Studies Association for her book, &lsquo;Embracing Race: Why We Need Race-Conscious Education Policy.&rsquo; &rdquo; </p>
          <p> <img src="facstudents_images/Panitch2.jpg" width="108" height="156" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="left">Panitch is the principal investigator in the Protein and Tissue Engineering Laboratory in the Harrington Department of Bioengineering. In the lab, Panitch and her co-workers seek to understand the molecular and cellular basis of biological activity, and to incorporate such features into the design of synthetic biomaterials. Ongoing projects are directed toward designing various bioactive peptide and protein signals into a material to achieve desirable chemical, mechanical and biologically active properties. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Alyssa Panitch is special because she has excelled in most aspects of her professional life at ASU,&rdquo; says Peter Crouch, dean of the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering. &ldquo;Her research achievements are amazing, given that she won career awards from the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health, which represent the pinnacles of peer endorsement for someone at this stage in her career.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> For Brem, Garnero, Moses and Panitch, their promotion and tenure went into effect July 1. These exemplary faculty members have received an extra salary increase in addition to the promotion adjustment. </p>
          <p>Jarvis, with Marketing &amp; Strategic Communications, can be reached at (480) 965-9689 or (j.jarvis@asu.edu).</p>
