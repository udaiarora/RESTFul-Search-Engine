      <h2>Scientific minds - East Campus welcomes future engineers to Chip Camp</h2>
      <p>        Fifty of the state's juniors and seniors spent June 15 - 21 at ASU East
          learning about depth diffusion, transistors, gates and vacuum pressure.
        And pneumatics, chemical etching and optics, too.</p>
      <p>That may seem like
            pretty deep stuff for a high schooler. But not if you ask Richard
        Newman, director of training operations at ASU East's
          Microelectronics Teaching Factory. </p>
      <p>He sees the high school years as the
          ideal time to introduce the complex, scientific processes of semiconductor
          manufacturing to the engineers
          of tomorrow.</p>
      <p>By adding in a little bit of fun, Newman hopes to hook the
          teenagers on a career in semiconductors, or at least to weed out the
          ones who need
          to realize now that this may not be the career path for them.</p>
      <p>It's all
          part of Chip Camp, an annual summer program sponsored by ASU, the state's
          community colleges and Intel Corp. The camp introduces students
          to the science and technology behind computer chips and the career
        opportunities of the semiconductor manufacturing industry. </p>
      <p>"We give kids some hands-on
          and formal, technical experience that they wouldn't get in their high
          schools," said Newman.</p>
      <p>This includes donning
          a head-to-toe bunny suit and working in ASU East's 15,000-square-foot
          clean room. Students learn to properly dress themselves
          in the suits and work in the bulky attire. The bunny suits and clean
          room environment are essential to the manufacturing process because
        human hair, skin cells and dust will render a computer chip useless.
        That's
        one of the most important lessons for the students to learn, Newman said.</p>
      <p>During
          a clean-room tour, camp participants enthusiastically awaited their
        turn to suit up. Giddy chatter was quickly replaced by dismay as
          they put on layers of garb. It quickly became apparent that clean-room
          work in a bunny suit was not fun and games. Putting the suit on was
        a challenge in itself. Learning to move about in the suit and operate
        machinery
        in the ultra clean environment would prove even more difficult.</p>
      <p>"If they
          don't like working in a bunny suit, they probably aren't going to like
          working in this type of engineering environment, specifically
          a clean-room environment. Not everyone can work in a bunny suit all
        day," he said. "It's better that they find out now."</p>
      <p>While there are lots of
          serious topics to be covered, the camp tries to integrate science and
          fun. Participants build robotic Lego cars that
          run on computer chips. For a pneumatics lesson, campers launch a rocket,
          and during a tour of Intel's Chandler operations, they take time out
        to build transistors using Play-Doh.</p>
      <p>The annual camp concludes with a
          career awareness night and awards ceremony for the students, their
        parents and school counselors. ASU and the other
          academic sponsors present their academic offerings and help the students
          and their parents explore the best career options in the semiconductor
        arena. </p>
      <p>"This is a great opportunity to provide information for parents
          that they'll deem valuable in helping their children choose an academic
          program,"
        said Newman.</p>
