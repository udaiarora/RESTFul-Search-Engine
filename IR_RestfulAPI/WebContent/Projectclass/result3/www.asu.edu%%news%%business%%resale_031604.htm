      <h2>Greater Phoenix resale home market shows no sign of slowing </h2>
      <p>The Greater Phoenix resale home market continued to surge in February, with 5,580 sales - 480 more than recorded in the previous month and well ahead of last year's 4,090 sales. So far in 2004, a total of 10,680 homes have been recorded sold, compared to the year-to-date figures of 8,310 sales in 2003 and 7,315 in 2002. </p>
      <p>"It appears that people cannot get enough of the local housing market," said Jay Butler, director of the Arizona Real Estate Center at ASU's W. P. Carey School of Business. "Home buyers' motivations continue - the desire to own rather than rent, to move up to better homes or to own rental investments." Butler noted, however, that concern about the sluggish job market could impact the future decisions of owners and buyers. He also pointed to the possibility that a strengthening economy, the deficit and the possible inflationary pressures of rapidly increasing energy costs could lead to higher mortgage rates. "Higher interest rates, combined with stable income and higher home prices, will adversely impact the affordability of housing - leading to a slowdown in home sales activity. Further, people, with low-interest mortgages have little incentive to move to provide some additional stimulus to the market." </p>
      <p>The median home price increased from $156,000 in January to $158,120 in February, compared to $147,500 in February 2003. Since the Greater Phoenix area is so large, the median price can range significantly - from $399,000 in North Scottsdale to $95,000 in the central western areas of Phoenix. In February, 50 percent of all recorded sales were for homes priced from $100,000 to $175,000 and 14 percent for homes priced over $300,000. </p>
      <p>The 1,065 resale townhouse/condominium units recorded sold in February represent an increase over the 1,010 sold in January, and was well above the 870 sales recorded a year ago. So far in 2004, a total of 2,075 units have been sold, up from 1,755 for the first two months of 2003. The median price increased to a record $110,000 (the previous record was $106,945 in January), compared to $100,000 a year ago. </p>
      <p>The median square footage for a single-family home recorded sold in February was 1,640, down from the 1,650 square feet reported a year ago. In the townhouse/condominium sector, the median square footage was 1,200, larger than the 1,160 square feet reported a year ago. </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; In comparison to February 2003, recorded sales in the city of Phoenix increased from 1,180 to 1,570, while the median sales price rose from $122,900 to $128,000. Since Phoenix is a geographically large city, the median prices can range significantly - for example, $83,000 in the Sky Harbor area and $187,000 in the Union Hills area. The townhouse/condominium sector also improved, from 200 to 305 sales, while the median price declined from $94,000 to $91,490. </p>
