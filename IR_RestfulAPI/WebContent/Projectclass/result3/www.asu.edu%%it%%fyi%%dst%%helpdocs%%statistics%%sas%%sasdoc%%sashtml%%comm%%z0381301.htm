<P>Various errors may occur when you initially
try to establish a connection over a network with the DECnet access method.
 Many of these problems are related to the network.  When errors of this nature
occur, SAS/CONNECT presents a general message that contains the specific return
code for the error. The form of the message follows:  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x<I>nn</I>)</PRE>
<P>where <B>nn</B>  is a nonzero return code that indicates the specific
problem. The following section explains the most common failures in establishing
DECnet communications.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x03)...</PRE>
<P>The SAS$CONN file is not defined on the remote host. This file is necessary
to invoke the remote SAS session.  Ensure that the file exists and is properly
defined to NCP or that it exists in the remote login directory.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x10)...</PRE>
<P>The host name that you specified as the value for the REMOTE= option
is invalid. Ask your systems personnel for valid names at your site.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x13)...</PRE>
<P>Permission to access the remote host was denied.  Verify that you specified
both a valid userid and password for the remote system.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x50)...
ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x51)...</PRE>
<P>Your network is down or cannot be reached.  Contact your system administrator.
 



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x64)... 
ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x65)...</PRE>
<P>Your remote host is down or cannot be reached.  Contact your system
administrator.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x24) -  
no privilege for attempted operation.</PRE>
<P>Permission to perform the requested operation was denied. Verify that
you have the access privileges assigned correctly on your system.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0xF4) -  network partner exited.</PRE>
<P>This message appears if the remote SAS session cannot create a work
directory when you try to establish a session with a remote VMS system.
<P>To resolve this error, change the SET DEF DISK statement in the SAS$CONN.COM
file to a valid directory.  This statement can be removed completely, and
the remote SAS session creates a work directory under the directory it is
being executed from.  This statement should only be used if the user needs
the work directory created in a different location.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed.
ERROR: Remote SIGNON to node name cancelled.</PRE>
<P>This error occurs if the remote node is busy or if the login command
files are long.  In either case, the remote node does not respond in time,
and the local node times out.
<P>To increase the time needed before a connection request times out on
the local node, increase the NCP parameter EXECUTOR OUTGOING TIMER. To increase
the time needed before a connection request times out on the remote node,
increase the NCP parameter EXECUTOR INCOMING TIMER.
<P>The error message is  



<PRE>ERROR:  Network request failed 
(rc 0xF4) - network partner exited. 
ERROR:  Remote SIGNON to nodename cancelled.</PRE>

<P>
<PRE>Network request failed (rc 0x24) - 
no privilege for attempted operation</PRE>
<P>The process that is trying to start the server does not have the SYSNAM
privilege.  



<PRE>Network request failed (rc 0x14) - 
bad parameter value</PRE>
<P>There is probably another SAS/SHARE server or other network object already
running that has the same name.  



<PRE>Network request failed (rc 0xA4) - 
network object is unknown at remote node</PRE>
<P>The server that was specified by the SERVER= option is not running on
the specified node.  



<PRE>Network request failed (rc 0x8C)
- remote node is unknown</PRE>
<P>A two-level server name was used, and the node that was specified is
not known to the user's node.  Make sure that the node name is spelled correctly,
and examine the DECnet database.  



<PRE>Network request failed (rc 0x94) - 
remote node is not currently reachable</PRE>
<P>A two-level server name was used, and the node that was specified is
not reachable.  This usually means that the specified node is down.  



<PRE>Network request failed (rc 0xF4) - 
network partner exited</PRE>
<P>The network request timed out before the connection could be made. 
This usually occurs only if you are auto-starting a server with a LIBNAME
or a PROC OPERATE statement.  Use the server's logs to verify that the server
is not generating any errors when it is being auto-started.  If there are
no server errors, the time out could be caused by the NCP EXECUTOR OUTGOING
TIMER on the user's node, the NCP EXECUTOR INCOMING TIMER on the server's
node, or the NCP EXECUTOR INACTIVITY TIMER on either node. If this occurs
often, you should increase the NCP EXECUTOR INCOMING, OUTGOING, and/or INACTIVITY
TIMER values until they are long enough for the connection to complete. Refer
to your DECnet documentation for information about the values for these timers
and how to change them.
