LIST's Newsletter<br>
July, 2002

</center>
<br>

This month, we have exciting news about the Scholars Portal project, 
as well as an update on the C41 classroom move that will accommodate the 
move of Video Resources? production equipment from ECA to Hayden.
<p><br>

<h3>Scholars Portal comes to the Libraries</h3>

The ASU Libraries have partnered with the Association of Research Libraries and 
six major university libraries (including the University of Southern California, 
University of California - San Diego, Dartmouth College, University of Arizona, 
Iowa State University, and the University of Utah) to implement a Scholar?s Portal 
using software developed by Fretwell Downing, Inc. (FD).  Dean Schmidt actively 
pursued this project for ASU, realizing it would greatly enhance our ability to 
provide seamless access to electronic resources.  
<p>
ASU?s Scholars? Portal will become the centerpiece of the ASU Libraries? web site.  
The goal of the Scholars Portal Project is to provide a single point of access on 
the Web to find high-quality information resources and, to the greatest extent 
possible, to deliver the information and related services directly to the user?s 
desktop. The initial implementation of the Scholars Portal Project will use FD?s 
ZPORTAL as a base. ZPORTAL will be deployed to deliver cross-domain searching of 
licensed and openly available content in a range of subject fields and from multiple 
institutions. The portal will aggregate and integrate the results of the search, and 
support delivery of the content to the user.
<p>
It is anticipated that in most academic environments (including ASU), the tools 
developed through the Scholars Portal Project will function as a library channel 
within a university-wide portal. Plans call for expanding the number of participating 
libraries over the course of the three-year project.
<p>
Scott Herrington will serve as the project manager for the implementation of the ASU 
Scholar?s Portal, with Qunying Li serving as assistant project manager.  They will 
work with several work groups, each assigned a different responsibility for successful 
implementation of this project, and all working together as a project management team.  
The core team includes Philip Konomos, Steve Tanner (Technical Support), Pam Dunlock 
(Authentication), Ginny Sylvester (Desktop Delivery), Jeanne Richardson (Electronic 
Resources/Collections), Deborah Koshinsky (Interface Design/Training), Dennis Brunning, 
and Jennie Duvernay (Web Integration/Redesign).

<h3>New Locations for C-41 Classroom, Video Production</h3>

The C-41 classroom is being moved to Hayden C-6. The remodeling of the area of C-6 
allocated to the classroom is progressing as scheduled with an expected completion date 
of August 1st.  When the classroom is re-equipped with the workstations from C-41, there 
will be something new added to the C-6 West Computer Classroom.  We?re installing wireless 
Ethernet on all of the student and instructor?s workstations. This will be a secure and 
seamless connection to all ASU electronic resources and the Internet. This solution avoids 
the time and money required for a traditional wired network as well as simplifying network 
integration. 
<p>
Video production will be moving from Engineering Center A-wing to Hayden C-41 and C-42 on 
Friday, July 19th.
