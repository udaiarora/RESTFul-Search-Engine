&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1999, the Arizona State University Academic Senate

appointed an Ad Hoc

<br>Committee on Health Insurance to review health insurance benefits available

to

<br>university employees. That committee surveyed faculty, academic professionals,

service

<br>professionals, and classified staff asking questions about the plan

selected, the reasons for

<br>selection, preferences for benefits, and identification of additional

benefits for which the

<br>employee would be willing to pay more.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ad Hoc Committee identified two goals. First,

the committee wanted to raise

<br>university awareness of the issues surrounding the adequacy and availability

of employee

<br>health insurance benefits. Second, the committee hoped to identify

a variety of

<br>reasonably priced health care plans from among which employees could

choose in order

<br>to meet different major needs.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASU surveyed benefits-eligible employees twice in

1999 with regard to health

<br>insurance benefits. Employees were divided into the following categories:

Faculty,

<br>Classified Staff, Academic Professional, Administrative, and Service

Professional. At the

<br>Time, ASU employees had the option of participating in the following

plans: CIGNA

<br>HMO, United (Health Partners) DA HMO, United (Health Partners) PCP

HMO,

<br>Intergroup HMO, Intergroup Indemnity Plus, Intergroup Medical Savings

Account, and

<br>PacifiCare HMO. Employees were asked questions about their current

coverage and

<br>about factors that would influence future choices.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Survey results indicate that both cost and coverage

influenced the plans chosen.

<br>The majority of employees surveyed indicated a willingness to pay more

for greater

<br>freedom of choice in specialists. Faculty expressed a willingness to

pay more for greater

<br>freedom of choice in primary care physician. Faculty, Academic Professionals

and

<br>Service Professionals were willing to pay more for greater freedom

of choice in out-of-

<br>area benefits. The survey also revealed that although employees generally

report having

<br>received adequate information about their plans, many did not understand

the specifics of

<br>their benefits. The 1999 surveys did not directly address amounts of

co-pays or domestic

<br>partner benefits. However, the latter was addressed in the recent University

Work/Life

<br>Task Force report.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After extensive study regarding benefits, review

of state and university history

<br>with regard to health care packages and consideration of the survey

results, the committee

<br>reached three conclusions:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASU faculty and staff are not well informed about

choosing plans or about

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

the processes for appealing decisions made under individual plans. The

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

ASU Benefits Office has an opportunity to play a more active role in

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

educating ASU employees about the availability of options and employee

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

rights under each plan and in facilitating employee appeals.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health insurance preferences of campus employees may

differ in

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

important ways from preferences of state employees generally. For

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

example, university employees indicate they want greater choices of and

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

access to physicians and specialists. They may also need greater out-of-

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

area benefits to accommodate travel associated with research, professional

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

development and sabbatical leave.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ASU Benefits Office should become more pro-active

in the selection

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

of providers at the state level. Ideally, ASU should actively contribute

to

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

the development of the Request for Proposals and have a seat on the

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

selection committee that reviews proposals. The appointed faculty

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

representative should possess the appropriate expertise to represent

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

completely the university?s interests with respect to health insurance

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

benefits.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reviewing these results in the context of the ongoing

discussions with the

<br>Department of Administration regarding the current RFP, we recommend

that the

<br>university take these additional steps to address employee concerns:

<p>1.&nbsp; Enhance the role of the Academic Senate through the Personnel

Committee to ensure

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the university plays a more active role in

selecting benefits plans;

<br>2.&nbsp; Reorganize and empower the university?s Health Benefits Committee

to play a more

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meaningful role in the process; and

<br>3.&nbsp; Co-ordinate and integrate health insurance issues into the

university?s work-life agenda.
