            I was also the president of our Fellowship of Christian Athletes Club

            my church and I was involved in a small group Bible study. I will
            be studying secondary education with my major in math and minor in
            athletic training. In my free time I loved to read, talk with friends,
            run, and play sports. </font></td>

            Fields Country Day School in Tucson, AZ where I was an active member
            in NHS, Student council, chorus, drama and musical theatre productions.
            Outside of school I enjoy going to dance class, listening to music,
            and traveling. I also offer my services as a Youth Commissioner for
            the Pima County Tucson's Women's Commission. As of right now I am

              Hey, everyone! I have a feeling that we will all be getting to know
              each other very well soon, but here is a little bit of background
              on myself anyway! My name is Celina Munoz, and I'm an 18-year-old
              Virgo. I grew up in Tucson, AZ., but went to high school in Rio
              Rico, AZ. I love traveling and recently went to Spain to study Spanish.
              I definitely plan on studying abroad again in the future. I also
              love cooking and want to own my own restaurant someday. Well, that's
              it for now, but I can't wait to meet everyone.</font></p>

            everyone!! I am a proud graduate of Skyline High School in east Mesa
            (Go Coyotes!). Just like all of you, I was extremely involved in high
            school. I was captain of the varsity cheer team and a member of the
            varsity track team for three years. The list could go on forever but
            I don't want to bore you. This summer I am living one of my dreams.
            I work as an instructor for the National Cheerleaders Association
            (a true honor in the cheerleading world). I am not sure of my major
            just yet but I love science and I love kids. I plan to become a coach
            and help kids strive for excellence, just as my coaches have done
            for me. I feel very honored to a member of LSP, and I can't wait to
            get to know all of you. It is going to be a great year!!! </font></td>

            working out at the gym, singing, watching Broadway shows, and playing
            with my dog Polly. I am ecstatic about attending ASU and being a part
            of the Leadership Scholarship Program. My major is Biology, but basically
            I am pre-med, so hopefully after 8 long years of education I will
