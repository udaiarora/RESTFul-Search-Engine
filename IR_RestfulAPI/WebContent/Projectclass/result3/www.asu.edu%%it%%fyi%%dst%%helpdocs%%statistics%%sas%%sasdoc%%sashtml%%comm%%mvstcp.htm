<DD>The TCP/IP access method for the OS/390 host uses routines
in the SAS/C Transient Library for
communications services. This library relies on an underlying layer of TCP/IP
communications software such as IBM TCP/IP Version 2, Release 2.1 or a subsequent
release for OS/390.
<P>You must perform the following tasks or have knowledge of the following
issues to configure the TCP/IP access method for SAS/CONNECT and SAS/SHARE: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Install
the
SAS/C Transient
Library.<P>

<LI>Understand the function of network configuration files.<P>

<LI>Understand the search order for locating network configuration
files.<P>

<LI>Understand the search order for locating host names and Internet
addresses.<P>

<LI>Know about configuration file-naming conventions.<P>

<LI>Redirect error output with the SASCTCPE
DDname.<P>
</UL>
<P></DD>

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5"><A name="zap">Installing the SAS/C Transient Library</A></FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>You should have already installed the SAS/C Transient
Library. If you have not, the installation steps are provided in this section.
<P>The TCP/IP access method requires the SAS/C Transient
Library, which is included with both SAS/CONNECT and SAS/SHARE.
<P>If your site is running Release 5.50 of
the
SAS/C Transient
Library, either you must re-install it, thereby replacing it with a later
version, or you must apply zap Z5500974 to your installed library. The zap
is included on the install tape and is described in usage notes.
<P>Steps for installing the SAS/C Transient
Library follow: 
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>With the install tape mounted, install the SAS/C Transient
Library.
<P>The CNTL data set member ULCTRANL contains JCL that is updated with
job, &amp;<B>prefix</B>, and allocation information that you supplied
in the SASEDITP member.  If you run this job as supplied, it unloads the SAS/C Transient
Library Release 5.50 or a subsequent release from your install tape to a data
set named  <B>&amp;prefix</B>.SASC.TRANSLIB.<P>

<LI>If you want to change the library name (for compatibility with
a particular SAS release), you can do so by setting library name DSN= in the
SASCTRAN DD statement in the IEFBR14 step, and in the DDOT0 DD statement in
the IEBCOPY step.<P>

<LI>Submit the job and verify successful completion.<P>

<LI>To allocate the SAS/C Transient
Library for SAS execution, you may use either of the following options: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Change your SAS CLIST to add a CTRANS allocation as follows:  



<PRE>ALLOC F(CTRANS) DA('<I>&amp;prefix</I>.SASC.TRANSLIB') 
      SHR &amp;SU11</PRE><P>

<LI>Change your SAS cataloged procedure to allocate the SAS/C Transient
Library as follows:  



<PRE>// CTRANS DD DSN=<I>&amp;prefix</I>.SASC.TRANSLIB,
          DISP=SHR</PRE><P>
</UL>
<P>

<LI>For SAS/SHARE only, change
the started task JCL for your server.<P>
</OL>
 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose to install your SAS/C Transient
Library to a link-list data set, you do not need to allocate it in your CLIST
and in your cataloged procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">Understanding the Function of Network Configuration Files</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>The
operation of the TCP/IP access method depends on its ability
to access network configuration information from particular site-specific
files. The specific filenames are based on the particular vendor TCP/IP product.
<BR><H3>IBM TCP/IP Network Configuration Files</H3>


<P>SAS software uses the IBM 
TCPIP.DATA  file or  TCPPARMS  file
to determine resolver configuration and IBM defaults. SAS searches the following
locations for configuration data sets in this order: 
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>Data set identified by the DDname
SYSTCPD<P>

<LI><B>tsoprefix</B>.TCPIP.DATA<P>

<LI>SYS1.TCPPARMS
(TCPDATA)<P>

<LI>TCPIP.TCPIP.DATA<P>
</OL>

<P>If your configuration file is not in one of the default locations, you
may specify its location by setting the TCPIPPRF SAS option to the TCP/IP
prefix of your IBM files. For example, if your TCPIP.DATA file is installed
in SYS2.VER2.TCP.TCPIP.DATA, you should set the TCPIPPRF option to SYS2.VER2.TCP.
<P>If you do not use IBM defaults for resolver configuration or you do
not maintain a name server, see <A href="#zchorder">Understanding the Search Order for Locating Network Configuration Files</A>
for information about the rules for searching for configuration files. 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  SAS/C  Transient Library
does not support the IBM TCP/IP files HOSTS.LOCAL and HOSTS.SITEINFO. The
previous SAS TCP/IP access method used these files through the Pascal Transient
Library Services (Release 6.07 and 6.08 TS404).&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<BR><H3><A name="z0235492">Setting SAS/C Environment Variables with the SASCTCPV DDname</A></H3>


<P>You can set the
SAS/C environment
variables that are used in the configuration data set selection by including
a data set with the special ddname SASCTCPV. If a data set with this ddname
is allocated to the SAS session, then its contents are read during the TCP
access method initialization. Each logical record is assumed to contain an
environment variable assignment of the form:



<PRE><I>environment_variable_name</I>=<I>value</I></PRE>
<P>For example, if all your configuration files existed under the TCPIP_PREFIX
names, you could include the following in your SASCTCPV data set:



<PRE>//SASCTCPV DD *
TCPIP_PREFIX=TCPCURR
/*</PRE>
<P>If any of the SAS options controlling configuration data sets are specified,
they will override the values that are set in the SASCTCPV data set. For example,
the SAS option TCPIPPRF will take precedence over a TCPIP_PREFIX assignment
in the SASCTCPV data set.
<BR><H3>Interlink TCP/IP Network Configuration Files</H3>


<P>Interlink
provides an LSCNCOM interface to the  SAS/C 
Transient Library. You should place the LSCNCOM routine and its alias L$CNCOM,
 in the link-list search order before the module that is supplied by SAS.
The routine is dynamically loaded when the first call to the SAS socket library
function is made. SAS searches the following locations for configuration data
sets in this order: 
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>STEPLIB<P>

<LI>LLA<P>

<LI>LPA<P>

<LI>link
list.<P>
</OL>

<P>SAS uses the Interlink name resolver and the ICSRSLV option to determine
the order in which the Interlink name resolver (DNR) and the SAS/C resolver
are used.
<P>For details about the LSCNCOM interface, see the Interlink documentation.

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5"><A name="zchorder">Understanding the Search Order for Locating Network Configuration Files</A></FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>An explanation of the search logic that is used by the  SAS/C 
Transient Library is contained in the following sections.
<P>The file that contains configuration information usually has a name
that is derived from the equivalent UNIX filename; for example, the OS/390
data set name  ETC.HOSTS  is derived from the UNIX filename 


<CODE><B>/etc/hosts</B></CODE>.
<P>The SAS/C Transient Library uses
the following search logic to locate the file that contains configuration
information: 
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>Under TSO, it searches for a data set name that is composed of
the user userid prefix and the name that is derived from the UNIX filename.<P>

<LI>It searches for a data set name that is derived from the UNIX
filename, 


<CODE><B>hosts</B></CODE>.<P>

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5"><A name="dummy">Understanding the Search Order for Locating Host Names and Internet Addresses</A></FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>The SAS/C Transient
Library uses the following search logic to locate host names and Internet
addresses: 
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>RESOLV.CONF file using the rules given in <A href="#zolvconf">RESOLV.CONF File Search Order</A>. If the
SAS/C Transient
Library finds the RESOLV.CONF file, it performs the requested queries through
the SAS/C resolver, and it returns
any answer it receives. If attempts to connect to name servers are refused,
it uses the logic in step 3.<P>

<LI>Data set in the format of the IBM TCP/IP file TCPIP.DATA. The
search rules for this data set are the same as the search rules used by IBM
TCP/IP. 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Data set identified by the DDname SYSTCPD. If found, the filename
is passed to FOPEN.<P>

<LI><B>tso-prefix</B>.TCPIP.DATA under TSO.<P>

<LI>SYS1.TCPPARMS (TCPDATA) data
set.<P>

<LI>TCPIP.TCPIP.DATA.<P>

<LI>Default value of TCPIPPRF and searches for 
<B>default-value.</B>TCPIP.DATA.<P>
</UL>
<P>

<LI>If attempts to connect to name servers that are defined in TCPIP.DATA
are refused, the library looks for a HOSTS file by using the rules given in <A href="#zostfile">HOSTS File Search Order</A>. If the library finds
a HOSTS file, it returns the result, including failure.<P>
</OL>

<P>Determining the domain name in name-server queries follows the same
logic as the UNIX operating system follows when it uses the domain statement
of the  RESOLV.CONF  file.  Name-server addresses are also determined from
the RESOLV.CONF file.
<P>The SAS/C Transient Library recognizes
only the first three name servers specified in this file. Both the UNIX operating
system and the SAS/C environment have
a limit of three name servers.
<BR><H3>Knowing about the HOSTS File</H3>


<P>The HOSTS
file contains Internet address and host-name pairs with an optional alias.
<P>You use either the HOSTS file or the resolver program to locate host
name and Internet address equivalents.
<P>Use the following format to create a HOSTS file:  



<PRE><I>Internet-address</I> <I>host-name</I> <I>optional-alias</I></PRE>
<P>Example:  



<PRE>127.0.0.1       localhost                 loopback
151.174.130.8   bigserver.yourcompany.com bigserver
151.174.130.27  copland.yourcompany.com   copland
151.174.130.28  ives.yourcompany.com      ives
151.174.130.29  byrd.yourcompany.com      byrd</PRE>
<P>If you have access to a UNIX system, see the 


<CODE><B>hosts</B></CODE>(4) manual page for
more information.
<P>If you have access to a UNIX system, you are advised to copy the 


<CODE><B>hosts</B></CODE> file from the UNIX system to the OS/390 system and customize
it as necessary. Doing this prevents typographical errors that may occur if
you create a new file.
<BR><H3><A name="zostfile">HOSTS File Search Order</A></H3>


<P>The SAS/C
Transient
Library searches for the HOSTS file, in the following order: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>value of ETC_HOSTS environment variable, if defined in the SASCTCPV
file<P>

<LI><B>tso-prefix</B>.ETC.HOSTS under TSO or <B>userid</B>.ETC.HOSTS
under batch execution<P>

<LI>ETC.HOSTS<P>

<LI>TCPIP.ETC.HOSTS<P>

<LI><B>tcpip-prefix</B>.ETC.HOSTS, if TCPIPPRF is set to a
value.<P>
</UL>

<BR><H3>Knowing about the SERVICES File</H3>


<P>The SERVICES
file contains a service name, port number, protocol group with an optional
alias. For SAS/SHARE, you must specify
server names and port assignments in the SERVICES file. For SAS/CONNECT,
the default TELNET port number is used.
<P>If you have access to a UNIX system, see the  


<CODE><B>services</B></CODE>(4)  manual page for more information.
<P>If you have access to a UNIX system, you are advised to copy the 


<CODE><B>services</B></CODE> file from the UNIX system to the OS/390 system and customize
it as necessary. Doing this prevents typographical errors that may occur if
you create a new file.
<P>See <A href="z0140816.htm#zservice">Configuring the Server in the SERVICES File</A>
for details about the SERVICES file.
<BR><H3>SERVICES File Search Order</H3>


<P>The SAS/C
Transient
Library searches for the SERVICES file, in the following order: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>value of ETC_SERVICES environment variable, if defined in the
SASCTCPV file<P>

<LI><B>tso-prefix</B>.ETC.SERVICES under TSO or <B>userid</B>.ETC.SERVICES under batch

<LI>ETC.SERVICES<P>

<LI>TCPIP.ETC.SERVICES<P>

<LI><B>tcpip-prefix</B>.ETC.SERVICES, if TCPIPPRF is set to
a value.<P>
</UL>

<BR><H3>Knowing about the RESOLV.CONF File</H3>


<P>The
RESOLV.CONF file contains Internet address and corresponding host-name pairs
within the domain. This file is used by the resolver program to find addresses
of name servers that are used to locate host-name and Internet address equivalents.
<P>You will use either the HOSTS file or the resolver program to locate
host name and Internet address equivalents.
<P>Use the following format to create a RESOLV.CONF file:  



<PRE><I>host-name</I> <I>Internet-address</I></PRE>
<P>Example:  



<PRE>domain     yourcompany.com
nameserver 151.174.166.251
nameserver 151.174.52.151
nameserver 151.174.52.113</PRE>
<P>If you have access to a UNIX system, see the  


<CODE><B>resolver</B></CODE>(4)  manual page for more information.
<P>If you have access to a UNIX system, you are advised to copy the RESOLV.CONF
file from the UNIX system to the OS/390 system, and customize it as necessary.
Doing so prevents typographical errors that may occur if you create a new
file.

<TR valign="bottom"><TD><HR></TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">Knowing about Configuration File Naming Conventions</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>SAS searches for configuration files by the common default prefix
TCPIP. It is stored in a 26-character string array in L$CNDBA in the SAS/C Transient
Library. The SERVICES file, for example, is named TCPIP.ETC.SERVICES.  You
may override this default using one of the following methods: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Designate the default high-level qualifier ETC.<P>

<LI>Designate the default prefix
TCPIP.<P>

<LI>Substitute an alternate prefix for the default TCPIP prefix by
using a zap.<P>

<LI>Set the TCPIPPRF option.<P>
</UL>

<P>All but one of these methods sets a prefix in the system. However, setting
the TCPIPPRF option, affects only the invoking user's current session. 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most sites already have these files available for existing TCP/IP applications.
 If your site already has TCP/IP applications running under the SAS/C library,
this step was probably completed when the SAS/C Transient
Library was installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<BR><H3>Using the ETC High-Level Qualifier</H3>


<P>The
ETC high-level qualifier prepends a configuration file name with the ETC prefix;
for example, ETC.HOSTS and ETC.SERVICES. 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When using the ETC prefix,
do not set the  TCPIPPRF  option to override the ETC high-level qualifier
and do not apply the zap to change the default value of the TCPIP prefix in
the SAS/C Transient Library. See <A href="#zapper">Applying a Zap to Change the Default TCPIP Prefix</A> for more information.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<BR><H3>Using the TCPIP Default Prefix</H3>


<P>If
you cannot use ETC at your site and if DS names do not conflict with the ETC
high-level qualifier, you may use the default prefix to produce names such
as TCPIP.ETC.HOSTS. 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When using the TCPIP prefix, do not set the
TCPIPPRF option to override the TCPIP prefix, and do not apply the zap to
change the default value of the TCPIP prefix in the SAS/C Transient
Library. See the next section for details about the default TCPIP prefix.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<BR><H3><A name="zapper">Applying a Zap to Change the Default TCPIP Prefix</A></H3>


<P>To change the default TCPIP prefix, you may apply zap number Z5504151,
which is included on the SAS software install tape and is documented in usage
notes.
<P>For example, to produce this SERVICES file



<PRE>SYS.PROD.CONFIG.ETC.SERVICES</PRE>
<P>specify a TCPIP prefix of  SYS.PROD.CONFIG  by using the zap.
<BR><H3>Setting the TCPIPPRF Option to the TCPIP Prefix Value</H3>


<P>The
TCPIPPRF option initializes a filename prefix for the current
SAS session. Each session that uses the TCP/IP access method (SAS/CONNECT local
and remote hosts and SAS/SHARE server
and clients) must set this option at initialization time. For example, to
produce this configuration file  



<PRE>SYS2.VER2.TCP.ETC.HOSTS</PRE>
<P>set the TCPIPPRF option to SYS2.VER2.TCP as follows:  



<PRE>sas ... options ('TCPIPPRF=SYS2.VER2.TCP')</PRE>

<P>To document
the operating behavior of the SAS/C Transient
Library, the SAS/C libraries write

or the SASCTCPE DDname to SYSOUT. The DDname of SASCTCPE is reserved to contain
the redirection of library error messages.
<P>To prevent the writing of informational and error messages to your terminal
screen, you can direct SASCTCPE to DUMMY.
<P>If you have trouble making a TCP/IP connection, you may want to direct
SASCTCPE to a SYSOUT data set or to a permanent file in the local or the remote
SAS execution as a troubleshooting aid.
<P>You have completed the TCP/IP configuration process.
