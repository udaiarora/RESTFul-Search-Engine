      <h2>ASU master's degree program tackles national bilingual professional 
        shortage</h2>
      <p> As the number of non-native English speakers grows throughout the nation, 
        there is a need for professionals to serve that population. One ASU program 
        is helping to meet those needs with a specialized curriculum to prepare 
        bilingual speech-language pathologists.</p>
      <p>The ASU Bilingual Training Program, supported with funds from U.S. Department 
        of Education Office of Special Education Programs, is part of the master's 
        degree program in the speech and hearing science department. </p>
      <p>The bilingual training track is one of four curriculum options for graduate 
        students in the speech-language pathology program. Program students who 
        are awarded federally-funded traineeships work as speech-language pathologists 
        in a public school setting for a period of two years for every year they 
        receive assistance. </p>
      <p>"We have an incredible group of graduate students preparing to work with 
        the population of ESL (English as a Second Language) children who have 
        speech and language disorders," says Kathy Murphy, coordinator of the 
        program. "Living in the Southwest we are all aware of the increasing number 
        of children who are entering our public schools with limited skills in 
        English. Unfortunately there's a dire shortage of professionals who are 
        truly qualified to meet the needs of these children."</p>
      <p>Murphy says in the Valley alone, speech-language professionals in the 
        public schools are working with a diverse group of children with disabilities 
        who speak more than 60 different languages. One of the primary challenges 
        for professionals is to determine whether a child who is experiencing 
        language-learning problems has an underlying speech-language disorder 
        or if their identified problems are related to learning a new language.</p>
      <p>"It's the first question a speech-language pathologist needs to address 
        and it's difficult to answer without adequate training and appropriate 
        assessment tools," says Murphy.</p>
      <p>Unlike many graduate training programs throughout the nation where the 
        students participate in internships in their final few semesters, ASU's 
        students in the bilingual training track are working with professionals 
        in the field from the first week in the program.</p>
      <p>Through partnerships with more than 15 school districts around the Valley, 
        students spend one morning per week training with a local public school 
        speech-language pathologist who has experience working with multicultural 
        children. Every few weeks, students rotate to another school district. 
        By the end of the first year, the students will have trained in a minimum 
        of eight different school districts with more than 10 professionals, gaining 
        experience working with a very diverse group of children in grades K-12. 
        In the second year of the program, the ASU students will complete two 
        full-time internships at public school settings, often selecting a site 
        that prepares them to work with a specific age group or type of disorder.</p>
      <p>"I looked into a lot of schools and found that ASU had a strong clinical 
        focus and was one of the only schools in the nation with a bilingual training 
        program," says first-year student Julie Kleinheinz. "Being bilingual alone 
        doesn't mean you know how to work with multicultural populations. Our 
        program coursework and clinical training prepares us for understanding 
        the needs and challenges of working with kids of all cultures and language 
        backgrounds."</p>
      <p>Murphy says the training program also targets the needs of Valley speech-language 
        professionals who are already employed. Murphy says these professionals 
        are encouraged to enroll in the specialized academic coursework in the 
        master's program or participate in semi-annual workshops presented by 
        nationally recognized experts.</p>
