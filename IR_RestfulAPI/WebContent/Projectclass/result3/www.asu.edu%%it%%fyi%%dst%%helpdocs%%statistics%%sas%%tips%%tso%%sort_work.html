How to Increase Default Temporary Space?
</center></h2>
<P>
I am running a SAS program on TSO and I am getting the following error 
message. 
<p>
ERROR: Sort failed during output after writing 32510 observations 
successfully. <br>
ERROR: Insufficient space in file WORK.DEMO1.DATA.
<p>
It seems that the temporary work space is not large enough. I keep
increasing the region and time but it still fails. 
<p> 
The default WORK space available for SAS files is 
"SPACE=(6144,(500,200),,,ROUND)" which is approximately 525 tracks.  
However, you can add the following JCL statement after your EXEC statement to 
request more space.
<p> 
//WORK   DD   UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(p,s))
<p> 
Where 'p' is the number of cylinders for primary allocation and 's' for
secondary allocation. Furthermore, there are 15 tracks in one cylinder.
