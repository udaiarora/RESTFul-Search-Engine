<i>Abstract:</i> We calculate the discrepancy ratio of gate voltage shift between charge trapped throughout the oxide and its equivalent charge density and centroid. The trapped charge density is underestimated if we extract trapped charge and its centroid from the measured lateral gate voltage shift without considering the transmission coefficient change due to charge trapped within a tunneling distance. For the thin gate oxide (<img src="../images/approx.gif" alt="approx. ">9.5 nm) polysilicon gate MOS capacitors after constant current stress, <img src="../images/delta.gif" alt="delta-">VG, <img src="../images/delta.gif" alt="delta-">VFB and effective barrier height measurements showed that negative charges are trapped within the tunneling distance of both sides of the oxide.<p>
