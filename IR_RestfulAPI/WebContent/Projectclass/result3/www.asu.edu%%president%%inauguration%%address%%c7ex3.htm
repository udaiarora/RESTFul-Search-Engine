The cohort         will lay the ground work for positioning Arizona State University as the         leading academic institution in the nation in the heretofore undeveloped         area of intellectual discourse in matters related to American Indian culture         and its implications in the context of the broader American culture. </p>      <p> The presence of a critical mass of scholars encourages constructive         dialogue and the evolution of a given sphere of inquiry. It is all the         more essential in a developing field such as American Indian studies.         The initiative will encourage scholars from a spectrum of disciplines         to offer differing perspectives. Teaching and research related to American         Indian culture has been underway at Arizona State University for decades,         but the American Indian initiative will prove transformational in the         development of the field, and confirm the university&#8217;s commitment         to programs that are socially relevant.</p>      <p> Of particular interest to me is the discussion of enhancing cultural         understanding and cultural linkages between the larger, broader general         American cultural and the American Indian cultures of Arizona and the         Southwest. </p>            &nbsp;<BR> </td>    <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
