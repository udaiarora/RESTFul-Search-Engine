      <h2>ABOR moves universities forward with policy changes</h2>
      <p>        The Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) has made several substantive steps
          over the past year to increase quality and further the mission of the
      state's three research universities. </p>
      <p>Under the leadership of President
            Jack Jewett of Tucson, the 13-member board has revised several policies
            aimed at giving each university the
          flexibility to seek its own distinctive identity and increase accessibility
        to higher education.</p>
      <p>Jewett says the board's newly-implemented Changing
          Directions Initiative is designed with three goals in mind - make Arizona
          universities more
          inclusive, improve the state's student success rates and equip students
        with the skills necessary to meet the state's workforce needs.</p>
      <p>"These
          goals can and will be accomplished if the universities are allowed
        greater flexibility to play a more centralized role in determining their
        institution's policy and outcomes," he said.</p>
      <p>The board's first of three
          major policy revisions came in January when it eliminated all previous
          reference to program delivery within geographical
          boundaries. The move enables each university to now pursue addressing
        regional needs across the state.</p>
      <p>Prior to the policy change, each Arizona
          university was guaranteed the right to deliver specific services within
          prearranged geographical boundaries
          without competition from its sister institutions. With the protected
          boundaries removed, university presidents are now responsible for coordinating
          program delivery as to avoid unnecessary duplication of services, one
        major component of the Changing Directions Initiative. </p>
      <p>A second ABOR
          policy change allows universities to differentiate tuition by academic
          levels, degree programs and delivery methods - and for the
        first time - address financial aid within the context of setting tuition.</p>
      <p>In
          doing so, Jewett says universities now have a mechanism to substantially
          increase tuition according to their needs while making higher education
        more affordable for financially disadvantaged families. </p>
      <p>The third policy
          revision removes the 25 percent cap on nonresident enrollment to allow
          universities to register a mix of students that is more congruent
          with each campus. The new policy mandates the presidents ensure that
          qualified Arizona residents will be given full access to university
        programs and services.</p>
      <p>The board approved a 2003 - 04 academic year tuition increase
          on March 6 that is tied to an enhanced financial aid package for resident
          undergraduates.
          The board says the increase in financial aid packages - worth more
        than $22 million system-wide - offers greater access to the public university
        system while protecting low-income families.</p>
      <p>In approving the tuition
          increase, the board effectively moved the Arizona University System
        from the 50th position among the 50 states into the
          34th position, well within the board's goal of maintaining a position
          ranked for affordability in the top of the lower one-third of senior
        public institutions. </p>
      <p>Regent Gary Stewart of Phoenix said by approving
          the tuition increase, the board is effectively creating much needed
        funding to maintain quality
        institutions and increase access. </p>
      <p>When the board unanimously approved
          in April to establish new admission requirements, Jewett said the last
          cornerstone was laid for full implementation
          of the board's Changing Direction Initiative. The new admissions policy
          becomes effective for the 2006 freshman class. It assures the top 25
          percent of graduating Arizona high school seniors who have no curricular
          deficiencies will be accepted to the three universities. The board
        agreed that phasing in the policy would give adequate leeway for future
        college-bound
          seniors to prepare to meet the revised admission standards.<br>
        Formerly, the universities used grade-point averages and standardized
          test scores as criteria for assured admissions, however these measures
        have now been eliminated by the revised policy. </p>
      <p>The new policy also delegates
          authority to the universities to admit students eligible for what was
          formerly designed as "conditional admission."
          This allows universities to review admissions of student applications
          on a case-by-case basis where academic deficiencies exist. This designation
          was changed to Delegated Admission and will require students to have
          a class rank at least in the second quartile, or at least a 2.5 grade-point
          average. Applicants with extenuating circumstances who do not meet
        the minimum qualifications have the opportunity for an appeal.</p>
      <p>"It is important
          that the universities consider many factors for admitting students
        to our public institutions," said ABOR President-elect Chris
          Herstam of Phoenix. "I think this action is critical to ensuring a
        fair and reasonable opportunity for admission for all students."</p>
      <p>"I am impressed
          with the outstanding and visionary leadership of the board," said ASU
          President Michael Crow. "The new policies are milestones
          in the continuing process of achieving further excellence and positioning
        ASU as the New American University."</p>
      <p>The board approved several new facilities
          for ASU to increase its world-class stature, including the Arizona
        Biodesign Institute (AzBio), the $69-million
          project centerpiece of ASU's multi-phase biodesign corridor. AzBio
        will provide an intellectual and physical environment to allow the state
        to
        compete in the global bioscience and technology marketplace.</p>
      <p>The board
          gave support to ASU's plans to build new residence halls which supports
          ASU's mission to become a more fully residential campus. The
          board also gave approval for ASU to lease space at the Brickyard complex
          on Mill Avenue in Tempe to house the Institute for Computer and Information
          Sciences and Engineering (ICISE). The move allows ASU to centralize
        its key academic and research programs in computer science, and extend
        partnerships
          across the campus. The expected outcome is to enhance ASU's computer
          science department to a top-rank program. <br>
        In April, the board adopted a charter for Arizona Biomedical Collaborative
          for Education, Research and Health Policy (ABC), a new organizational
          entity to address and facilitate biomedical education and research
          needs of the state. </p>
      <p>Representatives of higher education and the health care
          industry are currently working on a comprehensive statewide plan to
        expedite a collaborative
          nursing training program at all academic levels, and nursing faculty
          training at the masters and doctoral levels to better address the state's
        professional healthcare shortages. </p>
      <p>ABC will also foster and coordinate
          research of interdisciplinary teams of scientists from the Arizona
        University System, community colleges
            and Arizona Health Sciences Center. The partnership will share expertise
            for advancing treatments and possible cures for several diseases
        such as pancreatic cancer and melanoma, diabetes, Alzheimer's and heart
            disease. A focused relationship with the Translational Genomics Research
            Institute
            and International Genomics Consortium will be a key element in fostering
          translational research.</p>
