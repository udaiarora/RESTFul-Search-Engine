  shall serve in a policy-forming and advisory capacity in the study, clarification, and formulation of
  policies and procedures affecting academic professionals at Arizona State University, including
  branch campuses, where appropriate.  The Committee, although subject to the Provost's requests
  and to charges originating  from that Office, shall also function autonomously in performing the
  organizational aspects of its duties.  It shall independently gather appropriate data for issues which
  are ultimately sent forward to the Provost's Office as recommendations.  The Committee is
  responsible for taking requests from individual academic professionals to the Provost's Advisory
  Committee and the Provost.
<P>
  
  <a name="policies"></a>
<ol type="1">
  <li><b>Academic Professional Policies and Procedures</b>
    
    <P>The Committee shall develop and revise as needed academic professional policies and
      procedures for approval by the Provost's Office.  Included policies and procedures related to
      annual evaluations, governance, salary adjustments, and other issues related to academic
      professionals.  The Committee shall ensure that these policies and procedures are made known to
      new academic professionals through various activities including coordination of distribution via
      the Office of the Provost and presentation at new academic professional orientations.
    <p>
        
      <a name="liaison"></a>
  <li><b>Liaison with Other Groups</b>
    <P>The Committee shall promote communication and understanding with other academic groups
      such as the Academic Professional Caucus, the Provost's Advisory Committee on Academic
      Professionals, and the Academic Professional Grievance Committee, and shall act as the official
      liaison between the Academic Assembly Senate and academic professionals.
    <P>
  <ol type="a">

    Advisory Committee on Academic Professionals and the Academic Professional Caucus.

      community and the relative size of the various subunits.  At any time, the Committee shall have
      only one member from any academic unit, except that the larger colleges/units may have up to
      two members on the Committee because of the large portion of academic professionals that such
      a unit comprises.  Over an appropriate period of time, the Committee shall include members from
      all other colleges and other University units or off-campus units.  As a guideline, those units with
      larger numbers of academic professionals shall be represented more often, but over a period of
