      <h2><strong>ASU, TGen to Tackle  Fundamental Question of Evolution </strong></h2>
      <p>Taking advantage of resources available through the Phoenix area's genome-sequencing powerhouse Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), biochemists at Arizona State University will soon be sequencing the genomes of an important group of bacteria whose specialized biochemistry may be of great value to biotechnology. </p>
      <p>The scientists hope that these organisms, which are all "green" or photosynthetic bacteria, may help answer one of science's biggest questions: how the world-changing process of photosynthesis first evolved. In turn, understanding this history will help biotechnology harness the some of life's most sophisticated and powerful chemical processes. </p>
      <p>ASU biochemist Robert Blankenship, the project's principal investigator, and co-principal investigator Jeffrey Touchman, a faculty member in ASU's School of Life Sciences, a researcher in the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University and also an Investigator and Director of DNA Sequencing at TGen, have recently been awarded a 3-year, $1.3 million dollar grant from the National Science foundation to sequence the complete genomes of four key species of bacteria. </p>
      <p>The genetic information to be acquired by the project, when combined with information already available from more than a dozen other photosynthetic bacteria, may contain missing information that will explain the mysterious evolution of photochemistry -- the almost incomprehensibly complex biomolecular machines that transfer light into chemical energy and power our entire biosphere. </p>
      <p>"These are very interesting bacteria, all with some scientific or economic importance, but the basic reason why we all wanted to do this is that it will provide a lot of new information to help us really get at the question of the origins of the evolution of photosynthesis," said Blankenship. "By having a whole new collection of genomes to work on we'll be able to really test some of our ideas about lateral gene transfer and the various mechanisms involved in the evolution of photosynthesis." </p>
      <p>Lateral gene transfer - the exchange of genes between different species of bacteria - has been proposed by Blankenship and others as one of the ways by which critical biochemical breakthroughs like photosynthesis evolve, as biochemical complexes and the metabolic processes they control combine or are transformed to form new kinds of biomolecular machinery. </p>
      <p>In past research, Blankenship and his team analyzed the currently available genomic data and found that there were clear relationships between the genes responsible for photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation and other important metabolic processes across a broad spectrum of different evolutionary lines of bacteria and bacteria-like organisms. The genetic similarities indicated that genetic material had been passed back and forth between different species. Because some critical bacterial genomes had not been sequenced, however, the picture remained incomplete. </p>
      <p>The four organisms to be sequenced are a heliobacterium, <em> Heliobacterium modesticaldum</em>, an aerobic phototrophic bacterium, <em> Roseobacter denitrificans</em>, an alpha proteobacterium, <em> Rhodocista centenaria</em>, and a cyanobacterium, <em> Acaryochloris marina</em>. Each of the bacterial groups these organisms belong to represent important parts of the genetic range of&nbsp; photosynthetic bacteria. </p>
      <p>"This was a very unique opportunity to apply genomics to some basic scientific questions that are being addressed at ASU in the area of photosynthesis, where ASU is nationally recognized as a leader," said Touchman. "My lab does high throughput genomic sequencing. Bob Blankenship and I got together and decided to seize this opportunity since we have the capability now to sequence complete genomes of photosynthetic bacteria right here in Phoenix. It's a natural collaboration." </p>
      <p>"This is not a mainstream project for TGen," Blankenship noted, "but it really helps us out. It provides some important new information for basic science. This is one of the advantages of having TGen here - we now have the ability to mount projects like this, which we couldn't have done before." </p>
      <p>Though the primary objective of the research is to unravel the events in molecular evolution that led to the development of the various versions of photosynthesis that now exist, Blankenship also notes that the organisms involved are in several cases economically important in their own right. </p>
      <p>According to Blankenship, the heliobacterium is capable of nitrogen fixation, an important process that makes nutrients available to plants, and is perhaps significant in the ecology of rice paddies. The aerobic phototropic bacterium is a member of a group of a group of organisms that dominate the microbial biota of the surface of the oceans and other surface waters an thus likely plays a major role in the way the earth absorbs and releases carbon dioxide. The alpha proteobacterium has an unusual life cycle that may provide genetic information important in biotechnology. </p>
      <p>"These organisms are very old, since they are bacteria," noted Touchman. "Though TGen has a large biomedical mission, our findings here will enable us to study the very origins of photosynthesis, when oxygen began to be produced on the planet. In that sense, this research is very profound."</p>
