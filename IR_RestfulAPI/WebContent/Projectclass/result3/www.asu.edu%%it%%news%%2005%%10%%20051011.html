				<h1>Prestigious Technology Conferences Seek Presenters</h1>
				
				<p class="article">Calls for proposals have been issued for technology conferences at <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> that will convene in Spring, 2006. The annual gatherings are the <a href="http://mec.asu.edu">Microcomputers in Education Conference (<acronym title="Microcomputers in Education Conference">MEC</acronym>)</a>, hosted by ASU and the College of Education Alumni Association; and the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/ecure"><acronym title="Preservation and Access for Digital College and University Resources">ECURE</acronym> conference</a>, hosted by ASU Libraries and <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>, with sponsorship from the Coalition for Networked Information.</p>
				<p class="article">MEC is the premier event for educational technology in the southwest, and for 25 years has pursued the mission of connecting technology and education. MEC conference presenters are drawn from <acronym title="Kindergarten through 12th grade">K-12</acronym> and higher education institutions around the country, and include teachers, students, principals, technology directors, instructional leaders, district administrators, IT and business managers, library / media specialists, and technology providers.</p>
				<p class="article">Conference tracks include Curriculum Integration, Distance Learning, Accessibility, Geographic Information Systems, Showcasing Successes, Emerging Technologies and Innovative School Reform. The conference will offer over 100 presentations, workshops, and hands-on labs as well as exhibits featuring new technology for education. Proposals for MEC should be received by the conference committee by November 15, 2005.  The MEC conference will be held on the ASU Tempe Campus March 11 â?? 13, 2006.</p>
				<p class="article">ECURE is an interdisciplinary and interactive event that addresses the issues facing higher education and public sector organizations in managing electronic records and digital resources. The conference encourages dialogue among professions and across institutions with an inclusive format. ASU was recognized in 2003 with the J. Franklin Jameson Award for Archival Advocacy from the Society of American Archivists, for the work done by ECURE in significantly increasing public awareness and appreciation for archives and advancing understanding of electronic records management.</p>
				<p class="article">ECURE is intended for all who work with or have a concern with recordkeeping and data management. Past conference presenters have included faculty, deans, vice provosts, administrators, researchers, research collections directors, attorneys, information systems managers, records managers, government records specialists, library and archival specialists, digital preservation administrators, and consultants. Proceedings from previous conference years can be found in the ECURE Archives.</p>
				<p class="article">The ECURE conference theme for 2006 is biomedical data and related knowledge management systems. There will be a second conference track dedicated to generalized electronic records, institutional repository, and digital asset management issues.</p>
				<p class="article">ECURE is an interactive small-group event. In addition to a presentation session, many speakers will lead one-hour open discussion sessions on the presentation topics to address concerns, projects, solutions and questions brought to the attention of the conference by the attendees. Proposals for the ECURE conference should be received by the conference committee by November 15, 2005. ECURE will be held on the ASU Tempe Campus February 27 â?? March 1, 2006.</p>
