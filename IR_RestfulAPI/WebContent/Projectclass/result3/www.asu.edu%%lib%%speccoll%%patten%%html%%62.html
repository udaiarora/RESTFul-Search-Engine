<P>This is the second edition of the first published work on gardening
in the north of England. The second part, <I>The Country Housewife's Garden</I>,
was one of the first books for women gardeners.&nbsp; The author notes
that since he has had success furnishing "this my Northerne Orchard and
Countrey Garden with needfull plants and usefull herbes," he wants to impart
this knowledge to others.&nbsp; The first part of the book is designed
to give the "best, surest, and readiest way to make a good Orchard and
Garden."&nbsp; In this section the author covers the choosing of a site,
soil preparation, layout, fence design, tree planting, grafting, etc.&nbsp;
Many of these same topics are covered in the second part of the book, the
Country Housewifes Garden, but the emphasis is on herbs and a kitchen garden.
This part also includes information on the husbandry of bees.&nbsp; The
fourth part of this work deals with the art of propagating plants, and
it even has its own index.&nbsp; The final section covers the fruit orchard
and deals with the "true ordering of all sorts of fruits in their due season;
and how couble increase commeth by care in gathering yeere after yeere."
