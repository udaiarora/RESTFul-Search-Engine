      <h2>CoBrA exhibition at ASU Art Museum presents impact of World War II on 
        European art</h2>
      <p> ASU Art Museum presents an exhibition of works from one of Europe's 
        most important post-war art movements when it opens CoBrA: Before, During 
        and After, Works from the Collection of St&eacute;phane Janssen on Feb. 
        8. The exhibition will run through May 11. </p>
      <p> A free public reception from 7-9 p.m., Feb. 8, will launch the exhibition, 
        which presents approximately 80 pieces drawn from one of the world's best 
        collections of work by the CoBrA movement - that of Valley resident St&eacute;phane 
        Janssen.</p>
      <p> Named for Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam, from which the original 
        group came, the CoBrA artists reflect post-World War II malaise and shifts 
        in philosophical thought that followed the devastation of war and genocide. 
        Among the best-known figures in the movement are painters Pierre Alechinsky, 
        Karel Appel and Asger Jorn. However, this exhibition will include work 
        by a number of other artists, lesser known in the United States, including 
        Henry Heerup, Corneille, Christian Dotremont, Reinhoud and Carl Henning 
        Pederson.</p>
      <p>Marilyn Zeitlin, director and chief curator of the ASU Art Museum, said 
        that while the group existed under the CoBrA rubric for only the period 
        of 1948-51, associations among them preceded and endured after this time. 
        For this reason, the ASU Art Museum exhibition will contain works from 
        before and after the official CoBrA time period.</p>
      <p>"The artists of CoBrA took stock of their culture in the aftershock of 
        the horrors of Nazi genocide and the extermination camps," Zeitlin said. 
        "Their work demonstrates a recasting of European traditions and innovation, 
        creating a visual vocabulary for expression of a new worldview."</p>
      <p>The CoBrA artists often worked despite hunger and meager shelter, painting 
        on burlap, cardboard and found objects to compensate for the absence of 
        canvas. Yet it was this poverty that helped spur their creativity. And, 
        just as the war had swept away much of Europe's material wealth, it had 
        taken old ideas along with it, creating a liberating atmosphere for artists.</p>
      <p>While the CoBrA movement is known primarily as a movement of painters, 
        the ASU Art Museum exhibition will contain a substantial selection of 
        drawings by the artists, as well as rare ceramic pieces.</p>
      <p>The artists were driven by the need to find meaning in senseless violence 
        and by age-old questions about God, good and evil. In the immediate aftermath 
        of the war, the imagery of the CoBrA artists was often of skulls, piled 
        corpses or hordes of the insane. They sought to plumb the destruction 
        of society and civilization, and the human capacity for evil.</p>
      <p>The CoBrA movement had its stylistic roots in Surrealism and German Expressionism, 
        but also incorporated many of the attitudes and techniques of American 
        abstract expressionism. Artists on both continents were impacted by the 
        enormous changes of their time, such as the creation of the atomic bomb 
        and the credibility of psychoanalysis as a method for accessing unknown 
        regions of the mind. In this environment, the imagery of dreams (and nightmares) 
        became the logical avenue for the CoBrA artists' expression.</p>
      <p>As time distanced them more from the horrors of war, the European artists 
        began to use more satire and wit in their images, and to break with traditional 
        methods of painting. They explored very direct methods of paint application, 
        such as the "action painting" invented by Appel. Alechinsky, at about 
        the same time as Jackson Pollock in America, also began to pour paint 
        directly onto canvas.</p>
      <p>Zeitlin said that although CoBrA: Before, During and After presents work 
        that was created decades (and in some cases more than half-a-century) 
        ago, is particularly relevant to our time.</p>
      <p>"Much of the work reflects on the horrors of war and the determination 
        to rebuild both physically and psychically in its aftermath. This is applicable 
        to the present, as art is being asked to assist in addressing the meaning 
        of violence," Zeitlin said</p>

        of Fine Arts at Arizona State University. It is located on the southeast
