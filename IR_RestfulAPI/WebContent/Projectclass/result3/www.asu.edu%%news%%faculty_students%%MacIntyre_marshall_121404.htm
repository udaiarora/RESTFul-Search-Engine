      <h2>Talented young pianist wins Marshall Scholarship </a></h2>
      <p> The piano notes that flow from Scott MacIntyre&rsquo;s fingers tell the story of a young man whose passion for life overrides all obstacles. The 19-year-old has performed all over the United States and Canada, composes and sings his own music, plays guitar and drums. Yet he has been virtually blind since birth. </p>
      <p> He also is the winner of a 2005 Marshall Scholarship, among the most prestigious awards for graduate study in the world. </p>
      <p> <img src="facstudents_images/Scott-MacIntyre.jpg" alt="Scott MacIntyre" width="288" height="192" align="right">MacIntyre is the latest in an impressive string of 12 ASU students who have won Marshalls in the last 13 years. Just 40 are named each year. </p>
      <p> MacIntyre will graduate from ASU in May with a degree in piano performance before beginning graduate studies at Britain&rsquo;s Cambridge University and the Royal Academy of Music. The Marshall Scholarship provides full funding for two years, amounting to about $60,000. </p>
      <p> Born with just 2 degrees of tunnel vision (it&rsquo;s as if he sees the world through a tiny straw), MacIntyre started playing the piano by ear at age 3 and began his classical training at age 5. He can read sheet music note by note and memorize it one hand at a time. </p>
      <p> At 14, MacIntyre was accepted into the ASU Barrett Honors College and the Herberger College of Fine Arts. He made his orchestral debut at 15, performing as guest piano soloist with the Phoenix Symphony to a standing-room-only audience of more than 2,000. </p>
      <p> He has performed with the Phoenix Symphony six times, won a number of top competitions and studied on full scholarship at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Canada, Tanglewood Institute at Boston University and the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria. He has produced five CDs &ndash; the first when he was 11 years old. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;Scott is a wonderful young man, very articulate, focused and accomplished, and he has performed at hundreds of charity concerts all over the United States,&rdquo; says Janet Burke, associate dean of the Barrett Honors College. &ldquo;Yet he&rsquo;s a very normal individual who likes to try all kinds of different things.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> He swims, hikes and skis &ndash; with a sighted guide in front of him &ndash; and teaches salsa, swing and ballroom dancing. He performs in live drama and musical theater, gives motivational speeches and has won debate honors as a YMCA student senator. Since the age of 11, he has created his own computer games. </p>
      <p> The tall, blue-eyed young man uses a cane to navigate around the ASU campus with confidence, and he studies textbooks with the aid of computer scanners, tape recordings and magnifying glasses. </p>
      <p> Walter Cosand, ASU professor of piano performance in the School of Music who has worked with MacIntyre since he was 14, says his own initial reluctance to work with such a young student quickly was dispelled. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;I remember how astonishing his ability to learn and perform new music proved to be,&rdquo; Cosand says. &ldquo;I have been teaching talented pianists for 28 years, and Scott may be the most promising performer I have ever taught. One would call his playing effortless, but for the knowledge that it is the result of great diligence over most of his life.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> MacIntyre calls the faculty at ASU &ldquo;amazing,&rdquo; and says he wouldn&rsquo;t trade his years on campus for anything. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a wonderful experience here. The professors really connect with the students.&rdquo; </p>
