      <h2>Columnist to explore realities of religion in politics</h2>
      <p>This September, as summer in the Valley begins to wind down, the discourse at ASU's Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict (CSRC) will continue to heat up. </p>
      <p>Kicking off its 2004 - 05 lecture series, the CSRC brings to the Valley <em>Washington Post </em> columnist E.J. Dionne, Jr., one of the nation's top analysts of American politics, and an important leader in the national discussion of the role of religion in public life. Dionne will speak on a subject that could not be timelier - the role of religion in the upcoming presidential election. </p>
      <p>Dionne will be delivering the lecture, "Religion and the 2004 Presidential Election" as part of the CSRC's "Religion and Conflict: Alternative Visions" lecture series. The free public lecture is scheduled for 7:30 p.m., Sept. 27 at the ASU College of Law Great Hall. Tickets are free, but reservations are required. Call (480) 727-6736 or e-mail (csrc@asu.edu) to obtain tickets. </p>
      <p>Dionne's visit will be the first installment in a&nbsp; series of public lectures and conversations with nationally and internationally recognized writers, scholars and policy experts. The series explores the sources and consequences of religious conflict and strategies for their resolution. Previous lecturers in the Alternative Visions series included <em>New York Times </em> best-selling author and NPR commentator Bruce Feiler and Azar Nafisi, a best-selling author and international activist on behalf of women's rights and democracy. </p>
      <p>"In this lecture series, the Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict is bringing real insight about some of the biggest issues affecting the outside world home to Arizona," says ASU President Michael Crow. </p>
      <p>The series will continue to do so throughout the fall. In October, the CSRC will bring Noah Feldman to speak on "Islamic Democracy and the Future of Iraq." </p>
      <p>Dionne has made a reputation for himself by defining for his readers the strengths and weaknesses of competing political philosophies, and for his insightful analysis of trends in public sentiment. He is also a recognized expert on religion and public life and is University Professor in the Foundations of Democracy and Culture at Georgetown University. He co-chairs the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, a nonprofit national organization that seeks to promote a deeper understanding of issues at the intersection of religion and public affairs. </p>
      <p>Dionne is the author of the best-selling book, "Why Americans Hate Politics" (Simon and Schuster, 1991), a book that won the <em>Los Angeles Times </em> book prize, and was a nominee for the National Book Award. His most recent book, "Stand Up Fight Back: Republican Toughs, Democratic Wimps, and the Politics of Revenge" (Simon &amp; Schuster; June 2004) is a study of the dynamics behind the state of extreme partisan politics in America. </p>
      <p>Dionne has also written "They Only Look Dead: Why Progressives Will Dominate the Next Political Era" (Simon and Schuster, 1996). </p>
      <p><em>The Los Angeles Times </em> praised his coverage of the Vatican as the best in two decades. Dionne began his op-ed column for the <em>Post </em>in 1993, and it is syndicated to more than 90 other newspapers. He has been a regular commentator on politics on television and radio. </p>
      <p>Dionne grew up in Fall River, Mass. He graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. from Harvard University in 1973 and received his doctorate from Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar. In 1994-95, he was a guest scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center. In May 1996, Dionne joined the Brookings Institution as a senior fellow in the Governance Studies Program. </p>
      <p>For more information on the lecture or on the ASU Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict, visit the Web site (www.asu.edu/csrc) or call (480) 965-7187. </p>
