Everything you need to get started with SAS software is right here, from   understanding program syntax to managing data and performing statistical
analyses. First-time users of SAS will benefit from Quick Start's          no-nonsense approach to statistical analysis. The book explains the
fundamentals of SAS software and gives readers the basic SAS skills        needed to begin immediately managing and analyzing data. A special
"Statistical Roadmap" chapter helps readers find the appropriate           analytical method to best serve their research needs. The book's
straightforward style emphasizes the practical use of SAS over obscure     programming theory. Readers who need to analyze large, complicated data
in the social sciences, life sciences, public administration, or           engineering will find this book particularly useful.
