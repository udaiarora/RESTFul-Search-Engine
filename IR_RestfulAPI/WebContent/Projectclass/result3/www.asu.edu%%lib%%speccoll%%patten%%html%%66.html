There are strange prescriptions in this fascinating 17th century household book, which focuses primarily on medical matters and is the equal of many similar contemporary books.
 Some of the remedies prescribed are most interesting to present day readers.  "A Drink for a Hot Fever" is made as follows: "Take Spring-water and red Rose-water, of each one pint and a half, the juyce of three Lemmons, and white Sugarcandy one ounce, and mix them together."  Many of the remedies advanced are validated by well-known people's experiences, such as "A Drink for the Plague. . .proved by the Countess of Arundel in the year 1603," and "The Bishop of Worcesters admirably curing Powder."
 A treatment for consumption begins with instructions to "take a peck of garden shell-snails, wash them in small beer, put them into a great Iron dripping-pan, and set them on the hot fire of Charcoals, and keep them constantly stirring till they make no noise at all;. . .then take a quart of Earth-worms, rip them with a knife, and scour them with salt.
