      <h2>ASU taps renowned scientist Dr. George Poste to head Arizona Biodesign
        Institute </h2>
      <p><img src="research_images/GeorgePoste.jpg" width="220" height="300" align="right">World-renowned researcher, scholar and science policymaker George Poste
        has been named director of the Arizona Biodesign Institute, Arizona State
        University's new and path-breaking biodesign and biotechnology enterprise.</p>
      <p>Currently, Poste is chief executive of Health Technology Networks, a
        consulting group based in Scottsdale, Ariz., and suburban Philadelphia
        specializing in the application of genomics and computing in healthcare.
        From 1992 to 1999 he was president for research and development and chief
        science and technology officer at the multinational healthcare company,
        SmithKline Beecham, during which time he was instrumental in 29 successful
        drug and vaccine registrations in the USA and internationally.</p>
      <p>ASU President Michael Crow announced Poste's appointment April 29, at
        a ceremony marking the groundbreaking of the institute's first state-of-the-art
        research facility under construction on the university's main campus
        in Tempe, Ariz. </p>
      <p>&quot;George Poste is one of the leading scientists in the world, and
        there is no better person to build the Arizona Biodesign Institute (AzBio)
        into a world-class biodesign research center that will benefit the state,
        the nation and the entire world,&quot; said Crow. &quot;George is a scientific
        genius with a compassion for humankind that inspires those around him
        to do great things to make the world better.</p>
      <p>&quot;One of our most immediate goals at ASU is to build research facilities
        that will attract leading researchers from across the country and around
        the world," said Crow. "Even as we break ground on the first of four
        Arizona Biodesign Institute buildings, we are able to announce the first
        such recruitment of a research leader who has enjoyed great success in
        academia, industry and government and has proven skills in building complex,
        multidisciplinary research enterprises on an international scale.&quot;</p>
      <p>Arizona Biodesign Institute will house a core of ASU's elite, cutting-edge
        researchers, both those already at the university and those who will
        be recruited in the future. It draws together research efforts in biotechnology,
        information technology and nanotechnology to improve human health and
        quality of life through multidisciplinary research. Emphasis will also
        be given to forging extensive relationships with industry to ensure the
        rapid translation of leading edge research into practical benefits.</p>
      <p>Poste said, "I'm excited by President Crow's invitation to make his
        ambitious vision for AzBio a reality. I also applaud the members of the
        Arizona Legislature for their forceful commitment to capture research
        and development excellence in Arizona. The convergence of spectacular
        advances in genomics, materials science, miniaturization engineering,
        robotics and computing offers unprecedented opportunities to harness
        this knowledge to produce dramatic gains in the diagnosis, treatment
        and prevention of diseases and address major unmet medical needs, both
        nationally and internationally. ASU is in the vanguard in recognizing
        the need to conduct multi-disciplinary research on a large scale. </p>
      <p>"It's my goal that AzBio will pioneer new approaches in both research
        and teaching," said Poste. "By forging an extensive network of alliances,
        both on-and off-campus, AzBio will become a dynamic intellectual and
        economic resource for ASU, the state and the nation.&quot;</p>
      <p>When completed in 2004, the first building of the Arizona Biodesign
        Institute will be a state-of-the-art research facility located on ASU's
        main campus in Tempe. The 170,000-square-foot facility is the centerpiece
        of ASU's multi-phase Biodesign Corridor that will provide an intellectual
        and physical environment to allow Arizona to compete in the global bioscience
        and technology marketplace.</p>
      <p>Phases 2, 3, and 4 of AzBio will be built if a legislative bill authorizing
        an additional $400 million for research facilities at Arizona's three
        state universities is approved. The bill, which was submitted to the
        state legislature April 16, will provide ASU with $185 million to complete
        construction of all phases of the Arizona Biodesign Institute, as well
        as a facility for the university's new School of Life Sciences and research
        facilities to house burgeoning biotech fields such as nanotechnology,
        materials science, information technology and bioinformatics.</p>
      <p>ASU Vice President for Research and Economic Affairs, Jonathan Fink,
        said Poste's diverse background will help bring together the many elements
        of the institute and provide a rapid progression for its research efforts.</p>
      <p>&quot;George is already aligned with our vision for the institute and
        is ready to move us to the next level,&quot; said Fink. &quot;He can
        really paint a picture that leading scientists at ASU and around the
        world can get behind.&quot;</p>
      <p>The appointment of Poste enables Charles Arntzen, the founding director
        of AzBio, to focus his energies on the growth of plant-based pharmaceutical
        discovery and development.</p>
      <p>Arntzen said when he joined the institute as its founding director,
        he did so with the understanding a new leader would be recruited once
        the venture was successfully off the ground. He says that Poste will
        be arriving at a perfect time, now that the new AzBio complex is being
        built.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm extremely pleased that ASU has attracted someone of George
        Poste's stature to join AzBio and to use his vast experience to build
        programs of both excitement and excellence,&quot; said Arntzen.</p>
      <p>Poste is well known in the scientific community for his vast knowledge
        of health research and health policy, and he is an expert in genetics,
        pharmaceuticals, computing and healthcare research and development in
        both academia and industry. </p>
      <p>Phoenix attorney Richard Mallery, a founding board member of the International
        Genomics Consortium, which will work closely with AzBio, says Poste's
        superb track records in both research and management will provide a boost
        to bioscience in the state of Arizona. </p>
      <p>"Poste has one of the most successful track records in the history of
        drug development," Mallery said. "His special genius is taking medicines
        from the research lab to the bedside and, in the process, getting them
        approved by the FDA and putting them into the physician's black bag.
        When he headed research at SmithKline Beecham, he proved that a top academic
        researcher could break the mold and become equally successful finding
        practical applications. Arizona is gaining one of the most highly regarded
        scientists in the world who also has superb managerial and negotiating
        skills, a man who can find win-win solutions. He is a giant addition
        to bioscience in Arizona."</p>
      <p>Dr. Jeffrey Trent, founder and chief science officer of the Translational
        Genomics Research Institute (TGen) said Poste is the perfect choice for
        AzBio and the state of Arizona.</p>
      <p>"There are only a few people in the world who have the background in
        bioscience and genomic research that George has, and who have taken vaccines
        and pharmaceuticals into the marketplace," said Trent. "He will help
        ASU and Arizona take a major leap forward."</p>
      <p>Trent said Poste's appointment caps a remarkable year for Arizona in
        the field of bioscience. He cited the addition of Crow and his research
        agenda at ASU and the support the state has shown for genomic and bioscience
        research, which has drawn efforts such as IGC and TGen.</p>
      <p>"It's a remarkable capstone on a remarkable year," he said. "George's
        presence and focus will help develop the field locally and he will attract
        national attention."</p>
      <p>Others in the pharmaceutical and bioscience fields have praised the
        appointment of Poste as director of AzBio. </p>
      <p>"I have had the privilege
        of knowing and working with many brilliant scientists and pharmaceutical
        executives, and George Poste is by far
        the standout among this prestigious group," said Robert R. Ruffolo, president
        for Research &amp; Development for Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and senior vice
        president for the Wyeth Corporation. "George combines an unusual blend
        of genius and vision with a healthy dose of pragmatism. George's strength,
        which few can match, is his visionary approach to managing scientific,
        technology-driven organizations."</p>
      <p>Jan Leschly of Care Capital LLC, former Chief Executive Officer of SmithKline
        Beecham, noted, "George Poste was the industrial scientist who introduced
        'genomics' to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. As chairman
        for Research and Development at SmithKline Beecham he revolutionized
        the approach to discovery of new drugs by implementing 'genomics' technology.
        As Chief Executive Officer for SmithKline Beecham I worked with Dr. Poste
        for 10 years. His leadership, vision, creativity and extraordinary intellect
        were very instrumental in SB's success.&quot;</p>
      <p>Stephen Benkovic, the Evan Pugh Professor and Eberly Chair in Chemistry
        at Pennsylvania State University added, "George Poste, is a charismatic
        leader, a true visionary, and a polymath. He will initiate a creative
        and ambitious strategy that will set the Arizona Biodesign Institute
        on a trajectory for international prominence."</p>
