General</b></font><p><b>A. Authority</b><p><ol><li type="1">By authority of <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> &#167; 15-1627, as amended, the President of Arizona State University adopts the following rules and regulations to promote an environment that is conducive to the mission of the university.  The Arizona State University Tempe Campus Transportation Code, hereafter referred to as the Code, is designed to meet the specific needs of the ASU Tempe campus.</li><p><li>Authorized entry to university property is contingent upon voluntary agreement to observe all university rules and state laws.  Hence, the Code applies to any person on university property. Unauthorized entry to university property may be a violation of <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> Title 13, the state criminal code, and may result in criminal prosecution (see <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> 13-1502, <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> 13-2905, and <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> 13-2911, relating to trespassing, loitering on university property and compliance with the rules of an educational institution, respectively).  It is the responsibility of each person who operates a vehicle or nonpedestrian device on university property to have read and understand the Code.  Accordingly, lack of knowledge of the Code will not be accepted as grounds for dismissal of any citation.</li><p><li>The chief of the Police Services Division (PSD) or the director of Parking and Transit Services (PTS), as appropriate, may exercise discretion to address circumstances not covered in the Code.</li></ol><p><b>B. Scope </b><p><ol><li>The ASU at Tempe campus has been designed primarily to accommodate pedestrians and emergency personnel.  However, operation of a nonpedestrian device or vehicle is authorized under certain conditions described herein.  The Code shall apply to the conduct of operators only, except as indicated in <a href="#section 8-a">Section 8-A</a>, &#147;Right of Way,&#148; which governs the conduct of pedestrians in the proximity of emergency personnel.</li><p><li>The Code and the ASU <i>Parking and Vehicle Control Regulations</i> are separate and distinct policies of the university.  Either or both may be applied to a situation, at the discretion of an enforcement officer.</li><p><li>The Code shall not apply to the transit-related conduct of a police officer during the course of duty.</li></ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>2. Guiding Principles</b></font><br><p><ol type="A"><li>Safety and courtesy are the operative elements of the Code.  Operation of a nonpedestrian device or vehicle on university property is a privilege granted by the university on the condition such operation adheres to all university safety requirements and exhibits, displays, or manifests courtesy for all. </li> <p><li>Operation of any nonpedestrian device or vehicle in an unsafe or discourteous manner is prohibited, subject to the sanctions herein.</li><p><li>Those unwilling or unable to observe these principles are not authorized to use a nonpedestrian device or vehicle on university property.</li></ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>3. Important Definitions</b></font><p>The following definitions have been adopted for the purposes of the Code.  Other definitions relevant to the Code may be found in <a href="#section 18">Section 18</a>, &#147;Definitions.&#148;<p>&#147;Safe&#148; means free of hazard.<p>&#147;Courtesy&#148; means behavior toward another that is marked by civility, respect, attention, consideration, cooperation, or generosity.<p>&#147;Hazard&#148; means a condition or circumstance involving the <i>chance</i> of injury or death.<p>&#147;Pedestrian&#148; means a person whose mode of transit is ambulation or who is defined as a pedestrian under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Examples include a person walking or using a wheelchair, self-propelled wheelchair, or handicap scooter.  A service animal, as distinguished from a work animal or pet, employed by a person with a disability, is granted the status of pedestrian for the purposes of the Code.<p>&#147;Operator&#148; means a person who is not a pedestrian, as defined above, and who operates a nonpedestrian device or vehicle.<p>&#147;Nonpedestrian device&#148; means any device, apparatus, or contrivance operated as a means of transit and propelled solely by human power.  Examples include a bicycle, tricycle, pedal cart, velocipede, water board, roller skate, in-line skate, skateboard, and scooter.<p>&#147;Vehicle&#148; means any device, apparatus, or contrivance operated as a means of transit and propelled by means other than human power.  Examples include a car, truck, motorcycle, electric cart, tractor, riding mower, forklift, and motorized scooter. For the purposes of the Code, a work animal used for transit, as distinguished from a service animal, is classified as a vehicle and is subject to the requirements thereof, which as by their nature apply to an animal, including proper display of a Mall Access Permit.<p><hr><font size=+1><b><a name="section 4"></a>4.

Rules of Transit</b></font><p>The following shall apply to those areas of the campus not under the jurisdiction of <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> Title 28, the state transportation code:<p><b><a name="section 8-a"></a>A.  Right of Way</b><p><ol><li>Each pedestrian or operator shall yield the right of way to all emergency personnel.</li><p><li>Each operator shall yield the right of way to any pedestrian.</li><p><li>Each operator of a nonpedestrian device shall yield the right of way to any other operator of a nonpedestrian device as necessary to ensure safe, courteous transit.</li><p><li>Each operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to any operator of a nonpedestrian device.</li><p><li>Each operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to any other operator of a vehicle as necessary to ensure safe, courteous transit.</li></ol><p><b>B.  Transit Routes</b><p><ol><li>A <a href="#walkway">walkway</a> may be used by pedestrians only.  Examples include an atrium, patio, point of ingress/egress, stairwell, single step, or flight of stairs, the university overpass, and a disability accommodation ramp.</li><p><li>A <a href="#traveled way">traveled way</a> may be used by pedestrians and operators.  Examples include a campus mall, sidewalk, parking lot, service drive, and loading bay, unless designated otherwise.  <p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>While a parking structure is a traveled way, operation of a nonpedestrian device is prohibited in a parking structure, excluding enforcement personnel of the PSD  Bicycle Patrol.

Direction of Travel</b><p>An operator will bear to the right side of any traveled way as necessary to ensure safe, courteous transit.<p> <b>D.  Intersections</b><p>Unless otherwise indicated, an operator may proceed through an intersection of traveled ways, or of a traveled way and a walkway, at a speed not to exceed that of surrounding pedestrian traffic if and only if safe, courteous transit is ensured and all provisions of the Code are observed.<p><a name="section 8-e"></a><b>E.  Speed Limits</b><p><ol><li>The maximum speed at which a nonpedestrian device or vehicle may be operated on a traveled way or campus street shall not exceed that which is reasonable and prudent for the conditions at the time or that which creates a hazard to any person or property.  In no case shall that speed exceed 5 miles per hour on any traveled way or 15 miles per hour on any campus street. <p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>5 mph is approximately twice the speed of an average pedestrian walking under fair conditions.</td></tr></table></li><p><li>Under conditions of heavy congestion on a traveled way such that progress cannot be made without sudden changes in direction, e.g., &#147;weaving,&#148; the reasonable and prudent speed is here defined as that of the surrounding pedestrian traffic.  If a nonpedestrian device or vehicle cannot be operated safely and courteously at that speed, operation shall be terminated.  Operation may resume only when conditions permit safe, courteous operation within the applicable speed limit.</li></ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>9.  Enforcement</b></font><br><p><ol type ="A"><li>The campus administration and finance officer authorizes PSD  and PTS to enforce the Code.  The campus administrative services officer may authorize others to enforce the Code, as needed. PSD, by virtue of its employment of state certified sworn peace officers, is also empowered to enforce all state laws, both on and off university property, the most notable of which for this context is <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> Title 28, the state transportation code.</li><p><li>An enforcement officer may issue a citation for any violation of the Code.  The enforcement officer may assign a level of severity to the violation that is commensurate with any aggravating circumstance present at the time of the violation.  A citation may be issued for a violation of the Code with or without proper operator identification.</li><p> <li>An enforcement officer may impound a nonpedestrian device or vehicle in conjunction with a citation for a violation of the Code.</li><p><li>An enforcement officer may instruct an operator to redirect, modify, or terminate operation of a nonpedestrian device or vehicle, whether or not a citation has been issued.  Failure to comply with such instruction is a Level 3 violation of the Code and, at the discretion of the enforcement officer, may be addressed as violation of state law, i.e., <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> 13-2911, which relates to compliance with the rules of an educational institution.</li><p><li>An enforcement officer may ask an operator to leave university property, whether or not a citation has been issued.  Failure to comply with such a request is a violation of state law, i.e., <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> 13-1502, which relates to criminal trespassing.  Operation of a nonpedestrian device or vehicle in order to comply directly with such a request is permitted if such operation is safe and courteous at all times, unless otherwise prohibited or an instruction to terminate operation has been issued.</li></ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>10.  Reasonableness and Fairness in Enforcement</b></font><p>The primary factors that influence campus traffic are the perceptions, expectations, and subsequent behaviors of people using the transit routes of the campus.  A principal objective of the Code is to promote and maintain an environment in which the community supports and participates in the management of campus transit issues.  Consistent with that objective is the belief that enforcement actions should be reasonable, prudent, and fair.  Accordingly, the university encourages enforcement officers to exercise their professional discretion and to consider tolerance of those violations in which no hazard of immediate concern to the enforcement officer is present.  Factors relevant to this tolerance include, but are not limited to, time, place, and general conditions of the violation.  The exercise of such tolerance is entirely at the discretion of the enforcement officer.  Accordingly, expectations of tolerance are not grounds for appeal of a citation.<p><hr><a name="section 11"></a><font size=+1><b>11.  Prohibited Conduct</b></font><p><b>A.  Unsafe or Discourteous Conduct</b><p>Safety and courtesy are fundamental to the mission of the Code.  Accordingly, it is a violation of the Code to operate a nonpedestrian device or vehicle in an unsafe or discourteous manner.  Conduct not expressly identified in the Code may be prohibited immediately by an enforcement officer upon that officer&#146;s determination that such conduct is unsafe or discourteous.  In such a case, the enforcement officer will communicate that determination to the operator under consideration and provide a reasonable opportunity for that person to end the conduct.  If the conduct continues after such notification and opportunity, enforcement action may be taken, including citation and impound, for failure to obey an instruction related to the operation of a nonpedestrian device or vehicle issued by an enforcement officer, a Level 3 violation (see <a href="#section 11-f">Section 11-F-1</a>).<p><b>B.  Speeding</b><p>Speeding is a violation of variable severity that occurs when an operator travels faster than the applicable speed limit (see <a href="#section 8-e">Section 8-E</a>, &#147;Speed Limits&#148;). Speed is the most significant factor that contributes to the creation of unacceptable risk on the transit routes of the campus because any conduct is made more hazardous by increasing the element of speed.  Hence, a speeding violation may be assigned to any level of severity based on speed alone or based on a combination of speed and any aggravating circumstance present at the time of the violation (see <a href="#section 12">Section 12</a>, &#147;Aggravating Circumstances&#148;).<p><b>C.  Speeding through Crowded Traffic</b><p>This is a speeding violation of variable severity that occurs when an operator travels faster than the surrounding traffic by repeatedly executing sudden changes in direction in order to proceed through crowded traffic, e.g., &#147;weaving.&#148;  The severity of the violation shall be assigned at the discretion of the enforcement officer in consideration of any aggravating circumstance present at the time of the violation (see <a href="#section 12">Section 12</a>, &#147;Aggravating Circumstances&#148;).<p><a name="section 11-d"></a><b>D.  Level 1 Violations</b><p>The following conduct is prohibited and, except where an aggravating circumstance exists, shall be Level 1 violations of the Code:<p><ol><li>To fail to observe any posted traffic control device or signal.</li><p><li>To fail to yield the right of way as prescribed by the Code.</li><p><li>To fail to bear to the right side of any traveled way as prescribed by the Code.</li><p><li>To traverse an intersection of traveled ways, or of a traveled way and a walkway, (a) at a speed greater than that of surrounding pedestrian traffic, (b) at a time when it is unsafe or discourteous to do so, or (c) if any provision of the Code is not observed.</li><p><li>To operate a nonpedestrian device or vehicle anywhere but on a traveled way or campus street, except as provided for by the campus administrative services officer.</li><p><li><a name="section 11-d-6"></a>To operate a nonpedestrian device in a parking structure, excluding enforcement personnel of the PSD Bicycle Patrol.</li><p><li>To cling to a moving nonpedestrian device or vehicle.</li><p><li>To operate a bicycle without operational brakes, as defined in <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> Title 28.</li><p><li>To operate a bicycle without at least one hand upon the handlebar.</li><p><li>To operate a bicycle with more riders than seats installed by the manufacturer.  This provision shall not apply in the case of a child riding safely in a properly installed child seat or other such accommodation in a manner consistent with the instructions provided by the manufacturer of such seat or accommodation.</li><p><li>To propel a skateboard by <a href="#tacking">tacking</a> (see <a href="#section 18">Section 18</a>, &#147;Definitions&#148;).</li><p><li>To operate a roller skate, in-line skate, or skateboard by skating backwards.</li><p><li>To operate a nonpedestrian device or vehicle on or over a step, stairs, or disability accommodation, excluding a curb-cut between a sidewalk and a street.</li><p><li>To leave a vehicle without direct supervision by an authorized operator while the engine is running or in such a manner as to allow operation by an unauthorized person.</li></ol><p><a name="section 11-e"></a><b>E. Level 2 Violations</b><p>The following conduct is prohibited and, except where an aggravating circumstance exists, shall be Level 2 violations of the Code:<p><ol><li>To operate a nonpedestrian device or vehicle in a manner not consistent with <a href="#simple transit">simple transit</a> (see <a href="#section 18">Section 18</a>, &#147;Definitions&#148;).</li><p><li>To operate a vehicle without a current driver&#146;s license.</li><p><li>To operate a university vehicle prior to satisfactory completion of Mall Driver Training.</li><p><li>To operate a nonuniversity vehicle without a properly displayed temporary or permanent Mall Access Permit or without authorization from the campus administrative services officer or designee.</li><p><li>To operate a prohibited nonpedestrian device or vehicle, e.g., a motorized scooter other than a handicap scooter (see <a href="#section 7">Section 7</a>, &#147;Prohibited  Devices and Vehicles&#148;).</li><p><li>To experience any loss of control of a nonpedestrian device or vehicle.</li><p><li>To operate or park a nonpedestrian device or vehicle on the university overpass.</li></ol><p><a name="section 11-f"></a><b>F.  Level 3 Violations</b><p>The following conduct is prohibited and shall be Level 3 violations of the Code:<p><ol><a name="section 11-f-1"></a><li>To fail to comply immediately with any instruction related to the operation of a nonpedestrian device or vehicle issued by an enforcement officer.</li><p><li>To operate a nonpedestrian device or vehicle, except a handicap scooter, inside a building.</li><p><li>To park or otherwise leave a nonpedestrian device or vehicle in a manner which is not consistent with the requirements of the <i>Arizona State Fire Code</i> or which obstructs access to any transit route, disability accommodation, emergency equipment, or point of ingress/egress.  Of particular relevance for the campus is the requirement that at least 20 feet of clearance be maintained at all times to ensure free access by emergency vehicles.</li><p><li>To collide, or cause another person to collide, with a pedestrian, operator, nonpedestrian device, vehicle, or property.</li><p><li>To bring a fuel-powered motorized scooter or other such vehicle inside any building, except a garage or other building designated by the university for this purpose.</li></ol><p><hr><a name="section 12"></a><font size=+1><b>12.  Aggravating Circumstances</b></font><p>Campus traffic presents diverse circumstances that may affect the nature and severity of a given violation. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, time, place, weather, traffic congestion, surface conditions, and proximity to persons or property.  In order to provide appropriate sanction, a violation of the Code may be classified according to the nature and severity of a hazard created by the violation under the circumstances at the time.  An enforcement officer may, according to professional discretion, increase the severity of a given violation beyond that prescribed in <a href="#section 11">Section 11</a>, &#147;Prohibited Conduct,&#148; provided the officer notes on the citation the aggravating circumstance leading to the increase.  For the purpose of identifying the severity of a given violation in the context of an aggravating circumstance, the following guidelines will apply:<p><ol>A. A <a href="#section 11-d">Level 1 violation</a> presents a mild hazard to any person, including oneself.  A mild hazard is present when the consequences thereof, as estimated by a reasonable person, could cause inconvenience, distraction, or discomfort.<p>B. A <a href="#section 11-e">Level 2 violation</a> presents a moderate hazard to any person, including oneself.  A moderate hazard is present when the consequences thereof, as estimated by a reasonable person, could cause pain or injury not requiring medical attention.<p>C. A <a href="#section 11-f">Level 3 violation</a> presents a severe hazard to any person, including oneself.  A severe hazard is present when the consequences thereof, as estimated by a reasonable person, could cause injury requiring medical attention or death.</ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>13.
