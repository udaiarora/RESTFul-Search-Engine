<h2>ASU Cronkite School offers public workshop with top national geographic photographers </h2>
<p>TEMPE (March 18, 2004)-The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University will host two renowned National Geographic Contributing Photographers-in-Residence next month to lead a Masters of Photography workshop aimed at both students and the university community. </p>
      <p>"Through the Lens with the Masters of Photography," presented by Sam Abell and Karen Kasmauski, will take place April 5-7. </p>
      <p>The two-day program will comprise classroom lectures, review sessions where the photographers will meet students one-on-one to critique portfolios, and a free public lecture with slide presentations by each photographer. The public lecture will feature Sam Abell's photographic life and Karen Kasmauski's work on global health, followed by a question-and-answer session and a book signing of the National Geographic book "Through the Lens," which showcases 250 of National Geographic's most spectacular photographs. The free lecture will take place on Tuesday, April 6 at 6:30 p.m. in Room 170 of the new Lattie Coor Building, which is on the ASU campus at Myrtle Avenue and Tenth Street. Pay parking is available across the street in Tempe Center. </p>
      <p>"The university outreach program is a new initiative that takes National Geographic's special way of looking at the world - through the photographer's eye - to university communities," said Terry Garcia, National Geographic's executive vice president for mission programs. "Besides furthering National Geographic's mission to diffuse geographic knowledge and promote conservation, we hope this initiative will inspire people to see the world in a new way." </p>
      <p>The Contributing Photographers-in-Residence program was launched three years ago to support and showcase the work of pre-eminent freelance photojournalists who have contributed outstanding work to the National Geographic Society over the years. The photographers, in turn, help develop projects and programs that advance the Society's mission. </p>
      <p>Sam Abell began working with National Geographic in 1970 and has published 10 books with the Society, most recently "The Mississippi and the Making of a Nation: From the Louisiana Purchase to Today," with historians Douglas Brinkley and the late Stephen Ambrose, in 2002. He has photographed more than 20 articles for National Geographic magazine. A book highlighting his life and images, "Sam Abell: The Photographic Life," written by Leah Bendavid-Val, was published in 2002. </p>
      <p>Karen Kasmauski has documented many social issues, such as radiation, viruses, population and aging, and has contributed 26 articles to National Geographic magazine since 1987. Her work has won top honors in the annual Pictures of the Year competition as well as special recognition in the Magazine Photographer of the Year category. Her latest book, "Impact: From the Frontlines of Global Health," was published by National Geographic Books last fall. </p>
      <p>Founded in 1888, the National Geographic Society is one of the largest nonprofit scientific and educational organizations in the world. It reaches more than 250 million people worldwide each month through its five magazines, the National Geographic Channel, television documentaries, films, books, videos and DVDs, maps and interactive media. National Geographic has funded more than 7,000 scientific research projects and supports an education program combating geographic illiteracy. </p>
      <p>The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication prepares students to enter positions in media fields, ensuring that they receive a broad-based education rooted in the liberal arts and sciences, and courses that lead to an understanding of the role and responsibility of the media. The Cronkite School is one of the largest mass communication units in the country, with more than 1,700 <a href="http://cronkite.asu.edu/programs.html">undergraduate </a>s, 85 <a href="http://cronkite.asu.edu/graduate.html">graduate students, </a> and a permanent <a href="http://cronkite.asu.edu/honsupp.html">endowment </a> worth more than $6 million. The <a href="http://cronkite.asu.edu/faculty.html">faculty </a> includes not only some of the nation's top mass communication scholars but also professionals with many years of experience. </p>
