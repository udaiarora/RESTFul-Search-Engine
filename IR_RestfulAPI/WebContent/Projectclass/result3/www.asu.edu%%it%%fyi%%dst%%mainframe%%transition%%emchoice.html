    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">E-MAIL CHOICES</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You can migrate your use of electronic
    mail (e-mail) on the VM/CMS or Academic VAX/VMS systems independently
    of when you migrate other applications. In fact, you should take
    steps now that will simplify your transition later.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You should first configure your
    Post Office account and advertise your Post Office E-mail Address
    (e.g. Jane.User@asu.edu) as your new e-mail address. This will
    allow you to have an e-mail address based on your name, rather
    than on the system you happen to be using at the time. By doing
    this, you will (probably) never have to change your e-mail address
    at ASU, even if you change e-mail systems again.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You can initially configure the
    Post Office so that when your correspondents send e-mail to your
    new Post Office address, it will be delivered to your current
    e-mail system. Once you are ready to transition e-mail systems,
    you can tell the Post Office to deliver your e-mail to the new
    system, and none of your correspondents will know the difference.
    In case some of your correspondents aren't aware of your Post
    Office E-mail address, you can have the mail they send to your
    old address forwarded to your new address.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">ASURITE E-mail Systems</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">ASURITE E-mail systems are based
    on a mail server protocol known as IMAP. There are several e-mail
    &quot;clients&quot; you can use to access e-mail on IMAP.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">UNIX Pine</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Available on all ASURITE UNIX
    clusters, including Research, Stats, General, and AI. UNIX Pine
    is a character based application that allows you to send and
    receive local and Internet e-mail, maintain folders and address
    books.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">PC-Pine</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Just like UNIX Pine except that
    it runs on Windows workstations. There is no need to log on to
    the UNIX clusters first.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Simeon</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Windows and Mac based e-mail
    clients for accessing IMAP mailboxes. Allows you to store address
    books and personal configurations on a server so that you can
    easily move between workstations.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you have access to PPP then
    you can run PC-Pine or Simeon when dialing into ASU from your
    workstation at home. Otherwise, you will have to dial into one
    of the UNIX clusters and run Pine. Also, if you are on an Internet
    connected host outside of ASU, you can telnet to one of the UNIX
    clusters and run Pine.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">For more information about the
    ASU Electronic Post Office, forwarding e-mail, or migrating to
    an ASURITE E-mail System, please send a note to <A HREF="mailto:email-q@asu.edu">e-mail-q@asu.edu</A>,
    or call (480) 965-6500.</FONT></TD>
