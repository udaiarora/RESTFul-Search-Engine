    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">RACF is software which provides
    security for account access (both interactive and batch access),
    disk data sets, and tape volumes.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Account access is granted if
    a valid userid and password are supplied when an interactive
    logon is attempted or a batch job is submitted.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Access to disk data sets and
    to tape volumes is granted if the person attempting access is
    the owner of the resource. If the person attempting access is
    not the owner, the system checks a RACF data base to determine
    if the owner will allow access.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If the owner of a disk data set
    or a tape volume wishes to allow other people to access the resource,
    the owner uses RACF to indicate which userids will be permitted
    access and what type of access is allowed.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The types of access allowed are:</FONT></P>

    <PRE>  NONE    - no access allowed
  READ    - allowed read access
  UPDATE  - allowed read and write access
  CONTROL - same as UPDATE for all data sets except VSAM data sets;
            for VSAM data sets this provides the same function as
            a CONTROL password
  ALTER   - allowed read, write, rename and scratch access</PRE>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The owner of a resource can permit
    access by individual userids, groups, all userids (universe),
    or any combination of these. The system keeps this information
    (access lists) in the RACF data base. (All access lists for a
    resource are contained within one data base entry called a profile.)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Universal access is the phrase
    used to describe the access given to the universe (all userids)
    for a particular resource. Each profile in the RACF data base
    has a field called UACC. The type of univeral access permitted
    is determined by the value you assign to the UACC field. The
    possible values are those in the table of access type shown above.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A group is a set of userids which
    can be represented by a name rather than having to enumerate
    each userid. A group name may be used in an access list in the
    same manner as a userid. Groups are established for accounts
    which have more than one userid associated with them; i.e., if
    two or more userids have the same account number, a group will
    be established. The name of the group will be the account number
    prefixed with the letter G. The most common example of an account
    with multiple userids is a class account. The class account would
    have one account number and several userids (one per student).</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The owner of a resource can establish
    more than one access list for the resource. One list can be used
    to permit READ access; another list can be used to permit UPDATE
    access. The owner can use the universal access code UACC in addition
    to or in lieu of any access lists.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The help topics <A HREF="disk.html">DISK</A>
    and <A HREF="tape.html">TAPE</A> give detailed information regarding
    protection of disk data sets and tape volumes. The following
    text describes information common to both types of resources.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Whenever a resource is accessed,
    the system checks the RACF data base to determine whether a profile
    exists for the resource. If no profile exists for a disk data
    set, only the owner of the data set is permitted access. (If
    the access is attempted from WYLBUR rather than a batch job,
    the owner and anyone who knows the password/keyword of the owner
    is permitted access.) If no profile exists for a tape volume,
    anyone may access the tape volume, except that the Tape Library
    Management System (TLMS) prevents anyone (including the owner)
    from overwriting a tape data set which is unexpired or is followed
    by an unexpired tape data set.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If a profile exists for the resource
    and the userid attempting access is not the owner, RACF checks
    the access lists for the resource. If the userid is on the access
    list and has the appropriate access level, access is granted.
    If the userid is not on the access list or does not have the
    appropriate access level (i.e., the userid has READ access but
    is attempting to do UPDATE) then RACF checks the UACC code.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The UACC code defines universal
    access. This is the last check RACF makes. If the UACC is NONE
    (no access), the userid is denied access. If the UACC has another
    value, RACF compares the type of access being attempted with
    that permitted by the UACC before making the final determination
    to grant or deny access.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In order to establish access
    lists or the UACC for a resource, a profile needs to be added
    to the RACF data base for the resource. Tape volume profiles
    are established by the tape librarian. You can request that a
    RACF profile be established for a tape volume when the tape is
    checked into the tape library. You can also request the tape
    librarian to define a RACF profile for a tape volume which is
    already in the tape library, provided you are the owner of the
    tape.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">For a disk data set, use ISPF
    9.R (or the RACF ADDSD function) to add a profile to the RACF
    data base. The add function also permits you to establish an
    initial UACC value. If you do not specify an initial value, NONE
    is assumed.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A profile for a disk data set
    or for a tape volume only needs to be added once. Should the
    profile get deleted and you wish to reestablish the profile,
    follow the steps described above for adding a profile. If a resource
    profile is deleted, access to the resource is determined the
    same as if the profile had never existed.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">For disk data sets, there are
    two types of profiles: discrete and generic. Unless you specify
    otherwise, when a disk data set profile is added to the RACF
    data base it will be a discrete profile.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A discrete profile is one which
    is associated with one specific data set. If the data set is
    deleted, the profile will be automatically deleted. This is advantageous
    if you re-use the same names for different data sets over a period
    of time. If the profiles were to remain, you could inadvertently
    permit unauthorized access to data sets.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A generic profile is capable
    of protecting more than one disk data set at the same time. The
    profile is not automatically deleted when the data set(s) it's
    protecting are deleted. This type of profile is useful for situations
    requiring the same access for many data sets which have similar
    names, for example, all disk data sets that begin with the name
    &quot;WYL.PD.ACD.HELP.**&quot;. The symbols asterisk &quot;**&quot;
    and percent &quot;%&quot; are used as &quot;wild card&quot; characters,
    where the asterisk represents many characters and the percent
    represents one character. A generic profile is also useful in
    those situations where you wish to delete a disk data set and
    recreate it at a later time but you don't want the profile to
    be automatically deleted.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Whenever you perform a RACF function
    with a profile name containing a wild card character, RACF recognizes
    the profile as a generic profile. If you plan on using a profile
    name that does not contain a wild card character, you need to
    specify the generic option as part of the RACF function to have
    the name treated as generic. (A generic profile name which does
    not contain a wild card character will only protect one resource,
    namely the data set with the identical name.)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After a profile has been created
    for a resource, it is possible to use other commands to perform
    various RACF functions.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You can change the UACC code
    in a profile at any time. You can also add or remove entries
    (userids and group names) from access lists at any time. There
    is a function available which will remove all access list entries
    from a profile without having to enumerate the entries to be
    deleted. (This latter function is performed without deleting
    the profile or changing the UACC.)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You can search for the names
    of all profiles which you own (typically used to determine which
    disk data sets or tape volumes may have access lists associated
    with them). You can also display the contents of any profile
    owned by you (typically used to display the list of userids which
    are permitted to access a disk data set or tape volume.)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The search and display functions
    listed above may also be used to determine your access to resources
    not owned by you, provided the profiles exist for the resources
    and only if you are permitted access to the resource(s).</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Other tasks for which RACF is
    used include determining which disk volumes on which a userid
    is permitted to create disk data sets, recording the disk usage
    totals (tracks used, tracks allowed), establishing a minimum
    length for logon passwords, and determining the expiration date
    for logon passwords.</FONT></P>

    for additional information regarding RACF.</FONT>&nbsp;</TD>
