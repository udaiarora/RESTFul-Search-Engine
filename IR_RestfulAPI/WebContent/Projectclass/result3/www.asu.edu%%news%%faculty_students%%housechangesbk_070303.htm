      <h2>Book offers design tips for ranch homes</h2>
      <p>        An ASU associate professor and her students are providing Scottsdale
          residents who own a 1950s or '60s-vintage ranch house, with some valuable
        options for updating the home's lighting, space and storage.</p>
      <p>The suggestions,
            come in the form of "Every House Changes," a guide prepared by Catherine
            Spellman, associate professor of architecture, and almost
          two dozen of her students over the last year. The project was initiated
          by the City of Scottsdale to help homeowners update, enlarge and remodel
          their homes. The ranch style home was built by the thousands in Scottsdale
          - and throughout the valley - from the 1950s through 1970s.</p>
      <p>"All of the
          houses were built by a few developers, and they have similar floor
        plans," says Connie Padian, a director in the city's planning and
          development department.<br>
        The ranch house, a staple of the Southwest after World War II, is low
          in scale, generally single story, and the front "addresses," or faces
          the street, Spellman says.<br>
        "Its functions are divided into separate areas, and the focus is efficiency,"
          she says. "The biggest shift, in moving from the bungalow to the ranch
          house, was to bring the outside in through bigger windows and sliding
          glass doors."</p>
      <p>Ranch houses also were the first to be built on concrete
          slabs and to have attached carports or garages.</p>
      <p>"There was an excitement about them,
          an acceptance of modernity and technology," Spellman says.</p>
      <p>To begin the project, Spellman and the students visited
          25 ranch houses in Scottsdale and surveyed their neighborhoods. They
          created a package
          of 12 case studies with design suggestions, ranging from furniture
        choices to major additions.<br>
        One of the challenges of renovating a ranch house is to let more light
          in, Spellman says. The design team recommended cutting slots in all
          the walls that touch the exterior wall to make "interior windows,"
          replacing
        solid hallway doors with frosted-glass-panel doors and adding skylights.</p>
      <p>Lack
          of storage is also an issue in the ranch house. One suggestion, Spellman
          says, is to cut a huge hole in the ceiling, say in the living
          room and build storage in the attic that's accessible from inside the
          house. Another idea, is to cut niches out of the walls between rooms,
          putting bookcases or shelves between the studs.<br>
        The larger-scale renovation ideas include adding second-story apartments,
          remodeling the house into two townhouses, or building a mirror image
        of the house behind it, depending on lot size and city codes.</p>
      <p>"Our design
          directives were to define good architecture for the neighborhoods,
        consider lifestyles of today, think about the desert in terms of landscaping,
          water and light, try to extend the view through the house and maintain
        a relationship between inside and outside," Spellman said.</p>
      <p>The design guidelines are available in book form from the City of Scottsdale
        and Spellman's "Every House Changes" lecture is being televised at 2
        and 9 p.m., June 28, and 10 a.m., June 29, on Scottsdale's Citycable
      11. </p>
