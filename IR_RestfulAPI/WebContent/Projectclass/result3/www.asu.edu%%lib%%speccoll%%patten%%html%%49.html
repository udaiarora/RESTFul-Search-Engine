This 1509 edition of the Latin Herbarius was printed in Italy and
 featured 150 woodcuts of plants with text on their medicinal uses.
  It was written for an audience who had little or no access to doctors,
 and thus copious illustrations were deemed necessary.  These decorative
 woodcuts were not, however, suitable for field identification, since
 they were stylized drawings rather than exact reproductions.
<P>
There are two major sections of this work: a first part which contains descriptions and the medicinal uses of 150 plants which grew in Germany, and a second part which lists the medicines and herbs available in German apothecary shops and from spice merchants.  Each plant was assigned a vernacular German name in addition to the traditional Latin one.
