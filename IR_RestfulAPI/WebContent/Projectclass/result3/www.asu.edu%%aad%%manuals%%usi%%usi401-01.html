Whether the specific semester hours of credit may be applied toward a degree depends on the requirements of the department, division, or college in which the student is enrolled.<p>There are several qualifications:<p><ol><li>Transfer credit is not given for courses in which the student earned a grade below &#147;C-.&#148;</li><p><li>While courses successfully completed but evaluated on nontraditional grading systems (e.g., pass-fail) may be acceptable for transfer, some colleges in the university may not accept such credits to fulfill graduation requirements.</li><p><li>Grades and honor points earned at other colleges and universities are considered for admission, but are not included in computing the student&#146;s cumulative grade point average (GPA) at ASU.</li></ol><p>Certain types of credit cannot be transferred to ASU, including:<p><ol><li>credit awarded by postsecondary institutions in the United States that lack candidate status or accreditation by a regional accrediting association</li><p><li>credit awarded by postsecondary institutions for life experience</li><p><li>credit awarded by postsecondary institutions for courses taken at noncollegiate institutions (e.g., governmental agencies, corporations, industrial firms, etc.)<p>and</li><p><li>credit awarded by postsecondary institutions for noncredit courses, workshops, and seminars offered by other postsecondary institutions as part of continuing education programs.</li></ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Veteran&#146;s Exception</b></font><p>Honorably discharged veterans who served in the Armed Forces of the United States for a minimum of two years are given the following exception to the above transfer credit policy. In determining admissibility to the university, the Undergraduate Admissions Office or Admission Services at the West campus may not consider any failing grades received at an Arizona university or college before military service. Military service records must be submitted, including form DD 214.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Community Colleges</b></font><p>With the exception of special programs, a maximum of 64 semester hours of credit will be accepted as lower-division credit when transferred from an accredited community, junior, or two-year college.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Conditional Admission Prior to Receipt of Final Transcript</b></font><p>Students enrolled in other accredited colleges and universities will be considered for conditional admission if all admission requirements, except for a final transcript of work in progress, are met. This final transcript must be sent to the Undergraduate Admissions Office from the issuing institution immediately after the work in progress has been completed. Hand-carried transcripts will not be accepted. Regular admission will be confirmed only after the final transcript has been received, showing that the applicant has met the university admission requirements. Students who have not cleared their conditional admission will not be permitted to register for the next semester.<p>In the event an applicant does not qualify or has falsified application documents, admission and registration will be canceled and any registration fees paid will be returned.<p><img src="usihr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="usihr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>For related information, see:<p><ol><li><a href="usi202-04.html">USI 202&#150;04,</a> &#147;Undergraduate Transfer Credit Evaluations&#148;<p>and</li><p><li><a href="usi401-02.html">USI 401&#150;02</a>, &#147;Transfer Credit Appeals.&#148;</li></ol><p>&#160;<font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">USI</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | USI&#160;manual&#160;<a href="usi001.html">contact</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
