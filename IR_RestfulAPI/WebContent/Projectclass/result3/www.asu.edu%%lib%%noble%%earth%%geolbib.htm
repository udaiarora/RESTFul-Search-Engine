      <p>The key to efficient library research is a systematic search strategy 
        that progresses from general background material to specific detailed 
        information. Use the following guidelines to find information in the earth 
        sciences including geology, physical geography and environmental topics. 
        Although the research strategy is described in a linear sequence, students 
        may need to repeat steps as the paper topic is refined. </p>

      <h2>Research Strategy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <h3><a name="select"><b>Select a Topic</b></a></h3>
          Keep three things in mind when selecting a topic: 
          <ol>
            <li>Pick a topic that is interesting, 
            <li>Before committing to a topic, do a quick preliminary search to 
              make sure that the library has materials on that topic, and 
            <li>Be flexible; during the research process, you may find it necessary 
              to broaden or narrow the topic to fit the requirements of the assignment. 
              If the topic changes, even slightly, during the research process, 
              it is usually necessary to repeat the research steps using the terminology 
              specific to that topic. <br>
              <br>
          </ol>
          <p> 
        <li> 
          <h3><a name="enc"><b>Find an Overview</b></a></h3>
          <p> An encyclopedia is the best place to start if the topic is unfamiliar 
            or if a basic overview is needed. General encyclopedias have information 
            on science topics, however, earth science encyclopedias cover this 
            field in depth and they usually provide longer articles, lengthier 
            bibliographies, and more numerical data. Be sure to copy down/printout 
            all appropriate references at the end of encyclopedia articles; these 
            references will lead to books, journal articles and/or Internet sites 
            that provide more information on the topic.

          <p> Books provide a comprehensive look or an in-depth review for a specific 
            topic. There are several ways to find books on a topic: 
          <ul>
            <li> To determine what <b>books the ASU Library own</b> on a particular 
              topic, search that topic as a <b>keyword</b> in the <a
href="http://catalog.lib.asu.edu">ASU Online Catalog</a>. 
            <li>To <b>locate specific books</b> (such as those found in the bibliography 
              of an encyclopedia or journal article) in the library, search for 
              the <b>title</b> in the <a href="http://catalog.lib.asu.edu">ASU 
              Online Catalog</a>. <br>

          <p> The most current earth science research is found in journal articles. 
            Journal articles can be identified by using an Indexing or Abstracting

              <p> This is an excellent place for undergraduate students to start 
                researching science journal articles. Journals range from popular

                the <i>Bulletin of the Geological Society of America</i>. All

                available within the database. The ASU Libraries own most of the

            the Internet, be sure that your instructor will accept this type of 
            resource. Also note that Internet resources vary in quality and accuracy 
            and should be evaluated closely (see: <a href="/lib/tutorials/suntutor/eval/">SunTutor: 
            Evaluating Sources</a>). 
          <p> Because the Internet can quickly disperse news and images, this 
            is a valuable source of information on current topics. For example, 
            the Internet would be a ready source of information on volcanic eruptions 
            or earthquakes that may have happened in the last couple of days.
