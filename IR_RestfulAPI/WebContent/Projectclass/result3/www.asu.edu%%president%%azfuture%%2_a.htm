      <p>January 2003</p>
      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
      <p> Technology accounts for over 50 percent of long-term growth in the United 
        States. It is the single most important determinant of long-term economic 
        growth. Science provides the basis for technological advance. Together, 
        science and technology drive productivity growth and the emergence of 
        new industries. Public science and the institutions that engage in publicly 
        funded research provide the foundation and seedbed for innovation. Thus, 
        these institutions directly and indirectly serve as engines for economic 
        growth. </p>
      <p>The primary investment in scientific research in the United States occurs 
        at the federal level. However, state and local policies are critical for 
        determining where that research will be undertaken and, therefore, where 
        the opportunities will exist for private companies to invest in technology 
        and where new industries, firms and jobs will be created. </p>
      <p><strong>Science And Technology As Drivers For Economic Growth</strong></p>
      <p> <em><img src="images/chart1.gif" width="288" height="275" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right">Economic 
        studies have clearly shown that technology is the single most important 
        determinant of long-term economic growth. </em></p>
      <p>Economic growth as a key determinant of the success of cities, regions 
        and nations: </p>
      <p>&#8220;Compounded over generations, a 1 or 2 percent reduction in the 
        overall [economic] growth rate could be the difference between the standard 
        of living merely doubling or surging five-fold over a hundred-year period. 
        For countries with similar standards of living today, small differences 
        in the rate of growth could lead to very different economic outcomes in 
        the future. For example, Argentina and the United States had roughly similar 
        levels of economic performance during the 1860s, but the United States 
        managed to launch itself on a high-growth path while Argentina became 
        mired in low growth which reinforced itself over time.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Economic growth is driven by long-run investment in three basic categories 
        of economic assets: human capital (labor), physical capital (plant and 
        equipment), intellectual capital (technology). Technology is in a particularly 
        strategic position among economic assets, as improvements in the productive 
        capacity of capital and labor skills are often driven by advances in technology. 
        The distribution of our investment among these three asset categories 
        determines the levels of long-term domestic productivity growth, competitive 
        trade positions and economic growth. </p>
      <p>Since Adam Smith, economists have recognized the importance of science 
        and technology for increased productivity and long-term economic growth. 
        Technological change can enable the economies of cities, regions and nations 
        to surge forward with dramatically increased rates of productivity growth, 
        and build long-term economic success, whereas without technological change 
        the per capita growth rate of an economy will inexorably tend toward zero. 
        Throughout the history of the United States and other industrialized nations, 
        macroeconomic studies have shown that scientific and technological change 
        accounts for at least half of long-term growth&#8212;many economists argue 
        that, when we measure scientific and technical change properly, the figure 
        is as high as 75 percent. </p>
      <p>While no single economic asset, including technology, can by itself drive 
        economic progress, investments in the research and development in science 
        and technology (R&amp;D) produce greater returns than almost any other 
        use of capital. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>The Public - Private Investment Interface</strong></p>
      <p> Econometric studies have shown that a strong correlation exists between 
        public and private investment [in science]. Specifically, public investment 
        leverages private investment and makes it more efficient, thereby increasing 
        the economy's growth rates of productivity and output. </p>
      <p><img src="images/chart2.gif" width="640" height="308"></p>
      <p>Technology based economic growth relies on our knowledge of the sciences 
        and engineering. Our ability to produce the incredible advances of the 
        20th century, the transistor, the laser, the microchip, for example, is 
        dependent on our understanding of the basic sciences of the material world, 
        and much of this understanding is based on publicly funded scientific 
        research. </p>
      <p>Publicly funded science and technology research provides the foundation 
        for private sector achievements that drive economic growth by building 
        the scientific base for advances in industry and by generating commercial 
        success in the form of spinoff companies and technologies.</p>
      <p>United States President George W. Bush has committed to promoting public 
        investment as a tool to leverage private investment in scientific research 
        and technology development. Economists hold that it is not in the direct 
        interest of individual companies to privately fund basic science because 
        they cannot capture all of the returns on their investment. A lack of 
        government support, therefore, reduces the availability of a major source 
        of opportunity for private investment, reducing promising targets for 
        capital and thus stifling economic growth. </p>
      <p>The President has requested the largest federal R&amp;D budget in history, 
        $112 billion for FY03 alone. President Bush has also proposed broadening 
        and making permanent the research and experimentation tax credit, noting 
        the importance of encouraging innovation and affirming the importance 
        of publicly funded science. Examples of the public-private investment 
        interface include major public investment in the National Institutes of 
        Health (NIH), which has seen its budget double in the last 5 years to 
        nearly $27 Billion for FY02 alone, and through which the United States 
        has both created a science and technology base in biotechnology and leveraged 
        substantial private investment in product and process applications. In 
        two decades, an industry has been created which is now beginning to turn 
        out products with enormous potential benefits for the pharmaceutical, 
        agricultural and chemical industries, as well as for quality healthcare, 
        improvements in life expectancies, and in quality of life. </p>
      <p>In the United States a great majority of the scientific innovations that 
        drive industry progress are generated by universities, and stories of 
        commercial success and economic growth born at the university-market interface 
        abound. In biotechnology, for example, genetic engineering as a commercial 
        venture began in 1976 when Robert Swanson, a venture capitalist, invested 
        $200,000 in the formation of Genentech based on the scientific innovations 
        of Herbert Boyer, a professor at the University of California San Francisco 
        Medical Center. </p>
      <p>The historically proven success of this university-industry interface 
        was dramatically enhanced in the United States with the passage by Congress 
        of the Bayh-Dole act in 1980. The Bayh-Dole act enabled universities to 
        bring the results of federally funded research to market&#8212;the act 
        achieved this by transferring ownership of the inventions born of that 
        research to universities from the federal funding agencies. Bayh-Dole 
        turned public funding of science into an investment to be leveraged by 
        private entrepreneurs and investors.</p>
      <p>Since the passage of Bayh-Dole, American universities have spun off more 
        than 2,200 firms to commercialize innovations born of research, created 
        260,000 jobs in the process and now contribute $40 billion annually to 
        the American economy. In the opinion of The Economist, &#8220;More than 
        anything, this single policy measure helped to reverse America's precipitous 
        slide into industrial irrelevance.&#8221; </p>
      <p><strong>The Importance of Knowledge Infrastructure</strong></p>
      <p><br>
        <img src="images/chart3.gif" width="233" height="259" align="right">In 
        addition to producing spinoff companies and related opportunities for 
        the private sector to reap direct financial returns, public investment 
        also leverages private investment in more subtle but equally important 
        ways. </p>
      <p>Current and past investment by the United States in knowledge infrastructure 
        enable U.S.-based companies to obtain science and engineering data much 
        faster than in other parts of the global economy. Given ever shorter product 
        life cycles, this timing factor can be critical. </p>
      <p>When a scientist in a corporate R&amp;D lab working on a new advanced 
        component for an aerospace or automotive application, or on the development 
        of a new drug therapy, needs data on the phase changes of the ceramic 
        material at different temperatures and pressures, or on emerging techniques 
        in synthetic chemistry, that data often comes from a government laboratory 
        or university engaged in federally funded science research. </p>
      <p>The private sector builds on publicly funded research, often with universities. 
        According to one survey, approximately 10 percent of new products and 
        processes depend on recent academic research. In some industries, the 
        impact is even higher. For example, in 1990, universities were responsible 
        for 18 percent of all U.S. patents dealing with genetic engineering and 
        recombinant DNA, 16 percent of patents dealing with natural resins/peptides 
        or proteins, and 12 percent of patents dealing with chemicals involving 
        microbiology and molecular biology. Multiple and diverse lines of business, 
        ranging from biotechnology, to semiconductors, software and aerospace, 
        to plastics, paper, steel, and automobiles, rely heavily on science, and 
        public science provides the knowledge infrastructure crucial to the success 
        of much privately funded research, and to economic development. </p>
      <p><strong>Science, Technology and Regional Economic Growth: The Role of 
        States</strong></p>
      <p> Research capacity building investment in science and technology is the 
        most critical factor in deciding the economic fate of regional economies. 
      </p>
      <p>As noted above, the federal government, under President George W. Bush, 
        is investing heavily in science. But, both the federal government and 
        economists are clear that &#8220;by itself, federal science policy cannot 
        guarantee a given region an economic payoff.&#8221; The federal government 
        provides most of the primary incentives, but the structure and organization 
        of the research system within the local economy heavily influences the 
        successful utilization of the results of research. </p>
      <p>When knowledge is produced, the benefits do not only accrue to the producer, 
        they &#8220;spill over&#8221; to the local economy as technical knowledge 
        accumulates in specialized local assets like labor pools and supplier 
        networks. One study put it this way: </p>
      <p>&#8220;When the U.S. personal computer assemblers go to Taiwan for design 
        and development of notebook computers, when U.S. disc drive assemblers 
        go to Singapore for processes and volume manufacturing, when IBM moves 
        microsystem development out of the United States to Japan they are seeking 
        access to such specialized and local know-how in components and microsystems 
        design, processes, and manufacturing. Such domestic capabilities are the 
        probable basis for product differentiation and new technology generation&#8230;.in 
        other words, without such domestic capabilities, an economy has no enduring 
        potential to operate at the technological frontier, with all that this 
        implies for maintaining national well-being...&#8221; </p>
      <p>Firms, regions, and nations that establish an initial advantage and invest 
        in locally embedded knowledge production will enjoy the benefits of technologically 
        driven economic growth. <br>
        State involvement in the formation and execution of policy for science 
        and technology is vital. States have the local knowledge, are attuned 
        to the needs and structure of local and regional industry, and will reap 
        the rewards of success in the form of local economic growth driven by 
        new wealth and employment gains. </p>
      <p>1998 data provide a snapshot of selected geographically mediated spillovers 
        throughout the United States:</p>
      <p><img src="images/chart4.gif" width="720" height="540"></p>
      <p>States have the power to create local conditions most conducive to new 
        ideas and new inventions, which in turn inspire new companies, industries, 
        jobs and growth. In order to build environments that encourage innovation, 
        the Council on Competitiveness recommends that states can have the greatest 
        positive impact by focusing much of their investment to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Build the physical, information, and talent infrastructures with 
          regional governments and organizations playing the central role in cluster-specific 
          strategies</li>
        <li> Encourage networking organizations that catalyze public-private dialogue 
          and develop community-wide strategies </li>
        <li> Establish research and industrial parks and business incubators that 
          encourage innovation-based competition </li>
      </ul>
        
      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>
      <p> In October 2002, United States Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
            argued that we live and work in a global environment &#8220;in which 
            prospects for economic growth now depend importantly on a country's 
            capacity to develop and apply new technologies.&#8221; &#8220;If we 
            are to remain preeminent in transforming knowledge into economic value,&#8221; 
            says Greenspan, &#8220;the U.S. system of higher education must remain 
            the world's leader in generating scientific and technological breakthroughs 
            and in preparing workers to meet the evolving demands for skilled 
            labor.&#8221; </p>
          <p>Technological innovations have contributed more than any other single 
            factor in America&#8217;s economic history to long-term growth. A 
            great many of these technological innovations have grown out of publicly 
            funded research, much of which has been undertaken at America&#8217;s 
            universities. In the last twenty years, legislative and fiscal conditions 
            in the United States have enhanced the ability of universities to 
            interface directly with the market, thus increasing substantially 
            the opportunities for private capital to benefit from public investments 
            in scientific research. Private companies, both established industrial 
            giants and emerging entrepreneurial ventures, have built on America&#8217;s 
            foundation of publicly funded science research, investing capital 
            and capturing the innovations that drive our economy forward. These 
            investments have created multiple new industries, thousands of firms, 
            and hundreds of thousands of new jobs. </p>
          
      <p>Technological innovations drive much of our economic growth at the national 
        level, but it is local economic environments that enable this growth to 
        occur. State and local policy makers are key in creating the environments 
        that encourage innovation. Through targeted investment in the building 
        blocks of knowledge infrastructure, states can draw private capital to 
        invest in the building of regional strength in science and innovation 
        and act as catalysts for regional, and national, economic growth. </p>
