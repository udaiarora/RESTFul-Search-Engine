      <h2>ABOR approves projects to accommodate students' needs </h2>
      <p>ASU received approval from the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) to lease 111 apartment units (444 beds) from SHP Commons located at 1111 E. Apache Blvd. </p>
      <p>American Campus Communities has offered to lease the entire apartment community to ASU from Aug. 1 through July 1, 2006 to help ASU meet its immediate need for upper-classmen student housing. </p>
      <p>ABOR met March 11 - 12 at the University of Arizona to approve the lease and other projects presented by ASU. </p>
      <p>Existing upper-classmen space will be converted to freshmen-oriented space, in order to make room for more freshmen to live on ASU's Main Campus. </p>
      <p>By the end of the lease in July 2006, McAllister Academic Village with 1,900 beds will be online. Freshmen students residing in Chola (upper-classmen facility) will move into McAllister Village (freshmen facility) and upper class students residing in The Commons on Apache will move back into Cholla. </p>
      <p>Juan Gonzalez, vice president of Student Affairs at ASU, says having freshmen live on campus during their first year is a critical period for their success in college. </p>
      <p>"We have found that freshmen who live on campus have a 15 percent higher retention rate than those freshmen who live off campus their first year," he says. "Additionally, students living in residence halls have more of an opportunity to have a sense of belonging and a sense of community." </p>
      <p>Mernoy Harrison, executive vice president of Administration and Finance at ASU, says this is the first time ASU has been involved in this type of effort. </p>
      <p>"On several occasions we have rented space in the Twin Palms for two to three weeks to accommodate students," he says. "In those cases we were either responding to a strong demand or we had a renovation project that ran a bit late. In those cases, all students were soon transitioned into the residence hall system." </p>
      <p>ASU also received approval to enter a master lease of the office, retail, parking and multi-use space in the Brickyard on Mill, with ASU as the tenant and the ASU Foundation as the landlord. ASU currently leases 138,000 square feet of office space used for the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering. </p>
      <p>Other items that were approved by ABOR include: </p>
      <p>. Phase III of an infrastructure upgrade project to expand current utilities, repair deterioration of existing facilities and to support new building projects currently in design or in planning. This project includes campuswide infrastructure upgrades including sewer, water, steam, chilled water, electrical, utility tunnels and other miscellaneous upgrades. </p>
      <p>. Formation of Nanotechnology Research, LLC (NTR); issuance by NTR of lease revenue bonds to purchase the Motorola Flat Panel Display (FPD) facility located in the ASU Research Park. The building contains approximately 250,000 gross square feet of space for clean room, a laboratory, offices and support/common areas. ASU plans to use the FPD for research and development of nanoelectronic technologies and to facilitate partnerships with the public and private sectors interested in technology-specific projects. </p>
      <p>To learn about other projects discussed and approved at the ABOR March 11-12 meeting, visit (<a href="http://www.abor.asu.edu/">www.abor.asu.edu/</a>). </p>
      <p>The next Arizona Board of Regents meeting is April 29 - 30, at ASU. </p>
