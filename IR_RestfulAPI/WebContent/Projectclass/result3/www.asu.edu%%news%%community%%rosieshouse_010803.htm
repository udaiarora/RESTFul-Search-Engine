      <h2>KBAQ FM opens doors to Rosie's House for project</h2>
      <p>ASU's KBAQ FM 89.5 is helping enrich young lives with the gift of music.</p>
      <p>KBAQ, a part of KAET-TV, has partnered with the Phoenix Bach Choir to 
        do a series of workshops for a group of children at Rosie's House, a music 
        academy for low-income, high-risk young people in Phoenix.</p>
      <p>Margaret Morgan, KBAQ program production manager, says working with the 
        children has been a rewarding experience for everyone involved.</p>
      <p>"It's amazing to see the excitement in these kids' eyes," she says. "We 
        do this every day, so for us it becomes routine, but seeing their faces 
        light up makes providing them with the exposure to broadcast production 
        and musical performance all worthwhile." </p>
      <p>Rosie's House is the result of a vision by Rosebell and Woody Schurz. 
        In 1996, they decided to transform a dilapidated house into a safe place 
        where low-income, at-risk youth could develop their potential through 
        music. Today, the academy is located on 7th Avenue and Pima Street. Through 
        a partnership with local schools and the Boys &amp; Girls Club, Rosie's 
        House offers free instruments and music lessons from top professionals 
        to more than 350 children. </p>
      <p>The current project was made possible through a Community Arts Project 
        grant from the Phoenix Arts Commission and an Arts Education Project grant 
        from the Arizona Commission on the Arts. The KBAQ Production Studio is 
        providing the children with the opportunity to learn about the recording 
        process and radio production, and the Phoenix Bach Choir is offering individual 
        and group vocal instruction. </p>
      <p>In November, the KBAQ staff took their remote recording equipment to 
        Rosie's House so the children could have a hands-on experience with age 
        appropriate introductions to recording equipment and processes as well 
        as demonstrations on how to read and record voice-overs and live music.</p>
      <p>Morgan says reaching out to the community came naturally and provided 
        the opportunity to educate future generations about the art of recording 
        live performances and career opportunities in the arts. </p>
      <p>"At our first workshop, there were kids between the ages of 5 and 17. 
        I don't think many children this age ever get to experience life in a 
        radio production studio," she says. "I think it's great that we have been 
        able to reach out to these kids, many of whom are very talented musicians. 
        They may even be future broadcasters."</p>
      <p>For the next part of the project, scheduled in the spring, a combined 
        concert with the Phoenix Bach Choir and vocal instrumental ensembles from 
        students of Rosie's House will be presented to the Phoenix community. 
        KBAQ Production Studio will record this concert using Rosie's House students 
        as production assistants for hands-on technical experience.</p>
      <p>KBAQ Production Studio will prepare a CD of the performance for all collaborating 
        parties to use as a development tool for funding of future collaborations, 
        and possible broadcast on KBAQ FM 89.5.</p>
