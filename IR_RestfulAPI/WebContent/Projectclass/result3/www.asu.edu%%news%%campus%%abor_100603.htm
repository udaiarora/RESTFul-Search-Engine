      <h2>Regents approve projects, gain insight to ASU's future</h2>
      <p>A five-year plan
          to double the number of students who graduate with a bachelor of science
          in nursing (BSN) degree was approved by the Arizona
          Board of Regents (ABOR) during its meeting Sept. 25 and 26.</p>
      <p>This effort
          is part of a statewide plan to increase nursing program graduates,
        which was mandated in 2002 by Senate Bill 1260. Plans for all three universities
          anticipate significant additional support through partnerships with
        private
          hospitals and other health care providers. All three plans propose
        including a program fee on top of undergraduate tuition to be paid by
        participating
          hospitals and other primary care providers.</p>
      <p>"We have been at this for
          three years now and it's the most comprehensive plan in the state,"
        said Regent Don Ulrich. "It's a large undertaking,
          and I am very pleased with the progress that has been made."</p>
      <p>The five-year
          plan sets a goal for the universities of doubling the number of nursing
          program graduates by increasing enrollments until they reach
          a combined total of 310 additional undergraduate students (140 ASU
        students, 70 NAU students and 100 UA students) by the end of the 2007
        - 08 academic
          year.</p>
      <p>ABOR also approved the following items during its meeting:<br>
        . ASU's FY 2004 Capital Development Plan: This plan consists of eight
          new construction and renovation projects at the ASU campuses. At ASU
          Main projects include the construction of an Interdisciplinary Life
            Sciences and Technology Building, Geosciences and Materials Building,
            a new business
          school complex at Tempe Center, instructional research laboratory renovations,
          and the combined Heat and Power Project. </p>
      <p>At ASU East, projects include
          the construction of a research building and extended campus capital
        and infrastructure upgrades, which are also
          being done at the ASU West Campus. The plan also includes the development
          of the Arizona Biomedical Collaborative at the ASU Downtown campus. </p>
      <p>The
          FY 2004 Capital Development Plan also includes the following projects
          that were approved by ABOR: Arizona Biodesign Institute Phase II, estimated
          at $73 million, and McAllister Academic Village, both at Main campus. </p>
      <p>The overall total for projects approved in the Capital Development Plan
        is $317.6 million.</p>
      <p>. ASU Capital Improvement Plan for FY 2005 - 07: The
          plan includes the following projects: Research Laboratory Renovations
          Phase II (estimated
          at $10 million), Academic Renovations and Deferred Maintenance Phase
          I (estimated at $10 million), Infrastructure Improvements Phase III
        (estimated at $10 million), Light Rail Displacement/Parking Project (estimated
        at
          $10 million), and South Campus Academic Village (Third Party Financed)
        (cost has not been determined).</p>
      <p>. Renovation of Building 505, Exercise-Wellness
          ASU East, Phase II (project approval and budget increase): The project
          includes the renovation of
          the 16,800 square-foot Building 505 and the addition of 700 square
        feet of new space. This request includes a budget increase of $646,147
        to
          the previously approved budget of $987,795 for a new budget of $1.6
        million. The renovation of Building 505, the former base Non-Commissioned
        Officers
          Club, will provide administrative offices for faculty and staff, two
          computer mediated classrooms, conference rooms, instructional labs,
        research spaces and a computer lab.</p>
      <p>The Regents also received a glimpse of ASU's
          interdisciplinary future through a presentation by Robert Wills, dean
          of the Katherine K. Herberger
          College of Fine Arts, and Thanassis Rikakis, composer and director
        of the Institute for Studies in the Arts. The two presented the Arts,
        Media
          and Engineering (AME) graduate research and education initiative that
          focuses on the integrated, parallel development of digital media technologies
        and digital media content.</p>
      <p>AME, a joint project between the Herberger
          College and the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, seeks to address
          the needs of researchers (faculty
          and graduate students) who wish to combine understanding of computation
          and computational modeling with the ability to apply this understanding
          at every level of the digital media communication process throughout
          disciplines across campus. The presentation included examples of movement
          recognition that used the concepts of dance, digital art, music, engineering
          and computer science. To find out more about the AME initiative visit
        the Web at (http://ame.asu.edu).</p>
      <p>The next meeting for the Arizona Board
          of Regents is scheduled Nov. 20 - 21 at the University of Arizona.
