<P><A name="z0595493">&#13;As
you use SAS under the CMS environment, you may encounter many different kinds
of problems.  The problem may actually be with some component of the operating
environment or with computer resources other than SAS.  The problem may also
be caused by operating environment commands being executed or used incorrectly.</A>

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">Problems Associated with the CMS Operating Environment</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>If the problem is related to the operating environment,
you will receive messages on the terminal screen.  You may need to consult
an appropriate IBM manual or your onsite systems staff to determine the problem
and how to solve it.  Much error message information can be found in the CMS
HELP system.  For example, if you receive a DMSSCT120S error on your terminal,
type HELP DMS120S and you will see an explanation as well as a list of possible
causes of the error.  Consult the appropriate system manual to determine the
source of the problem.

<P>The following resources are available to help you if
you determine that your problem is within SAS.
<BR><H3>Examining the SAS Log</H3>


<P><A name="z0595496">&#13;The primary source of information for
solving problems that occur
within SAS is the SAS log.  The log lists the SAS source statements along
with notes about each step, warning messages, and error messages. Errors are
flagged in the code, and a numbered error message is printed in the log. 
It is often easy to find the incorrect step or statement just by glancing
at the SAS log.</A>

<BR><H3>Using User-Defined Help</H3>


<P><A name="z1098361">&#13;
Your site may provide user-defined Help that provides site-specific information
via the standard SAS Help browser. To access user-defined help via the SAS
Help browser, you need to allocate a user-defined Help library at SAS invocation.</A>
<P><A name="z1098362">&#13; 
The user-defined Help library contains information in the form of one or more <B>itemstores</B>, which SAS treats as a file system within a file. Each itemstore
can contain directories, subdirectories, and individual Help topics. </A>
<P>For information about loading user-defined Help into
itemstores, see the next section and <A href="z0617249.htm">ITEMS</A>.
<BR><H3><A name="z0685666">Developing User-Defined Help</A></H3>


<P><A name="z1098364">&#13;
You can develop Help for your site or for your SAS programs that can be displayed
in the standard SAS Help browser. To ensure that user-defined Help will be
displayed as it is written, use only the subset of tags from HTML Version
3.2 that is supported on the SAS Help browser. Help information in tags that
not supported by the SAS Help browser may be ignored.</A>

<BR><H3>Online Documentation (CD-ROM)</H3>


<P><A name="z1098399">&#13;
  The CD-ROM
that is supplied with SAS software contains most of the documentation for
base SAS, including  



<B>SAS Language Reference: Dictionary</B> and other titles. If you encounter
a problem that you cannot solve with the information that is provided in the
SAS log or in SAS online Help, load the CD-ROM disk into a CD-ROM reader and
browse through the contents of the books.</A>
<BR><H3>Hardcopy Documentation</H3>


<P><A name="z0595498">&#13;   Contact
your SAS Support Consultant for assistance with ordering hardcopy documentation.</A>
<BR><H3>SAS DATA Step Debugger</H3>


<P><A name="z0595508">&#13;The SAS DATA
step debugger is an interactive tool that helps you find logic errors, and
sometimes data errors, in SAS DATA steps.  By issuing commands, you can execute
DATA step statements one by one or in groups, pausing at any point to display
the resulting variable values in a window.  You can also bypass the execution
of one or more statements.</A>
<P>For complete information about the DATA step debugger,
see  



<B>SAS Language Reference: Dictionary</B>.
<BR><H3>Using SAS Statements and Procedures to Identify Problems</H3>


<P><A name="z0595510">&#13;If you are having a problem with the logic of your program, there
might be no error messages or warning messages to help you.  You might not
get the results or output that you expect.  Using the PUT statement to write
messages to the SAS log or to dump the values of all or some of your variables
might help.  Using PUT statements enables you to follow the flow of the problem
and to see what is occurring at strategic places in your program.</A>
<P>Some problems may be data related; these can be very
hard to trace. Notes that appear in the SAS log following the step that reads
and manipulates the data might be very helpful.  These notes provide information
such as the number of variables and observations that were created.  You can
also use the CONTENTS and PRINT procedures to look at the data definitions
as SAS recorded them or to examine all or parts of the data in question.

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">Recovering Memory Resources</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P><A name="z0595512">&#13;During execution, when SAS cannot
acquire sufficient memory
or disk space to perform the executable tasks, SAS uses a requestor window
or a requestor prompt to ask you how you want to handle the situation.  The
requestor window displays a list of alternatives from which you can select
an item to be released.  The requestor window redisplays until sufficient
resources have been released to allow execution to continue.  Alternatively,
you can select   
</A><CODE><B>Continuous cleanup</B></CODE> or   
<CODE><B>Do nothing</B></CODE>.
<BR><H3>Requestor Window Selections</H3>


<P><A name="z0595513">&#13;The
following list explains the choices that are given in the requestor window
plus some other possible selections. </A>
<DL>
<DT><B>Be prompted to delete files from SAS libraries</B></DT>
<DD>allows you to select which SAS files to
delete.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Clean up everything</B></DT>
<DD>invokes every item that is shown in the
requestor window. This selection applies only for the current resource request.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Clear LOG window</B></DT>
<DD>erases the contents of the Log window.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Clear OUTPUT window</B></DT>
<DD>erases the contents of the Output window.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Clear paste buffers</B></DT>
<DD>deletes what is saved in the paste buffers.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Clear PROGRAM EDITOR window</B></DT>
<DD>erases the contents of the Program Editor
window.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Clear source spooling/DMS recall buffers</B></DT>
<DD>erases the recall buffers.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Continuous cleanup</B></DT>
<DD>tells SAS to perform automatic continuous
cleanup.  The SAS System will perform cleanup as much as possible and subsequently
not display the requestor window for an out-of-memory condition.  This selection
applies for the remainder of the SAS session.  If you want SAS to always perform
automatic continuous cleanup, specify the CLEANUP system option when you invoke
SAS.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Deassign inactive librefs</B></DT>
<DD>allows you to select which librefs to deassign.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Delete definitions of all SAS macros and macro
variables</B></DT>
<DD>deletes all macro definitions and variables.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Do nothing</B></DT>
<DD>tells SAS to do nothing and allow the resource
request to fail. This selection applies only for the current resource request.
<P>You can select this option at any time. If you have
tried all the other selections and still cannot recover enough resources,
you should select `Do nothing' or `Continuous cleanup'.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Execute X command</B></DT>
<DD>puts your SAS session into CMS subset mode.
 This enables you to erase files to free disk space or release accessed disks
to make more memory available.  Be careful not to erase temporary SAS files.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Free windows</B></DT>
<DD>removes enough windows to get enough space
to continue.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Halt data step/proc</B></DT>
<DD>tells SAS to stop the current step.<P></DD>

<DT><B>More items to cleanup</B></DT>
<DD>means that there are more items to clean
up than can be displayed in this window.  Select this item to see the additional
list.<P></DD>

<DT><B>Terminate SAS</B></DT>
<DD>aborts SAS.  SAS files that are currently
being modified are marked as damaged.  The next time you use the file, you
will receive a message that SAS is recovering as much data as possible from
the file.<P></DD>
</DL>

<P>A requestor window always displays for a disk-full condition
during an interactive session.
<P>If your cleanup selection does not satisfy the immediate
need, a second message is displayed in the requestor window:    

<PRE>NOT ENOUGH <I>resource</I> WAS CLEANED UP. PLEASE TRY AGAIN.</PRE>
<P>To determine whether sufficient resources can be recovered
so that SAS can continue in a normal fashion, select 'Clean up everything'.
If the requestor window returns the TRY AGAIN message, the situation is much
more serious.  If you have other files that can be erased to free disk space
or disks that can be released to make more memory available, select the 'Execute
X command' item.
<P> If this last step does not solve the problem, select
the `Do nothing' or `Continuous cleanup' item and tell SAS to stop pursuing
the problem.
<P>From the requestor window you can stop execution of
SAS by selecting the 'Terminate SAS' item. <DL>
<DT><B><FONT color="FF00007">CAUTION:</FONT></B></DT><DD><B>This method
of stopping SAS may cause a SAS file to lose the data that was last added
or modified.</B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"></DD></DL>
<BR><H3>Using the CLEANUP System Option</H3>

<A name="z0595556">&#13;The default value for the CLEANUP
system option is CLEANUP. 
When CLEANUP is in effect, SAS performs automatic continuous cleanup, and
you are shown a requestor window or a requestor prompt only for a disk-full
condition.</A>
<P>The NOCLEANUP option displays requestor windows during
resource constrained situations if there is a terminal attached.  However,
the requestor windows do not display while SAS is running on a CMS batch machine
or a disconnected virtual machine.  When a resource-critical situation arises,
SAS performs automatic continuous cleanup.  If insufficient resources are
recovered, SAS responds as if you had specified the CLEANUP system option.
