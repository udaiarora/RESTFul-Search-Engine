<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>The Family Herbal, or, An Account of All Those English
Plants, Which are Remarkable for Their Virtues, and of the Drugs Which
are Produced by Vegetables of Other Countries, With Their Descriptions
and Their Uses, as Proved by Experience. . .</FONT></I>
<P>Also called: Account of all those English plants. . . Bungay: Printed
and published by C. Brightly and T. Kinnersley, 1812. Sixth ed.--Cf. Johnston,
S. H. Cleveland coll. 760. Earlier eds. published under title: <I>The Useful
Family Herbal</I>. Hand-colored plates. References: Johnston, S. H. Cleveland
coll. 760.
<P>Hill has arranged his plants according to their English names, adding
the Latin name as well.&nbsp; He gives a "general description of the plant,
if it be a common one, in a line or two; that those who already know it,
may turn at once to the uses; and for such as do not, a farther and more
particular account is added. Last come the virtues, as they are confirmed
by practice: and all this is delivered in such words as are common, and
to be understood by all."&nbsp; Hill begins his work with an introduction
detailing the purpose of the work, the methods of collecting and preserving
plants, the techniques for preparing simples, information about distilled
waters and other household preparations, and the best methods for putting
medicines together.&nbsp; This introduction is then followed by the alphabetical
listing of the plants, many of which are also shown on the hand-colored
plates.&nbsp; The work includes with an appendix which discusses the virtues
of plants which have not yet been tried.&nbsp; This is a later edition
of PAT-54, and this edition has all the plates located at the end of the
work, following the appendix.&nbsp; Some of the plates are inserted in
reverse order, e.g. 32, 31, 34, 33, 36, 35, etc.
