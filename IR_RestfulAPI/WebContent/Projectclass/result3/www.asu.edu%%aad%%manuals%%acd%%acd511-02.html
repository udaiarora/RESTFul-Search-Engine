The external party will pay the faculty member&#146;s salary either directly or to the university on a pass through or reimbursement basis.  In such a case, a temporary adjustment to the employee&#146;s base pay rate may be made if approved by the executive vice president and provost of the university.  (A temporary adjustment may be appropriate if the employee must reside out of state in a location with a cost of living that is significantly higher than that in the Phoenix metropolitan area.)<P>This temporary adjustment applies regardless of either the source of funds or their method of distribution.  It should be based on the differential in cost between Phoenix and the city or metropolitan area that will be the temporary work residence.  It should be calculated using the government cost-of-living indices at the time the appointment is agreed upon.  The adjustment terminates upon the faculty member&#146;s return to the university.<P>When the &#147;base&#148; salary is reported to the federal agency or other external organization, the reporting party must indicate clearly that the &#147;base&#148; includes a temporary cost-of-living adjustment (and the basis of that adjustment) that has been made consistent with university policy.<P>&#160;<P><HR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">ACD</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="acd001.html">contact</A> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="provost.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
