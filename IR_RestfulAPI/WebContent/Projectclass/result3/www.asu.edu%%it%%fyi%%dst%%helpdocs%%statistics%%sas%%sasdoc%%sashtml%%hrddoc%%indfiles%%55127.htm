Design, construct, and display customized graphs quickly and efficiently   with this new example-based book. It helps you master these customizing
techniques without relying on the Annotate facility. You'll also           discover practical tips here on topics not thoroughly covered in other
books. Of the numerous adaptable examples the book contains, most are      based on plots and graphs developed in actual applications. Examples
include the code used to produce the graphs. Though directed toward a      scientific audience, the examples are equally applicable to other
disciplines. SAS users familiar with the basics of the SAS System and      the fundamentals of SAS/GRAPH software can use this guide to become pros
at graphical design.
