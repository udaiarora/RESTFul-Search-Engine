above a specified record in the same path.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>authority</TD>
<TD align="left">a SYSTEM 2000 code that associates a password
with a database component and determines what kind of access to the database

other activities at your terminal.  It is sometimes referred to as running
in background.</TD></TR>

See also level.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>index</TD>
<TD align="left">in the SAS System, a SAS file associated
with a SAS data file that enables you to access observations by index value.
 Indexing usually makes data set processing faster, although the SAS System
determines the most efficient way to process data maintained by the SAS System.
<P>In SYSTEM 2000 software, values are indexed if the associated
item is specified as a key item.  Indexed values provide more efficient access
than nonindexed values.  If an item is non-key, values are not indexed, although

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>level</TD>
<TD align="left">the organization of a SYSTEM 2000 database
in which each schema record is placed at a certain level, thus reflecting

right below the ENTRY record are at level 1, and so on. The corresponding
data records also reflect the hierarchical structure.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>libref</TD>
<TD align="left">a temporary name that points to a SAS data
library.  A SAS file's complete name consists of two words separated by a
period.  The libref is the first word and indicates the library; the second

nulls. See null item and null record.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>SAS data file</TD>
<TD align="left">one of the formats of a SAS data set.  A
SAS data file contains both data  values and descriptor information associated
with the data, such as the variable attributes.  In previous releases of the
SAS System, all SAS data sets were SAS data files.  SAS data files are of
the member type DATA.
<P>A SAS data file is arranged in a rectangular, two-dimensional
format.  Each item in a SAS data file is called a data value. Data values
in a row comprise an observation and those in a column comprise a variable.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>SAS data library</TD>
<TD align="left">a collection of SAS data sets and other
SAS files that are stored and referenced as a unit.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>SAS data set</TD>
<TD align="left">a collection of information stored as a
unit under the SAS System. Several SAS data sets can be stored in a SAS data
library. Unlike external files, a SAS data set is processed and controlled
only through the SAS System. See SAS data file and SAS data view for how SAS
data sets are implemented in Version 7 of the SAS System. </TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>SAS data view</TD>
<TD align="left">one of the formats of a SAS data set.  A
SAS data view contains only the  descriptor and other information required

<TD align="left">a password, other than the master password
or DBA password, having restricted SYSTEM 2000 statement usage and specifically
assigned update, retrieval, and where-clause authorities for any or all components
in a SYSTEM 2000 database. </TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>single-user environment</TD>
<TD align="left">the SYSTEM 2000 execution environment in
which you are working with your own copy of SYSTEM 2000 software.  Usually,
in a single-user environment, you have exclusive access to the database. 
However, the single-user environment, can be configured so that that all users
can query the database. See also Multi-User environment.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>stored string</TD>
<TD align="left">one or more SYSTEM 2000 statements stored
in a database definition. For example, you can store a SYSTEM 2000 where-clause
as a string. </TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>U-authority</TD>
<TD align="left">a code that gives a secondary password the
authority to update a SYSTEM 2000 schema item or record; set by the master
password holder.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>variable</TD>
<TD align="left">a column in a SAS data file.  Each SAS variable
can have the following attributes:  name, type (character or numeric), length,
format, informat, and label. In the ACCESS procedure, variables are created
from SYSTEM 2000 item names.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>view</TD>
<TD align="left">a definition of a virtual data set that
is named and stored for later use.  This file contains no data, but it describes
or defines data stored elsewhere.  SAS data views can be created by the ACCESS
and SQL procedures.  See also SAS data view.
<P>For example, when a SAS/ACCESS view -- a view descriptor
-- is referenced in the SAS PRINT procedure, the view reads data directly
from a SYSTEM 2000 database. You can also reference this view in certain SAS
procedures to update the database described by a SAS/ACCESS view.
<P>A view defined by the SQL procedure reads data from
its underlying SAS data files, other PROC SQL views, or SAS/ACCESS views.
Its output table can be a subset or a superset of one or multiple underlying
structures.  However, in Release 6.06, you cannot reference a PROC SQL view
to update its underlying data. ?????</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>view descriptor</TD>
<TD align="left">a SAS/ACCESS file that defines a subset
of a database described by an access descriptor. The subset consists of selected
items in a given path of one SYSTEM 2000 database with optional selection
and ordering criteria. See also access descriptor.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>W-authority</TD>
<TD align="left">a code that gives a secondary password the
authority to use a SYSTEM 2000 schema item or record for selection criteria
in a where-clause.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>where-clause</TD>
<TD align="left">a set of one or more user-specified conditions
that states the selection criteria for SYSTEM 2000 updates or retrievals.</TD></TR>
