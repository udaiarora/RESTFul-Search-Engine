				  <p><strong>I. Shared Leadership/Collaboration Among Staff At All Levels</strong>
				  <br><br>
				  Shared leadership occurs when decision-making takes place at whatever level is appropriate. Decisions are made at all levels in the organization, not only at the upper management level. Information to make decisions is sought from those people most directly involved in the outcome and implementation of the decision. True collaboration occurs when staff are able to work in a cooperative manner with those outside their work units for the greater benefit of the organization.</p>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Clarify the concept of shared leadership as it applies to the University Libraries and promote both shared leadership and collaboration as part of the organizational culture.</li><br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Shared leadership is a management concept that the Libraries' personnel are in favor of adopting, with the recognition that it entails a new set of behaviors that will only become part of the organizational culture over time.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> As soon as possible.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Staff report through surveys, etc., that the concept of shared leadership is understood and that participation in it has increased throughout the Libraries. The practice of shared leadership improves the quality, acceptance and timeliness of decisions. Output measures include the dissemination of ground rules, all staff having undergone training.</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Inter- and intra-departmental collaboration is actively promoted to ensure effective utilization of the wide variety of skills and the knowledge base available within the Libraries, and to ensure that decisions at all levels of the organization are communicated to those affected by the decisions.</li><br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Collaborative behavior benefits the entire organization as it results in effective, timely service to customers.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> As soon as possible.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Staff throughout the Libraries report that both inter- and intra-departmental collaboration has increased and that internal customer service has improved. Output measures include the dissemination of performance expectations and annual evaluations that incorporate assessment by the expectations.</li>
				  </ul>
				  </ul><br>
				  <p><strong>II. Communication</strong><br><br>
				  Effective communication occurs at all levels in the organization: within work units, between units, and from the top down and the bottom up.</p>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Identify and reaffirm successful means of communication within the Libraries. Identify causes of discontent about lack of communication. Correct problem areas by developing programs such as regularly scheduled training for small groups on topics related to communication. Emphasis will be placed on the diversity of ways of communicating, such as articles in SoundOff, distributed via electronic mail, communicated person-to-person, etc.</li><br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Improved communication enhances awareness of how all library activities are inter-related and results in further improvements in individual job performance and customer service.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Survey staff and begin training no later than January, 1997.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Staff report that they have the information they need to do their jobs more effectively for both external and internal customers.</li>
				  </ul>
				  </ul><br>
				  <p><strong>III. Rewards And Recognition</strong><br><br>
				  Rewards and recognition are important components of motivation toward excellence. Motivation can be encouraged through both intrinsic (e.g., finding one?s work challenging, fulfilling, interesting) and extrinsic rewards (e.g., recognition by the organization).</p>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Develop and conduct a survey of all library staff to assess what are considered to be meaningful rewards and methods of recognition; from the results of this survey, measures will be taken to enhance and supplement those rewards and recognition strategies already being utilized.</li><br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> This strategy reaffirms staff preferences regarding rewards and recognition and helps to retain valuable, well-trained library personnel.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Program in place by January, 1997.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Perception of increased motivation by a significant number of staff, resulting in higher quality service for both external and internal customers.</li>
				  </ul>
				  </ul><br>
				  <p><strong>IV. Training And Development</strong><br><br>
				  Training is instruction in all parts of one?s job -- both its technical and human relations aspects -- that enable one to perform effectively. Development is not confined to, but includes: professional and personal growth through participation in workshops, seminars, classes, etc.</p>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Define and establish a library-wide training and development program for all staff.</li><br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li>Key elements of this program will include:</li><br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li>consistent quality and relevant content;</li>
				  <li>outcome measures for training effectiveness that are clearly delineated and demonstrably achieved;</li>
				  <li>a library-wide orientation program for new and continuing staff, including student employees;</li>
				  <li>an expectation that each staff member will spend a minimum number of hours per year in training and development activities;</li>
				  <li>a focus for certain programs that is based on strategic need and/or as revealed in internal customer surveys or feedback from external customers;</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> There is a need to assure consistency in training and development throughout the Libraries which would ultimately enhance library-wide service capabilities.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Written guidelines in place by January, 1997.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> A January, 1998 survey indicates that a significant number of staff feel the program has improved job training in the Libraries and offers greater opportunities and support for training and development.</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Supervisors at all levels will participate in training programs which emphasize the principles of shared leadership and collaboration (e.g., coaching, teaching, building consensus, sharing in goal setting, empowering others to get things done).</li><br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> This training may be available now but is an option; supervisors at all levels are critical players in the new workplace and all should be equally trained in skills essential to the success of the organization.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Implementation as soon as possible.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Staff report improved communication, increased collaboration and shared leadership, greater job satisfaction.</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Campus and library training programs on the use and application of electronic resources will be widely promoted on a regular basis; if not available on campus, efforts will be exhaustively pursued to make them available to the Libraries' staff.</li><br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Training in electronic capabilities is a critically important area as we move into the future defined by the strategic plan. Keeping up with this rapidly changing field is a challenging task.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Immediate implementation.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> A January, 1998 survey indicates that a majority of staff have increased their skills in using electronic resources that pertain to their jobs, so that service to customers is of a higher quality.</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Each staff member will propose and negotiate a personal development plan for the following year as a routine element of his/her annual performance review. Once established, the following year's performance review will address the staff member's progress in this area.</li><br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The importance of continuing training and development is a key element of each staff member's success and should be documented in the annual performance review.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Immediate implementation.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Staff are more knowledgeable regarding their assignments and the role and mission of the library; they perform at a consistently high caliber, continuously improving their knowledge and skills. These factors contribute to their own and customers' satisfaction.</li>
