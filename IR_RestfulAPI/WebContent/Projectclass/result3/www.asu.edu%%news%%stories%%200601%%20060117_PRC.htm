<h1 class="storyhead">Center aims to help children build resiliency in times of trauma</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>Within 10 years, researchers at ASU's Prevention Research Center plan to change the "legacy of divorce" in the United States. </p>
<p>They also intend to help children better deal with one of the most traumatic events that can occur in their lives: the death of a parent. </p>
<p>The National Institute of Mental Health has awarded the center a $7 million grant to adapt two model programs that have been scientifically proven to prevent behavioral and mental health problems in children and families experiencing these high-stress situations. </p>

<p> The Prevention Research Center is a national leader in research on multiple issues in prevention science, including children&#8217;s adaptation to divorce, bereavement and poverty. Its focus is on preventing mental health-related problems. As part of ASU&#8217;s Department of Psychology, it is an interdisciplinary group that includes researchers from across the university as well as collaborations with community agencies and researchers throughout the country. </p>
<p>With research solidly in place, the ASU researchers are attempting to do something novel in the social sciences: take their research and establish effective delivery of the intervention in the "real world." </p>
<p>"We have demonstrated that changes in protective factors, like improved parenting, can reduce mental health problems in children," says Irwin Sandler, director of the Prevention Research Center and an ASU Regents' Professor of psychology. "The grant will help move our programs from the lab to the field. It gives us the ability to partner with agencies and establish these programs as viable services." </p>
<p>With divorce so prevalent in the United States, that particular source of family stress has earned a large measure of the researchers' attention. More than 1.5 million children experience parental divorce each year in the United States, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. </p>
<p>Children whose parents divorce are about twice as likely to experience a range of problems, from depression to drug use and teen pregnancy. They also are more likely to drop out of school. </p>
<p>The Prevention Research Center's "New Beginnings" program, launched in 1992 and led by Sharlene Wolchik, an ASU professor of psychology, represents a milestone in research on how to prevent behavioral and mental-health problems in children of divorce. </p>
<p>It was the first study to document long-term effects of preventative interventions for children of divorce using an experimental trial. It proved that positive parenting strategies - such as effective listening, maintaining positive routines, being clear and consistent in discipline, and minimizing conflict between parents - and teaching children coping skills can have a dramatic effect on children's development after divorce. </p>
<p>Children going through the 11-week program, after six years, had a 38 percent lower rate of mental health problems than their peers. The findings were published in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association </em>, a rarity for research in the psychosocial fields. </p>
<p>"Most kids are very resilient and adapt well after divorce," Sandler says. "For those kids with difficulties, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. What makes the most difference in a child's life following divorce is consistent, warm, disciplined parenting." </p>
<p>The team will pilot-test "New Beginnings" with families going through the court system in Maricopa County, Ariz., and Seattle. They then will launch a multiple-site experimental study. Within 10 years, they expect to make the program available to any divorcing family in the United States. </p>
<p>Sandler and his collaborators, ASU professors of psychology Sanford Braver and Nancy Gonzales, are working on several major areas that are critical for making the transition: developing an infrastructure for program delivery, developing community collaborations and assessing cultural factors unique to specific populations. </p>
<p>"We are focused on developing a system where the courts can help families access the program as part of the divorcing process," Sandler says. </p>
<p>Maricopa County Presiding Family Court Judge Norman Davis is working with the Prevention Research Center on program adaptation. He says the ASU project presents "a good opportunity to collaborate and explore programming to help families in crisis." The goal, he says, "is better parenting for the children's sake, and healthier family relationships after divorce." </p>
<p>Developing a national model of its family bereavement program will be the second initiative supported by the grant, and will be done in collaboration with researchers from the W. P. Carey School of Business and community agencies such as the New Song Center, a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based organization that provides support for grieving children, youth, young adults and their families. </p>
<p>Initial studies of the ASU's family bereavement program show promising results in reducing the rate of clinically significant mental health problems for high-risk children and adolescents. </p>
<p>"Excellent research is done," but the resulting psychological interventions are not efficiently translated into community services that benefit the public, according to Amy Ostrom and Mary Jo Bitner, co-principal investigators on the project. </p>
<p>Ostrom and Bitner, who are professors in the W.P. Carey School of Business, specialize in marketing services. Their goal is to adapt service development models - primarily constructed in the private, for-profit business sector - to psychological and community health settings. </p>
