Professors and students of statistics will find in this book the perfect   approach to learning and teaching computing in statistics with emphasis
on the SAS programming language. While integrating computing into          beginning statistics studies, this book provides the necessary means to
learn computing and acquire an appreciation for basic data analysis        techniques. Divided into 21 modules, statistical concepts covered range
from the simple to ANOVA, regression, and analysis of covariance.          Complete the first two modules and learn the basics of the SAS System.
The remaining modules can be studied in any order that corresponds with    your course of study. This flexible format makes this book uniquely
suited to both the classroom and to those who are learning                 independently. All modules contain examples, sample problems for
practice and a recap of the material covered.
