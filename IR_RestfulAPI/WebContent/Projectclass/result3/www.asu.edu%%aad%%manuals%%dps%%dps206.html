This minimizes the need for rekeying in the event that the keys are lost or stolen.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Responsibility for University Access and Key Control</b></font><p>The primary responsibility for security patrols of buildings and grounds rests with the ASU Department of Public Safety (ASU DPS).  ASU DPS, in cooperation with Facilities Management, is responsible for university key distribution and is authorized to initiate and implement this policy through the  vice president for University Administration and General Counsel.  The ASU DPS section responsible for this operation is ASU DPS Key Control, which<p><ol><li>approves or disapproves all key requests</li><p><li>issues keys to individuals or departmental designees authorized to control keys</li><p><li>conducts an investigative review of each instance of key loss or theft; recommends corrective measures</li><p><li>conducts periodic audits of campus departments to determine status of authorized keys<p>and</li><p><li>in consultation with Facilities Management, approves all new access control systems and modifications to existing systems.</li></ol><p>The primary responsibility for maintenance and service of buildings and grounds rests with Facilities Management.  Facilities Management is responsible for all maintenance, repair, and installation of locking systems.  The unit responsible for this work is the ASU Lock Shop, which<ol><li>maintains current and accurate key control records</li><p><li>creates and maintains a keying system that provides security and reasonable access to departments occupying campus facilities</li><p><li>makes all keys and combinates all cylinders</li><p><li>maintains a secure file for original keys furnished with all new buildings, additions, or renovations</li><p><li>issues periodic reports as required</li><p><li>performs all maintenance and repairs of locking systems<p>and</li><p><li>consults with ASU DPS Key Control concerning records of lost or stolen keys and decisions to rekey.</li></ol><p>All university property that is secured by locking devices shall be secured by locks having the capability of being combinated to the university master key system.<p>All keys remain the property of the university. Obsolete or unneeded keys must be returned to ASU DPS Key Control to clear the account of the person to whom they were assigned, as well as to cancel the liability of the authorizing department.<p>Individuals are limited to one key per room or area.<p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>Personnel who are assigned custody of departmental keys may request and receive more than one key to a particular area, when approved by ASU DPS.</td></tr></table><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Approving Authority for Keys</b></font><p>The following unit administrators are authorized to control the issuance of keys to individuals within their assigned areas:<p><ol><li>the president</li><p><li>the executive vice president and provost of the university</li><p><li>the vice presidents</li><p><li>the vice provosts</li><p><li>the deans</li><p><li>the directors</li><p><li>the department heads or chairs<p> and</li><p><li>anyone designated by one of the above.</li></ol><p>This authority is recognized by means of a <a href="dpsforms.html">Key Authorization Form</a> submitted to ASU DPS Key Control.  No key will be issued without the written approval of one of the unit administrators mentioned above.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Unauthorized Use and Reproduction of Keys</b></font><p>No person shall knowingly possess an unauthorized key to property owned by the state of Arizona.<p>No person shall duplicate any key to property owned by the state of Arizona.<p>Violation of these policies shall constitute a class 3 criminal misdemeanor, as described in the <i>Arizona Revised Statutes</i> &#167; 13&#150;3715, &#147;Unauthorized manufacture, duplication, use or possession of key to a public building&#148;:<br><p><ol type="a"><li>A person who knowingly causes to be manufactured or duplicated or who possesses or uses a key to any building or other area owned, operated, or controlled by this state or any agency, board, commission, institution, or political subdivision of this state, without authorization from the person or his designated representative in charge of such building or area, is guilty of a class 3 misdemeanor.</li><p><li>A person who manufactures or duplicates a key for himself or another to any building or other area owned, operated, or controlled by this state or any agency, board, commission, institution, or political subdivision of this state, with knowledge that he or the person requesting the manufacturing or duplication of such key does not have authorization from the person or his designated representative in charge of such building or area, is guilty of a class 3 misdemeanor.</li></ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Requests for Rekeying</b></font><p>When circumstances warrant, departments may request rekeying of locks.  These requests may arise from new access needs, lost keys, change of personnel, or other conditions.  Requests for rekeying should be submitted in writing to ASU DPS Key Control.  All requests are reviewed to determine the appropriate action to be taken.<p>Requests for rekeying are not considered routine maintenance, and departments requesting rekeying are billed for the work.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Keys to Areas Removed from the Master Key System</b></font><p>When it is deemed absolutely necessary to remove an area from the master key system, the requesting department sends a written request, with appropriate justification, to the director of ASU DPS.  The Crime Prevention Unit of the Police Services Division will perform an evaluation of the request. The director of ASU DPS will send the original request, evaluation by the crime prevention unit, and recommendations to the responsible vice president or vice provost for a decision. If the request is approved by the responsible vice president or vice provost, the ASU Lock Shop combinates the necessary cylinders and cuts the keys requested.  No extra keys are kept, nor will any be cut except those authorized by a properly approved key request.<p>Once approved, the requesting department shall furnish ASU DPS with the names and phone numbers of at least two people who are available to respond to after-hours calls should an emergency arise in the area.  In the event that ASU DPS is unable to reach these individuals and the safety of the building and/or its occupants make it necessary to force entry, the department authorizing removal of the area from the master key system is liable for the cost of repairs.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Special Door Locks</b></font><p>Under most circumstances, the university does not allow the installation of door locks that do not conform to the standard lock systems in use on the campus.  Any request for special door locks must be approved by the appropriate vice president or vice provost and sent to the director of ASU DPS with written justification.  The director of ASU DPS will determine if there is a demonstrated need that cannot be met by the existing locking systems.  Departments may not order and/or install any locking device on any door without the written approval of ASU DPS.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Departmental Keys</b></font><p>Departmental keys are those used by several people within a department. They are for use during normal working hours and are not to be taken home by those using them, but must remain secured at the university when not in use.<p>A designated member of the department has custody of these keys and is responsible for them. Departmental keys must be kept in a secure cabinet, approved by ASU DPS, when not checked out and signed for on an approved log to be maintained by the designated responsible person.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Vendor and Contractor Keys</b></font><p>Vendors and contractors needing access to portions of university property (telephone service, elevator service, vending, etc.) are issued keys through ASU DPS Key Control.  Should the key be lost or not returned upon expiration of the period of usage, vendors and contractors are responsible for rekeying costs to all affected facilities.  Prior to keys being issued, vendors and contractors are required to sign an agreement to pay all rekeying costs for areas affected by lost or nonreturned keys.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Lost or Stolen Keys</b></font><p>Lost or stolen keys must be reported to ASU DPS within 24 hours of the discovery of the loss or theft on the <a href="dpsforms.html">Lost or Stolen Key(s) Form</a>.<p>Individuals who are issued university keys are responsible for their safekeeping and for any charges associated with their loss or theft. Individual desks are not considered secure storage for university keys.  Fees for the replacement of keys reported missing or stolen from desks, cabinets, lockers, or similar places are assessed as outlined in this policy.  <p>Replacement keys are issued only after submission of a new, completed <a href="dpsforms.html">Key Action Form</a> to ASU DPS Key Control and after payment of lost key charges. Should rekeying be necessary, the cost is paid by the individual or his or her department.<p>Charges for lost or stolen keys are set by ASU DPS and approved by the executive vice president for Administration and Finance. Charges are reviewed annually for adequacy and adjusted as deemed necessary.<p>Current charges are as follows:<p><table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1><tr><th>Type of Key<hr></th><th>Charge<hr></th></tr><tr><td valign=TOP>Individual Door</td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>&#036;10</td></tr><tr><td valign=TOP>Outside Door</td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>&#036;20</td></tr><tr><td valign=TOP>Sub-Master</td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>&#036;50</td></tr><tr><td valign=TOP>Building Master</td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>&#036;100</td></tr></table><p>Regardless of the number of keys involved, when keys are lost or stolen, no individual is required to pay more than &#036;500 and no department more than &#036;10,000 per occurrence.<p>As a general rule, if keys have been lost or stolen, this policy calls for the rekeying of rooms, areas, or buildings.<p>An investigative review is conducted by ASU DPS in each instance of lost or stolen keys. The mandatory rekeying policy can be waived only upon written notification by the department head or chair and concurrence by the responsible dean and vice president.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Miscellaneous Requirements and Prohibitions</b></font><p>The exchanging or lending of keys between individuals is prohibited.<p>When keys are no longer needed by an individual or department, they must be returned to ASU DPS Key Control.  Upon termination of an employee authorized to hold a key, the key is returned immediately to ASU DPS or the authorized holder is transferred to the department name for later reissue so that the terminating employee is released from any further liability.<p>It is the responsibility of the person assigned to an office or laboratory to ensure that the door is locked when leaving the area or at the conclusion of work.<p><img src="dpshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Procedure</b></font><a href="dps206table.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">D</font></a></center><img src="dpshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]"  width="100%" height="2"><p><hr noshade><table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1><tr><th>Responsibility<hr></th><th>Action<hr></th></tr><tr valign=TOP><td>Department or unit</td><td><ol><li>Complete Key Action Form.
