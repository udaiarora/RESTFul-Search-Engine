CULTURAL DIVERSITY IN THE UNITED STATES (C)</H4>

<U>Rationale and Objectives</U><P>

The contemporary "culture" of the United States involves the complex interplay of many different cultures that exist side by side in various states of harmony and conflict.  The history of the United States involves the experiences not only of different g
roups of European immigrants and their descendants but also of diverse groups of American Indians, Hispanic Americans, African Americans, and Asian Americans--all of whom played significant roles in the development of contemporary culture and together sha
pe the future of the United States.  At the same time, the recognition that gender, class, and religious differences cut across all distinctions of race and ethnicity offers an even richer variety of perspectives from which to view ourselves.  Awareness o
f our cultural diversity and its multiple sources can illuminate our collective past, present, and future and can help us to achieve greater mutual understanding and respect.<P>

The objective of the Cultural Diversity requirement is to promote awareness and appreciation of cultural diversity within the contemporary United States through the study of the cultural, social, or scientific contributions of women and minority groups, e
xamination of their experiences in the U.S. , or exploration of successful or unsuccessful interactions between and among cultural groups.<P>
