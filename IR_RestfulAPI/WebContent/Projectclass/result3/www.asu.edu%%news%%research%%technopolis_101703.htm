      <h2>Technopolis to aid local technology, life science entrepreneurs</h2>
      <p>        Providing local technology and life science innovators with an entrepreneurial
        education will help transform Phoenix into an internationally-recognized
        "technology city." And ASU Technopolis, launched by the Office of Economic
        Affairs, will provide that education. </p>
      <p>ASU Technopolis will draw upon
          ASU's vast expertise to help these local innovators create viable business
          plans; manage fast-growing companies;
          access public and private funding; and connect with other entrepreneurs,
          ASU programs, and business and technical experts. </p>
      <p>ASU Technopolis' first
          program, "Launch Pad," will be offered beginning Nov. 5. "Launch Pad"
          is a rigorous, eight-week process that uses a well-established,
          structured methodology to coach entrepreneurs to produce a quality
        business plan presentation. The entrepreneur then presents the plan to
        a "dream
          team" panel of potential investors, customers and partners that the
        entrepreneur helps select. To participate in "Launch Pad," entrepreneurs
        must apply
          to a competitive selection process, in which a review panel chooses
        eight ventures.</p>
      <p>Technopolis will also provide a series of in-depth workshops
          to help local entrepreneurs access federal funding programs that finance
          early
          stages of technology and life science product development. These programs,
          the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology
          Transfer Research (STTR), provide critical funding to entrepreneurs
        to help determine the viability of technology or life science products.
          Winners of these grants, typically ranging from $100,000 to $750,000,
          are not required to share ownership of their companies with the federal
          government. A hands-on SBIR Phase II proposal-writing workshop will
        be
          offered Nov. 13. Additional programs to help entrepreneurs win federal
          funding awards will be offered throughout the year.</p>
      <p>ASU President Michael
          Crow says, "Technopolis is an example of how ASU is enhancing its role
          as a catalyst for high-value economic development
          in the region. ASU Technopolis creates an environment for new ideas
        and technology businesses to flourish, by delivering the resources that
        are
          essential, but often out of reach for local individuals and small,
        entrepreneurial businesses. The program will generate substantial benefit
        to entrepreneurs
          and the community."<br>
        ASU Technopolis is modeled after the renowned CONNECT program at the
          University of California at San Diego (UCSD), which has been widely
          credited for playing a significant role in San Diego's economic transformation
          into a high-tech powerhouse.<br>
        "ASU contributes to the well-being of Arizona's economy in a number
          of ways, including research, policy analyses, workforce development,
          technology
          transfer and entrepreneurial education," says Rob Melnick, ASU's recently-appointed
          associate vice president of Economic Affairs. ASU Technopolis expands
          ASU's economic impact by providing non-credit, cutting-edge programs
          customized to the needs of science and technology-focused entrepreneurs
          in Greater Phoenix.<br>
        To coach participating entrepreneurs and to promote ASU Technopolis,
          the Office of Economic Affairs has tapped Tech Continuum Ventures (TCV),
          led by Dan O'Neill and Sharon Ballard. </p>
      <p>"The principals of TCV are successful
          technology-focused CEOs. Dan O'Neill is not only an outstanding businessman,
          he is extraordinarily dedicated
          to the long-term economic vitality of the region as evidenced by his
          broad-based contributions to local technology and economic development
          organizations. Sharon Ballard has vast experience successfully coaching
          entrepreneurs internationally and, in particular, at UCSD's CONNECT
        program. She has unparalleled knowledge and experience helping entrepreneurs
        secure
          funding from the SBIR and STTR federal grant programs," says Melnick. </p>
      <p>"ASU Technopolis is exactly what this community needs," says Gregg Adkin,
          general partner at Arizona venture capital firm Valley Ventures. "Its
          programs will significantly accelerate the rate at which entrepreneurs
          secure investment and generate revenue." </p>
      <p>ASU Technopolis is a program
          of ASU's Office of the Vice President for Research and Economic Affairs.
          The office works with faculty researchers,
          campus units, community organizations, government and businesses to
        increase ASU's contribution to the metropolitan economy. </p>
