      <h2 align="left">Regents hear student referendum, approve projects </h2>
      <p>A student-initiated referendum to increase student fees to help pay for renovation and expansion of the Memorial Union and the Student Recreation Complex was presented Jan. 23 at the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) meeting. </p>
      <p>ASU Graduate Student Association President Brian Collier and Associated Students of ASU (ASASU) President Brandon Goad are championing the referendum. They presented the proposal following an introduction by ASU President Michael Crow. </p>
      <p>Crow said the issue is complex, but one that "clearly reflects the maturing mind-set of the students to invest further in their education, and I am fully in support of their taking an active role through their leadership position." </p>
      <p>ASASU will facilitate the student voting process, which will occur on Feb. 18 and Feb. 19. If the students approve this, a recommendation will be presented to President Crow for his review and decision regarding a capital development item for the Arizona Board of Regents. </p>
      <p>Arizona's university presidents are obligated by statute to present their tuition and fee increase recommendations to the ABOR on Feb. 2., and ABOR President Chris Herstam said he's "concerned about the timing in all of this." </p>
      <p>The student referendum proposes an increase in student fees as follows: $25 per semester in 2004 - 05; $75 per semester in 2005 - 06; $100 per semester in 2006 - 07; and $155 per semester in 2007 - 08. </p>
      <p>Regent Jack Jewett said he is concerned that this student fee will hurt students who are already struggling to obtain financial assistance. </p>
      <p>Crow responded by saying the details surrounding the increase of financial aid offerings have not been discussed, however, he assured Regents that ASU is committed "to making certain that the university is affordable for those who don't have the means to afford going to the university." </p>
      <p>President Crow will present his 2004 - 05 tuition recommendation Feb. 2. </p>
      <p>The Arizona Board of Regents is scheduled to set 2004 - 05 tuition and fees during the March 11 - 12 meeting. </p>
      <p>Items approved at the Jan. 22 - 23 Arizona Board of Regents meeting included: </p>
      <p>. The approval of an intergovernmental agreement with the City of Phoenix for the Arizona Biomedical Collaborative (ABC) Facility Development. The ABC project is aimed to coordinate the collaborative efforts of ASU, Northern Arizona University and the University of Arizona to meet the needs of the state through further expansion and development of statewide healthcare educational programs, biomedical research programs and health policy. </p>
      <p>. The approval of a special program fee for the J.D. program at ASU's College of Law. </p>
      <p>Currently the special program fee is $5,750 above the base tuition and fees charged by the university for newly enrolled students and $4,250 above the base tuition and fees charged by the university for second and third year students. Beginning in 2004 - 05 the special program fee will be set at a level not to exceed $7,250 while maintaining the special program fee of $4,250 for the current second year class only. </p>
      <p>. The approval of the Arizona Biodesign Institute Phase II building, estimated at a total project cost of $73 million. The building, to be situated within the northwest portion of Lot 44, is planned for high tech laboratory and office space and is to be physically connected at all floor levels to Arizona Biodesign Institute Phase I. Preliminary planning includes approximately 142,000 square feet of bioengineering, biotechnology, integrative biomedicine laboratories, an animal care facility which will serve the institute, and 30,000 square feet of faculty/research and administrative offices. </p>
      <p>. The approval of the license agreement between Arizona Technology Enterprises, LLC, ASU's intellectual property management company, and Nanobiomics, Inc. </p>
      <p>Frederic Zenhausern is the director of ASU's Applied Nanobioscience Center (ABNC) and has developed and continues to develop technologies in the field of molecular diagnostics through his work with ANBC. ANBC is part of the <br>
        ASU Arizona Biodesign Institute led by George Poste. </p>
      <p>. The approval of the Capital Development Plan update which included four new projects: Academic Renovations and Deferred Maintenance Phase 1, $10 million; Infrastructure Improvements Phase III, $7 million; Arts and Business District Gateway (third-party financing); and South Campus Academic Village (third-party financing). </p>
