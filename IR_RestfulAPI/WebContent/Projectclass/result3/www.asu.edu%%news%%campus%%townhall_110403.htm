      <h2>Hard work paying off as ASU evolves to national status</h2>
      <p>        ASU President Michael Crow thanked employees for their hard work, dedication
          and accomplishments over the past 15 months during his Town Hall session
          on Oct. 22. He said everyone's efforts are a significant part of the
        process to evolve ASU into a national university. </p>
      <p>"A national university
            is an institution that is competing at the highest possible level
        in all aspects of its identity - its academic programs,
          its specialty programs, its athletic programs - everything," Crow said.</p>
      <p>Crow
          said ASU is embarking on its sixth evolutionary step as an institution,
          growing from a territorial normal school, to a teacher's college, to
          a state college, to a comprehensive state college, to a state university,
          and, now, the step from a state university to a national university.
          "Six steps of evolution in a little more than 100 years is huge," Crow
          said. "Almost no institution, and, certainly, no university, has had
          to go through that. It puts a huge amount of stress into the organization
          when you've just completed step five and someone comes along and says
          'hey, let's take step six.'</p>
      <p>"But, step six is essential for the success
          of metropolitan Phoenix and the success of Arizona," Crow said.</p>
      <p>To point out ASU's success in moving
          toward step six in its evolution, Crow introduced the university's
        first annual report, printed through
          the ASU Alumni Association in Vision Magazine, which represents a summary
          of the ASU community's collective efforts over the past year and a
        half.</p>
      <p>"Many
          of you have heard me talk about the enterprise model, or being more
        entrepreneurial, and have probably wondered 'what is he talking
          about.' This report's content helps explain what we mean by academic
          enterprise - being responsible for ourselves, being responsible for
        our own destiny, plotting our own course and moving forward and behaving
          in ways where we don't act and think like an agency of the government.we
          act and think like a university, an independent creature."</p>
      <p>In addition
          to highlighting successes, Crow answered questions from the audience.
          The full presentation is available electronically online at
          (<a href="http://is.asu.edu/live">http://is.asu.edu/live</a>).</p>
      <p>Following are some questions submitted via
          e-mail that were not addressed at the Town Hall due to time constraints:</p>
      <p><strong>Q. If all of ASU's funding goes to athletics, research in sciences,
        business and law, what does this say about our commitment to the departments
        that place emphasis on the human endeavors of art and literature?</strong><br>
        A. The ASU Intercollegiate Athletic Department gets minimal funding from
        the university, relying instead on revenue producing sports and external
        fund-raising support programs. </p>
      <p>There has been a great deal of publicity
          around our research infrastructure program and large gifts to support
          specific colleges, such as business
          and engineering. I can't stress enough the importance of building strong,
          well-funded science and technology programs, because when a university's
          scientific programs are world class, those programs bring in new revenues,
          which frees up other funds to build world class humanities, arts and
          literature programs. Just last month, we received a $10 million gift
          for the new Virginia G. Piper Center for Creative Writing.</p>
      <p><strong>Q. Are there any plans to add more on-campus housing at the Main Campus,
        and when?</strong><br>
        A. Yes, we are planning for the development of approximately 5,500 new
        beds over the next four years. The first phase is the McAllister Academic
        Village, with 2,000 beds. The first 500 beds will be operational for
        fall 2005, and the remaining 1,500 beds will be available for fall 2006.
        The Barrett Honors College will follow with approximately 1,700 beds
        - possibly in Fall 2006 as well. The remaining beds will follow with
      the redevelopment of the south campus housing area.</p>
      <p><strong>Q. Will the salary increase you mentioned be given as a lump sum, is
        it based on merit, and will the increase address employees with at least
        10 years experience who are not at mid-point in salary range?</strong><br>
        A. The salary increase will be based on merit, as a reward for high-level
        performance. There is an opportunity within the merit adjustment process
        to address market and salary equity issues. The salary adjustment will
        not be a lump-sum payment, but will be added as a percentage to eligible
      employees' base salary.</p>
      <p><strong>Q. Will the university be prepared to handle enrollment growth in terms
        of student support, faculty teaching support and crowded conditions?</strong><br>
        A. We are a very successful state university trying to become a unique
        national university in a unique place, while growing at an unprecedented
        rate. We have a long way to go. This institution is probably funded at
        50 percent of the level that's needed to carry out the mission we have.
        Tremendous things have been done here with limited funding. The people
        of Arizona are the most significant contributor to this institution and,
        person for person, they also are the most generous contributor. Alumni,
        private donors, and students actually contribute very little compared
        to other state universities. We need substantial increases in financial
        aid, substantial improvements in access, substantially enhanced salaries
        for all staff, substantial expansion of faculty, larger numbers of advisers
        and better repair of our buildings. But the solution to all that does
        not rest solely with the ability of the administration to sell the Arizona
        legislature. Our future rests in our ability to dream what we want to
        be and sell it to everyone - students, families, donors, alumni, everyone
      - and that's what we're trying to do.</p>
