				<h1>The 10 IT Services New Employees Need To Know</h1>
				
				<p class="article">Information Technology (IT) wants new members of the ASU community to have the help they need in finding computing resources. This "top ten" checklist covers some of the most frequently-used services that IT provides.</p>
				<p class="article">You can take an online tour of IT by visiting the <a href="/connecting/">"Connecting With IT" Orientation pages</a>. "Connecting With IT" is a step-by-step introduction to the department that is updated annually. The IT Orientation has information helpful to both new and returning ASU community members. There are printable guides to services on the IT Orentation Web site in PDF format.</p>
				<li><p class="article"><strong>IT provides campus technology support </strong><br />
				The IT department provides infrastructure support for the university in areas that include administrative mainframe systems, centralized server systems, desktop systems, classroom technology, data communications, wireless networking, voice communications, and computer security. If you do not know where to go for help with a question about centralized technology services, you can submit a question or problem to the IT Help Desk by visiting the <a href="/askit/">Ask IT Web page</a>.</p></li>
				<li><p class="article"><strong>IT provides tools for data protection and security</strong><br />
				Data backup resources include AFS space and CD/DVD burners available in the IT Computing Sites and IT Classrooms and from Classroom Support. You can learn about security best practices, and download security software, by visiting the <a href="/security/">Computer Security Web pages</a>. ASU will be hosting a Computer Security Awareness Week Oct. 31 - Nov. 3. Speeches about preventing laptop theft and other security topics by visiting experts at the most recent Computer Security Week can be viewed online in streaming video. </p></li>
				<li><p class="article"><strong>IT supports online services</strong><br />
				At the <a href="http://my.asu.edu/">myASU portal</a>, you'll find ASU news and announcements of interest to the university community and access to online university services. IT provides support for the myASU portal, for portal development, and for the Blackboard online course management system. Many of the forms used to request IT services or changes to services are hosted online. </p></li>
				<li><p class="article"><strong>IT provides Web access to information</strong> <br />
				The <a href="/it/">IT Web site</a> has detailed information about services provided by the department, hours and locations for service areas, and computing site schedules. System status reports are posted on the IT System Status page.</p></li>
				<li><p class="article"><strong>IT offers learning resources</strong><br />
				Faculty and instructors have access to computing resources and training in the Instruction Support Lab as well as in the open-access IT Computing Sites.</p>
				<p class="article">For information about personal computing, a menu of links to frequently-asked questions can be found at the <a href="/askit/">Ask IT Web page</a>. Help sheets for software and services are available on the <a href="/itdocs/">IT Documentation pages</a>.</p></li>
				<li><p class="article"><strong>IT offers teaching resources</strong><br />
				Mediated classroom equipment for academic use is provided by IT Classroom Support. If you'd like to take a course on the use of technology for teaching, there are Instruction Support workshops, Classroom Support training sessions, and myASU workshops in addition to courses provided by ASU. Instructors may post software, sample test questions, assignments, or handouts on the Instructor Volumes, so that students can access them from any computing site. </p></li>
				<li><p class="article"><strong>IT supports tools for efficient work</strong><br />
				Making use of add-on services and time management options can help you streamline your work and save time. From time to time, the <a href="/it/news/">IT News Web site</a> features stories about how to make the most of services like e-mail and voice mail. Browse the <a href="/it/news/archive.htm">IT News Archives</a> for these articles, or use the IT Search page for keyword search if you are looking for a particular topic.</p> 
				</li>
				<li><p class="article"><strong>IT provides e-mail updates</strong><br />
				ASU community members can join one of the <a href="http://announce.asu.edu/">IT Announcement Groups</a> and receive e-mail notification about specific services or systems they use. Subscribe to an IT News announcement list to be notified of IT announcements and informative articles that are of general interest.</p></li>
				<li><p class="article"><strong>IT can assist you with service changes</strong><br />
				To make changes to your ASURITE UserID services, see the <a href="/asurite/">ASURITE Activation and Service Management Web page</a>. To help you if you forget your password, the Web page includes a self-service password reset function. Blackberry site licensing is provided at the IT Help Desk. Departmental requests for networking services go to Data Communications. Telephone Services is the resource for requesting telephone systems services, voice mail and pagers.</p></li>
				<li><p class="article"><strong>IT has answers for your questions</strong><br />
				Consulting for computing problems is available from the IT Help Desk. You can submit questions to the IT Help Desk using the Submit A Question form at the <a href="/askit/">Ask IT Web page</a>. An IT consultant will respond to your questions by e-mail. The IT Help Desk also has walk-in support hours from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays. Call (480) 965-6500 for critical problem reporting. AskASU (askasu@asu.edu) answers general questions about the university that are outside the area of technical services.</p></li>
