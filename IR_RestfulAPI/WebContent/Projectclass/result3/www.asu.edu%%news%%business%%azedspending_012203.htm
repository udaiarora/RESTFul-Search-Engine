      <h2>Education spending per student in Arizona among lowest in nation</h2>
      <p> Public education expenditures per pupil in Arizona were among the lowest 
        in the nation during school year 1999-2000, for elementary/secondary education 
        and for higher education, according to an analysis by the Center for Business 
        Research at Arizona State University. Arizona fell further below the national 
        average on each of these measures during the 1990s.</p>
      <p>"Arizona spends little on public education - compared to other states 
        and to what it spent in the past," said Tom R. Rex, the center's research 
        manager.</p>
      <p>Per student spending at public community colleges and universities (excluding 
        capital outlays, such as construction) was the second lowest in the nation 
        in school year 1999-2000 in Arizona, 27 percent less than the national 
        average. Nevada had the lowest figure; otherwise every other western state 
        spent at least $1,900 more per student than Arizona. The inflation-adjusted 
        change between 1990-91 and 1999-2000 was 18 percent in Arizona (a little 
        less than the economic growth rate) and 33 percent nationally. Only eight 
        states, including Idaho, had a lesser percent change.<br>
        Expenditures per pupil in public elementary and secondary schools in Arizona 
        were 25 percent less than the national average in the 1998-99 school year, 
        the latest with complete data by state. Only Arkansas, Mississippi and 
        Utah spent less. Inflation-adjusted per pupil spending rose only 3 percent 
        in Arizona between 1990-91 and 1998-99, the least in the West. Seven of 
        the other nine western states posted double-digit increases; the national 
        average rise was 13 percent.</p>
      <p>Preliminary data for 1999-2000 indicate that expenditures per pupil in 
        Arizona were 28 percent less than the U.S. average. Utah was the only 
        state with a lower figure.<br>
        "These data precede the passage of Proposition 301, a voter-approved initiative 
        in November 2000 that raised the sales tax rate, with the additional tax 
        revenues directed to public education," Rex said. "Proposition 301 funding 
        began in 2001-02, when it provided an inflation-adjusted boost in total 
        government education spending per pupil of 8 percent over the prior year."</p>
      <p>Including Proposition 301, total inflation-adjusted per pupil education 
        funding rose only 9 percent between 1990-91 and the current school year, 
        less than half of the economic growth rate. "Thus, while the additional 
        spending from Proposition 301 likely has boosted Arizona a little in the 
        rankings of the states, the state probably remains far below the national 
        average on per student expenditures," Rex said.<br>
        Elementary/secondary teacher salaries at public schools also were quite 
        low in Arizona in 1999-2000, with the average teacher salary of less than 
        $35,000 about $7,000 (16 percent) less than the national average - 11th 
        lowest in the nation. In the West, the average salary was lower only in 
        New Mexico. Arizona's beginning (minimum) salary of about $25,600 was 
        not as far (8 percent) below the national average. Twenty-two states, 
        including four western states, had a lower starting salary.</p>
      <p>The average public teacher salary in Arizona fell 11 percent between 
        1990-91 and 1999-2000 in inflation-adjusted dollars, the second greatest 
        decline in the nation. Nationally, the average rose marginally. Arizona's 
        minimum salary decreased 5 percent, compared to a national increase of 
        3 percent. Only five states, including Nevada, had a greater decline.</p>
      <p>At 19.9, the student-to-teacher ratio in public elementary and secondary 
        schools in Arizona was third highest in the nation in 1999-2000, with 
        only California and Utah having higher figures. Nationwide, the average 
        number of students per teacher was 17.4. The 0.5 rise in the student-teacher 
        ratio in Arizona between 1990-91 and 1999-2000 exceeded the national average 
        of 0.2.</p>
