<h1 class="storyhead">ASU names College of Law after O'Connor</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p><em><strong>Retired justice recognized for her lifelong contributions to public service for Arizona and the nation</strong></em></p>
<p>ASU is naming the College of Law after retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor, in honor of her lifelong dedication to public service, her intellectual vigor and her sense of fair-mindedness.</p>
<p><img src="images/20060404_oconnor2.jpg" width="225" height="334" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">The Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor College of Law at ASU was announced at an April 5 press conference at ASU. Dignitaries attending the press conference included Gov. Janet Napolitano, Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Ruth McGregor and ASU President Michael M. Crow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are establishing a permanent and living tribute to Justice O&rsquo;Connor, one that will honor a native daughter who has provided extraordinary service to her state and country,&rdquo; Crow says. &ldquo;This will be a living tribute, because it will continue over generations of students. Justice O&rsquo;Connor is a quintessential Arizonan, and we want to celebrate that. We want to associate ourselves and our school with the values that she stands for, including integrity, public service, personal independence, the willingness to take risks, wonderful curiosity, high intellectual standards, and an abiding commitment to justice and the rule of law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adds Napolitano: &ldquo;Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor was Arizona&rsquo;s gift to the national legal community, and it is altogether fitting that we name one of our premier law schools in her honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &#8220;I am very proud to be associated with the ASU College of Law in this way,&#8221; said O&#8217;Connor. &#8220;The College of Law and has been a pioneer and a leader in clinical law, and was among the first to start a center for law, science and technology. I am delighted, and hope to have many years ahead of a happy association.&#8221; </p>
<p> &#8220;In naming its law school after Justice O'Connor, Arizona State University honors a great Arizonan and one of America&#8217;s most distinguished jurists,&#8221; said U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) <br>
  <br>
Arizona Rep. J.D. Hayworth added, &#8220;Justice O'Connor's service on the United States Supreme Court has inspired and motivated many women to pursue a career in law. ASU's new Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law will train many more students, in the tradition of Justice O'Connor, to think independently and impartially, to pursue lofty goals and to place great emphasis on public service.&quot; </p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very excited about the opportunity to be the first law school named after a contemporary woman,&rdquo; says Patricia White, dean of ASU&rsquo;s College of Law. &ldquo;One cannot overestimate Justice O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s importance as a role model for women, and how central her success has been to the acceptance of women in legal practice and the judiciary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe this is the first major law school in the country to be named after a living person solely on the basis of merit. We are choosing to honor Justice O&rsquo;Connor, and in so doing we honor ourselves. We believe that our association with Justice O&rsquo;Connor will help us gain recognition of the ASU College of Law, its accomplishments and what it stands for. We are confident that now and in the future students, faculty and others will want to share in this association.&rdquo;</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Connor served as the first female associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1981 &ndash; 2006), and she was cited by <em>Forbes</em> magazine in 2004 as the fourth most powerful woman in the United States &ndash; and the sixth most powerful in the world. Because of her case-by-case approach to jurisprudence and her relatively moderate political views, O&rsquo;Connor was the crucial swing vote of the court for many of her final years on the bench.</p>
<p>Sandra Day was born March 26, 1930, in El Paso, Texas. She spent her early childhood on the Day family cattle ranch near Duncan, Ariz., but lived with her grandmother in El Paso when she reached school age.</p>
<p>She attended Stanford University, where she received a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in economics in 1950. She continued at Stanford for her law degree, completing the program in two years rather than the customary three, and graduating third out of a class of 102. While in law school, she met John Jay O&rsquo;Connor III, whom she married in 1952 and with whom she has three sons.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connor served as an Arizona assistant attorney general from 1965 &ndash; 1969, when she was appointed to a vacancy in the Arizona Senate. In 1974, she successfully ran for trial judge, a position she held until she was appointed to the Arizona Court of Appeals in 1979.</p>
<p>On July 7, 1981, President Ronald Reagan nominated her to the Supreme Court. In September 1981, on a 99-0 confirmation vote, O&rsquo;Connor became the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 102nd justice and its first female member.</p>
<p>During her time on the court, O&rsquo;Connor was regarded as a consummate compromiser. Her votes were generally conservative, but she frequently surprised observers with her political independence.</p>
<p>In her later years on the Supreme Court, O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s voting record was pivotal. She joined four liberal judges on many 5-4 decisions including those of <em>Grutter v. Bollinger</em> (2003), which affirmed the right of state colleges and universities to use affirmative action in their admissions policies to increase educational opportunities and promote racial diversity on campus. In <em>Rush Prudential HMO Inc. v. Moran</em> (2002), her vote helped uphold state laws giving people the right to a second doctor&rsquo;s opinion if their health maintenance organizations tried to deny them treatment.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2005, O&rsquo;Connor announced her retirement from the Supreme Court after 24 years of service on the bench.</p>
