Leave may be used:<P><OL><LI>for personal reasons<P>or</LI><P><LI>for additional leave after the 12 weeks of family leave per 12-month period (see <A HREF="spp705-02.html">SPP 705&#150;02</A>, &#147;Family Leave&#148;) has expired<P>or</LI><P><LI>for medical reasons (if the employee is not eligible for family leave).</LI></OL><P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Request for Leave</B></FONT><P>The employee must submit a written leave request to the supervisor stating the reason for the leave and the duration (dates) of the leave.  A <A HREF="sppforms.html">Request for Leave of Absence</A> form is available. As soon as practical, but no later than two weeks before the end of the leave with or without pay, the employee must confirm with the supervisor a return-to-work date.<P>An eligible employee may use accrued sick and vacation leave (as specified in <A HREF="spp701-01.html">SPP 701&#150;01</A>, &#147;Sick Leave&#151;General Policy,&#148; and <A HREF="spp702-01.html">SPP 702&#150;01</A>, &#147;Vacation Leave&#151;General Policy&#148;) during the leave period.  If neither is available, the leave will be without pay.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Supervisor&#146;s Approval</B></FONT><P>If the employee requests leave for medical reasons, he or she must provide a physician&#146;s statement specifying the purpose and duration of the extended leave.  If the employee has exhausted available medical leave under <A HREF="spp705-02.html">SPP 705&#150;02</A>, &#147;Family Leave,&#148; (12 weeks per 12-month period), the leave may be approved for up to an additional three-month period.  Requests for leave beyond this three-month period will be considered by the supervisor and may be granted based on a case-by-case determination consistent with the provisions of federal and state law.<P>If leave is approved for personal (non-medical) reasons, the leave may be taken for up to 12 months&#146; duration.<P>In no instance will combined sick leave, family medical leave, extended leave, or any combination of paid or unpaid leaves be for more than 12 months.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Benefits Status during Leave without Pay</B></FONT><P>An employee on leave without pay will not accrue sick and/or vacation leave.  He or she may continue benefits coverage during the leave by prepaying both the employee&#146;s and the employer&#146;s portions of the insurance premium for the leave period.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Retirement Contributions</B></FONT><P>An employee will not earn service credit or have retirement contributions paid by the university during a leave of absence without pay.<P>An employee in the Arizona State Retirement Plan (ASRP) may purchase service credit in an amount equal to the period of a leave of absence without pay if the leave is in the best interests of the university (i.e., the leave has significant relationship to the employee&#146;s professional activities and is not for purely personal reasons). The employee must contact a representative of ASRP to apply for service credit purchase after returning to work from the leave.<P><IMG SRC="spphr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Cross-References</B></FONT></CENTER><IMG SRC="spphr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><P>For further information, see:<P><OL><LI>the <I>Academic Affairs Policies and Procedures Manual,</I> <A HREF="../acd/acd405.html" TARGET="NEW">ACD 405</A>, &#147;Americans with Disabilities&#148;</LI><P><LI><A HREF="spp701-01.html">SPP 701&#150;01</A>, &#147;Sick Leave&#151;General Policy&#148;</LI><P><LI><A HREF="spp702-01.html">SPP 702&#150;01</A>, &#147;Vacation Leave&#151;General Policy&#148;<P>and</LI><P><LI><A HREF="spp705-02.html">SPP 705&#150;02</A>, &#147;Family Leave.&#148;</LI></OL><P>&#160;<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><HR><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">SPP</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | SPP&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="spp001.html">contact</A> | Human&#160;Resources&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="hr.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
