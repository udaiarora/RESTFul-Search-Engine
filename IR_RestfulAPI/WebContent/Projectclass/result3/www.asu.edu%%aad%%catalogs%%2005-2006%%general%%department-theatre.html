Twenty-four semester hours of THE and THP electives are selected by the student and advisor to complete the 57 or 58 semester hours required in the major.

A list of recommended courses appropriate to each area is available from the department advising office. Undergraduate students interested in pursuing Arizona teacher certification or endorsement for Theatre are encouraged to pursue the focus area in theatre for youth, then obtain postbaccalaureate teacher certification through the ASU College of Education or another Arizona educational institution. General Studies courses make up 35 semester hours of the total courses required. Additional elective courses are selected with an advisor to meet the total 120 semester hours required for the degree.</p>
