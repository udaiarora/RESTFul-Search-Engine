Mattioli, Pietro Andrea</H2>
1500-1577.
<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Pietri Andreae Matthioli. . .Epistolarum medicinalium
libri quinque.</FONT></I>
<P>Lugduni: Apud Caesarem Farinam, 1564. Series of letters between Mattioli,
a botanist and well-known physician, and several contemporaries in the
field of medicine. References: BM STC French, 1470-1600. Includes index.
<P>Mattioli apparently suffered a personality change midway through his
life.&nbsp; He became absolutely absorbed with Dioscorides, confident that
only he and Dioscorides were correct.&nbsp; He reached a point where he
would attack maliciously any who dared to criticize.&nbsp; He was responsible
for ruining several careers, and even Gesner failed to escape his wrath.&nbsp;
While many of the letters in this work are not dated, those which are were
written from 1856-1859.&nbsp; For the most part, Mattioli's letters are
very lengthy and comprehensive and the letters to him are much shorter.&nbsp;
The index at the end lists subjects as well as plant names.
