        Investment in Infrastructure<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></h2>
      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Body" --> 
      <p>Former Governor Daniel J. Evans (R) and former Governor Booth Gardner 
        (D) propose that the Washington State Legislature provide additional debt 
        capacity to Washington State&#8217;s higher education institutions for 
        new construction and capital improvements.</p>
      <p> Gov. Evans and Gov. Gardner argue:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Only a few states will capture the bulk of new high-technology jobs. 
        </li>
        <li> Without strong higher education institutions, the best students leave 
          for better education out-of-state and don&#8217;t come back.</li>
        <li> Bill Gates was asked what was the most important single thing we 
          could do to assure our economic future, he answered: &#8220;Support 
          your local university.&#8221;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Gov. Evans and Gov. Gardner propose $1.7 billion in additional debt capacity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> No new taxes are required &#8211; construction costs are financed 
          by bonds and become part of the state&#8217;s long-term debt, not an 
          immediate expense.</li>
        <li> Work on new construction would create more than 30,000 new jobs.</li>
        <li> Work on new construction plus renovation and repairs would create 
          an estimated 90,000 direct and indirect jobs over the next 10 years.</li>
        <li> New construction would generate over $100 million in sales-tax revenue.</li>
        <li> New construction plus renovation and repairs would generate estimated 
          $213 million in sales-tax revenue.</li>
        <li> Timing (now) would take advantage of low interest rates. </li>

        Higher ed jeopardized by rickety foundation <br>
        <em><font size="1">Sunday, January 12, 2003</font></em><br>
        By DANIEL J. EVANS AND BOOTH GARDNER<br>
        FORMER GOVERNORS</p>
      <p>Washingtonians have been through a lot together over the past few years: 
        Boeing, a Washington icon, moved its corporate headquarters to Chicago; 
        we survived a huge earthquake with major damage to our state's basic infrastructure; 
        the boom of the dot-com industry came in a flash and left almost as quickly; 
        we found ourselves with the dubious distinction of the greatest unemployment 
        in the nation; and yes, even the Mariners came oh so close to making it 
        to the World Series. </p>
      <p>But we do not have the luxury of self-pity.</p>
      <p>We are in a highly competitive economy. Only a few states will capture 
        the bulk of new high-technology jobs. Although Washington is a current 
        center of biotechnology and computer science, there is no assurance that 
        we will continue to be competitive with other states. After a speech a 
        year ago, Bill Gates was asked what was the most important single thing 
        we could do to assure our economic future? He replied, &quot;Support your 
        local university.&quot; In other words, make an investment in education 
        because brains are now our most important natural resource.</p>
      <p>Other states have gotten the message. Many are making huge investments 
        in their higher education systems, hoping to reap the rewards of new jobs 
        and continuing prosperity.</p>
      <p>Washington, in contrast, has squeezed higher education for the past decade 
        and the system is now running on fumes. We continue to ignore investment 
        in higher education at our peril. Our best and brightest students seek 
        education elsewhere, and our top faculty are being recruited by those 
        states that are making an investment in their higher education systems.</p>
      <p>One thing, however, remains at the core of the spirit of Washingtonians. 
        We still believe in the American dream of leaving the next generation 
        better off than the previous one. The pursuit of education that will prepare 
        the next generation to succeed is the underpinning of that American dream. 
        That is why, as former governors, we have joined to make sure that public 
        higher education in Washington state will remain accessible to our grandchildren 
        and their children in the years ahead.</p>
      <p>Today, all public four-year universities and the community and technical 
        colleges are overenrolled. Our colleges and universities are educating 
        more students than the state is willing to support. Many of our campuses 
        are badly in need of repair, technology upgrades and renovation. </p>
      <p>If we are to prepare for the future, new construction is needed, to provide 
        additional capacity for children of the baby boomers now rapidly approaching 
        college age. They will be joined by many adults seeking re-education to 
        better compete in today's tough job market.</p>
      <p>In 2008, only five years from now, Washington will graduate a record-breaking 
        class of high school seniors. The baby-boom echo will squarely challenge 
        us. Unless we act now to prepare new space and to upgrade existing classrooms, 
        we risk closing the doors of opportunity to many qualified graduates. 
        They either will lose the chance for needed education or will seek college 
        elsewhere. </p>
      <p>Many of those who leave our state for their college education never return. 
        Is that the legacy we choose to leave our children?</p>
      <p>That describes a dismal future that we reject. Instead, we will ask the 
        Legislature to embark on a major 10-year capital construction project 
        that will address new construction as well as repairing, modernizing and 
        renewing our existing colleges and universities. </p>
      <p>We propose that the Legislature provide additional debt capacity of $1.7 
        billion for new construction over the next decade. Simultaneously, we 
        will ask the Legislature to reauthorize the current share of the capital 
        budget that higher education has traditionally received to focus on repair 
        and renovation of current facilities. This bold plan will provide new 
        capacity for more than 40,000 students. It will open expanded opportunity 
        in high-demand programs such as computer science, biotechnology and nursing.</p>
      <p>Our plan will do more for our citizens than just provide capacity at 
        our higher education institutions. It will help kick-start an economy 
        that is sorely in need of a boost. The new construction alone would create 
        more than 30,000 new jobs. If we add work on renovation and repair, we 
        estimate the number of direct and indirect jobs at 90,000 over the next 
        10 years.</p>
      <p>Sales-tax revenue generated by the new construction part of our proposal 
        will exceed $100 million. If the whole package is included, the revenue 
        is estimated at $213 million. That is a fine return on a needed investment.</p>
      <p>Some wring their hands and say this idea is too expensive; it can wait 
        for economic recovery, or for a better idea to come along. In other words, 
        why do it now?</p>
      <p>We strongly believe now is the time. First, we must be prepared to provide 
        higher education access to the rising tide of high school graduates. Second, 
        the jobs created by this proposal would assist many of our citizens to 
        go back to work. Third, current low interest rates make this an affordable 
        proposition. And finally, we must start reinvesting in our higher education 
        system if we are to retain our status as a progressive and competitive 
        state.</p>
      <p>We can accomplish our plan without raising taxes. The proposal is for 
        a 10-year construction program. It will start with the highest-priority 
        projects and allow all institutions to plan ahead for their construction 
        needs. Debt service during the coming biennium will be less than $6 million 
        and would rise gradually in future biennia as our economy recovers. </p>
      <p>We believe this program will fit within our current debt limits and will 
        still allow for reasonable capital projects for other purposes. This is 
        a necessary and affordable investment in our future. </p>
      <p>We are both committed to actively engaging the Legislature in developing 
        our plan. This is not an end run around the governor or Legislature. We 
        will bring legislation to this session for public debate and collaborative 
        development. We hope for a strong bipartisan support that will show that 
        the Washington can-do spirit has revived.</p>
      <p>This project has the potential to be a patch of blue sky in what otherwise 
        could be an extraordinarily gloomy legislative session. We hope every 
        citizen will help us achieve the goal of securing Washington's future. 
        We can and must invest in the next generation of Washingtonians who represent 
        our future prosperity.<br>
