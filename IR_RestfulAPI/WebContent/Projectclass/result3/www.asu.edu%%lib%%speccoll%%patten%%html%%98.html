<p>This is a book on agriculture written in verse and enjoyed for its humor
and practical use. The author discusses various aspects first of husbandry
and then of huswifery.&nbsp; After introductory materials on such topics
as the importance of thrift and the movement of the planets, the author
works through the calendar, beginning in September, and discussing issues
pertinent to each month.&nbsp; The section on huswifery follows and is
arranged by the hours of the day, beginning at dawn.&nbsp; The author ends
with an autobiographical sketch.&nbsp; There is an index to the book as
well.
