            here in the Valley. I live with my Mom and younger brother, Alex, 
            in northwest Phoenix but will be living in Cholla at ASU. In my spare 
            time, I love anything Disney, attending theatrical performances and 
            shopping! I also like to do community service projects. Although officially 
            &quot;undeclared,&quot; my educational interests are in dance, theater 
            &amp; psychology. I also enjoy reading &amp; analyzing literature. 
            I was involved with the Anti-Defamation League and Unitown at Greenway 
            and would like to pursue anti-bias and diversity issues in college. 
            I'm not sure what my career will be but am excited to explore the 
          varied opportunities ASU has to offer.</font></td>

            Tucson, AZ. Army brat? No. My parents just occasionally like a change 
            of scenery. I graduated from Sabino High School, where I participated 
            in Swimming, Choir, and a few clubs. In my (rather limited) spare 
            time, I enjoy playing the piano and traveling. Right now, I am in 
            Europe with a friend and seeing everything from the countryside to 
            cities such as Berlin. At ASU, I will be majoring in biomedical engineering 
            and completing my pre-medical requirements. Eventually I hope to work 
          as a radiologist in a clinic. </font></td>

              Hello, my name is Jennifer Rogers, and I am recently a proud graduate 
              of Gilbert High School! I was actively involved with Student Council, 
              Symphony Orchestra, Speech &amp; Debate, National Honors Society,

              fashion, and cooking. In June, I drove across the country to Florida 
              with two friends. I would really like to study abroad in a few years. 
              I am truly looking forward to meeting everyone and being part of

            and hobby, is dance; it too, has been one of the things that has been 
            instilled in me through my Hispanic heritage. If you watch me closely,
