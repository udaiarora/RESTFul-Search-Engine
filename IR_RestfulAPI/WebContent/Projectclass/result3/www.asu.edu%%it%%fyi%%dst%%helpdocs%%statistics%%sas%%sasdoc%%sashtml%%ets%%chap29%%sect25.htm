<P><A NAME="idxtf80055">&#13;</A>This resizable window provides plots and tables
of actual values, model predictions, forecasts, and related statistics.
The various plots and tables available are referred to as <I>views</I>.
The following <I>View Selection Icons</I> section explains how to change the view.

</CENTER><BR CLEAR="ALL"><P>
<P>You can access Model Viewer in a number of ways,
including the <TT>View Model Graphically</TT>
icon of the Develop Models and Model List windows, the <TT>Graph</TT> button
of the Automatic Model Fitting Results window,
and the Model item under the View pull-down in the Manage Foreasting
Project window.
In addition, you can go directly to a selected view in the Model Viewer window
by selecting Model Predictions, Prediction Errors, Statistics
of Fit, Prediction Error Autocorrelations, Prediction Error Tests,
Parameter Estimates, Forecast Graph, or Forecast Table from the
View pull-down menu or corresponding toolbar icon or popup menu item
in the Develop Models,
Model List, or Automatic Model Fitting Results windows.
<P>The state of the Model Viewer window is controlled by the current model and the
currently selected view.
You can resize this window, and you can use other windows without closing
the Model Viewer window.
By default, the Model Viewer window is automatically updated
to display the new model when you switch to working with another model
(that is, when you highlight a different model).
You can unlink the Model Viewer window
from the current model selection by selecting the <TT>Link/Unlink</TT> from the
window's horizontal tool bar.  See <I>Link/Unlink</I> under <I>Tool Bar Icons</I>.
<P>For more information, see <I>Model Viewer</I> in the 
<I>Getting Started</I> section.
<P><H3><I>Tool Bar Icons</I></H3>
The Model Viewer window contains a horizontal row of icons
called the Tool Bar.
Corresponding menu items appear under various pull-down menus.
The function of each icon is explained in the following list.
<P><DL>
<DT><TT>Zoom in</TT>
<DD>
In the Model Predictions, Prediction Errors, and Forecast Graph views,
the Zoom In action changes the mouse cursor into cross hairs that you can use
with the left mouse button to define a region of the graph to zoom in on.
In the Prediction Error Autocorrelations and Prediction Error Tests
views, Zoom In reduces the number of lags displayed.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Zoom out</TT>
<DD>
reverses the previous Zoom In action.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Link/Unlink viewer</TT>
<DD>
disconnects or connects the Model Viewer window to the model table (Develop
Models window, Model List window, or Automatic Model Fitting Results window).
When the viewer is linked, selecting another model in the model table causes
the model viewer to be updated to show the selected model.
When the Viewer is unlinked, selecting another model
does not affect the viewer.  This feature is useful for comparing
two or more models graphically.  You can display a model of interest in the
Model Viewer, unlink it, then select another model and bring up another Model
Viewer window for that model.  
Position the viewer windows side by side for convenient comparisons of models,
or use the <I>Next Viewer</I> icon or F12 function key to switch between them.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Save</TT>
<DD>
saves the contents of the Model Viewer window.
If the display contains a graph,
output is written to a SAS/GRAPH <TT>grseg</TT> catalog entry.
This is the same as the Save Graph action under File in the menu bar.
You can open the saved entry using the SAS Explorer.  This brings up
a graph window from which you can export to a number of external
graphics formats by selecting <TT>Export as Image</TT> from the File 
pull-down window.
<BR><BR>If the display contains a table, output is written to a SAS data set
(same as the Save Data action under File in the menu bar).
You will be prompted for the
output destination if none has been specified.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Print</TT>
<DD>
prints the contents of the viewer window.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Close</TT>
<DD>
closes the Model Viewer window and returns to the window from which it was
invoked.
</DL><BR><H3><I>View Selection Icons</I></H3>
At the right hand side of the Model Viewer window is a vertical tool bar
to select the view, that is,
the kind of plot or table that the viewer displays.
Corresponding menu items appear under View in the menu bar.
The function of each icon is explained in the following list.
<BR><BR><DL>
<DT><TT>Model Predictions</TT>
<DD>
displays a plot of actual series values and model predictions over time.
Click on individual points in the graph
to get a display of the type (actual or predicted), ID value, and data
value in the upper right corner of the window.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Prediction Errors</TT>
<DD>
displays a plot of model prediction errors (residuals) over time.
Click individual points in the graph to get a display of the
prediction error value in the upper right corner of the window.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Prediction Error Autocorrelations</TT>
<DD>
displays horizontal bar charts of the sample autocorrelation, partial
autocorrelation, and inverse autocorrelation functions for the model prediction errors.
Overlaid line plots
represent confidence limits computed at plus and minus two standard errors.
Click on any of the bars to display its value.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Prediction Error Tests</TT>
<DD>
displays horizontal bar charts representing results of white noise and
stationarity tests on the model prediction errors.  The first bar chart
shows the significance probability of the Ljung-Box chi-square statistic
computed on autocorrelations up to the given lag.  Longer bars favor rejection 
of the null hypothesis that the series is
white noise.  Click on any of the bars to display an interpretation.
<BR><BR>The second bar chart shows tests of stationarity of the model prediction
errors, where longer bars favor the conclusion that the series is stationary.
Each bar displays the significance probability of the augmented Dickey-Fuller
unit root test to the given autoregressive lag.  Long bars represent higher
levels of significance against the null hypothesis that the series contains
a unit root.  For seasonal data, a third bar chart appears for seasonal
root tests.   Click on any of the bars to display an interpretation.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Parameter Estimates</TT>
<DD>
displays a table showing model parameter estimates along with standard errors
and <I>t</I>-tests for the null hypothesis that the parameter is zero.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Statistics of Fit</TT>
<DD>
displays a table of statistics of fit for the selected model.  The set of
statistics shown can be changed using the Statistics of Fit item
under Options in the menu bar.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Forecast Graph</TT>
<DD>
displays a plot of actual and predicted values for the series data range,
followed by a horizontal reference line and forecasted values with confidence
limits.  Click on individual points in the graph
to get a display of the type, date/time, and value of the data point in the
upper right corner of the window.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Forecast Table</TT>
<DD>
displays a data table with columns containing the date/time, actual, predicted,
error (residual), lower confidence limit, and upper confidence limit values,
together with any predictor series.

<P><H3><I>Mouse Button Actions</I></H3>
You can examine the data values of individual points in
the Model Predictions, Model Prediction Errors, and Forecast Graph views
of the Model Viewer by positioning the mouse cursor over the point
and clicking the left mouse button.
The date/time and data values as well as the type
(actual, predicted, and so forth)
are displayed in a box that appears in the upper right corner
of the Viewer window.
Click the mouse elsewhere or select any action to dismiss the data box.
<P>Similarly, you can display values in the Prediction Error Autocorrelations
view by clicking on any of the bars.  Clicking on bars in the Prediction Error
Tests view displays a <TT>Recommendation for Current View</TT> window which
explains the test represented by the bar.
<P>When you select the Zoom In action in the Predicted Values, Model Prediction
Errors, and Forecasted Values views, you can use the mouse to define
a region of the graph to zoom. Position the mouse cursor
at one corner of the region, press the left mouse button, and move the mouse
