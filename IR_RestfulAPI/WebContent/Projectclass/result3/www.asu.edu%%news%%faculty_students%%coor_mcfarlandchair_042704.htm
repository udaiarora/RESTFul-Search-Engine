      <h2><strong>Lattie Coor accepts McFarland Chair appointment </strong></a></h2>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/Coor-Dedication.jpg" width="179" height="288" align="right">As student body president at Northern Arizona University, former ASU President Lattie Coor had the honor of meeting Ernest McFarland, then governor of Arizona. Little did Coor realize that some 50 years later he would be named the Ernest W. McFarland Arizona Heritage Chair in Leadership and Public Policy in the School of Public Affairs. </p>
      <p>The McFarland Heritage Chair is one of eight Arizona Heritage Chairs, established through the ASU Campaign for Leadership, which commemorate those who have been leaders in the state and made an impact on Arizona's future. </p>
      <p>During the campaign, Delbert and the late Jewell Lewis established the McFarland Heritage Chair in memory of Jewell's father. </p>
      <p>McFarland had a stellar life and career, first as a Superior Court Judge in Pinal County, then as a U.S. Senator for two terms during which he was the majority leader of the Senate in the 82nd Congress. He finished his political career as governor of the state. He also was a chief justice of the Arizona Supreme Court. </p>
      <p>During his political career, McFarland co-founded KTVK/Channel 3 in 1953. The Lewises sold the station in 1999. </p>
      <p>"I'm deeply honored to hold the McFarland Chair and hope, through my activities, to advance the qualities Ernest McFarland reflected throughout his life and efforts. It's inspiring to try to carry his spirit forward," says Coor. </p>
      <p>His appointment is effective immediately. </p>
      <p>"A true Arizona leader himself, Lattie is someone we can all point to as an inspiration and it's fitting that he be selected for this honor," says ASU President Michael Crow. "Because of his incredible commitment to making life better for Arizonans, as demonstrated through his work as chairman and CEO of the Center for the Future of Arizona and in the School of Public Affairs, it makes sense that he be selected as the first to carry the prestigious title and set the bar for his successors." </p>
      <p>Coor agrees that there is a strong link between the chair position and the Center for the Future of Arizona. The center has been established to improve the quality of life for all Arizonans through engagement with civic and political leaders in the development of a dynamic statewide agenda to expand educational and other opportunities, encourage necessary strategic investments, and achieve a sustainable quality of life. Currently the center is attempting to create a vision for Arizona and seeking to reduce the state's high school dropout rate. </p>
      <p>He also hopes to establish an annual McFarland lecture and has already been in discussions with Jeff Chapman, director of the School of Public Affairs, about it. </p>
      <p>While Coor has only recently been named chair, he clearly has some things under way, with more to follow, he says. </p>
      <p>Coor was ASU's 15th president between 1990 - 2002. For the preceding 13 years, from 1976 through 1989, he served as president of the University of Vermont. When he assumed that position, he was only 39 and one of the youngest university presidents in the nation. Earlier in his career, Coor served as an assistant to the governor of the state of Michigan and held faculty appointments in political science at Washington University. </p>
