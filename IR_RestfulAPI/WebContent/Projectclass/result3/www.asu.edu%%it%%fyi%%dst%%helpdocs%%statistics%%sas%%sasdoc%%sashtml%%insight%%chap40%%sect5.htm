<H2>Canonical Correlation Analysis  </H2>

Its application is discussed by Cooley and Lohnes (1971),
Kshirsagar (1972), and Mardia, Kent, and Bibby (1979).
It is a technique for analyzing the relationship between two sets
of variables. Each set can contain  several variables.
Multiple and simple correlation are special cases of
canonical correlation in which one or
both sets contain a single variable, respectively.
<P>Given two sets of variables, canonical correlation analysis
finds a linear combination
from each set, called a canonical variable, such that the correlation
between the two canonical variables is maximized. This correlation
between the two canonical variables is the first canonical correlation.
The coefficients of the linear combinations are canonical coefficients
or canonical weights. It is customary to normalize the canonical
coefficients so that each canonical variable has a variance of 1.
<P>The first canonical correlation is at least as large as the
multiple correlation between any variable and the opposite set of
variables.  It is
possible for the first canonical correlation to be very large while
all the multiple correlations for predicting one of the original
variables from the opposite set of canonical variables are small.
<P>Canonical correlation analysis continues by finding a second set
of canonical variables, uncorrelated with the first pair, that
produces the second highest correlation coefficient. The process
of constructing canonical variables continues until the number of
pairs of canonical variables equals the number of variables
in the smaller group.
<P>Each canonical variable is uncorrelated with all the other
canonical variables of either set except for the one corresponding
canonical variable in the opposite set. The canonical
coefficients are not generally orthogonal, however, so the canonical
variables do not represent jointly perpendicular directions through the
space of the original variables.
<P>The canonical correlation analysis includes tests of a series of
hypotheses that each canonical
correlation and all smaller canonical correlations are zero in the
population. SAS/INSIGHT software uses an <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>F</I></SPAN> approximation (Rao 1973;
Kshirsagar 1972) that gives better small sample results than the usual

 ALT="\chi^2"> approximation. At least one of the two sets of
variables should have an approximately multivariate normal distribution
in order for the probability levels to be valid.
<P>Canonical redundancy analysis (Stewart and Love 1968; Cooley
and Lohnes 1971; van den Wollenberg 1977)
examines how well the original variables can be
predicted from the canonical variables.
The analysis includes the proportion and cumulative proportion 
of the variance of the set of <SPAN CLASS="ssbeleven"><B>Y</B></SPAN> and the set of <SPAN CLASS="ssbeleven"><B>X</B></SPAN> variables 
explained by their own canonical variables and explained 
by the opposite canonical variables.
Either raw or standardized variance can be used in the analysis.
