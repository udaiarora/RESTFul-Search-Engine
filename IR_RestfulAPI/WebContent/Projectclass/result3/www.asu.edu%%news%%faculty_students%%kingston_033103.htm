      <h2>Kingston reflects on years as faculty representative</h2>
      <p>        <img src="facstudents_images/Kingston_033103.jpg" width="180" height="269" align="right">ASU professor Jerry Kingston has announced he will leave his position
          as faculty athletics representative at the close of the 2003 - 04 fiscal
          year. Kingston will return to teaching full time in the economics department
        within the W.P. Carey School of Business at ASU.</p>
      <p>A replacement will
            be chosen within the next few months. Kingston says this timeline
        will provide ample time for him to train the new representative
          ensuring a smooth transition. </p>
      <p>ASU President Michael Crow says Kingston
          has been a true asset to the university, and has made an impressive
        impact on the Pac-10 conference
          and the NCAA. </p>
      <p>"Jerry Kingston has provided steadfast leadership in representing
          ASU's intercollegiate athletic interests not only on campus, but also
          in the
          Pac-10 and through the NCAA governance structure," Crow says. "We appreciate
          his long tenure in serving in this role and know that he will provide
          strong guidance and support to his successor."<br>
        Kingston has held a variety of positions within the NCAA and the Pac-10
          conference. He has served on each of the three major governance units
          of the NCAA: the Academic Testing and Requirements Committee, forerunner
          of the current Academic Cabinet (1991 - 95); the NCAA Council (1993
          - 95) and the Championships and Competition Cabinet (1999 - 2003).
          Kingston
          is also completing a four-year term of service on the NCAA Certification
          Committee, the group that evaluates and extends or withholds accreditation
          to the athletics programs of NCAA Division I member institutions.</p>
      <p>"I have
          observed first-hand, the many positive benefits that intercollegiate
          athletics provides for student-athletes," says Kingston, who has held
          the position since 1987. "I am pleased to have been a part of ensuring
          that such benefits are provided within both the spirit and letter of
          all NCAA and Pac-10 Conference regulations."</p>
      <p>Kingston was also a founding
          member of the Faculty Athletics Representatives Association, serving
          as president in 1995 and 1996. He first served as
          president of the Pac-10 Conference Council during the 1993 - 94 academic
          year. This coming year he will take on the position once more.</p>
      <p>Kingston
          was involved in the formation of NCAA Proposition 16, implemented in
          1995, which raised initial academic eligibility standards for student-athletes
          and has ultimately led to increased student-athlete graduation rates.
          He has also received distinguished service awards from the NCAA Council
          and the Faculty Athletics Representatives Association.</p>
      <p>Kingston says he
          will miss interacting with the many friends he has made in the intercollegiate
          athletics community.</p>
      <p>"The individuals who work
          in intercollegiate athletics are among the most dedicated, hardworking,
          optimistic people with whom I have ever
          had the pleasure of working," Kingston says. </p>
      <p>ASU's Executive Director
          of Athletics Gene Smith says he appreciates the important strides Kingston
          made during his service as representative.</p>
      <p>"Jerry
          has served our university and all of intercollegiate athletics at the
          highest level," Smith says. "We are indebted to him and will be
        forever grateful."</p>
