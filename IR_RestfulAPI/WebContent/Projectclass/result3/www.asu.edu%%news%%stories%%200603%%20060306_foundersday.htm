<h1 class="storyhead">ASU Founders' Day Award winners recognized for civic, university service </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>A beloved professor who studies the history of needlework samplers, a nationally recognized researcher who probes the development of substance abuse behaviors in adolescents, and a legislative advocate whose work has benefited his community and his alma mater are some of the individuals honored March 7 by the ASU Alumni Association at its Founders' Day dinner and awards presentation at the Tempe Mission Palms hotel. </p>
<p>Held annually on March 7 - in recognition of the date in 1885 when the 13th Territorial Legislature presented a charter to establish the Territorial Normal School of Arizona, ASU's predecessor institution - Founders' Day recognizes individuals who exemplify the spirit of ASU's founders. </p>
<p>Here are capsule biographies of this year's winners: </p>
<p><strong>Young Alumni Achievement Award: Israel Torres, bachelor's degree, 1994 </strong></p>
<p><img src="images/20060306_ITorres-Duo_000.jpg" width="130" height="186" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">Israel Torres is the former director of the Arizona State Registrar of Contractors. </p>
<p>He was responsible for 11 statewide offices, and he transformed the organization into one that offers first-time programs and services for consumers and the construction industry. He also found innovative ways to tackle critical quality-of-life improvements for disadvantaged residents and seniors. </p>
<p> As a graduate of ASU's political science program, Torres' achievements were recognized by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, which named Torres a CLAS Leader last year. He is a board member of the Industry Advisory Council in the Del E. Webb School of Construction and a board member of the President's Economic Council. </p>
<p><strong>Alumni Achievement Award: Kevin Olson, bachelor's degree, 1977 </strong></p>
<p><img src="images/20060306_K-Olson_000.jpg" width="130" height="186" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">Kevin Olson is the managing partner of the Arizona offices of the law firm of Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP. He graduated summa cum laude from ASU with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. He has served as chairman of the Securities Council and the business section of the Arizona Bar Association. </p>
<p>While Olson's vocation is law, his avocation is ASU. He has been an avid volunteer with the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, serving on the college's alumni board since 1993 and acting as its leader from 1995 to 1998. Olson also has served the ASU Alumni Association in numerous capacities, including being a member of its board of directors and a member of the executive committee, as well as serving on seven other committees. </p>
<p>In the civic arena, Olson has volunteered with the Tempe Chamber of Commerce and Phoenix Chamber of Commerce boards. He was president of the East Valley Partnership in 2001 and 2002 and serves on the Governor's Vision 21 Transportation Task Force. </p>
<p><strong>Staff Achievement Award: Felicity Snyder, bachelor's degree, 2004 </strong></p>
<p><img src="images/20060306_Snyder-Felicity_000.jpg" width="130" height="185" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">Felicity Snyder is a program coordinator for the undergraduate programs of the School of Life Sciences at the Tempe campus. </p>
<p>She is the sole staff member for the school's Center for Biology and Society, and she also coordinates activities and research projects for three academic programs (biology and society; bioethics, policy and law; and history and philosophy of science), as well as the Human Dimensions faculty and the Arizona Consortium for Medicine, Society and Values. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Faculty Service Award: Noel Stowe, professor and chair of the ASU History Department </strong></p>
<p><img src="images/20060306_Noel-Stowe_000.jpg" width="130" height="185" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">Noel Stowe joined ASU in 1967 and has served as chair of the History Department for the last eight years. He previously served as the interim dean of Graduate Studies. </p>
<p>As one of the founders of the field of public history as an academic discipline, Stowe helped establish the nationally recognized public history graduate program at ASU. He is regarded nationally for his research in public history, including topics related to community studies, regional history, border studies, organizational history, historical administration and policy history. His teaching interests include public history methodology and research, historical administration and applied history. </p>
<p>In addition to his work on the national level, Stowe has made significant contributions to the history community of Arizona. Stowe is the chair for subcommittees for the Arizona Historical Advisory Commission; through this commission, he is taking a leadership role in planning the 2012 Arizona Centennial. </p>
<p><strong>Faculty Teaching Award: Maureen Daly Goggin, associate professor of rhetoric and associate chair of the English Department </strong></p>
<p><img src="images/20060306_Goggin-Maureen_000.jpg" width="130" height="185" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">Maureen Daly Goggin has worked at ASU for 11 years. During that time, she has contributed to the scholarship in the history of rhetoric and composition, the teaching of writing, and visual and material culture. </p>
<p>Goggin, known as a prolific and meticulous researcher, has received nine awards that recognize her excellence in mentoring students, including the "Graduate Student Mentor of the Year" honor and three awards for teaching. She is a gifted teacher who uses interactive lectures, group presentations, performances, collaborative exercises, exploratory writing and research assignments to engage her students. </p>
<p>Her work in the history of rhetoric and composition is most fully explored in her book "Authoring a Discipline: The Post-World War II Emergence of Rhetoric and Composition." Recently, Goggin turned to an entirely new area of study within the field of material culture and visual rhetorical studies: tracing the history of needlework sampler-making to examine the craft as a form of meaningful mark-making and a system of writing. </p>
<p><strong>Faculty Research Award: Laurie Chassin, professor, Department of Psychology </strong></p>
<p><img src="images/20060306_Chassin-Laurie_000.jpg" width="130" height="185" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">Laurie Chassin's primary area of research is in addictive behaviors, focusing on the study of development of substance abuse problems in early childhood and adolescence. </p>
<p>Chassin arrived at ASU in 1979 and began her research on the social psychological determinants of cigarette smoking. She continues her award winning research on this valuable topic, and it has been funded by the National Institutes of Health almost without interruption for the past 27 years. She has published more than 140 scientific papers. </p>
<p>Chassin was the principal investigator on the first institutional training grant from the National Institute of Mental Health to train pre- and post-doctoral students for careers in research in child mental health and substance abuse prevention. She has directed this grant since 1987, during which time it has supported the training of 79 scientists. </p>
<p><strong>2006 James W. Creasman Award of Excellence: Martin Shultz, bachelor's degree, 1966, master's degree, 1967 </strong></p>
<p><img src="images/20060306_Marty-Shultz_000.jpg" width="130" height="185" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">Martin Shultz is vice president of government affairs for Pinnacle West Capital Corp. Shultz has extensive experience in corporate public affairs and public relations, negotiations of complex issues, business policy development, government affairs and public administration, plus a history of civic, community and political involvement. </p>
<p>Shultz also is known for his philanthropic work. He is a defender of civil rights through his involvement in the Anti-Defamation League, and he has received recognition for his leadership role in Jobs for America's Graduates Inc., one of the nation's most successful school-to-work networks for high school students. </p>
<p>Over the decades, ASU has remained close to Shultz's heart, and he has given back to the university in a variety of ways. He is the chair of the dean's investment board in the College of Public Programs and has served as a board member for the ASU Foundation, as well as a member of the KAET board of advisers. </p>
<p>His volunteerism at the university has been recognized by two Distinguished Achievement Awards, one from the College of Architecture and Environmental Design and one from the College of Education . </p>
<p>Winners of the Staff Achievement Award and the three faculty awards will each receive a $1,500 grant, made possible through donations from the 2006 Founders' Society. </p>
