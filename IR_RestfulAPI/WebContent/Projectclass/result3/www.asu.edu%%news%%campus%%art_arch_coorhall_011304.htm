      <h2>Art and architecture intersect at Lattie F. Coor Hall </h2>
      <p>The first integration of art and architecture on campus is also ASU's latest work of public art.&nbsp; Visitors approaching Lattie F. Coor Hall may notice a series of shapes emerging from the sheer glass fa&ccedil;ade of the building, slowly revealing itself as architectural pattern, then as abstract symbols and finally as language fragments. </p>
      <p>According to the artist, BJ Krivanek, these "text fragments," reflect the philosophies and methodologies of the 11 departments within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences that are housed in the structure. </p>
      <p>"We consulted with building representatives and it was the decision of the group to not be explicit in terms of words but rather to move toward abstract fragments that would suggest the potential of language," states Krivanek, who was chosen by the building's architects, Gensler and Jones Studio. According to Krivanek, the challenge was to come up with fragments that would reflect the building's users. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;"The choice of languages represents the suggestion of a universal language from multiple languages," states the Chicago artist. He selected letters from several Latin-based, Native American and Asian languages, as well as numbers and punctuation marks, to represent the potential of language. </p>
      <p>Other characters, such as numerals and punctuation marks, suggest quantification or expression. "The perception of the fa&ccedil;ade is like the process of learning language, not as the spoken word, but as a visual symbolic system," says Krivanek. "Eventually the letterforms acquire specific phonetic or conceptual meeting. </p>
      <p>Krivanek also considered the social dynamics of a multi-use classroom building from the perspective of the outside community. "The apparent visual transparency of the fa&ccedil;ade suggest a collective act of seeing - the university looks out toward the social landscape with powers of observation - reflecting interpretations back toward the community as any glass surface will." </p>
      <p>For several months the artist talked to faculty and students searching for themes that would "clarify the inhabitation of the building both symbolically and experientially." His goal is for the artwork to engage the viewer on visual, experiential and intellectual levels. </p>
      <p>"Coor Hall is a beehive of activity inside," says the artist, "and language is a raw material given form and disseminated." </p>
      <p>Once Krivanek determined six different patterns of fragments, they were sandblasted on the inside of two standard-size glass modules and distributed in a random manner. The modules create a sheer glass curtain wall that cover the east and west facades, and wrap around sections of the north and south sides of the building. Depending on the time of day, the shadows of the text are cast on an inner, opaque wall.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Krivanek also fabricated in steel the single word, EXPLORE, which juts out from the roof of the west fa&ccedil;ade casting an indistinct shadow on the ground. </p>
      <p>Krivanek has created several text-based artworks for such clients as California State University at Long Beach, Ocotillo Library in Phoenix, and the City of Los Angeles Communications Dispatch Center. He received a Federal Design Achievement Award from the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as awards from the American Center for Design, American Institute for Graphic Arts and the Society for Environmental Graphic Design. Krivanek is an associate professor at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. </p>
      <p>This project was funded by the university's Percent-for-Art program.</p>
