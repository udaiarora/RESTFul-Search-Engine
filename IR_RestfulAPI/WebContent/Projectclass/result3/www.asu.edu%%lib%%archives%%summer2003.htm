          The Labriola Center celebrated its 
        10th Anniversary on March 26, 2003. In addition to honored guests, Frank and 
        Mary Labriola, the Center welcomed faculty, students, and donors. Gilbert Innis 
        (Pima), from the Center of Indian Education, ASU, gave a moving blessing, while 
        Dean Sherrie Schmidt officially welcomed the assembled guests. We were pleased 
        to have Lattie Coor, ASU President (1990-2001), introduce Frank Labriola. <p>
        On 
        exhibit, were a number of articles and publications written by students,
         faculty, and visiting scholars who had used material from the Center?s
         collections.</p>

<p>Frank and Mary Labriola want the Center to be a source of 
          education and pride for all Native Americans. In addition, it is also
      a place where the non-Indian can learn about the indigenous populations

          Arizona celebrates 
        its history annually at the Arizona History Convention, which is held in various 
        locations around the state. There are always scholarly presentations and field 
        trips. <p>
        In addition, the convention sponsors a contest for high school 
        students, who submit papers on Arizona history. Generous checks are awarded to 
        the first place winner and one who receives honorable mention. The contest is 
        spearheaded by ASU professor, James McBride, and he encourages all Arizona high 
        school students to enter. The 2003 convention was held at the Fiesta Inn in 
        Tempe.<BR>

          Laura Tohe, Associate 
        Professor of English at ASU, has made arrangements with the Labriola
            Center, to deposit some of the best work by her students in the Labriola
            Center.It will
        come from three classes: Navajo Literature and Cultural Studies (494/547);
            American Indian Literature (359); and American Indian Poetry (461/547).
            New
        items will be added each semester. A Finding Guide is available describing
            each paper on deposit. The call number is LAB MSS-170.
            <p>
        Dr. Tohe (Navajo), and 
        Heide E. Erdich (Ojibwe), recently contributed to and edited a volume that 
        explores the roles of Native women in the modern world. The Center for the Book 
        at the Library of Congress sponsored a discussion and book signing on March 4, 
        2003 for their book, <em>Sister Nations: Native Women Writers</em>.</p>

          Wicazo Sa Review, one of the most 
        reputable journals for Native American studies, has moved from its editorial 
        offices at the University of Minnesota to the American Indian Studies program at 
        ASU.<p>
        Elizabeth Cook-Lynn founded the journal in 1984, which is geared toward 
        an international audience for refereed articles by Indian and non-Indian 
        scholars. James Riding In, associate professor for Justice Studies and American 
        Indian Studies, becomes the new editor. Assistant professor, Susan Miller, 
        American Indian Studies, has been named associate editor. <p>
        Riding In notes 
        that for many years, non-Indian scholars have been doing the writing about 
        Indians. The editors plan to encourage Indian scholars to submit articles 
        reflecting the Native point of view. To this time, Wicazo Sa Review has been 
        published twice a year on a variety of topics. Future plans call for a quarterly 
        journal.</p>

          <p>
              Geraldine Kay Stewart, 
      daughter of Dr. Kenneth Stewart, donated his papers to Arizona State University
          in 2002. Dr. Stewart was the first  anthropologist
          employed by ASU in 1947, before formation of the Anthropology Department.
          Ultimately, he joined the faculty of the anthropology department when
          it was
      founded in 1960.<p>
      Dr. Stewart conducted field work among the Mohave Indians in 
      1946 and 1970-1971. He published widely on the tribe during his career, with 
      articles in <em>The Kiva, Plateau, Southwest Journal of Anthropology</em>, and 
      <em>Ethnohistory</em>. While professor emeritus at ASU, Dr. Stewart provided the 
      introductory section and a chapter on the Mohave in volume 10 of the <em>Handbook
      of North American Indians</em>. <BR>
      Following his retirement, Dr. Stewart remained 
      active as an amateur musicologist and avid traveler. ? <em>Joyce Martin</em></p>

            The Center is currently 
          adding volumes from the American Language Reprint series published by Evolution
              Publishing. The small books fit nicely with our aim to add to our collection,
              dictionaries, grammars, linguistics? materials, language work books,
              hymnals and bibles in the native language, along with tapes and video
              recordings.
              These
          reprints are a timely addition, since Native languages are fast disappearing. <BR>
          For example, in 1995, some 46 Native languages were spoken by a significant 
          number of children; adults are the main speakers of 91 Native languages; while 
          some 72 Native languages are spoken by a very small number of elders. The list 
          of extinct languages totals 120, and growing (<em>Handbook of North
          American Indians: Language</em>, volume 17, Smithsonian Institution, 1996).<BR>

                The first words were collected by Thomas Hariot, who was among
                the British settlers sent by Sir Walter Raleigh to establish
                a colony on Roanoke Island , North Carolina. He returned to England
                in 1856 following two years in the colony. Upon his return, he
                published <em>A Briefe and true report of the new found land
                of Virginia</em> (London 1588). <p>
A second source of words was provided by artist and cartographer, John White,
who arrived on the Island with a second group of Raleigh colonists. Before returning
to England in 1587, he produced watercolors featuring Native people, flora, and
fauna, which he described with Algonquian names. Hariot included these in his
report, which preserved a total of 39 words. Two of the important indigenous
foods of the Americas are listed: macócqwer can be pumpkins, melons, and gourds,
while okindgíer translates to beans. The language died out in the 1700s, according
to the series editor.</td>

              Though called singing, it is not exactly. It must be performed
              by two women facing each other. It is a vocal game in which they
              make breathing noises emanating from the throat. They each produce
              short rhythmic sounds to show their vocal ability. It is a kind
              of friendly competition as they try not to run out of breath or
              lose the rhythm. When this happens, the one who does so, ends with
              a giggle, and is soon joined by her partner. </td>

            Among other items dealing with the Nunavut in the Labriola 
            Center, is the <em>Nunavut Atlas</em>, a spectacular publication illustrating the extent 
          of Inuit land along with photographs.</p>

            Mostly unrecognized until recently, are the hundreds 
            of contributions Native North and South Americans have made to the world. These 
            may include agriculture, medicine, architecture, philosophy, language, 
            government, and more. For example, 70% of the food eaten in the world today is 
            native to the Americas. Just think of corn, the tomato, potato, and avocado; 
            chocolate, chile peppers, peanuts, cranberries, and the turkey to name a 
            few.<BR>
            In this and future newsletters, we will include a few of their 
            inventions and innovations. Most are taken from the <em>Encyclopedia
            of American Indian Contributions to the World</em> (Facts on File, 2002).<BR>
            We were intrigued by 
            the fact that prehistoric babies wore biodegradable and disposable diapers. 
            Before being strapped to the cradle board, baby was rubbed with tallow and 
            placed in a soft leather sack, which was filled with absorbent material found in 
            the various environments. It could be the downy fibers of puff balls or 
            cattails, dried moss, cedar fibers, or dried and powdered buffalo chips.<BR>

            The Paleo-Indians living in the area of the Great Lakes area (ca. 5000 
            B.C.-4,000 B.C.) fashioned copper PAN PIPES as well as tubular beads. In 
            addition, they produced copper tubing and were thought to be the first 
            metalworkers in the world. Some might think it hard to believe that the Inca, in 
            what is now Peru, used copper tubing to transport hot and cold water to the 
            sunken tubs in their bath houses.<BR>

            When Columbus arrived in the 
            Caribbean, he found the Native people sleeping in hammocks and wrote
            in his journal that he was impressed by the cool, comfortable, and clean
            way
            of
            sleeping. Gonzoalo Fernandez de Oviedo was the first European to draw
            a picture of the hammock and described the ones he found on Haiti. It
            was
            knitted with
            cotton with ties made from the agave plant. Hammocks were used throughout
            the tropics and also served as easily-rocked cradles for infants. It
            wasn?t
            long before Europeans adapted the hammocks for use on naval and merchant
            ships.

            The Labriola Center is building a nice 
            collection of Native-oriented newsletters. Since most are gifts or come 
            individually, we do not have complete runs. However, they have been indexed to 
            and listed in our on-line American Indian Index, which can be reached from the 
            Labriola web page. Examples are:<BR>
