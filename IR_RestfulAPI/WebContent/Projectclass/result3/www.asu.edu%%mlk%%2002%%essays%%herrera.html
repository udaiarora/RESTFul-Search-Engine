      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have chosen Roberto Clemente because he exemplifies the theme of this essay.  He gave the greatest sacrifice: his life, trying to help the people of Nicaragua.  He was on his way there in a cargo plane filled with supplies when the plane crashed and he died.  Roberto Clemente is my hero.
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roberto Clemente was born in Puerto Rico.  He lived by pride and hard work.  These values were a big part of him.  As a child, Roberto worked with his father in the sugar cane fields.  After work he would always play baseball.  It was always "número uno" to him.
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his strong work ethic he made it to the major leagues and won many Gold Glove and MVP awards.  Roberto remained the same person.  He didn't drink or smoke and always cared about people.  He treated people fairly and helped those in need.  He went back to Puerto Rico often to take part in anti-drug campaigns and youth activities.  He was their hero and role model, too!
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His life has encouraged me to help people in any way I can.  I try to be polite and be a role model for the younger kids in my multi-age class and in my school, where I am President of the student body.
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made my world better by trying his best.  He gave it his all in everything he did, which has inspired me to do my best in everything I do!
