      </p>
      <h1 class="style13">Certificate Program in Translation </h1>
      <p class="style13">The Spanish Translation Certificate Program is not associated with a degree program and is offered at the undergraduate level to ASU students as well as to members of the community at large who are granted admission&nbsp; to ASU (see information on admission and registration procedures below)&nbsp; and meet the entrance requirements to the certificate program. </p>
      <p class="style13"><strong>Prerequisites for Admission to the Certificate Program </strong></p>
      <p class="style13">Students must apply for admission to Translation Certificate&nbsp; Program.&nbsp; In order to apply for admission, candidates need to submit the required application materials (listed below) and pass an entrance exam. Application materials: </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="style13">
          <p class="style13">Copies&nbsp; of all college level transcripts (official transcripts not necessary) <strong>highlighting any pre-requisites&nbsp; for the certificate program coursework, e.g., </strong> SPA 412, ENG 301, an&nbsp; Introduction to Linguistics course, or any courses in translation already taken. </p>        
        <li class="style13">        A list&nbsp; of the names, dates, and location of educational institutions attended.<p>
        <li class="style13">Candidates contact information: name, e-mail and postal address, and phone number. </li class="style13">
      </ol>
      <p class="style13"><strong>Entrance exam </strong></p>
      <p class="style13">Before taking the exam, students are expected to have completed: </p>
      <p class="style13">SPA 412 and ENG 301. </p>
      <p class="style13">SPA 412 Advanced Conversation/Composition (offered every semester and&nbsp; summer)* </p>
      <p class="style13">ENG&nbsp; 301 Writing for the Professions (offered every semester, summer and on-line)* </p>
      <p class="style13">*SPA 412 and/or ENG 301 can be waived if the student can present proof of having taken an equivalent course at another institution or having&nbsp; had substantial formal education in Spanish and/or English. </p>
      <p class="style13">The entrance exam consists of two written essays (one in English and the other in Spanish).&nbsp; Candidates will have two hours to complete the exam <strong>with the aid of Spanish/English dictionaries </strong>, if desired. Exams are usually given the last week of classes of the Fall and Spring semesters (December and May). </p>
      <p class="style13"><strong>Exam registration </strong></p>
      <p class="style13">In order to register for the exam, you will need to mail or hand-deliver all application materials listed above along with an application fee of $20.00 (make check payable to Arizona State University) to: </p>
      <p class="style13">Prof. Barbara Lafford <br>
  Translation Certificate Program, Interim Director <br>
  Department of Languages and Literatures <br>
  Arizona State University <br>
  Tempe, AZ 85287-0202 </p>
      <p class="style13">You must be registered to take the exam.&nbsp; No walk-ins will be accepted.&nbsp; Incomplete applications will not be processed. Applications must be received by November 15 th or April 15 th of each year&nbsp; in order to register for the December and May exams, respectively. </p>
      <p class="style13">After your registration has been processed, you will notified via email or phone of the exam dates and times available. </p>
      <p class="style13">You will be notified in 7-10 days after taking the exam regarding your acceptance into the certificate program. </p>
      <p class="style13"><strong>Program Course Requirements </strong></p>
      <p class="style13">You may consult ASU's on-line schedule of classes ( <a href="https://sec.was.asu.edu/soc/">https://sec.was.asu.edu/soc/ </a>)&nbsp; to find out when the courses below are offered in any given semester or summer session. </p>
      <p class="style13"><strong>Pre-requisites </strong></p>
      <p class="style13">After a student is admitted into the Translation Certificate Program they must take an Introduction to Linguistics course as a pre-requisite&nbsp; for the certificate coursework. In order to fulfill this requirement,&nbsp; you have the option of taking one of the following three courses&nbsp; at ASU: </p>
      <p class="style13">FLA 400 <em>Introduction to Linguistics </em> (taught in English), </p>
      <p class="style13">ASB 480 <em>Introduction to Linguistics </em> (taught in English) </p>
      <p class="style13">SPA 400 <em>Introduction to Spanish Linguistics </em> (taught inSpanish); </p>
      <p class="style13">This pre-requisite cannot be waived unless the student can demonstrate that he/she has taken a similar course at the 400 level or above at another institution. In some cases, individual students may be allowed to take the Introduction to Linguistics course simultaneously with their first&nbsp; semester of certificate coursework. </p>
      <p class="style13"><strong>Required courses for the certificate: </strong></p>
      <p class="style13">Once admitted to the program, you will need to take FLA 401 Translation Theory* (offered every Spring) during the first year of the student's certificate program. In addition, students&nbsp; should complete three "Applied" translation courses, to be&nbsp; chosen among the following options*: </p>
      <p class="style13">FLA 481* Technical and Scientific Translation </p>
      <p class="style13">FLA 482* Business and Financial Translation </p>
      <p class="style13">FLA 483* Medical and Legal Translation </p>
      <p class="style13">FLA 494 Medical Translation </p>
      <p class="style13">FLA 494 Legal Translation </p>
      <p class="style13">*The line numbers for these courses are&nbsp; suppressed; they can be obtained from the Director of the Spanish Translation Certificate Program or from the course instructor after a candidate is approved to enter the program &nbsp; </p>
      <p class="style13">Usually only one of these applied courses is offered each semester,&nbsp; each one being taught only once in a two year period. </p>
      <p class="style13">Finally, FLA 484* <em>Internship </em> (2 credits=30&nbsp; hours) is required to complete the 14 credit hours necessary for the&nbsp; program; FLA 484 cannot be taken until all other courses in the program&nbsp; have been completed unless the student is granted permission to do so by the Director of the Spanish Translation Certificate Program.&nbsp; Students are normally required to find their own Internship venue.&nbsp; The site must have someone capable&nbsp; of and willing to supervise the student's translation work. </p>
      <p class="style13">Graduate students may only take the aforementioned translation courses at the graduate level as SPA 590 Reading and Conference for each course with a professor willing to work with them.&nbsp; They&nbsp; would then take the translation internship under FLA 584. </p>

      <p class="style13"><strong>Information on admission and registration procedures for those not already admitted to ASU: </strong></p>
      <p class="style13">In order to take courses in the ASU Spanish Translation Certificate program, you must first be admitted to the university.&nbsp; Non-degree seeking students already possessing a Bachelor's degree apply for admission to the Graduate College; non-degree seeking students without a Bachelor's&nbsp; should apply to Undergraduate Admissions. </p>
      <p class="style13">If you are not already admitted to ASU, you must&nbsp; obtain the necessary admissions forms. &nbsp;If you have taken ASU courses before, you need&nbsp; to be readmitted to the university. &nbsp;All necessary forms are available&nbsp; from the undergraduate or graduate admissions office. They are also available&nbsp; for downloading from the Web at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/forms/adm.html">www.asu.edu/forms/adm.html </a>.&nbsp; You also have the option of applying entirely on-line. &nbsp;You then submit&nbsp; the admissions form to the proper office and wait to be admitted. &nbsp;No matter what form you submit, if you are not enrolled at ASU for a degree of any kind you must indicate on the form that you are a <strong>Non-Degree&nbsp; Seeking Student </strong>. </p>
      <p class="style13">After you are admitted you need to pre-register (if time permits, in the middle of the Fall or Spring semester for&nbsp; the next semester) or register for the ASU courses you wish to take after the pre-registration period is over. &nbsp;Information on registration for courses is available at the Registrar's office (480-965-7302), in the ASU schedule of classes and on-line at the following Web address: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/registrar">www.asu.edu/registrar </a>;&nbsp; scroll down until you find "registration information." Under that heading you will find "Ways to Register" (Pre-registration,&nbsp; In-Touch and In-person). &nbsp;"In Touch" is the telephone registration system used by most ASU students to register and pay for&nbsp; classes. </p>
      <p><span class="style13">Information on fees is available from the ASU schedule of classes and&nbsp; on-line at the following Web Address: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/vpsa/fees.html">www.asu.edu/vpsa/fees.html </a>.
