      <h2>Herberger College presents "Spring Dance Collection"</h2>
      <p>ASU's Herberger College of Fine Arts Department of Dance presents
        "Spring Dance Collection," a modern dance concert comprising eight pieces.</p>
      <p>This concert's showcase piece is a new work titled "Big Sky," created
        by acclaimed choreographer and guest artist Mark Haim. The New York Times
        has called Haim, "a choreographer's choreographer," and his work, "mad
        and memorable." </p>
      <p>"The material was developed by the dancers through several days of structured
        improvisations," Haim says. "I became attracted to the idea of working
        in confined and isolated spaces on the stage.</p>
      <p>"The title "Big Sky" is slightly ironic in that there is very little
        "big" about this work. Perhaps it is a response to a paradox of living
        in a country with lots of space: while we as Americans live with an abundance
        of space and material wealth, our vision is very often short-sighted,
        isolated, restricted by codes of conduct and reduced by our obsession
        with amplitude and abundance."</p>
      <p>Haim said his experience creating this work was one of constant joy
        and play. "Even though there is a large degree of weight in the work
        itself, the dancers and I created it with much lightness and curiosity,"
        Haim adds. "I found the dancers to be extremely curious, responsive and
        responsible. I am looking forward to seeing the dance on stage."</p>
      <p>WHEN: March 27-29, 7:30 p.m.; March 30, 2 p.m.</p>
      <p>Special Preview! The second dress rehearsal on March 26 is open to the
        public. Same admission charge; show time is 4 p.m.</p>
      <p>WHERE: Paul V. Galvin Playhouse, 51 E. 10th St. on the ASU campus in
        Tempe.</p>
      <p>TICKETS: $14 adults, $12 seniors, faculty and staff; $5 students.</p>
      <p>INFORMATION: 480-965-6447.</p>
      <p>"Big Sky" is one of eight diverse works in the Herberger College Department
        of Dance's "Spring Dance Collection," a concert performance of highly
        acclaimed faculty and student choreography. The department is known for
        its inventive choreography and dynamic and beautiful performances.</p>
      <p>Haim, a native New Yorker, directed Mark Haim &amp; Dancers, which performed
        at the Riverside Dance Festival in NYC, and at various theaters and venues
        in the US, Luxembourg and Holland. In 1987 he was invited to Lisbon,
        Portugal, to become artistic director of the Companhia de Danca de Lisboa
        and toured Portugal, Spain and Italy. </p>
      <p>Haim has been commissioned to create new works for many dance companies
        in the US, Europe and Asia. He has restaged his works on companies such
        as The Joffrey Ballet, the Bat-Dor Dance Company of Israel and the Juilliard
        Dance Ensemble. </p>
      <p>Haim served on the faculty of the American Dance Festival from 1993
        to 2000. He has been on the faculty of New York University's Tisch School
        of the Arts. Haim is a recipient of a 1987 NYFA Choreographers Fellowship,
        a 1988 and 1996 NEA Choreographers Fellowship and grants from the NPN
        Suitcase Fund, ArtsLink, Inc., the Harkness Foundation and the Jerome
        Foundation.</p>
      <p>Haim set this piece on student dancers during his January guest residency
        in the department. The guest artist work is generously supported by the
        Arizona Commission on the Arts, with funding from the State of Arizona
        and the National Endowment for the Arts; ASU Public Events; and the City
        of Tempe.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The other pieces in "Spring Dance Collection" are:</p>
      <p>&middot; "Time and Again," choreographed by Cliff Keuter and set on
        six dancers;</p>
      <p>&middot; "Inseparable," choreographed by Ying Yang and set on Yang and
        Casey Blake; </p>
      <p>&middot; "Fork in the Road," choreographed by Ann Ludwig and set on
        five dancers;</p>
      <p>&middot; "The Backwards Boys," choreographed by Rayn Hookala and set
        on six dancers;</p>
      <p>&middot; "The Field," a duet choreographed by Kimberly Karpanty;</p>
      <p>&middot; "Quick," a solo choreographed and danced by Karen Schupp;</p>
      <p>&middot; "Going to the Other Shore," choreographed by Mary Fitzgerald
        and set on eight dancers. </p>
      <p>The Department of Dance is committed to providing a stimulating and
        diverse environment where students develop as scholars, educators and
        artists through participation in innovative programs, residencies, performances
        and partnerships.</p>
      <p>The department is nationally ranked in the top 10 by Dance Teacher Now
        magazine. Its graduate program is ranked fifth and its undergraduate
        program is ranked ninth. The ARCO Performance Arts College Guide calls
        the department one of the "most highly recommended programs" in the country.</p>
