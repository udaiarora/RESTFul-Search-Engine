                <p><strong>HST 300: The Birth of the Modern: Europe and Its Others<br>
                </strong><strong>Dr. Andrew Barnes<br>
                </strong><strong>SLN: 16127, Internet </strong></p>
                <p>This course looks at how over the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Europeans gave up one set of ?others,? that is, social outsiders (witches, Jews&nbsp;and the poor) and during the Enlightenment replaced these with a new set of ?others? (women, Africans and Asians).&nbsp;History 300 is a historical methods course, so this subject matter will be discussed with a view toward also giving students some basic introduction to how historians develop and debate historical theses.<br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>HST 300: Urban Rebellion<br>
                </strong><strong>Dr. Matthew Whitaker<br>
                </strong><strong>SLN: 73401, TTh, 1:40-2:55, EDB 212 </strong></p>
                <p>The many urban rebellions that rocked U.S. cities and forced Americans to confront inequity and injustice embedded in our nation can be looked upon as causative components of myriad dynamic and influential movements.&nbsp; These movements include the black freedom struggle, the Chicano and American Indian Movements, protests against U.S. military action in Vietnam, the Feminists Movement, contemporary conflicts ignited by racial tensions and allegations of police brutality, and more clandestine acts of individual and collective resistance.&nbsp; This course will examine that which has inspired, and continues to inspire, the cultural and tactical responses to various forms of marginalization, exploitation, and discrimination in twentieth century America on the one hand, and systemic and societal constructs that create and perpetuate racial, economic, gender, and political disunity and inequality in urban America on the other.&nbsp; By analyzing this history, and referencing core ?American? values, such as freedom, the desire for self-determination, and resistance to oppression, this course ultimately seeks to help students develop a more holistic intellectual base from which to evaluate the importance and limitations of urban rebellion as a device to secure and maintain justice and freedom.<br>
                </p>
                <p class="style4"><strong>HST 300 : THE AMERICAN STRUGGLE FOR WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE<br>
                    Dr. Gayle Gullett<br>
                SLN: 22706, TTh, 3:15-4:30, Cowden 215 </strong></p>
                <p>In this class history majors move from reading history to creating history. To do this students will learn all the necessary skills?how to read documents critically, to build arguments that explain past events, and to communicate their understanding of the past. Students will engage in this active, participatory learning process by examining how American women?and some men?struggled to gain the vote, a campaign that stretched from 1848 to 1920. Students will seek to understand why this struggle took so long. Students will also ask if winning the vote was significant and, if so, why was it important? To answer these questions, students will learn about individuals, the women's suffrage movement, and all kinds of politics. Students will teach themselves how to write history while they are learning about women's struggle for citizenship. Students will read the opinions of other historians?and challenge them. Students will read documents written by suffragists and anti-suffragists and use these documents to write their own explanations of the struggle for the vote.<br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>HST 300: American Memory: The Civil War and Reconstruction<br>
                </strong><strong>Dr. Brooks Simpson<br>
                </strong><strong>TTh, 10:40-11:55, EDB 212<br>
                </strong><strong>SLN 05864 </strong></p>
                <p>How do Americans remember the Civil War and Reconstruction? How have those memories and impressions changed over time, and why? Why do different people remember different things about the war and its aftermath? This course is not about the Civil War and Reconstruction itself, but about how various groups of Americans have understood, remembered, and celebrated the war and its aftermath. Students will discuss readings, conduct short research projects, and interact with the community of Civil War fans as they gain an understanding of how historical memories are formed and how they function.<br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>HST 300: The Overland Trails, 1840-1860<br>
                </strong><strong>Dr. Susan Gray<br>
                </strong><strong>TTh, 9:15-10:30, EDB 212<br>
                </strong><strong>SLN: 28124 </strong></p>
                <p>HST 300 is a writing-intensive course in historical methodology intended to prepare students for their senior seminars (HST 498). HST 300 is required for the major in history, and it is taught topically by various members of the department. This particular version of the course examines in some detail an epic event in United States history: the uprooting of tens of thousands of people from their homes and their endurance of a grueling trek of many months to the far reaches of the continent. Most, but by no means all, of the overlanders were white, native-born, and impelled west by the promise of something better. Some sought more and better land, others gold, and still others sanctuary from religious persecution. Some, however, sought nothing at all, for the decision to emigrate was made for them by their fathers, husbands, and sons, or by their masters. Whatever the overlanders' reasons for travel, the journey proved the trip of a lifetime. In this course, students will explore the rich and varied historical record of the trail?diaries, letters, memoirs, and guidebooks?as well as modern writings and films by historians and other commentators. The course also explores the perspectives of the Indigenous peoples, for whom the consequences of a migration corridor through their homelands were disastrous.<br>

                <p><strong>HST 300: Creating Communities. The 19th and 20th Century Immigrant Experience<br>
                </strong><strong>Dr. Christiane Harzig<br>
                </strong><strong>MWF 9:40-10:30, EDB 212<br>
                </strong><strong>SLN 48640 </strong><strong></strong></p>
                <p>(Im)Migrants have always shaped and altered societal trajectories and demanded recognition. The course will look at immigrants' encounters with receiving societies and their social, political and cultural negotiations. Ethnic communities provided the framework for institution building and identity construction, they also function as a stepping stone to move beyond. Because community formation is a complex process and a historically contested issue, it is also a useful concept to historical &quot;tools.&quot; It will introduce a broad range of sources as well as the various historical theories and methods (cultural vs. social historical analysis, quantitative methods, oral history, &quot;classical&quot; hermeneutics, construction and deconstruction). The course will focus on U.S., Canadian and European experiences, questioning the old vs. new immigration country paradigm and U.S. exceptionalism.</p>

                <p><strong>HST 300: Fascism: Politics, Culture, and Everyday Life in Mussolini's Italy and </strong><strong>Hitler's Germany<br>
                </strong><strong>Dr. Anna Holian<br>
                </strong><strong>MW, 1:40-2:55, EDB 238<br>
                </strong><strong>SLN: 93929</strong></p>
                <p>During the 1920s and 30s, fascist and authoritarian movements rose to prominence and power throughout Europe. This course examines the rise and fall of the European fascist movements, focusing in particular on Italy and Germany.&nbsp; It emphasizes politics, culture, and everyday life under fascism. What distinguishes fascist regimes from traditional authoritarian regimes in both the style and the content of their politics? What made fascist movements so popular?&nbsp; How did fascist movements appeal to the public? What was it like to live in a fascist country? How were women's experiences of fascism different from men? How was Italian fascism different from that in Germany? These are some of the key questions we will consider in the course. Class meetings will generally consist of a brief introductory lecture followed by discussion of the reading. Sources will include scholarly monographs, fiction, film, art, and architecture.<br>

                <p><strong>HST 302: Navajo History<br>
                </strong><strong>Dr. Peter Iverson<br>
                </strong><strong>SLN 37096, MW, 1:40-2:55, Coor 186 </strong></p>
                <p>This course will provide an overview of the Navajo Nation, from the origins of the people to our own time. We will examine how and why the Dine emerged as a major indigenous community in the Southwest. The class will be centered primarily in the period from the mid-19th century to the present. Thus we will consider such topics as the Long Walk, imprisonment at Fort Sumner, the Treaty of 1868, the importance of livestock, the evolution of weaving, the addition of additional lands, schooling, traders and trading posts, the attempted imposition of federal authority, the creation of chapters and the council, livestock reduction, World War II, Navajo leadership, modern economic development, and urbanization. We will not ignore the presence of racism and discrimination, but we will emphasize the ability of the Navajos to forge their own future. Along the way we will discover what constitutes the heart of history--not the memorization of random dates and facts but rather the power of memory, the creation of tradition, the significance of place, the richness of language, and the employment of imagination. The instructor taught at Navajo Community College (now Dine College) during its first years and has taught American Indian history for more than 30 years. This semester will mark the third time he has offered this class at ASU.<br>

                <p><strong>HST 302: Jazz and Culture in America<br>
                </strong><strong>Dr. Andrew Barnes<br>
                </strong><strong>SLN: 46620, Internet </strong></p>
                <p>This course provides a survey of the cultural reaction to jazz from its emergence as a distinct form of music in the first decades of the twentieth century to its inclusion in the intellectual academy as an accepted form of music in the last decades of the twentieth century. Through the study of texts and music, the course hopes to provide students with a sense of how both jazz and its audiences evolved over the century. While some consideration will be given to jazz as it was experienced in Europe and the rest of the world, the main focus will be on how jazz developed in the United States. Because the concern is to connect jazz styles with other contemporary cultural phenomena, coverage will decline after 1970, by which time most of the styles presently maintained had come into existence.<br>

                <p>Relations between races have determined much of the history of the United States of America. Indeed, the United States ? as elsewhere in what came to be called the Americas ?&nbsp; developed as a massive encounter between and among groups identified racially. Race and the Law in U.S. History surveys the historical development of public policy and attitudes toward groups identified in U.S. history as races, that is as groups perceived as significantly different ? culturally, physically, or socially. The course treats race as a constructed reality, not as a matter of natural science.&nbsp; It pursues the contours of legal doctrines and social practice from the framing of the U.S. Constitution in 1787 to the 21st Century. It examines the roles of law in creating, sustaining, or negating racial identity; it also examines the roles of law in promoting progressive or repressive treatment of racial groups. In that regard, the course pays particular attention to "legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group," as U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo L. Black put it in Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 216 (1944), which treated the United States' internment of Japanese-Americans in concentration camps during World War II (1941-1945). Thomas J. Davis, Race Relations in America (Westport CT: Greenwood Press, 2006) serves as the course text.<br>

                <p>War has been fundamental to shaping the American nation-state and its social order: in turn, how a society wages war reflects the values and priorities of that society. This course will offer both a chronological and thematic overview of Americans at war, both on the battlefront and the home front, from the colonial origins of British North America through the present day. Students will prepare a research paper on some aspect of the American military experience: lectures and readings will highlight the major themes of the course.<br>

                <p>Although one of the major topics of current historical research has been the African diaspora in the Americas, a less researched, although equally important, aspect of the global African diaspora is that internal to Africa. Over time, blacks migrated --voluntarily and for the most part involuntarily-- across the Sahara to North Africa. The islamization of northern Africa in the seventh century led to a huge increase in trade, especially in the trans-Saharan slave trade. This course will focus on the institution of slavery in Africa and its different forms in different historical periods and geographical locations.&nbsp; We will examine theories that have developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries among scholars of different origins in their attempt to reconstruct the history of slavery in Africa.&nbsp; This course is designed to provide students with an overview of significant issues focusing on the historical, economic, political, and cultural relationships among and between black sub-Saharan Africans and North Africans.&nbsp; We will examine how race/ethnicity and gender; trade and religion affected African slavery; the impact of the decline of the trans-Saharan trade on slave trading and slavery; the impact of notions of gender on the trading of slaves; the historical relationship between black Africans and their descendants in North Africa; the self perception (identity) of the early blacks in North Africa; the emancipation of slaves; the social role and the economic status of freed slaves, and finally we will analyze the current ideas and existing knowledge in the study of the Africa Diaspora.<br>

                <p>This seminar focuses on the intellectuals, workers and peasants who contributed to the Russian revolutionary movement which culminated in the communist revolution of 1917. By reading together different types of translated primary documents written by revolutionaries and Russian citizens, utilizing theoretical works to analyze such documents, and studying recent and classic historiographical debates on the theological, ideological, cultural and social origins and outcome of the revolution, students will acquire the skills to research and write their senior research seminar paper on any topic of their choice connected with the revolutionary movement. Research topics can span from an aspect of the revolution = s nineteenth century origins to a facet of its legacy in the post-revolutionary Soviet period. In addition, students will be required to give several extended oral presentations over the course of the semester, write book reviews on a scholarly monograph they are employing for their research papers, write a short paper on a historiographical debate, hand in a rough draft, preliminary bibliography and prospectus of their final paper, and participate actively during each class meeting.<br>

                <p>This course is about Europe's relationship with Africa since the first significant encounter of the Portuguese with Black West Africa in the 15 th century until the modern era.&nbsp; It was a complex relationship that was at times characterized as cooperative and at other times as antagonistic.&nbsp; The evolution of this encounter is tied to the tumultuous dynamics of modern history.&nbsp; First we will talk about the role of black Africans in the making of Mediterranean civilizations and the Impact of Africa on Europe.&nbsp; Then we will examine the European attitudes toward African civilizations, the Age of European Discovery, early contacts, and colonial relationships.&nbsp; We will discuss the ideas and notions Africans and Europeans held about each other and how the language used to designate the ?other' changed over time.&nbsp; Colonized peoples for instance had a foreign language and culture imposed on them, but they have also appropriated them as tools to resist the colonial regime and sometimes to solve postcolonial problems. Topics to be examined include concepts of slavery in and out of Africa, the Diaspora, Orientalism, European imperialism, colonialism, the impact of colonial rule, religious and cultural movements, the rise of nationalism, the creation of racial theories and issues of ethnicity and identities in modern Africa.<br>

                <p>This course will examine the history of formal and informal barriers to equal residential opportunities for racial and religious minorities in the U.S. in the twentieth century. Formal barriers include government-initiated or -supported measures such as laws barring the naturalization of foreign non-whites as U.S. citizens until the early 1950s; racial zoning ordinances that legally restricted members of particular races to certain areas of cities and towns through the 1940s; racial and religious deed restrictions and restrictive covenants (i.e. private mutual agreements to not sell or lease property to specified groups) drawn up by real estate developers and property owners and enforced by U.S. courts until 1953; and federal, state, and local programs that included explicit racialist provisions. We will also investigate government-initiated or -supported measures (such as exclusionary/?expulsive? zoning and urban renewal) that were ?race neutral? on the surface but, intentionally or unintentionally, reduced residential opportunities for racial and religious minorities. Informal barriers include the use of violence, harassment, threats, persuasion and other means of preventing racial and religious minorities from residing in certain parts of the city or suburbs. Among the theoretical issues we will examine are the role of law and the state in creating and sustaining racism, the significance of residence in modern societies, and nature of racism in the post-Civil Rights U.S. <br>
