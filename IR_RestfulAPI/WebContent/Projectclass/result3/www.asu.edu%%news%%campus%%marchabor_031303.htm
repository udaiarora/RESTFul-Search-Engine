      <h2>Regents approve tuition increase, residence hall rates</h2>
      <p>        The Arizona Board of Regents has approved a tuition increase tied to
          an enhanced financial aid package for resident undergraduates, saying
          the move will provide for greater access to the public university system
        while protecting low-income families.</p>
      <p>The board voted 9-0, at its meeting
            March 6, in favor of raising ASU tuition $1,000 for resident and
        nonresident students and $1,200 for resident
          and nonresident graduate students for the 2003 - 04 academic year.
        In doing so, the board fully adopted the recommendations set forth by
        ASU
          President Michael Crow.</p>
      <p>Crow commended the board on its action, saying
          the revenues generated by the increase would not only maintain the
        academic quality of the university
          but would allow ASU to move forward in achieving its strategic goals
          to increase student services. </p>
      <p>Crow said the 40 percent set-aside of funds
          earmarked for financial aid was "an equivalent of a $400 million endowment
          to protect thousands of
          Arizona families" against the rising costs of higher education.</p>
      <p>In approving
          the tuition increase, the board moved the Arizona University System
        away from the lowest tuition rate among the 50 states. The increase
          should keep the system within the board's goal of maintaining a position
          ranked in the lower third of senior public institutions, however. </p>
      <p>Regent
          Gary Stewart of Phoenix said by approving the tuition, the board is
        effectively creating much needed funding that should stay in the university. </p>
      <p>"We need to remind the good, well-meaning legislators who are trying
          to solve a difficult state budget deficit that these are funds that
        were raised by us and should stay here," he said.</p>
      <p>The board also approved a
          5 percent increase for ASU residence hall rates for the 2003 - 04 academic
          year. The residence hall increase averages
          $158 and will allow Residential Life to make repairs and renovations
        to address deferred maintenance.</p>
      <p>In other action:<br>
        . The board approved project implementation for safety improvements
            to the Gammage Auditorium rigging system and fire curtain to correct
            significant
          safety and code issues. The project is estimated to cost $1.6 million
          and should begin in June.<br>
        . Proposed changes to the board's policy regarding definitions of special
          class fees or requests were discussed. Proposed changes include modifying
          the allowable uses of class fees to include supervisory instruction
          for in-context training classes and accompanists for music and dance
          classes.
          The issue will be brought back for further discussion in the April
          meeting.<br>
        . The board voted to modify its approval action taken at the November
          2002 meeting for the formation of a South Campus student residential
          project to be built using a public/private partnership. A modification
          was needed to respond to a recent tightening of the bond rating system
          by rating agencies on non-recourse student housing debt. The board
          voted to allow ASU to provide contingent operating assistance in the
          ground
          lease for the project to significantly decrease financing costs.<br>
        . The board held its first discussion on a Tri-University Voluntary
          Separation and Retirement Incentive program to be instituted upon approval
          under
          the Changing Directions Initiative. Crow said such a policy is needed
          to move ASU ahead in its transformation by providing the proper incentive
          mechanisms for retirement to individuals who do not share in the vision
          of ASU's new direction. Further discussion is expected at the board's
        April meeting.</p>
