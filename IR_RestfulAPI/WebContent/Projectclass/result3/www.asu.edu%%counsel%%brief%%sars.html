<P>Travel to certain parts of the world currently is subject to serious health risks due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  The University strongly discourages all non-essential travel to affected areas.  The status of risks in various countries is subject to change.  Employees considering travel should check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/index.htm>website</a>  before deciding to travel to areas affected by SARS. The ASU Student Health <a href=http://www.asu.edu/health/SARS.html>website</a> also contains useful information about SARS for the ASU campus community.

<P>Before the university will approve travel to any area for which a SARS alert or advisory has been issued, ASU travelers must complete the SARS Travel form and give it to the Department Chair or Administrative Unit Head:

<P><strong><center>UNIVERSITY-RELATED TRAVEL AND SARS</strong></center>

<P>As you know, travel to certain parts of the world currently is subject to serious health risks due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  The University strongly discourages all non-essential travel to affected areas.  The status of risks in various countries is subject to change.  Employees considering travel should check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website before deciding to travel to areas affected by SARS.

<P>Travel insurance policies that provide for emergency evacuation and other medical services may not cover SARS.  Travelers in other countries who show SARS-like symptoms may be subject to mandatory quarantine abroad and may be prohibited from receiving visits from personal physicians, family, and U.S. consular officials.

<P>Professional travel to any area affected by SARS is strongly discouraged. This includes University-related programming and all travel supported by University funds, contracts and grants.  The University will not impose any adverse consequences for your decision to avoid travel to a SARS-affected area.

<P>Before the University can approve your travel to an area for which a SARS alert or advisory has been issued, you must:


<ol>
<li>	consult the CDC <a href=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/index.htm>website</a> for up-to-date information and warnings on SARS;
<li>	consult with your personal physician;
<li>	agree that, upon your return, you will consult with your personal physician regarding any recommended medical treatment, testing, isolation, or other precautions related to SARS;
<li>	agree to see medical attention immediately if you develop a cough or fever within 10 days of your return from travel or possible exposure and to follow the advice of medical personnel and ASU administration regarding isolation to minimize the risk of exposure of others on campus to SARS;
<li>	sign the statement below and give to department chair (or unit head).
</ol>

<P>
<strong>I have read the above information.  I have had my questions regarding the risks of travel to SARS-affected areas answered to my full satisfaction.  In making my decision, I understand the University recommends that employees follow CDC, State Department, and World Health Organization warnings.

<P>I understand that I am not required to travel, and agree to assume the risk of my voluntary decision to travel.</strong>
