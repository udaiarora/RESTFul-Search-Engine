                    <BLOCKQUOTE>Amazzzzzing utility for language underachievers!!! Enter text or URL of one language and let Translation Assistant render the information in another language. Works with English to/from French, German, Italian, Portugese, and Spanish. Translation not exactly idiomatic, (ha! ha!) but BIG help. Will not work for long documents, but try pasting in shorter sections. Made to translate foreign language websites. Type in URL and review that indecipherale but intriguing webpage or news item. Very helpful for translating dificult bibliographical citations, but not perfect. Thank you Altavista and Systran S.A. </BLOCKQUOTE>
