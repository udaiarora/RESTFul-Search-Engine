      <h2>ASU mourns the loss of pioneer of Southwest architecture </h2>
      <p>Widely acknowledged as one of the pioneering architects of the Southwest, George Christensen's career was dedicated to sharing his expert knowledge and keen discrimination of the world around him with clients, colleagues, friends and inspired students. </p>
      <p>A professor in ASU's School of Architecture for more than 40 years, Christensen always reminded his students that, "all architects tend to criticize subdivision housing. It's time we made a conscious commitment to improve it." </p>
      <p>In addition to teaching, Christensen owned an architecture firm in Arizona, which he started in 1958, five years after graduating from the Illinois Institute of Technology. Before heading to Arizona, he worked for a Chicago-based architect, then opened his own firm in Chicago and also moved to Brazil to work for Oscar Niemeyer, widely considered one of the leading Latin American architects and the pioneer of modern architecture in Brazil. </p>
      <p>In subsequent years, some of his former students joined Christensen's growing Arizona firm. He has been recognized for his works in Arizona and was named a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1982. </p>
      <p>"In his 46 years of professional practice in Arizona, one of George's most important contributions was his unselfish mentoring of young interns and collaborators, as they followed their own professional trajectories and established independent offices, such as CCBG Architects and most recently Carson Poetzl Architecture," says Max Underwood, professor of architecture. </p>
      <p>In 2001, when Christensen received the Arizona American Institute of Architect's Educator award, many of his former students returned and fondly remembered his insistence on becoming a "refined" architect. </p>
      <p>"Whether seeking ways to expand their professional knowledge, experiencing the beauty of the people and places they encounter daily, or how to properly open a bottle of champagne, George shared his appreciation for the finer things in life with his students and all who knew him," says Underwood. </p>
      <p>A memorial service organized by the family will be held at 2 p.m., Jan. 24, at the All Saints Episcopal Church, 6300 North Central Avenue, Phoenix. </p>
