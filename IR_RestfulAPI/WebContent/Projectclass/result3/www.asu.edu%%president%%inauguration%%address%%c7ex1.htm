The fact that the public         high school graduation rate in Arizona is less than 60 percent, and that         only 42 percent of Arizona high school graduates are enrolled in college,         is clearly a call to action. And we plan to act, by becoming a greater         force in the lives of the citizenry, particularly the underserved communities,         and in early childhood education, putting more certified teachers in the         classrooms, and providing more direction to leaders in education. </p>      <p><br>      </p></td>    <td align="center" valign="top"> &nbsp;<BR> </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
