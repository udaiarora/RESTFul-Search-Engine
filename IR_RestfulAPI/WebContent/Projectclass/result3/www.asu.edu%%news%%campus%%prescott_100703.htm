      <h2>Dr. Edward C. Prescott joins ASU's W. P. Carey School of Business;
        best-of-the-best pushes research frontiers in economics </h2>
      <p> Dr. Edward C. Prescott, whose work has shaped current thinking in macroeconomics
        and whose doctoral students are stars at universities nationwide, joined
        the economics faculty of the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona
        State University effective Oct. 3. </p>
      <p>Prescott is one of a small circle of scholars who have altered the course
        of macroeconomic thinking in the past three decades. His research spans
        many areas, including business cycles, economic development, general
        equilibrium theory, and finance, and has addressed some of the most important
        long-standing questions in economics. </p>
      <p> With the exception of one year spent at the University of Chicago,
        Prescott has been on the faculty at the University of Minnesota since
        1980, most recently holding the titles of Regents Professor and McKnight
        Presidential Endowed Professor in Economics. He is also a senior advisor
        in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,
        a position he will retain while on the faculty at the W. P. Carey School
        of Business. In 2002 he was awarded the Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in
        Economics, a prestigious honor generally reserved for economists believed
        to be future contenders for the Nobel Prize.</p>
      <p>He earned a Ph.D. in economics from Carnegie-Mellon University and a
        master of science in operations research at Case-Western Reserve University.
        His undergraduate degree in mathematics was awarded by Swarthmore College.</p>
      <p> "We can remember the way we thought about the issues before Prescott's
        analysis, and the comparison with the way we think about them now gives
        a measure of the enormous effect each paper has had on our thinking,"
        said Dr. Robert E. Lucas Jr., 1995 Nobel Laureate in Economics, who worked
        with Prescott on research projects in the early '70s. "Prescott's papers
        met with resistance, but in the end he has caused us to rearrange important
        parts of our vision of how the economy works, to start over in many respects."</p>
      <p> Prescott is also revered for his teaching, especially at the graduate
        level. "His students don't learn to be acolytes of Ed Prescott," Lucas
        said. "They learn to be excellent researchers, to think for themselves."</p>
      <p>ASU President Michael Crow has made economics a high priority in his
        efforts to raise the stature of the university. "The university recognizes
        that a concentration of economic thinkers is a vital component to a university
        that leads intellectually," said President Crow. "ASU is determined to
        build such an economics department in the W. P. Carey School, and has
        pledged significant new resources to make it happen."</p>
      <p> Dr. Richard Rogerson, the Rondthaler Chair in Economics at the W. P.
        Carey School, was one of Prescott's students.<br>
          <br>
  "Prescott is committed to graduate education," Rogerson said. "At some of the
  most famous universities the high profile professors have little time for students.
  Prescott is just the opposite. He spends lots of time with students, individually
  and in small groups, mentoring them and pushing them to think. That is the
  culture we are trying to build here."</p>
      <p> Prescott's arrival comes shortly after the W. P. Carey School's $50
        million naming endowment, the second largest single gift ever given to
        a U.S. business school. The appointment also coincides with the school's
        strategic initiative to build up doctoral studies, with the goal of elevating
        the program to peer status with the top 25 nationally. </p>
      <p> &quot;Hiring Edward Prescott is the W.P. Carey School's boldest move
        in its effort to attract world-class faculty. He epitomizes the type
        of faculty that are the foundation of a great university,&quot; said
        Dr. Philip R. Regier, interim dean. "The impact of his presence will
        be felt in the caliber of faculty who will strive to be associated with
        him, and the talent of doctoral candidates who will compete to study
        with him." </p>
      <p>Department Chairman Arthur Blakemore said that the energy created by
        the W. P. Carey School naming, and the firm support of the university
        administration helped to attract Prescott to ASU. He called Prescott
        "the key building block."</p>
      <p> "He is the ideal building block for us because of his superlative professional
        record. He has challenged the conventional thinking in the economics
        profession in the ways that only the elite do," Blakemore said. "We also
        wanted Ed Prescott for his absolute dedication to the profession of economics
        research and economics education. A large number of the top macroeconomists
        in the country have studied under Ed Prescott and have been inspired
        to great achievements in their profession by him. Now students at ASU
        will have this unique opportunity."</p>
