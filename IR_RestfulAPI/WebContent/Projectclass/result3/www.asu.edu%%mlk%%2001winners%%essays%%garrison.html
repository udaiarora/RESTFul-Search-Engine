<p>
I know of two great men who dedicate their lives to treating all people equal and serving the community.   One man helped in the past and one man is helping now.<p>
 The first man who helped in the past was Martin Luther King Jr. He tried to make people understated that all people are created equal.  He made a famous speech on August 28, 1969 about his dream.  It was not the kind of dream you have when you're asleep, it was the kind of dream when you wish for the future.  He told the people, &#147;I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: we hold these truths to be self-evident:<I>  </I>that<I> </I>all men are created equal.&#148;<p>
 The second man is Father Dale Fushek.  He is a priest at my church.  He serves the<I> c</I>ommunity by helping the poor and the hungry people of the community.  He is involved in Paz De Cristo, a place where poor and hungry people can go for hot meals.  My family also volunteers to help prepare and serve the food.  It makes them proud to know they are helping the community too.  Martin Luther King, Jr. and Father Dale are a lot alike. They both are ministers, they both serve the community and they both care her other people equally.  <p>
We celebrate Martin Luther King, Jr's birthday each January to help keep his dreams alive.  Father Dale continues his dreams by serving the community each and every day.
