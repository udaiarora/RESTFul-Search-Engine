Samuels<br />Special Assistant<br />Office of the Provost<br />Massachusetts Institute of Technology</h2><p>(This paper has been slightly revised by the author, but remains essentially the oral presentation delivered at the conference.)</p><p><b>You have just received an email requesting your assistance in a search for information. Can you locate the information needed to respond to these inquiries? Today?  In 20 years? In 50 years?  </b></p><ul><li>As you seek donors to fund the renovation of your Main Library you are aware that there are existing named spaces in the building.  Seeking naming opportunities you need to know what commitments were made when those spaces were named?</li><li>The President of your institution has been asked to speak to the local Chamber of Commerce.  She asks for examples of the funding, programs, and activities that your institution has offered to the local community over the last 50 years.</li> <li>As part of a lawsuit brought by a former employee of your institution you are asked to produce all evidence of this employee&#8217;s work, the performance evaluations and severance negotiations, as well as the employment policies under which this person was hired and fired.</li><li>For the re-accreditation of your business school you are asked to document how the teaching of your core courses has changed in the last 20 years, and how class size and teaching staff have varied.</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><p><b>Where is the information required to answer these questions? Who has that information, and, in what form does it reside? The answers to these questions, and so many more reside in the information generated by your institution ­ your records:  </b></p><ul><li>Official publications</li><li>Administrative and financial records</li><li>Correspondence</li><li>Committee reports</li></ul><p>And these records exist in many forms: paper, electronic, and visual, and often in more than one form at the same time.</p><p>Though the focus of this conference is on electronic records, I think it is important to dwell for a moment on the totality of the information that has value to our institutions.  What is this universe of information and why should we care about this stuff? </p><p>Today we hear a lot about:</p><ul><li>Knowledge management</li><li>Institution-wide business management</li><li>Information ecology</li><li>Enterprise resource planning systems</li></ul><p>We are told that the information produced by our institution has great value, and authors such as Thomas Davenport, the person who gave us the term &#8220;information ecology&#8221;, stress the importance of creating, managing and using the information in an integrated fashion.</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>But often, I believe, there is not enough attention paid to what information we are talking about.  </b></p><ul><li>What is this stuff? </li><li>What do we mean by &#8220;information&#8221;?</li></ul><p>In pondering this question about information my moment of understanding came during a discussion I attended at a recent CAUSE meeting. (CAUSE has since merged with Educom to form EDUCAUSE. The organization focuses on the use of technology in higher education in teaching, learning, research, and institutional management.)</p><p>A diverse group of professionals was talking about the problems of managing &#8220;information.&#8221; As the discussion proceeded I realized that each participant had a different mental model of the &#8220;information&#8221; we were discussing based on their work and their own perspective: 	</p><ul><li>Registrar ­ student records</li><li>Librarian ­ electronic and paper based collections of books and journals</li><li>IT/IS staff ­ any and all data run over the network</li><li>Archivist ­ the records, administrative and academic, of the institution, in published and unpublished form</li></ul><p>What we must acknowledge is that each perception is correct.  In actuality,  &#8220;information&#8221; is all of these and more.  For academic institutions &#8220;information&#8221; encompasses the full spectrum of the information the faculty, staff and students generate, manage and use.</p><p>Let&#8217;s be honest here ­ colleges and universities are very <b>odd</b> institutions. Institutions of higher education are information centered and information dependent.  The core functions of colleges and universities depend upon information, current as well as historical.  Our central purpose rests on the value we place on the production and transmission of knowledge. But, as committed as we are to knowledge, we are often very poor managers of our own information, rarely taking advantage of the wealth of information generated by our institution to inform the decisions we make each day. </p><p>Each time your Faculty launches a new study of the curriculum, which we know it does every five years or so, are the reports of the former curriculum committees studied?  The decisions you make in 2000 may be different than those you made in 1988 and 1965, but they can be informed by the earlier conclusions, and the success or failure of those recommendations.</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>Our information, our records, have value as they ensure that our institutions have:  </b></p><ul><li>Self-knowledge, </li><li>Continuity, and</li> <li>Accountability,</li></ul><p>and that we can analyze and plan in light of past activities, and manage and defend the institution responsibly.</p><p>To help us appreciate the value of this information and its potential uses we need to understand the full spectrum of this information.  Because only then can we:</p><ul><li>Ensure the creation, capture, retention and effective management of the information.</li><li>Ensure integrated access to and use of the information</li></ul><p>How can we achieve a better understanding of our institutional information, and appreciate both how and why it was created, and how it can be used?</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>One way to analyze the very central role information plays in supporting academic institutions is through functional analysis.  For this I will use my own work <i>Varsity Letters</i> (<i>Varsity Letters: Documenting Modern Colleges and Universities,</i>The Society of American Archivists and Scarecrow Press, 1992). </b></p><p>While written primarily for archivists as a tool to improve the documentation of their institutions, the work has also been used by non-archivists, such as academic administrators seeking a way to analyze the functions of their institution as part of a strategic planning exercise.  </p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>Rather than a detailed functional analysis, the intent was to broadly understand academic institutions. The book investigates seven functions, which taken together comprise the activities of all institutions of higher education: </b></p><ul><li>Confer credentials ­ describes the process of recruiting, selecting, and admitting students; providing financial aid and academic advice; and finally, graduating the students.</li><li>Convey Knowledge ­ covers the formulation and delivery of the curriculum as well as the learning process.</li><li>Foster socialization ­ includes the informal learning that takes place outside the classroom in a planned and unplanned manner through residential life, extracurricular activities, and personal counseling.</li><li>Conduct research ­ describes the endeavors of the faculty and graduate students in the search for new knowledge.</li><li>Sustain the institution ­ covers those areas, including governance, financial and personnel management, and physical plant, that are required to assure the continuity of the institution.</li><li>Provide public service ­ examines those activities, including technical assistance and continuing education, that are primarily directed to outside communities.</li><li>Promote Culture ­ explores the role of the institution as collector and disseminator of culture through the operation of museums, libraries m and archives.</li></ul><p>These categories were established to facilitate the analysis of the functions, but clearly many activities may appear to belong in more that one function. For example, in the book athletics is discussed in the function &#8220;foster socialization.&#8221; When informed of this fact, a group of archivists disagreed: athletics belongs in &#8220;provide public service,&#8221; suggested an archivist from a large Midwestern state university, while another colleague felt that it belonged in &#8220;promote culture;&#8221; an archivist from a &#8220;Big Ten&#8221; institution suggested that they were both wrong as clearly athletics belongs in &#8220;sustain the institution.&#8221; The point is that they were all correct.  These archivists have identified the nuances of athletics that are important at their institutions and that suggest what should be documented.  At MIT, and other NCAA Division III institutions, understanding the role of athletics in the socialization process is sufficient.</p><p>We can use this functional typology, to explore the notion that academic institutions are information centered and information dependent. To help us focus on the potential scope of the information, let us examine what information is generated and what information is used during each function. (The following list is just suggestive and I&#8217;m sure each institution could add additional information.)</p></div><div class="slide"><table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td valign="top"><b>Function</b></td><td valign="top"><b>Information generated</b></td><td valign="top"><b>Information used</b></td></tr>	<tr><td valign="top">Confer credentials</td><td valign="top">Admission applications<br />Student and financial aid records<br />Statistical reports</td><td valign="top">Student and financial aid records</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Convey knowledge</td><td valign="top">Curriculum materials<br />Student work ­ exams and papers<br />Web course pages</td><td valign="top">Library resources</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Foster socialization</td><td valign="top">Student organization records<br />Photographs of events<br />Student diaries and personal web pages</td><td valign="top">???</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Conduct research</td><td valign="top">Databases, laboratory notebooks<br />Published results: journal articles, books, theses</td><td valign="top">Databases<br />Library resources</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sustain the institution</td><td valign="top">Administrative records<br />Published reports</td><td valign="top">Administrative records<br />Published reports</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Provide public service</td><td valign="top">Administrative records<br />Consulting reports<br />Catalogs (e.g. continuing ed courses)</td><td valign="top">Administrative records<br />Library resources</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Promote culture</td><td valign="top">Administrative records of libraries, museums, and archives<br />Catalogs (e.g. exhibits, library holdings)</td><td valign="top">Administrative records<br />Professional literature</td></tr>	 </table>	<p>The information described here encompasses a broad spectrum of materials that includes administrative records, published materials issued by your institution and diverse sources of information created outside your institution.  The information exists in paper and electronic form and includes, written, visual and even artifactual sources.</p><p>Let&#8217;s think about how this broad spectrum of information can support the major decisions faced by your institution. And let&#8217;s think about the form in which you will find this information now and in the future.</p><p>Some uses of information we acknowledge as a critical part of the way we do business. We can neither do strategic nor tactical planning without a considerable battery of information documenting past budgets, enrollment and personnel figures, cost to maintain the physical plant, endowment gains, etc.</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>But let&#8217;s explore some other situations  </b></p><p>It is 1995 ­ Your Faculty senate is about to change the requirements for an undergraduate degree: number of credits and the distribution of courses.  To justify their proposal and ensure that they are adhering to the institution&#8217;s regulations, the Faculty needs to compare their proposal to the last major changes made in 1972. Where is the evidence they require?</p>	<ul><li>Reports of the 1972 Curriculum Committee:<br />- Charge to the Committee<br />- Minutes and correspondence</li><li>Minutes of the Faculty</li><li>Course Catalog</li><li>Rules and regulations of the Faculty</li><li>Undergraduate manuals</li></ul><p>It is 2005­ you are faced with the same question and you need to reconstruct the decisions of the 1995 CommitteeNow where do you look?</p><p>Curricula committee:</p><ul><li>The charge to the committee went out as a letter.</li><li>There is a set of paper minutes but all of the correspondence took place as email.</li><li>The report of the committee was issued in paper and electronic versions.</li><li>Both the minutes of the Faculty, the course catalog and the undergraduate manual were available in paper and electronic forms.</li></ul><p>It is 2025 and you are faced with the same question as you try to reconstruct the records of the deliberations in 2005.  By then everything was created and stored only in electronic form.  The ultimate question ­ Can you gain access to and use these electronic records? This is a question that Tim McGovern and other speakers at this conference will address.</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>The documentation is changing.  Our search for this vital information will change overtime. It remains to be seen whether we will be more or less successful at capturing and reusing our institution&#8217;s valuable information. </b> [<a href="sld008p.htm">Slide</a>]</p><p>Let me return then to some real and hypothetical cases to continue to explore this idea of why we need this information and how our records support the management of our institutions.</p><p>Lawsuits manage to make us sit up and pay attention: we exist in litigious times.</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>Two cases from MIT:  </b></p><ul><li>The Justice Department brought suit against MIT and other academic institutions for working together to set financial aid packages.  The academic institutions claimed that the intent was to allow students to select an institution based on where they wanted to go rather than how much money they were offered.  The Justice Department saw this practice as an antitrust violation.</li>	<li>Patients who received small doses of radiation as part of a nutrition study in the 1950&#8217;s sued MIT.</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><p><b>In each case the records in the Archives at MIT were used extensively, and did help MIT win both suits. I think we learned two things from these cases:  </b></p><ul><li>Availability of records:<br />Lawyers are heard to say that they prefer if we destroy everything. But in truth, records most often can defend an institution.</li>	<li>Availability of records over time:<br />The two cases I described involved events in the 50&#8217;s and 70-80&#8217;s.  The records used were paper files.  If the cases had involved activities in the 90&#8217;s would we have been able to retrieve all that we needed from both paper and electronic form?</li></ul><p>Let&#8217;s get back to the personnel case I gave you at the opening of the talk. As part of a lawsuit brought by a former employee of your institution you are asked to produce all evidence of this employee&#8217;s work, the performance evaluations and severance negotiations, as well as the employment policies under which this person was hired and fired.</p><p>What kind of records are needed, who creates and is responsible for them, and in what form do they reside? (Group discussion ­ think about both paper and electronic records)</p><p>And one more:</p><p>For the re-accreditation of your business school you are asked to document how the teaching of your core courses has changed in the last 20 years, and how class size and teaching staff have varied.</p><p>I consider this one of the most interesting and challenging questions.  This is our core function ­ teaching and learning ­ and yet it is the <b>most</b> difficult to document.</p><p>You are looking for the documentation of a course taught in 1960 ­ what might you be able to find?  A syllabus, reading list, exam questions and maybe a few student papers? With some luck the faculty member has some notes of their lectures, or you can gather some student notebooks recording the lectures.</p><p>You are looking for a course that was taught in 1999 ­ what might you be able to find? Interactive educational programs, email between students and faculty, student papers and projects on-line all allow us to examine and capture the teaching and learning process, as we have never been able to do before this time.  Yes, there are legal problems about the reuse of these materials (privacy and copyright) but potentially we have a record of the teaching and learning process.</p><p>Why are these materials so interesting and potentially important?  As we allocate increasing resources to educational technology no issue is more central to the question about the efficacy of the use of these resources than evaluation and assessment. The design and delivery of courses that use web communication, simulations, streaming video etc. can cost thousands of dollars.  Is it worth it? Has instruction become more effective, and most importantly do our students have a better comprehension and ability to use the concepts they are taught? How can we answer these questions without the evidence of the educational process?</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>O.K. now in closing it is your turn to play.  </b>	</p><ul><li>The Dean for Students has just asked you to serve on the Planning Committee for the New Undergraduate Dorm. </li><li>As your first task you are trying to identify and gather the information you need as background to guide the decisions you face. </li></ul><p>What are your questions? What information do you require? Who has it?</p><p>(Group discussion)</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>Examples of documents:  </b></p><ul><li>Current and past statements about the agreed upon values, developed by the students, staff and faculty that guide housing- student handbooks, evidence that provides information about the current and previous uses of the existing dorms.</li><li>Surveys and interviews.</li><li>Size - number of students currently housed in dorms, enrollment projections, revenue projections: Data from Registrar and Admissions.</li><li>Facilities required and Design issues - connectivity, common vs. private spaces, food, etc. Planning documents and specifications for earlier dorms. Surveys and interviews with faculty students and staff. </li><li>Resources ­ past funding efforts ­ bonds, private donors etc. Current prospects and patterns. Required endowment?</li><li>Maintenance ­ Budgets and reports from physical plant documenting staff and funds needed to maintain existing facilities. </li><li>Building code and requirements, local laws and codes.</li></ul><p>My goal this morning has been to make you think about your information ­ the records of your institution and the vital role they can play in supporting each and every function carried out by you institution.  I hope the cases I have presented and our discussion will help you appreciate the value of these varied resources.</p><p>So you say  - what do I do now? I know I have valuable information to preserve ­ I want to be sure it is created, managed responsibly and available when it is needed. The traditional skills of archivists and records managers are still vital to address these needs, but increasingly those skills must be applied to the management of the full life cycle of these records: from creation to continuing use, or destruction. We have to be able to ensure the same continuing access to and use of electronic records as we have to our paper records.  But can we?  What new problems do we face?</p><p>Fortunately we have Tim McGovern and the other speakers at this meeting who will shed light on these challenging questions. </p></div><!-- footer --><p class="nav">[ <a href="../../"><acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym> Home</a> |<a href="../../archives.html">Archives</a> |<a href="../">1999 Presentations</a> ]</p><div class="footer">    <p class="postdate">&copy;&nbsp;1999    Samuels &nbsp;&#8212;    Last Modified		Wednesday 11 February 2004		<br />Visits to this page: <img src="/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?pad=0|dd=E|ft=0|tr=T|trgb=ffffff|df=ickim-ecure-speaker-presentation-samuels-html.dat" alt="Number of visits to this page" />	</p></div></body></html>
