<b><font size=+1>Instructions for applying for equivalency of  First-Year Composition
requirements</font></b>
<br>
&nbsp;
</center>
<p>First-Year Composition is required of every student who intends to graduate
with a baccalaureate degree from Arizona State University.&nbsp; The composition
program emphasizes the reading and writing of academic prose.&nbsp; Most
students meet the composition requirement by successfully completing ENG
101 and ENG 102 or completing ENG 105, the advanced First-Year composition
course.&nbsp; International students from non-English speaking countries
meet the composition requirements by taking ENG 107 and ENG 108.&nbsp;
Other students complete the composition requirement by transferring equivalent
courses from other institutions.
<p>Students wishing to transfer composition courses from other institutions to 
  satisfy the ASU composition requirement must submit an ?Application of Equivalency 
  of First-Year Composition requirements,? a transfer transcript (which can be 
  obtained from the Registrar's Office), and a copy of the catalog description(s) 
  of the course(s) to the Writing Programs Office, Language and Literature Building, 
  Room 314.&nbsp; 
<p>Note: Composition courses completed from Arizona two-year colleges, if taken 
  after 1978, automatically transfer in as equivalent to ASU composition courses, 
  so no form is required. <br>
