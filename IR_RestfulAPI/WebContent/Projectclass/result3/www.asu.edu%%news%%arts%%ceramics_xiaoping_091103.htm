      <h2>World leaders come together in ceramic exhibition</h2>
      <p>Osama bin Laden and George Bush. Tony Blair and Saddam
        Hussein. Yasser Arafat and Ariel Sharon. Imagine these world leaders
        in the same room, then add many others, including the UN's Kofi Annan,
        Russia's Vladimir Putin and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi. A recipe for disaster
      . or perhaps reconciliation?</p>
      <p>On Oct. 3, 20 world political leaders - or
          their ceramic likenesses - will come together at ASU Art Museum's Ceramics
          Research Center in the exhibition
    Luo Xiaoping: The Time Square Series. The ceramic figures by Chinese artist
    Luo are part portrait, part caricature and will bring audiences face to face
    with the leaders who are shaping our global community.</p>
      <p>Luo describes his approximately
    two-feet-tall sculptures of some of the world's most powerful people as "a
    political image spectrum installed on the Square
    of Time." His work provides an opportunity for both artist and viewer to
        enjoy a somewhat lighter perspective on world affairs than recent events
        have allowed.</p>
      <p>"Some
    of these figures may never, in reality, stand together, but today I have
        brought them together on a single stage," Luo says. "Here, I can scoff
        at them,
    myself and the world."</p>
      <p>Luo is an internationally renowned ceramic artist who
    divides his time between Yixing - his home in China's Jiangsu Province -
        and Arizona. He has participated
    in dozens of exhibitions at home and abroad, and held solo exhibitions in
        the United States, New Zealand and China. He has also been the recipient
        of many
    domestic and international prizes for his work.</p>
      <p>Luo Xiaoping was born in Jiangxi,
    China, in 1960. He attended the Sculpture Department of Jingdezhen Ceramics
    College in 1983 and became a teacher on the
    architecture faculty of Tongji University, Shanghai, after graduation. After
    five years,
    he resigned from the university and set up Xiaoping
          Studio in Yixing, where he has hosted ceramic artists from around the
        world, exposing them to the rich pottery traditions of Yixing.</p>
      <p>The Time
    Square Series will run Oct. 3, 2003 - Feb. 7, 2004 at the Ceramics Research
    Center. A free public reception sponsored by Desert Jade Women's
          Group of Phoenix will be held from 7-9 p.m., Oct. 3, to open the exhibition.
          A lecture by Claudia Brown, professor in ASU's Herberger College of
        Fine Arts and director of ASU's Center for Asian Studies, is scheduled
        for
        8 p.m., Oct. 3, at the CRC.</p>
