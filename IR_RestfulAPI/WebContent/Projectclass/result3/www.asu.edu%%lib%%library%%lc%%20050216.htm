                     <blockquote>
                       <p>Compensation Committee met with Associate Dean Kurt Murphy on December 10 to address compensation issues raised by Executive Committee of Librarians&rsquo; Council. Kurt stated that he reviews ARL data every fall and was updating ASU&rsquo;s data and profile for this year.</p>
                       <p>Kurt distributed 3 documents and discussed their importance to the process:</p>
                       <blockquote>
                         <p>1. <i>Arizona State University Libraries Academic Professional Performance Based Salary Plan - </i>Approved in 1995, this is the salary plan that the library follows when dealing with compensation issues. Kurt highlighted Item III D, which states:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                           <p>Salary Structure: The goal of the University Libraries&rsquo; salary structure is to be competitive with external markets, internally equitable, and to reward performance. </p>
                           <p>The University Libraries&rsquo; salary structure seeks to attain and maintain salaries equivalent to the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile of the combined ASU and U of A peer institution salaries.</p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p>2. <i>Peer Institutions for ASU, UA and NAU, PLUS Public PAC-10 and Public Big 10- </i>On the list of ASU peers. Issues with peer list - It is the overall institution - not the library - being grouped as peers; geography</p>
                         <p>3. <i>2003-04 ARL Salary Survey - Table 21 - Number and average salaries of ARL University Librarians by position and type of institution - </i>Usefulness diminished because it is based on the 68 Public ARL libraries and has limited librarian position categories.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>
                       </blockquote>
                       <p>The process used by Kurt and the UL Administration is to use the above data to set &ldquo;target salaries&rdquo; for all librarians. When the money comes from the University, it has parameters and a dollar amount that make it unrealistic to bring everyone up to &ldquo;target salaries&rdquo;. The UL generally adjusts all librarian salaries over a 3-year cycle beginning with the bottom third, then the top third, and finishing with the middle third.</p>
                       <p>Since ARL collects so much more data than they generally report, Kurt inquired a couple of years ago about running a custom report that would give us UL requested data related to our specific peers. ARL can run it, for a price. Dean Schmidt approved funding for such a report and has approved funding for another more detailed report, which Kurt hopes to have run by late winter/early spring.</p>

                       <p>&nbsp;</p>
                       <p>Pat Etter attended the January meeting. It was held at the East Campus, and Pat described it as a great meeting area.</p>
                       <p>The new ASU East Provost, Jerry Jakubowski, welcomed everyone and outlined the general plans for transforming ASU East into a Polytechnic Institute, soon to be called: ASU at the Polytechnic Campus<b>. <o:p></o:p></b></p>
                       <p>Student Affairs committee Chair Steve Happel reported on the problems with student cheating at ASU, which some characterize as prevalent. Although a resolution regarding academic integrity was presented, it was tabled and will be worked on to include some suggested modifications from the Senate meeting.</p>
                       <p>Provost Glick discussed several items:</p>
                       <blockquote>
                         <p> -- The TF on Health Care</p>
                         <p>-- The family of Professor Starsky, a faculty member who was released in the 1970s by the Board of Regents for missing a class for a sit-in and whose son now attends ASU, has donated papers to ASU. Dean Schmidt accepted the Starsky papers for the University. This incident regarding Professor Starsky serves as a reminder of an unfortunate event in the University's history and reminds us what transpired at ASU and many other places in the U.S. We think this is a fitting closure for many to an incident that should not have happened.  -- He clarified a number of assertions about the news article <i>ASU hiring stars, NAU hiring only young faculty</i>.                  Bill Simmons, ASU West described a recent report to President Crow and the four University provosts. It was an idea for University Council. The University Council would be a non-policy making body that would serve three main functions. </p>

Revising the ACD manual with the additions of West and East campuses is taking longer than anticipated. </p>
