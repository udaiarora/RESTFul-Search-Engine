The vi Survival Kit
</center></h2>
<p><ol>
<li>To open a file for editing, type:<p>
         vi filename<p>
    from the command prompt. vi will open an existing file for
    editing, or create a new one, if it doesn't find the file you
    request.
<p>
<li>In vi, there are two modes: Command Mode, and Input (Typing) Mode.
    When you start vi, it's always in Command Mode. To move the cursor
    around in Command Mode, use the Arrow Keys, or type:<br><pre>
	h = left	k = up	j = down	l = right</pre>
    **Hint: You can only move the cursor around in areas where there is
    text.
<p>
<li>Once a file has been opened, you may type either "i" or "a". 
    This will put vi into Input Mode. Now you can use vi like a
    typewriter. To return to Command Mode at any time, press ESC.
<p>
       "i"nsert mode will insert text in front of the cursor.
<br>   "a"ppend mode will insert text after the cursor.
<p>
<li>If you make a mistake, either the DELETE, or the 
    CTRL H keys (simultaneously) will erase a character.
<p>
<li>To delete several characters, enter Command Mode by pressing
    ESC and repeatedly type "x" to delete faster.
<p>
<li>To delete a line, from Command Mode, place the cursor on the line
    you want to remove, then type "dd".
<p>
<li>To "undo" the last command, type "u" while in Command Mode.
<p>
<li>To save a file and end vi, type <Escape> :wq
<p>
<li>To end vi without saving the current file, type <Escape> :q!
</ol><p>
Example: Using vi to Create a File (on "stats.asu.edu")
<pre>
(1) Log on to your account.

(2) At the prompt type "vi testfile" (as shown below).

         stats1 &gt; vi testfile

      The screen should now look something like this:
      ~         Note: "~" stands for a blank line in vi
      ~
      ~
      ~
      ~
      "testfile" [New file]

(3) At this point, vi is waiting for your commands. To change 
    to Typing Mode, press either "i" (insert text before cursor) 
    or "a" (append text after cursor). 

(4) Type in the text shown below. Press ENTER at the end of 
    each line.
           This is a test.
           Line two fo the test.
           This is a mistake.
           This is line three of the test.

(5) Even though we can see a mistake or two, let's save the 
    file. We can always fix it later. To do this, first press 
    ESC, which will tell vi we want to return to Command Mode.

(6) No matter where our cursor is, once we're in Command Mode, 
    we just type ":", which moves the cursor to the bottom line 
    of the screen.  To save the file, type wq and press ENTER.
    We should see a message like this telling us that the file 
    has been saved:

	"testfile" [New file] 4 lines, 59 characters 

(7) Let's get "testfile" again, and fix it. At the prompt type in 
     
	"vi testfile". 

(8) The file should have reappeared (see below), and vi will be in
    Command Mode. Don't enter Typing Mode just yet. Use the Arrow 
    Keys or the cursor keys (h, j, k, and l) to move the cursor to 
    the second line of text. Place the cursor over the non-word 
    "fo" and press the x twice. This should remove the offending 
    letters. To replace them, first press "i" to enter Insert Mode, 
    then type the word "of": 

          This is a test.
          Line two of the test.
          This is a mistake.
          This is line three of the test.
          ~
          ~
          ~
          "testfile"  4 lines, 59 characters 

    **Helpful Hint: In case anything goes seriously wrong while 
    you are editing the file, you can just press ESC :q!, 
    which will get you out of vi without saving the changes you 
    made to the file.  Then you can go back into vi and try 
    editing it again.

    There is one more thing to fix in our file "testfile". Press 
    the ESC key to re-enter Command Mode. Use the Arrow Keys to 
    move the cursor to any place on the third line (which has the 
    word "mistake" in it). Type dd, and watch the line disappear.

    Now we are ready to re-save the file. To do this, from 
    Command Mode press ":", then wq

(9) Use the ls command to see that the file has been saved. At the
    main prompt, type "ls testfile"

(10)Type more testfile at the main prompt. more shows the contents 
    of a file, one screen at a time. To view the next screen, press
    SPACE-bar.  To move down one line, press ENTER. For large 
    files, you may use "q" to quit the more command.
