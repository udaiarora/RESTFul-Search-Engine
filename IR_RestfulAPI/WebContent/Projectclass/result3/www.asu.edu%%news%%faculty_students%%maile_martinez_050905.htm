          <h2>Martinez becomes ASU&rsquo;s first Gates Cambridge Scholar</h2>
          <p align="right"> <img src="facstudents_images/Maile-Martinez.jpg" alt="Maile Martinez" width="180" height="261" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">ASU graduate student Maile Martinez has been awarded the Gates Cambridge Scholarship and will study at the University of Cambridge in England beginning in the fall. </p>
          <p> She is the first ASU student to receive the award. </p>
          <p> Martinez, who is receiving her master&rsquo;s degree in education this month, is one of just 38 recipients from the United States who are part of the fifth annual contingent of Gates Cambridge Scholars selected from around the world. Scholars first must gain admission to Cambridge before vying for the scholarship, which is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled to enroll at Cambridge, and am honored to be part of the Gates Cambridge program,&rdquo; Martinez says. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;This accomplishment by Maile is truly outstanding,&rdquo; adds Maria T. Allison, vice provost and dean of graduate studies. &ldquo;To be able to compete among the very best of the talented students supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation speaks volumes to her quality and commitment as a person and as a student.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Martinez is a seventh-grade language arts and social studies teacher at Underdown Junior High School in Cashion, Ariz., as part of Teach for America , a nonprofit organization that recruits recent college graduates to teach in urban and rural public schools. Through a partnership between Teach for America and ASU, she is working toward meeting her teaching certification requirements &ndash; and, at the same time, her master&rsquo;s degree. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;I can say without hesitation that this has been the most challenging experience of my entire life,&rdquo; Martinez says. &ldquo;I feel like I was prepared as much as I could be, but I simply didn&rsquo;t understand how much work it takes to be a teacher. The experience, however, has been very rewarding.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> With her two-year commitment to Teach for America concluding this year, Martinez decided to pursue further graduate study. Cambridge&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s program in European culture and literature will help her build on her background in English, French, and Spanish language and literature, and move toward her goal of earning a doctorate and becoming a professor. As a faculty member, she will be able to undertake a leadership role in helping build a bridge between the academic world and the community, she says. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;There often is a disconnect between a university and its communities, and in becoming a professor I can connect those students with the passion and desire to help those communities,&rdquo; Martinez says. &ldquo;In other words, I can use it as a position to affect change.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> The Gates Cambridge Scholarship program is designed to prepare outstanding graduate students to contribute solutions to complex social issues. There is a great need for highly educated leaders who are skilled in research and analysis to address social injustices and inequities, according to the Gates Foundation. Since the scholarship program&rsquo;s inception in 2001, more than 200 scholars have received degrees from Cambridge and have gone on to endeavors in various fields throughout the world. </p>
