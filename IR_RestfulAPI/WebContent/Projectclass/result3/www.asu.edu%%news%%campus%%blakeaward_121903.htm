      <h2>Groups salute late lobbyist Blake Anderson</h2>
      <p>The American Association of Community Colleges, the American Association
        of State Colleges and Universities, the Council for Advancement and Support
        of Education (CASE), and the National Association of State Universities
        and Land-Grant Colleges have named the late ASU lobbyist Blake Anderson
        as the recipient of the Marvin D. "Swede" Johnson Achievement Award for
        his dedication to state relations and advancing the cause of colleges
      and universities. Anderson passed away in June.</p>
      <p>The Johnson award is only
          one of two national honors in higher-education state relations, a field
          that encompasses advocacy and outreach efforts
          on behalf of colleges and universities to governors, state legislators
          and other key policymakers. <br>
        Also awarded was the Edwin Crawford Award for Innovation to Matthew
          Hargrove from the University of California, Davis.</p>
      <p>"These winners have profoundly
          improved the lives of all members of their campus communities through
          their persistent and all-too-often unacknowledged
          efforts," said CASE President Vance T. Peterson. "We are pleased to
        honor these distinguished professionals for the positive impact they
        have had
          on American higher education and for the outstanding example they have
        set for state-relations professionals everywhere."</p>
      <p>Anderson served as
          the university's chief political adviser and lobbyist since 1994. Prior
          to joining ASU, Anderson worked for the Arizona House
          of Representatives and previously for Sen. John McCain. During his
        tenure at the university, Anderson assisted in the creation of the ASU
        legislative
          network, an advocacy mechanism in conjunction with the Alumni Association
          and other members of the campus community. He also was in charge of
        the organization and coordination of the annual Western States Governmental
          Relations Conference, which has been key in connecting government relations
        professionals from the region.</p>
      <p>One of Anderson's greatest accomplishments
          was the passage of a bill to give $400 million to the three Arizona
        universities for constructing
          research facilities. Anderson was instrumental in getting this legislation
          passed, even as the state faced a $1 billion budget deficit. After
        Anderson's death, the members of the state legislature named the bill
        "Blake's Bill"
          and to a person they spoke of the effectiveness with which he had carried
        it through from start to finish.</p>
      <p>"Blake was dedicated to ASU and worked
          hard on ASU's governmental affairs issues," says Steve Miller, deputy
          vice president in Public Affairs.
          "I am very proud of Blake's accomplishments and am honored to have
        worked with him." </p>
      <p>Nominees for the Johnson Award are evaluated on three criteria
          - motivation/coordination/stewardship; support from policymakers and
          colleagues; and extraordinary contributions
        over a significant period of time. </p>
      <p>The recipient of the Marvin D. "Swede"
          Johnson Award receives a $5,000 cash prize, sponsored by ACS, Inc.,
      PeopleSoft and Unisys.</p>
