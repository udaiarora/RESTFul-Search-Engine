<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting was called to

order at 3:20 p.m. by Senate President Douglas Johnson.

<p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acceptance of Previous Minutes of November

13, 2000.</b>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The draft minutes of November

13, 2000 are delayed. The November 13 and November 27 Senate Minutes will

both be considered at the first meeting of the spring semester on January

22, 2001. All editorial corrections of these minutes should be directed

to Darby Shaw at the Senate office (965-9245) or emailed to <font size=-1><a href="mailto:darby.shaw@asu.edu">darby.shaw@asu.edu</a></font><font size=+0>.</font>

<p><b><font size=+0>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Announcements

and Communications.</font></b>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.A&nbsp;

Senate President?s Report </b>(Douglas Johnson).</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I trust you

all had a nice Thanksgiving. My family and I were fortunate in that we

had family in, with turkey and all the trimmings.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Glick,

perhaps you would like to share with our senators the new proposal on a

fall vacation schedule? Do any of you feel that a week of vacation in the

fall, comparable to the spring recess, would be a good idea? (A definite

Yes! and much clapping here).</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Glick:

We would then have to begin school on May 1!</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amazing

thing over the weekend was the recounts and the judicial jockeying that

is going on in the election. We all know what a chad is now--swinging,

pregnant, dimpled, or otherwise. It will be interesting to see what the

process changes are that result from this whole event. The news people

are really having a field day.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minutes

of our last meeting are not ready yet, and we will inform you when they

are posted to the web page. (Update: Minutes were posted 12/01/00 and a

notice sent to senators).</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Task Force

on Promotion and Tenure is in the process of having hearings. One is scheduled

for Thursday, November 30. This is an important study. The group has tried

to provide some balance to the changes to the Promotion and Tenure policy

to reflect good ideas and the needs of the university as well as safeguards

for individuals and their careers.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.B University

Provost?s Report </b>(Milton Glick).</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I have

two things I want to bring up. Some of you will talk about the health care

issues. What I can say is that we will be re-bidding one year early on

a five year contract. This is a very important topic to everyone, but I

will not say much, as Senate President Johnson will talk about that more.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do want to

talk to you about task forces. The Governor appointed two task forces last

spring: the Task Force on Higher Education and the Task Force on the New

Economy. She also put on the ballot this election Proposition 301, which

adds six tenths of a cent in sales tax. As we discussed previously, more

than just money was involved. It was about whether the people in Arizona

believe education is important enough to make a tax increase. To everyone

who helped pass Proposition 301 in any way, thank you. It was a landmark

passage for this state, and it will help us very much over the next several

years. I could also add, there are 12 counties in the state of Arizona.

Interestingly enough, the measure only passed by 5,000 votes. The overall

passage was 80,000 votes, and in the County of Maricopa 5,000 of those

80,000 passed the bill. This means that there is a change in the political

landscape, with Pima County typically being a liberal stronghold and Maricopa

County being a conservative stronghold. Brent Brown could probably offer

some comment about this. It was a phenomenon that two years ago we could

not have predicted. So, again, thanks to all who helped in this process.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, everyone

wants to get their hands on that money. They are talking for higher education,

that there will be 3% going to the community colleges and 12% to the universities.

That 12% represents 40-50 million dollars in year one. Assuming the economy

stays healthy, that will grow larger over the years. It is very important

to know that the legislature does not appropriate that money. That money

is directly appropriated to the Regents. Our job will be to make sure the

legislature does not think that they have now solved our problems. They

have not, and they are now facing the tough problem of how to deal with

the alternative fuel fiasco.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Higher

Education Task Force is reaching closure. It has one more meeting.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The New Economy

Task Force intends to bring closure in the next three weeks, so the Governor

will have in hand those two reports as she gets ready for her state of

the state message in January.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shape of

the Higher Education Task Force is clear. It will have three basic strategies

and an after-piece on accountability and outcomes. The three strategies

are:</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; <i>Increase

the participation of Arizonans in higher education</i>:</font>

<ol>

<ul>

<li>

Improve the college-going rate of high school graduates by using outreach

and early awareness, and by establishing grants of $1,000 to those students

who go directly from a community college out of high school.</li>



<li>

Improve course transfer, and maintain open admissions to the community

colleges for high school graduates. There was in the last meeting still

on the table a statement to redirect some university students to the community

colleges. I think that stated in that way, it is a bad idea. I do not think

that this is a good plan for this state, but it is still on the table.</li>

</ul>

</ol>



<li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Increase research

and business development:</i></li>



<ol>

<ul>

<li>

There will be a series of university initiatives. Some will be tri-university,

some individual universities. Each will be funded in such a way that they

will directly support the state?s industry. This will be the first money,

certainly in my time here, which will be directed explicitly toward research.</li>

</ul>

</ol>



<ul>

<ul>

<li>

In addition, as a part of the increase in research and business development,

there will be a section on workforce development through learner centered

programs, increased adult education, new economy training for gainful employment,

workforce development for math and science.</li>

</ul>

</ul>



<li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font size=+0>Increase

capacity of productivity:</font></i></li>



<ul>

<ul>

<li>

<font size=+0>Enhancement of human resources: Address faculty and staff

salaries and make them competitive for both the universities and the community

colleges, and that includes increasing university faculty salaries to the

fiftieth percentile of their peer universities.</font></li>



<li>

<font size=+0>Management of capital assets: We will request that we take

care of our buildings, and that we invest in them.</font></li>



<li>

<font size=+0>Utilization of educational technology, through a variety

of initiatives including Arizona Regents University. We are still shaping

how that will get done.</font></li>

</ul>

</ul>

<font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Final after-piece:

<i>The

need for investment accountability and outcomes</i>.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Regents should examine and revise the 22 to 1 formula to more accurately

reflect the real cost of additional enrollment.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The 22 to 1 formula should be fully funded (and they have done pretty well

on that).</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The legislature in consultation with the Regents should adopt a funding

approach for universities beyond enrollment growth that is tied to a</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

market-based analysis, using benchmark data from peer universities.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of

the funding model should be the average of funding, on a per student basis,

of each institution?s ABOR approved peers. This is a very big issue for

us. As the main campuses of ASU and UofA are not intended to grow, all

of our new money at ASU in the last decade has been for growth. We had

less than one-half percent per year in money that was not directed at either

salaries or enrollment growth. So, if we continue the trend, that the only

thing the legislature will fund is growth, then Main Campus has no way

to solve its problem. But if they would really work toward putting us on

the same level of funding as our peers, that has enormous upside potential

for this campus, because we are substantially below our peers. Maybe there

is a large distance between this task force making its recommendations,

and then having them actually funded. But, nevertheless, step one is getting

these recommendations done. It should be funded through a combination of

tuition and state general funding. They also go on to discuss <i>increased

collaboration between the three sectors of education</i>, and finally <i>accountability

of higher education to the public, and productivity</i>. So, while we would

all modify this in little ways, if all this would actually happen, Arizona

as a state and ASU as a university would have been well served by this.

Are there any questions?</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: Do you (Provost Glick) want to see the color of that money? The

recommendations of that committee are remarkable. There are a number of

huge challenges that faculty will need to respond to. Thinking about structuring

our resources so that their technology transfer impacts the economy is

an entirely new concept. Thinking about investing in business learning

will challenge us in many respects, and creating an outcome measurement

system is pretty revolutionary also. There is a carrot out there, but there

are some risks associated with it. We will have to be active as a Senate,

be involved in this process and make sure that it works the way that it

should to benefit the university and to benefit Arizona.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Glick:

It will roughly be an increase of a couple of thousand dollars. If it is

really $2,000 per student for 40,000 students, then that is 80 million

dollars, which is a lot of money. If you say it is $1,000, that is only

forty million dollars. But even that would move us a long way.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: Is that based on F.T.E?</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Glick:

It really represents F.P.E (full paid enrollment). In fact this university,

I believe, can justifiably argue that it does more for the state than almost

any other, because I believe the faculty and staff here really do stretch

to do the best possible job. Just think of what they could do with some

more money. I would really like to think about how much more we could do

with a lot more money.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: I would like to direct your attention back to an issue that has

been before the Senate for the last several years, the Whistleblower policy.

As you know, we passed the ASU policy last year, and we thought we were

done with it. However, each year it seems, Carol Bernstein comes back with

a new bill from the AAUP group that threatens the tenure granting processes

on campus. I think it is our primary concern as faculty that our tenure

and promotion decisions be made by the university processes, and not by

some hearing-panel composed of people from the Department of Administration.

The legislation that has occurred for the last couple of years has attempted

to undermine the Regents and their responsibility for the universities,

and we find ourselves in a situation where we anticipate new legislation

again this year. The Arizona Board of Regents is attempting to preempt

that possibility by creating an umbrella policy on whistleblowing for the

three universities. I just bring this to your attention as an information

item. The background is that it is kind of an awkward situation for us

to be in. The Whistleblower legislation was created in order to minimize

corruption, irregularities, and fraud. To find ourselves against this legislation

is a bit awkward. The reason is that we need to create a policy that incorporates

good suggestions from all parties, but insures that the universities and

processes stay intact.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have asked

Mary Stevens, who is leading the policy drafting team for the Regents,

to identify a few of the issues they are facing. If you would like to be

involved in this process and give input, we will be working on this until

the spring.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.C ABOR

Whistleblower Report </b>(Associate General Counsel Mary Stevens).</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is fairly

good news, because the primary reason the ABOR is taking this on is remediation.

The three universities have developed policies, beginning with us. The

Senate took an active lead in the refining of that policy. The Board now

wants to develop a policy, which hopefully will deflect the coming legislation.

It is not related to whistleblowing per se, as much as it is related to

a larger issue: preserving the constitutional powers of the Board of Regents

under the state constitution. Any time the legislature has attempted to

intervene or limit the powers of the Regents in governing the universities,

the Board and the universities have always taken the position of not diluting

the power of the Regents in managing the universities. So, whistleblowing

is the most recent example of the legislature attempting to bring us into

the state system. We are not even under the state system; we are under

the Board of Regents system. It really is an important issue. We have taken

the lead and developed the policy for ASU and the other universities took

that as a model. Our policies are similar with some differences in language.

Now that we are at the Board level, they have decided to use our policy

as the model. Our role is to try to consolidate the three university policies

and present something to the Board that will be consistent with what we

already have. When you go to the Web and see the draft policy and compare

it to the current policy (ACD 204-07), you will see a lot of similarities.

There are two significant differences that I will present to you, and if

you have input I would welcome your ideas by email (mary.stevens@asu.edu).</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Whistleblower

law has four categories of whistleblowing information or disclosure. The

first is "violation of the law " (such as alleging a hazardous materials

violation, or an OSHA violation). A second category is "mismanagement undefined."

The third category is "gross waste of public monies." The fourth one is

"abuse of authority, undefined." When the university was developing its

policy several years ago--our first shot at it--we came up with an interpretation

that mismanagement was tied to gross waste of monies. We combined those

two, and we were criticized for not following the law because the law stated

four categories, and we had combined two, now making it three categories.

We now have a separate category of whistleblowing called "mismanagement."

Then we attempted to define it. If you have something better, please share

it with us. It is hard to define mismanagement in terms of whistleblowing.

Mismanagement is not, " I don?t like my managers style of management" or

"My manager does not smile at me in the morning." These can be the complaints

of employees, but they do not qualify as whistleblowing mismanagement.

When you see the policy, please review the definitions for abuse of authority,

violation of law, and gross waste of monies. You will see where we were

coming from. But if you can do better, let us know.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have made

another difference by adding timelines. Currently, if an employee wants

to make a whistleblower report, there is no timeline. It could even be

ten years after the fact, but that makes it difficult to investigate. We

have added a timeline of 45 days. You now have 45 days to make a whistleblower

report. After you have made a disclosure you do not have protection based

on making the report. A person receives protection if they suffer something

adverse as a direct result of making that report. Say for instance, you

do not receive tenure, are given a reprimand, or are terminated as a direct

result of making a whistleblower report, or you are subject to criticism,

or are subjected to some other adverse condition that takes place after

the whistleblower report. You then have 45 days to take steps to request

a hearing. There are other policies in the ACD that we wanted to model

with the timeline, such as the grievance policies and affirmative action

policies.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please read

and compare the two documents.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Cobas:

You mentioned several adverse consequences, but are these spelled out in

the policy?</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary Stevens:

The policy defines 12-13 actions, which could be considered adverse actions

for any category of employee.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: It is a delicate matter to protect the rights of everyone that

makes a disclosure without creating havoc within the university. One of

the things we are trying to document is not encouraging people to come

forward with unfounded items that might consume a lot of resources from

the university without being productive.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.D ASASU

President?s Report</b> (Alex Bainbridge).</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMMA has just

been released. Information Technology and ASASU are now providing students

with Web-based email (EMMA). You can examine the new program at http://www.asu.edu/EMMA.

My staff will be passing out a flyer to you today on using this system.

Please post them where students can see the flyers and speak to them in

your classes about this opportunity.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most all of

you have interactions with students on a daily basis. I want you to go

out there and identify your best students and encourage them to run for

ASASU government offices in the spring. Push them towards us literally.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Wednesday

we will have a question and answer day on Hayden Lawn from 10:00a.m.?2:00

p.m. Some of the executive officers and myself will be there to hand out

packets of information on student government opportunities.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.E Past

President?s Report</b> (David Burstein).</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legislative

receptions are winding down now. There are two more to go. The next to

the last reception is Tuesday night in Mesa, dealing with District 30 which

has Jay Blanchard, one of our own. The reception that we had just before

Thanksgiving holiday went very well, in Mesa, in District 29. It was probably

the best one that I have attended in the last two years, because of the

number of people and the diversity of people asking questions, and really

trying to push the legislators into giving answers. It really did go very

well. The last one will be next Wednesday, December 6, in Phoenix.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, how

many of you have signed on to ZsunDevils.com? Everyone in this Senate should

sign on in my view. It is free, and they do not bombard you with any literature.

If you have a question on how to sign up, just email me. That web site

will even give you a map of the upcoming receptions.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this semester

ends, my duties as Immediate Past President and as a sub for the current

President-elect will either end or die down. Although you will still hear

reports from me in the spring, they will not be quite the same as in the

past two and one-half years.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want you

to know that it has been an honor for me to be in this position, which

you bestowed on me. I would also hope that there are many of you who are

qualified to hold this position, and that some of you would consider running

for election as President-elect in the coming year.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is critical

to us as academics to have leadership that can represent us in a realistic

way, not just to ourselves, not just to the Regents, not just to the legislators,

not just to the alumni, not just to the students, not just to the retirees,

not just to the citizens of this state, but everyone. Because that is the

role that administration wants us to play, that is the role we will play.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: Let me see the hands again of those that have already signed on

the ZSunDevils web site. One of the things that we will have to do in the

spring is continue to exert some influence on the legislature in order

to get our budget approved. If you want our building renewal funds to be

funded at higher than 23%, we are going to have to exert some influence.

Probably the easiest way for some of us to do that is to use email. You

cannot use asu.edu, but on the Zsundevils site you are provided with a

non-university alternative that is easy to use. Dropping a note to your

representative is probably the most important thing you do during the spring.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.F ASU

West Senate Report</b> (Vince Waldron).</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two major issues

that we are addressing, which I will report on today: the passage of Prop

301 is one. This triggers funding for a new building at ASU West, which

was a part of our original plan that was developed ten years ago. People

on campus are actively starting to plan for that building, which is going

to add classroom space primarily, which we need badly during the nighttime

hours. We are completely full at night.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second

thing is that we are moving pretty rapidly, and with a lot of success I

think, in implementing a lower division curriculum. Quite a few students

have indicated interest. I think some 70-80 students are actually admitted

at this point, moving us toward our goal of 200 students, which is the

number we need to do things that concern us right now.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.G ASU

East Senate Report </b>(Gary Grossman).</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andy Jackson

gave me two announcements to make one of which David Burstein already covered.

That is, our legislative reception for District 30, if you happen to live

there. We had a very nice reception before the election, despite the fact

that the two candidates running for the house did not show up. It just

so happened that those two people won the election. We are going to watch

and see if they show up at the upcoming Coke Collection reception. If not,

we will have a love fest with our new senator-elect.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other announcement

was that we will have an Academic Assembly meeting on Wednesday, December

6. We are a committee of the whole; so in order to get people to show up

we have to have more than just announcements. What we have decided to do

is develop a theme-based assembly meeting. This year we are taking up Learner-Centered

Education. We have organized our topics within that concept. We have begun

a process of interviewing the faculty about what they think "Learner-Centered

Education" means. The meeting will be on December 6, at 11:00 a.m., in

the Technology Center Room 194.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: The East Campus is very active in the use of technology in instruction.

We look forward to being involved in that process. I plan to attend the

meeting on December 6.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.A Executive

Committee</b> (Doug Johnson).</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point

I would like to follow up on Provost Glick?s point about health care. Health

insurance is a big issue nationally. You probably saw the article in the

<i>Arizona

Republic</i> last week indicating significant increases in premiums are

to be expected. Nationally, this last year increases were running about

10%, and 15% next year is probably not out of the question. We got a shock

when the Department of Administration got bids to add chiropractic care

and big changes as far as people suing our HMO?s, to our current policy.

The bids came in at 60% over our current rates. That is pretty hard for

anybody to take. We are trying to do some damage control, and the Department

of Administration has decided to rebid the contract in hopes of attracting

more favorable bids. In doing that, they have decided that we need to go

with a higher co-pay structure, in order to come in with premiums that

would be affordable to a wide range of faculty. The basic strategy would

be for the state to cover the cost of the cheapest bid, or plan, in that

particular area, so we would get an affordable plan for all the faculty.

If you can afford it, you could buy more coverage and more flexibility

in the way you use your plan. The process is on fast track in order to

provide input to the state legislature. It is designed to happen during

January and February. Hopefully then, the result can be added to the budget

process. There is a nine-member task force that will select from the bidders.

We have been asked to submit nominations for representatives. Brad Kirkmann-Liff

is free to be one representative, or one name that goes forward, but there

are probably other faculty or staff who are good negotiators and who are

experienced in the health care area. If there are nominees, I would appreciate

your making that known to me in the very near future. You will hear more

about this throughout the coming year.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean Bernstein:

It is my understanding that the student health insurance is negotiated

separately from the faculty and staff health insurance. It is not clear

to me how or when the student health care plan is re-negotiated. I understand

that the rates have gone up about 15 to 20 percent each year. As you know

we are trying to carry all the cost of graduate health care insurance at

this time, so, it is extremely critical that we keep an eye on that. If

there is a way for this task force to also look at what has happened to

student health insurance that would be helpful.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: That is a good point to add. The RFP went out without it. Putting

that as an addendum may be a possibility, and we will look into that.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Glick:

Health insurance for faculty and staff is a state contract, and student

health is a university contract. They need to work together and Bianca?s

point is very important, but they need to be kept separated.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: It is clearly two separate contracts, but whether leverage could

be gained by combining them is an interesting issue. Bianca, are the NAU

and UofA policies combined with ours?</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean Bernstein:

They use the same vendors, but the rates slightly differ. The graduate

students have looked into possibly going in with other states, to get an

even better rate by bringing even more people into the system and possibly

combining with student groups in other states. No one has really paid attention

to this issue yet, but we have to keep a tab on this.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Chaudhuri:

As a point of information, some years ago we had a discussion on combining

and forming a separate academic group. Where are we now with that?</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: It is my understanding that we did have a consultant estimate

the contract, and it is not clear that we would have an advantage by doing

that. The responsiveness by DOA in this bidding process will be a determining

factor as to whether we reconsider the idea of separating ourselves out.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Carleton

Moore: I was very pleased to see that in your letter to the faculty in

the <i>Academic Senate Newsletter</i> you wrote on health insurance. I

put a lot of time and effort into thinking about this topic, and we put

two committees to work last year to study this and never had reports. The

basic question is that when we have health insurance, we have apples, bananas,

pears, and grapes. And everybody wants something different. The classical

anecdote is this?I spoke to a colleague when Fife Symington came in and

gave us the bad health insurance. He said which one did you pick? He said,

I didn?t have to pick because my wife works for a good company, U-Haul.

As you propose, we will have a faculty member go to attend the state committee.

The question is, does he or she really represent in some sense what people?s

interests are within the faculty, which I understand is greatly different

from the staff, in that all I am hearing is low price, low price, low price.

It doesn?t do you any good to have low price if the people in your family

die because of the low price. I for one personally prefer to have a medical

savings account. But we do not have that any more because not enough people

signed up for it.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: In order to get participation and involvement from a larger section

of people, one of the things we are planning on doing is forming an advisory

group to support that representative. I think the University Affairs Committee

report will contain some information relevant to your question about what

happened to the committees in the past.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Glick:

My impression is that Jon Rose?s efforts were to get a detailed broad survey

of the faculty and staff. I think that has been accomplished now. The downside

needs to be Carleton?s point. I think it emphasized more knowledge about

the options they had than the conditions. I think it would be worthwhile

to have Jon make a report. There is no doubt in my mind that university

faculty did set different priorities on their insurance, than that of state

employees as a whole.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: At the last University Affairs Committee meeting, Jon did present

an oral report. He is in the process of converting that to an executive

summary that would be accessible to the faculty. The current form of the

report is about 300 pages, which is not too easy to handle.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Grossman:

On this question I agree with Carleton. It is very wide spread. A question

has come up about the cost benefits of involvement in this. It is being

said, if we mobilize all of our resources and become an active player in

this process, what we will be able to do at best is marginally effect a

sequence of bad choices. Just as a strategic move, in theory, do we have

any mechanism at the university by which we can declare ourselves a group

independent of the State of Arizona, independent of the players, in order

to shape our policy?</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Glick:

The question of a separate group (either the universities together or ASU

as a separate group) has come up before. I think we could not unilaterally

declare ourselves a separate group apart from all state employees, but

given that most of the studies show that the expenditure cost is not much

different than the cost of state employees as a whole, and I think the

answer is state employees as a whole probably spend more on crises than

on overall care, and so it balances out. We could probably negotiate our

way out of the package. The thing which has most kept us from doing it,

other than just knowing whether we could pull it off, is that right now

if insurance rates go up, that part is going to be covered by the state

automatically which in turn gets added to the budget, without negotiation.

If we pull out from our own group, we have to know that when they decide

to put in another 2% into insurance for the state employees, we might get

it, but we would have to negotiate for it and that would probably come

at the cost of something else. So, we have been hesitant to go down that

road, a) because we may not succeed, and b) because it would allow the

state no longer to inflate our contribution upward. That does not mean

that we should not depart. I for one would rather pay more to get better

coverage. Brent, is that accurate? (Yes. That is very accurate).</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the

best solution for us is to put more effort into the state level and to

create a broader scope of options for us. If we can?t get broader options

(even if they cost more money), if not, then go separate.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Hal

Smith: I would like to reply to Carleton Moore. I am the faculty member

that has been regularly going down to the meetings. We do not have a lot

of impact on the policy process, but we do get to voice our concerns, and

I do that. One of the things that happened is that we had a very able administrator

that seemed to be on our side. He has just quit. We were getting good cooperation.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: That change in personnel has been one of our major concerns at

this point. It is very critical that we are represented in this area. So,

if you have nominations, please let me know.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Glick:

The Board has also recently hired a new person who came out of DOA. I don?t

know this person, but everyone that I talk to says that she is terrific

and really understands the benefits process.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: Cathy McGonigle is the Board HR person.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Glick:

She is going to be a much stronger proponent than the one in the past.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Brown:

This is an issue that we should bring up at the legislative receptions

because there will have to be some political decisions made at some point,

and you should remember that the Department of Administration are the ones

that gave us the alternative fuel scandal (much laughter here).</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.B Curriculum

and Academic Programs Committee</b> (Mike Mayer).</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.B.1 Senate

Motion #3 (2000-2001) was read: "A request from the College of Liberal

Arts and Sciences for the Implementation of an MA in Asian Languages and

Civilizations</b>." <b>Rationale: The program to be implemented at ASU

seeks to prominently prepare students for immediate entry to the job market

or for entrance to professional schools in such fields as law, business,

journalism, even medicine and engineering. It will aim to attract students

who seek a higher level of understanding of the language and culture of

Japan or China as a valuable asset in their professional careers. At the

same time, it will provide a strong start for those who eventually go on

to a doctoral program at another institution. In keeping with the idea

of advanced learning both inside and outside the classroom, all degree

candidates will be required to have spent at least one academic year residing

in the country of their specialization since their graduation from high

school.</b></font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had three

questions on this proposal at the November 13 Senate meeting, and I received

a note from Tim Wong who is the Professor of Chinese from the Center for

Asian Studies. As I understood the question, why Asian Studies rather than

East Asian, the idea behind this is that there is cross-fertilization between

languages. The proposers anticipate a time when another Asian language

program, which also includes languages of South East Asia, will be added

when the department grows sufficiently and begins to offer graduate degrees.

With respect to the one year requirement, they said they are not placing

conditions on the residency requirement, but it must be continuous, and

it must occur after graduation from high school. At some point we may have

to add further stipulations. The last question was about the relationship

between this program and Pacific American Asian Studies. That is essentially

American. The program deals only with Asian immigrants to the United States.

Our proposed program deals strictly with the study of Asia and is heavy

with requirements of the study of the language and culture of Asian countries,

beginning thousands of years before the New World was even discovered.

The two programs are very different, not like apples and oranges, more

like apples and elephants. Are there other questions?</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Singhal:

I am not opposed to the motion. I think it is a good idea. But I am concerned

about the language. On one hand it is labeled as Asian languages and civilizations.

But in the rationale, it emphasizes primarily Japan and China. I realize

Japan and China are strong areas at the university, but I wonder if we

are cutting ourselves off in terms of further development, by the discrepancy

in the language.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Mayer:

Is Dr. Wong here?</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tim Wong: That

was the number one question that I addressed. Being this is the first step;

it is not the final step. It anticipates any other Asian language, or minor

or major, which receives an appropriate level of enrollment. We will be

glad to add it to this program. That is why we used "Asian languages" rather

than East Asian languages, or Chinese, so that it would not be restrictive.</font>

West Campus?</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob Youngblood and

Tom Keating: We checked, and it does not conflict with anything at ASU

West. One of the things that we should point out is that ASU West has no

lower division offerings yet. They are still developing those courses.</font>

Motion #5 (2000-2001) was read:</b> <b>A request from the College of Liberal

Arts and Sciences for the Establishment of a Graduate Certificate in Statistics.

Rationale: The proposed certificate seeks to provide statistical training

for graduate students at ASU and professionals in the metro-Phoenix area.

Statistical analysis is one of the primary tools of modern scientific reasoning.

Since the need to draw correct and defensible conclusions from data arises

so widely, statistical techniques are useful in almost all disciplines.

There is a consequent demand for professionals who are well educated in

statistics, and the demand is growing. The proposed certificate seeks to

address this need. In particular, the goal is to provide an opportunity

for students to enhance their ability to apply statistics in their chosen

field of expertise.</b></font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Mayer:

Two questions were raised with respect to that. One was the interdisciplinary

aspect. The committee that is in charge of the Interdisciplinary Master

of Science in Statistics Program reports to the Graduate College, and it

involves statistics faculty from Economics, Mathematics, Industrial Engineering,

Biology, Accounting and Supply Chain Management. So, there is one program

composed of faculty from three colleges and six departments. This certificate

fits in well with the MS program for students who are interested in applications

and data analysis, and they do not have as much academic background as

required for an MS in statistics. It was asked if this program will be

extended to other departments. It may in the future, but right now they

will use the core of faculty from the committee in charge of the Multidisciplinary

MS that reports to the Graduate College.</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President

Johnson: I want to thank Dick Burdick who came to represent the statistics

group. Is there further discussion of this motion?</font>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Moorhead:

Since this is interdisciplinary, why does it say it comes from the College

of Liberal Arts? (It really originates in the Graduate College. It was

a mistake on the motion.).</font>
