      <h2 align="left"><strong><em>L. William Seidman Research Institute Director Retires: </em></strong><strong>Tim Hogan Tracked Arizona Economy For More Than 30 Years </strong></h2>
      <p>Dr. Timothy D. Hogan, professor of economics and director of the L. William Seidman Research Institute, is retiring after more than 30 years tracking the growth of the Arizona economy. </p>
      <p>Hogan joined the economics faculty at the W. P. Carey School of Business in 1970 and a year later began his affiliation with what would become the L. Seidman Research Institute, which encompasses the eight research centers at the W. P. Carey School. In 1987 he became the director of the Center for Business Research, and in 1995 he was named director of the institute. </p>
      <p>"Tim Hogan's work at the W. P. Carey School defines an era, a period when he set his own very high personal standards for applied economic research," said Lee McPheters, associate dean for executive and professional programs and director of the Bank One Economic Outlook Center. "His applied research work on a whole range of topics and his talent for economic analysis created a bridge from Arizona State University to the community and the state." </p>
      <p>Hogan's early projects included the metropolitan Phoenix consumer price index and a joint endeavor with the Arizona Real Estate Center to gather construction and building permit information. He has also provided data and analysis on transportation in the state. </p>
      <p>In recent years, Hogan was co-investigator with Professor Stephen Happel on what has become known as "the snowbird study." The survey is an important source of information about the annual migration of part-time residents and is eagerly anticipated each spring by the tourism and property management industry. </p>
      <p>Hogan also played a key role in helping leaders evaluate the value of the state's industries and events through the development of economic impact studies. The reports covered the Super Bowl, the Fiesta Bowl, the golf industry, the high technology manufacturing sector, and more. Some of these studies were conducted with the Arizona Department of Commerce. </p>
      <p>&quot;The thing that we at the Department of Commerce appreciate the most about Tim Hogan is that he clearly understands the need for balance and credibility in conducting economic and policy analyses," said Lisa Danka, executive director of the state's Commerce and Economic Development Commission. "Tim was always willing to do whatever was necessary to meet this goal: if we needed additional research, he did it; if we needed to tear the numbers apart, he was ready. His main concern was producing the best analysis possible. That's professional integrity.&quot; </p>
      <p>Tracy Clark, associate director of the Bank One Economic Outlook Center in the Seidman Research Institute, said "Tim's contribution has been a clear vision of what's important for the university to do in helping the community develop a strong economy. He is a good friend and an easy person to work with - always open to other points of view. His departure leaves a big hole." </p>
      <p>Hogan was born in Phoenix and grew up in northern California. He began his study of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a bachelor's degree. He pursued the discipline at the University of California, Davis, where he earned a master's degree, and at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, where he completed his Ph.D. He and his wife, Kathy, have three grown sons. </p>
      <p align="center" class="style1 style1">W. P. Carey School of Business </p>
      <p class="style1 style1">The L. William Seidman Research Institute in the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University is an affiliation of eight research centers that serves as a link between the local, state, national and international business communities and the creative and intellectual resources of the nationally ranked W. P. Carey School of Business. </p>
