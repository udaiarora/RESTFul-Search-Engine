Pico Overview &amp; Quick Reference
</center></h2>
<p>
Pico is a simple, easy-to-use text editor with a layout very
similar to Pine mail. A status line at the top of the display
shows pico's version, the current file being edited and 
whether or not there are outstanding modifications that have
not been saved.  The third line from the bottom is used to
report informational messages and for additional command
input.   The bottom two lines list the available editing
commands.
<p>
Each character typed is automatically inserted into a
buffer (temporary file space) at the current cursor position.
Editing commands and cursor  movement (besides arrow keys)
are given to pico by typing special control-key sequences.
A caret ^ is used to represent the control key, sometimes
labeled CTRL on a keyboard. The CTRL-q key combination is 
written as ^Q.  This sequence is typed by first pressing
down the Control key and while still pressing Control,
type the specified letter key.  Then release both keys.
<p>
Pico also provides simple search capability, spell checking,
cut/paste, and other basic functions including access to
directory and file information.
<p><h3>
Creating a New File
</h3>
To start the pico editor to edit a new file, type (in
lowercase):
<p><b>
    pico
</b>
After typing in the contents, save the file by typing ^O
(control key and letter O sequence) to write out a copy
from the buffer. You will be asked to provide a filename
Type a valid name in the highlighted space and press the
Return key. The file will be saved in your disk space.
<p>
To exit the pico editor, type ^X  (hold down the control
key and press the x key.
<p>
<h3>
Editing an Existing File
</h3><p>
To start the pico editor and edit an existing file you
may type:
<p>
    pico filename
<p>
where 'filename' is the name of the file to be edited
such as:<p>

    pico  dinosaurs
<p>
You may also select files to edit when you are already
in pico by using the ^R (Read File) command. Another
command, ^T lists your existing files and directories
from which you can choose to edit, copy, delete,or browse
by typing the corresponding letter listed at the bottom
of the display.
<p>
Save your changes by typing ^O (control-letter O sequence)
to write out a copy from the buffer. You will be asked if
you want to save the changes using the current filename or
provide a new filename. If you want to change the name,
type a valid name in the highlighted bar and press the
Return key.  The file will be saved in your user disk
space. Note it's not necessary to type the entire path;
just the filename.
<p>
To exit the pico editor, type ^X  (hold down the control
key and type the x key. If you don't want to save changes
skip the ^O and just exit with ^X.
<p><h3>

</h3>
The following functions are available in pico. Where
applicable, the corresponding function key commands are
given in parentheses ().
<p><pre>
^G (F1)   DISPLAY this HELP text.
^F        MOVE FORWARD a character.
^B        MOVE BACKWARD a character.
^P        MOVE to the PREVIOUS LINE.
^N        MOVE to the NEXT LINE
^A        MOVE to the BEGINNING of the CURRENT LINE.
^E        MOVE to the END of the CURRENT LINE
^V (F8)   MOVE FORWARD a PAGE of text.
^Y (F7)   MOVE BACKWARD a PAGE of text.
^W (F6)   SEARCH for (where is) text, neglecting case.

^^        MARK cursor position as beginning of selected

          the text.

</pre>
<p><h3>
Suggestions for New pico Users
</h3><ul>
<li>Practice using pico. Create a small file you can delete
  later to get use to the commands and cursor movements.

<li>Make a copy of any important file BEFORE you edit to
  avoid undesirable outcomes.

<li>if you anticipate a long editing session or many changes,
  SAVE your file (^O) frequently.

<li>When the computer system is busy, pico may not respond
  immediately when you type a command or use the arrow
  keys to move the cursor around your file.  Be patient
  and give pico a chance. If you continue typing commands,
  the situation will just get worse!  Sometimes taking
  a break from your computer session is the best move.
<p><h4>
Notes for pico Users Coming from a Mac or PC
</h4>
<li>pico uses ^C (control C) to terminate commands. Mac & PC
  communication packages (e.g. MacTCP, ASUKerm) may allow
  the interrupt sequence to be defined by the user. If you
  have trouble in pico when using ^C to end commands, e.g.
  you are thrown out of the editor, please check your local
  communications package and terminal settings.
