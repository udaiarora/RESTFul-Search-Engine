               <p>  <strong> MAJOR IMMINENT FLOODING: </strong></p>

               <p> Major flooding on campus would be the result of catastrophic dam failure or extraordinary releases by Salt River Project (SRP) along the Salt/Verde system. In either case, flood travel time to the ASU Tempe campus would be approximately 6.5 to 8.5 hours. Maximum flood depth is estimated to be 37 feet.</p>

               <ul>

                 <li> Evacuate from campus immediately. See &ldquo;<strong>EVACUATION</strong>&rdquo; section of this guide. </li>

                 <li> Follow instructions from the ASU Police Department for immediate action. </li>

                 <li> Use extreme caution around appliances or outlets near the leak and/or water. </li>

        </ul>

               <p><strong> MINOR IMMINENT FLOODING: </strong></p>

               <p> Minor or area flooding of campus is a more likely scenario. This could be the result of major, multiple rainstorms, or a water line break. In the case of imminent minor, weather-related flooding, ASU Police Department will monitor the National Weather Service and other emergency advisories to determine necessary action such as evacuation of areas and cancellation of classes. In cases of water main failure, affected areas of campus would need to be evacuated immediately. In this case, refer to the &quot;<strong>EVACUATION</strong>&quot; section of this guide.</p>

               <ul>

                 <li> Notify the ASU Police Department at (480) 965-3456. </li>

                 <li> Secure vital equipment, records, and chemicals (move to higher, safer ground). Shut off all electrical equipment. Secure all laboratory experiments. When able, notify the Facilities Management Service Center at (480) 965-3633. </li>

                 <li> Wait for instructions from the ASU Police Department for immediate action. </li>

                 <li> Do not return to your building unless you have been instructed to do so by someone from incident command or the ASU Police Department. </li>
