      <h2>Daniel Arreola wins national Jackson Prize for literary work</h2>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/arreola_bookaward_041003.jpg" width="74" height="107" align="right">        ASU geography professor Daniel D. Arreola was recently awarded the John
          Brinckerhoff Jackson Prize for his book "Tejano South Texas," published
        by the University of Texas Press, 2002.</p>
      <p>The Jackson Prize for Popular
            Books in American Human Geography is awarded by the Association of
            American Geographers to the author of a popular
          book of scholarly and literary merit on the human geography of the
        United States, one that interprets geographical scholarship in language
        that
          nonprofessional readers can appreciate and enjoy. The prize is restricted
          to books written by geographers, with preference given to those by
        United States citizens or permanent residents. Special consideration
        is given
          to books that are carefully designed, appropriately illustrated, and
          physically appealing.</p>
      <p>In his book, Arreola charts the many ways in which
          Texans of Mexican ancestry have established a cultural province in
        the Texas-Mexico borderland
          that is unlike any other Mexican American region. Arreola's approach
          combines historical perspective with contemporary assessment. Some
        issues discussed and illustrated include regional distinctiveness of
        Texas Mexican
          heritage, specific cultural celebrations and behaviors, and distinctive
          architectural aspects of town founding and layout in South Texas.</p>
      <p>"For
        example, I did an analysis of Hispanic surnames by comparing those found
        in the telephone directory for San Antonio with surnames found
        in a directory for Los Angeles," Arreola says. "There are some dozen
        surnames common in San Antonio like Garza, Trevi&ntilde;o, Villareal
        and Cant&uacute; that are rare in Los Angeles. The surnames in San Antonio
        are what I would consider Tejano surnames and thus identify Texans of
        Mexican ancestry. Furthermore, this ancestry is geographically connected
        to areas of northeastern Mexico, states like Nuevo Le&oacute;n and Tamaulipas,
        where there are also many with surnames like Garza and Cant&uacute;.
        In comparison many Hispanic surnames in Los Angeles are geographically
        linked to states like Jalisco and Michoac&aacute;n in western Mexico."</p>
      <p>Moving
          into the present, Arreola examines many factors that make South Texas
          distinctive from other Mexican American regions - the physical
          spaces of ranchos, plazas, barrios and colonias; the cultural life
        of the small towns and the cities of San Antonio and Laredo; and the
        foods,
          public celebrations and political attitudes that characterize the region.</p>
      <p>Arreola
          says this evidence suggests that the Mexican populations found today
          in regions in the United States have different place origins in
          the homeland of Mexico. </p>
      <p>"As Mexican American populations evolved in separate
          regions of the United States so too did they create varied regional
        traditions that combine
          their homeland culture from Mexico with their present regional culture
          in the United States," he says.<br>
        Arreola says researching and writing this book required long commitment
          to a single project. </p>
      <p>"This one evolved over a decade," he says. </p>
      <p>"Dozens of visits to South
          Texas - some short, some extended, interviews with key informants,
        research in archives and repositories, and field
          observation and documentation are just some of the necessary steps
        in this type of project. This leads to a kind of obligation between a
        geographer
          and the place and region investigated. I believe this type of geography
          is necessary to tell the story of a people and a place, and the rewards
          can be considerable because one learns how people shape a place creating
          what some have termed regional personality. 'Tejano South Texas' is
        one such regional personality."</p>
