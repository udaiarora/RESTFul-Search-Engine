          <p>March 31, 2005 </p>
          <h2> Fulton School makes progress on lofty goals</h2>
          <p> A little more than two years ago, the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering set out to realize its vision of being a world-ranked institution. </p>
          <p> The school had these goals: </p>
          <p> &bull; To be known for producing a creative, entrepreneurial and technical work force. </p>
          <p> &bull; To be a driving force for change and economic growth in the community. </p>
          <p> &bull; To deliver use-inspired research for the benefit of individuals, companies, institutions and the environment. </p>
          <p> With this vision, the Fulton School has set some challenging goals to achieve the New American University ideals, and some of these goals are being accomplished rapidly. </p>
          <p> One such goal is an increase in the quality of faculty working within the school. The number of National Academy of Engineering (NAE) members within the school is a key measure of that success, with NAE membership being one of the highest distinctions accorded an engineer. </p>
          <p> The number of NAE faculty members in the Fulton School of Engineering rose from two &ndash; Gerald Heydt and James Mayer &ndash; to seven in two years. Subhash Mahajan, professor and chair of the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, was elected to the academy in February of this year. In addition, four other NAE members recently joined ASU and the Fulton School. They include: </p>
          <p> &bull; Ronald Adrian, faculty member in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. </p>
          <p> &bull; John Crittenden and Bruce Rittmann, faculty members in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. </p>
          <p> &bull; Vijay Vittal, faculty member in the Department of Electrical Engineering. </p>
          <p> Also, NAE members Rustum Roy and John Rowell are regular visitors to the school and significantly add to the total faculty strength. </p>
          <p> The Fulton School has found success in developing and attracting the highest quality faculty and has moved forward on improving the student-to-faculty ratio. Additionally, the Department of Strategic Initiatives in the Fulton School is attracting some of the best undergraduate and graduate engineering students from around the country through fellowships, scholarships and additional research funding for exemplary students. </p>
          <p> The Fulton School&rsquo;s Entrepreneurial Programs department also has made headway. Under new leadership, Entrepreneurial Programs has become a heavy supporter of the Edson Student Entrepreneur Initiative and the Innovation Space design studio. Fulton School engineering students continue to produce creative, economically viable ideas that they are building into successful businesses through these supportive and trailblazing programs. In addition, the curriculum in the Fulton School is being tailored to develop the &ldquo;Fulton Engineer&rdquo; entrepreneurial spirit, leadership qualities and cultural understanding, building on the more traditional strengths that have characterized the school for nearly 50 years. </p>
          <p> Distance learning programs are allowing professionals and continuing students to obtain degrees and certificates from the Fulton School online. The Center for Professional Development manages 39 classes, five degree programs and three certificate programs offered to students across the globe. The center also provides in-person certificate training to executives at some of the largest companies around the world. These programs provide key links to the strategic technological industries of the future. </p>
          <p> These links also are being built in ASU&rsquo;s backyard. Research dollars in the Fulton School are increasing by the millions, and partnerships with industry and government are allowing new technologies to be born. The Flexible Display Center is a good example of this. With a $43.7 million grant from the Army and partnerships with local industry such as Motorola, who gave a building and equipment to the cause, Fulton School faculty are creating the flexible display technology of the future. </p>
          <p> All of these improvements have been made possible thanks to Dean Peter Crouch&rsquo;s strategic vision and through investor support &ndash; particularly from Ira A. Fulton, who has contributed an endowment of $50 million to the school and created a matching alumni donation program that has generated more than $500,000 for these types of programs.</p>
