      <h2>High profile mathematical epidemiologist equally serious about mentoring </h2>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/Castillo-Chavez_120103.jpg" alt="Carlos Castillo-Chavez" width="144" height="200" align="right">When Carlos Castillo-Chavez arrives at Arizona State University in January,
        he will bring a lot of accomplishment and energy with him. Joining the
        Department of Mathematics and Statistics as the Joaquin Bustoz, Jr. Professor
        of Mathematical Biology, Castillo-Chavez is a prominent mathematical
        epidemiologist whose research was featured in the national news during
        last year's SARS epidemic. He is also the past recipient of numerous
        national awards, including being recently named Los Alamos National Laboratory's
        prestigious Ulam Distinguished Scholar, and winning the Tapia Diversity
        in Computing Award (both in 2003).</p>
      <p>However, Castillo-Chavez is bringing more than his reputation to ASU.
        Also coming with him is a group of minority graduate students that he
        recruited as undergraduates and mentored in his past position at Cornell
        University and that he will continue to mentor in Arizona. In fact, these
        students have followed him not just from university to university, but
        through a one-year research residency at the Los Alamos National Laboratory
        as well.</p>
      <p>Castillo-Chavez has such a significant following because, in addition
        to being a prominent researcher, he is also well known for developing
        programs to encourage minority participation in science. At Cornell,
        where he was a professor in the departments of Biological Statistics
        and Computational Biology and Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, he was
        the director of the Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute (MTBI),
        an undergraduate research institute with a larger purpose. </p>
      <p>Founded by Castillo-Chavez, MTBI is a program designed "to encourage
        undergraduates to pursue advanced degrees in math and sciences and to
        facilitate the access to graduate studies for minority students in the
        sciences." MBTI does this through a training program that includes a
        series of small group research projects, mentored by faculty scientists
        and guided by Castillo-Chavez, who is both recruiting students for science
        and also preparing them for the next step - successful graduate careers.
        The institute will be moving with him to ASU where it will expand its
        mission by including a mentorship graduate program in computational,
        mathematical and theoretical biology.</p>
      <p>One indication of the effectiveness of MTBI is the success of the students
        who have been mentored through the program. Gerardo Chowell, an MBTI
        participant and one of Castillo-Chavez's current graduate students, will
        soon a Presidential Youth Award from the government of Mexico. On November
        23, Castillo-Chavez and Chowell will fly to Mexico City where Chowell
        will receive the award at Los Pinos, the home of Mexican President, Vicente
        Fox. </p>
      <p>Castillo-Chavez's strong interest in mentoring comes out of what he
        sees as a need to diversify the professional ranks in the math and science
        disciplines. "Nationally, the representation of minorities is a tragedy,"
        he said. "Last year there were about 1200 people getting doctorates in
        mathematical sciences, a group that included 30 under-represented minorities.
        My personal goal is to increase their representation by at least 50%."</p>
      <p>Prime among the reasons Castillo-Chavez decided to move to ASU is a
        climate that he perceives as being favorable to his major interests.
        "I've been recruited and tried to move to ASU for the past 11 years,"
        he said. "ASU has a very talented group of mathematical biologists who
        have been my friends for a long time." Regarding the recent tragic loss
        of Professor Joaquin Bustoz, Jr. he added, "His presence and leadership
        at ASU as well as his deep contributions and commitment to the training
        and mentorship of minority students were also a key factor in my decision
        to move. The legacy of his work is now a source of inspiration and strength
        as we try to continue Joaquin's work." </p>
      <p>Explaining why he would choose to leave an Ivy league institution for
        a large public university, Castillo-Chavez said, "I have always wanted
        to be at a school that was more accessible to people from all backgrounds.
        ASU has a mission to reach out to the Native American and Hispanic population,
        and I am sure that my institute and its programs will make a difference."</p>
      <p>Castillo-Chavez has received numerous national awards for his research
        and for his efforts to expand social participation in science and mathematics.
        The list includes the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics
        and Engineering Mentoring, given by President Clinton in 1997; the Faculty
        Fellowship Award (1992-97), given by President Bush; the 2001 Distinguished
        Scientist Award, given by the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos
        and Native Americans in Science; and the QEM Mathematics, Science and
        Engineering Network 2000 Giants in Science Award.</p>
      <p>In his research, Castillo-Chavez is an authority on the fields of theoretical,
        mathematical and computational epidemiology. He is finishing a year-long
        residency as the 2003 Stanislaw M. Ulam Distinguished Scholar at the
        Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where
        he has been working on a variety of projects, including influenza dynamics,
        dengue fever evolution, homeland security and the study of epidemics
        on networks. </p>
      <p>During last year's SARS epidemic, Castillo-Chavez had an opportunity
        to show how accurate his mathematical models can be. A model that he
        and his students developed of the outbreak of the disease in Toronto
        accurately predicted the number of cases while identifying the relative
        magnitude changes in diagnostic and isolation rates required to control
        an outbreak. The model showed that if the Canadians had not immediately
        isolated those infected, the number of victims would have been much higher
        - perhaps as many as 200,000. A feature article in the Washington Post
        noted the significance of the finding.</p>
      <p>Castillo-Chavez has co-authored or edited five books and more than one
        hundred articles. His most recent book is an edited volume (with Tom
        Banks) entitled Bioterrorism: Mathematical Modeling Applications in Homeland
        Security, which will appear this December in the SIAM Series, Frontiers
        in Applied Mathematics.</p>
