      <h2>Regents discuss modification of financial aid, admissions</h2>
      <p> Tuition, financial aid and admission dominated the discussion for the 
        Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) meeting Jan. 23 - 24 in Tucson. The three 
        issues are central to the board's Changing Directions Initiative, a move 
        to allow each of the state's three universities to seek its own identity, 
        while increasing accessibility to higher education.</p>
      <p>ABOR President Jack Jewett of Tucson, says as the board moves toward 
        increasing each university's distinctive quality, its overriding goal 
        is to make higher education more inclusive, improve the state's student 
        success rates and meet Arizona's work force needs. These goals can be 
        accomplished if universities are allowed greater flexibility to play a 
        more centralized role in determining the institution's policy and outcomes.</p>
      <p>The board reviewed two likely admission policy scenarios during its study 
        session in preparation for writing a new admissions policy to support 
        the differentiation initiative. Jewett said the new policy would be ready 
        for review at the March 6 - 7 meeting.</p>
      <p>The first scenario is nearly identical to the current admissions policy. 
        It ensures access at one of the state universities for the top 25 percent 
        of all entering resident freshmen based on class rank or a 3.0 grade-point 
        average or scoring exceptionally on a college entrance exam, if the student 
        has no more than one required course deficiency. No required course deficiencies 
        are allowed by the current policy. <br>
        Arizona high school graduates ranking in at least the top 50 percent with 
        at least a C-plus grade-point average may also be admitted to a state 
        university on a case-by-case basis under the current ABOR policy. It mirrors 
        the proposed policies in each scenario.</p>
      <p>While the second scenario - which was endorsed by the university presidents 
        - closely patterns the first scenario's admissions criteria, it puts the 
        admission decision-making and accountability measures in the hands of 
        the universities. <br>
        ASU President Michael Crow said this flexibility allows universities to 
        be more inclusive to Arizona students by considering various individualized 
        factors such as a student's leadership characteristics, special abilities 
        and talents and their drive for success, while controlling for grade inflation. 
        By having more control in the admissions decision-making, the universities 
        also have more control in determining their retention and graduation rates, 
        he said.</p>
      <p>"ASU can focus its energy on admitting most students in the top half 
        of the high school graduating class into programs where they will be academically 
        successful as long as there are tuition levels to generate revenues robust 
        enough to maintain quality, continuous and dependable funding by the state 
        legislature for enrollment growth and adequate funding available to expand 
        ASU's academic facilities to accommodate growth," Crow said.</p>
      <p>The board also heard new language modifying its current policy to set 
        aside need-based student financial aid received from tuition revenues. 
        The new policy increases need-based financial aid from 8 percent at ASU 
        and UA, and 9 percent at NAU, to 14 percent. The additional need-based 
        financial aid is intended to offset the impact resulting from any significant 
        tuition increase.</p>
      <p>"It will take more revenue than is provided by this set- aside to accomplish 
        individual university or board goals for financial aid," said Jewett. 
        "There is a lot we can do, but we can't do it all (at a board level). 
        The state must also step in and do its part."<br>
        The board is expected to approve the modified financial aid policy during 
        its March meeting.</p>
      <p>In other action, the ABOR:</p>
      <p>. Voted to set undergraduate and graduate tuition for the 2003 - 04 academic 
        year during its March 6 - 7 meeting at ASU. During the meeting, residence 
        halls rates and undergraduate fees will also be set. Graduate program 
        fees will be set April 24 - 25 in Tucson.</p>
      <p>. Gave its consent for a $90,000 per year, multi-year employment contract 
        for Head Softball Coach Linda Wells through June 2005. Wells' salary was 
        based on her experience and success with the softball program. She has 
        been head coach for 27 years, 13 years of which have been at ASU. Wells' 
        salary will be paid entirely from revenue generated by the intercollegiate 
        athletics department.</p>
      <p>. Consented to offer ASU Head Women's Golf Coach Melissa McNamara a $70,000 
        annual, multi-year employment contract through June 2005. The board agreed 
        to raise the annual salary on July 1 and on each consecutive July 1 thereafter 
        in percentage increments depending on achievement and performance milestones. 
        McNamara's salary will be paid entirely from revenue generated by the 
        intercollegiate athletics department.</p>
      <p>. Is considering a policy revision to allow tuition waivers and remissions 
        for graduate teaching and research assistants and associates. The proposed 
        policy change would allow universities to treat tuition waivers and remissions 
        as tax-exempt compensation while permitting the institutions to properly 
        charge tuition benefits to federal grants or contracts. </p>
