      <h2>Annual report finds large firms becoming dominant force in for-profit 
        education</h2>
      <p> The 2002-2003 Profiles of For-Profit Education Management Companies 
        released today by Arizona State University's Education Policy Studies 
        Laboratory finds that large education management organizations (EMOs) 
        dominate the industry. </p>
      <p> The report also documents a strong shift toward the for-profit management 
        of charter schools. Of 417 for-profit schools listed in the directory, 
        320 (77 percent) were identified as charter schools. </p>
      <p> Large EMOs (operating 10 or more schools) accounted for approximately 
        78 percent of EMO-managed schools and 88 percent of enrolled students. 
        In contrast, although small- (3 or fewer schools) and medium-size (4 to 
        9 schools) EMOs together made up 79 percent of all profiled EMOs, they 
        account for only 22 percent of the schools and 12 percent of the students 
        enrolled in for-profit schools. </p>
      <p> Large EMOs averaged 512 students per school, medium-sized EMOs averaged 
        283 students, while small EMOs averaged 220 students per school. All of 
        the schools in the medium and small EMO categories were charter schools, 
        while 70 percent of schools in the large category were charter schools. 
      </p>
      <p>Many Arizona Charter Schools Run For Profit </p>
      <p> States such as Arizona and Michigan with the most-permissive charter 
        school laws tend to have the most schools managed by for-profit companies. 
        The authors found Arizona and Michigan account for nearly half of all 
        schools managed or operated by EMOs. While nationally about 12 percent 
        of all charter schools are managed by for-profit EMOs, an estimated 19 
        percent of Arizona's charter schools are operated by EMOs. </p>
      <p> The fifth annual Profiles of For-Profit Education Management Companies 
        is the most comprehensive resource on the for-profit education management 
        industry. The report found that 47 management companies operate in 24 
        states and the District of Columbia, enrolling some 190,000 students. 
        An overwhelming majority of those schools are public charter schools. 
      </p>
      <p>EMO Management Is Controversial </p>
      <p> According to EPSL director Alex Molnar, &quot;Publicly funded schools 
        run by education management companies on a for-profit basis are a controversial 
        innovation intended to improve schools through the profit-seeking motive 
        of the marketplace. However, profitability continues to be an elusive 
        goal for many EMOs. The consensus view of investors, researchers, and 
        others is that the evidence thus far is insufficient to demonstrate that 
        the quality of education is improved or that private management companies 
        can profitably manage schools.&quot; </p>
      <p> The annual directory includes information about companies contracted 
        by school districts to manage existing traditional public schools, companies 
        that manage public charter schools, and companies that do both. The researchers 
        compiled the data from company survey responses, company websites, state 
        department of education websites, newspaper articles, company press releases, 
        government publications, and other sources. </p>
      <p>The Commercialism in Education Research Unit (CERU) conducts research, 
        disseminates information, and helps facilitate a dialogue between the 
        education community, policy makers, and the public at large about commercial 
        activities in schools. CERU is the only national academic research center 
        dedicated to schoolhouse commercialism. </p>
      <p>Visit the CERU website at http://schoolcommercialism.org/ </p>
      <p>The Education Policy Studies Laboratory (EPSL) at Arizona State University 
        offers high quality analyses of national education policy issues and provides 
        an analytical resource for educators, journalists, and citizens. It includes 
        the Commercialism in Education Research Unit (CERU), the Education Policy 
        Analysis Archives (EPAA), the Education Policy Reports Project (EPRP), 
        the Education Policy Research Unit (EPRU), and the Language Policy Research 
        Unit (LPRU). The EPSL is directed by ASU Professor Alex Molnar. </p>
