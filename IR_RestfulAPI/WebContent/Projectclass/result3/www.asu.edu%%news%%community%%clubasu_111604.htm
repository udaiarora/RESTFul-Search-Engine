      <h2>Club ASU sparks enthusiasm, interest among community members</h2>
      <p> In its first year, Club ASU has made a significant impact by introducing and welcoming the community to ASU. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;This has been an incredible year for Club ASU,&rdquo; says Anna Wales, Club ASU&rsquo;s program coordinator senior. &ldquo;The response for the program has been so amazing. The community and schools have enjoyed their experiences on campus so much that we are receiving calls and e-mails daily asking how they can join.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> Club ASU under ASU&rsquo;s Office of Public Affairs and in collaboration with Undergraduate Admissions, Intercollegiate Athletics, and other university programs, invites young people from all over the state of Arizona to visit the university and get involved in the diverse campus life. Once enrolled, participants are given special opportunities to experience programs and events at ASU, for free or at a reduced cost. Some of the opportunities for club members include athletic events, public events and leadership activities. </p>
      <p> So far, Club ASU has brought in guests from more than 98 different schools and community groups. Wales says it&rsquo;s been a rewarding experience for everyone involved. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;Most of our guests have never been on a large university campus before,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The events provide a non-intimidating and fun atmosphere where students and their families can feel excited about education. Their excitement is contagious.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> On Nov. 13, Club ASU is hosting a diverse group of guests for ASU&rsquo;s last home football game of the season, a contest against Washington State . The group includes 500 students and guests from the Yuma Marine Corps Air Station, San Luis, Somerton, Chicanos Por La Causa (Thew Elementary), Udall and HomeBase Youth Services. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;We hope our group learns more about ASU and really gets a chance to experience what the campus has to offer them,&rdquo; says Tom Pivonka, senior director of quality for HomeBase Youth Services. &ldquo;An ultimate goal for our youth is for them to stay inspired and on track, and to further their education.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> HomeBase Youth Services (http://www.hbys.com/) is an Arizona-based nonprofit agency founded in 1991 to address the growing needs of homeless and runaway youth in Arizona , between the ages of 18 and 21. Programs include Prevention; Project Safe Place ; Street Outreach; Medical Outreach; Transitional Living Program; Independent Living Program; and a Learning Center for street youths to earn their GEDs. </p>
      <p> Pivonka says developing community partnerships through programs like Club ASU is vital to the success of their youth participants. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;We depend on partnerships such as this,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We have worked with ASU through the homeless legal assistance program and with the W. P. Carey School of Business. It&rsquo;s very important that we work with other agencies that also have people that are close to their age. The connection is stronger and the messages really stay with them.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> Club ASU plans to continue developing additional opportunities for community involvement. Wales says Club ASU is now implementing a parent component as a part of their registration process. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;We are hoping to serve an important role for the whole family,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Parents will receive postcards letting them know about Club ASU workshops or programs designed specifically for them. We are also increasing our contact with current members.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> To find out more about Club ASU, visit the Web at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/clubasu/">(http://www.asu.edu/clubasu/</a>). </p>
