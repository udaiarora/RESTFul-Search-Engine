Round-reel &amp; Cartridge Tape Access
</center></h2>
<p>
The ftp utility is used, albeit indirectly, for UNIX access to data on
round-reel and 3480-cartridge tapes.  Both IBM and non-IBM tapes can be
processed, provided the tapes are not recorded in a system-specific
format or are in a format compatible with IBM MVS processing.
<p>
Since ftp cannot directly access tape files, the tape files must be
copied to disk before ftp can access them.  From UNIX, ftp is used to
submit an MVS batch job to copy the tape files to MVS disk, then ftp is
used to transfer the files from MVS disk to UNIX.  (Note:  This process
can be used from any system having ftp access.  You also have the option
of logging on to the MVS system with TSO, submitting the batch job, and
then use TSO's ftp command to transfer the data.)
<p>
The creation and submission of the batch job is not an automated
process.  You need to create a UNIX file containing the JCL for an IBM
MVS batch job, use ftp to submit the batch job, and then (after the
batch job completes) use ftp to retrieve the files.
<p>
The process to retrieve data from tape via the ftp utility consists of
the following steps or commands:
<pre>
  a) put the tape in the tape library
  b) create the batch job JCL
  c) connect to the IBM MVS system:         ftp acmvs.inre.asu.edu
  d) point at MVS batch queues:             site filetype=jes
  e) submit the batch job:                  put batchfile
  f) monitor the batch job:                 dir
  g) retrieve the batch job output:         get jobid.x
  h) point at disk volumes:                 site filetype=seq
  i) get the file:                          get remote.file local.file
  j) terminate the ftp utility:             quit
</pre><p>
Step a:  Check the tape into the tape library (ECB-130).  The tape
facilities of the IBM MVS system are used for accessing data on tape
from UNIX.
<p>
Step b:  Use an editor to create a UNIX file containing the MVS batch
job.  The batch job should include any JCL needed to retrieve the data
from tape and to write it on MVS disk in a format suitable for
subsequent transfer via ftp.
<p>
The batch job must contain a fully specified JOB statement.
Use the parameter UNIT=FTP on
the JCL DD statement used to create the MVS disk file.  Files created on
UNIT FTP do not count toward disk quotas and are deleted each night.
<p>
If you want to monitor or "fetch" the batch job from UNIX, the jobname
on the JOB statement must be your MVS userid plus exactly one additional
alphanumeric character.  You should also include MSGCLASS=W on the JOB
statement, SYSOUT=W on all DD sysout statements, and PRTCLAS=W on
selected EXEC statements.  (The PRTCLAS parameter is used on an EXEC
statement only if the JCL procedure being executed permits use of the
parameter.)  If you do not include these parameters, the batch job will
still process normally, though you won't be able to monitor/fetch the
batch job.
<p>
Step c:  Use "ftp acmvs.inre.asu.edu" to connect to the IBM MVS system.
You will be prompted to enter your MVS userid, and then your MVS
password.  (You need a userid with MVS access.  If you do not have MVS
access, complete and sign the requisite form available at the Computer
Accounts Office in the Computing Commons.  A userid with MVS access
cannot be obtained via self-subscription.)
<p>
Step d: Use the ftp command "site filetype=jes" to point at the batch
queues.  Normally ftp is pointing at disk volumes; however, after using
"site filetype=jes", you can submit, monitor, and retrieve batch jobs.
<p>
Step e: Use the ftp command "put batchfile" to submit a batch job.
Normally "put" would transfer a file to disk on the remote system;
however, after using "site filetype=jes", "put" submits the contents of
the indicated file as a batch job.  The name "batchfile" is merely an
example; substitute the name of the UNIX file containing the batch job.
<p>
Step f: Use the ftp command "dir" to monitor the batch job.  Normally
"dir" lists filenames; however, after using "site filetype=jes", "dir"
lists batch job names.  (You will be able to monitor the batch job only
if you used the jobname and print class W as described in "Step a".)
<p>
Step g: Use the ftp command "get jobid.x" to fetch the batch job.
Normally "get" retrieves a disk file; however, after using "site
filetype=jes", "get" retrieves a batch job.  (You will be able to fetch
the batch job only if you used the jobname and print class W as
described in "Step a".)  Replace "jobid" with the letter "j" and the
job's id number.  Use "dir" to determine the job's id number.  If the
job's id is 12345, "get j12345.x" will fetch the job and save it on UNIX
as j12345.x, and "get j12345.x newname" will fetch and save the job as
"newname".
<p>
(A batch job actually consists of multiple print files, with the JCL
listing being print file 0 and the other print file being numbered 1
through n.  The "x" in j12345.x represents "all" print files in the
batch job.  A specific print file can be retrieved by replacing "x" with
the print file number.)
<p>
Step h: Use the ftp command "site filetype=seq" to point at the disk
volumes.  This reverses the effect of "site filetype=jes" and allows you
to transfer disk files instead of batch jobs.
<p>
Step i: Use the ftp command "get remote.file local.file" to copy the
disk file from MVS to UNIX.  Replace "remote.file" with the name of the
MVS disk file; replace "local.file" with the name you want the file to
have on UNIX.  For example, "get 'wyl.xx.yyy.mydata' data123" retrieves
wyl.xx.yyy.mydata from MVS and saves it as data123 on UNIX.
<p>
Step j: Use the ftp command "quit" to terminate the ftp session.
<p>
(Refer to the communications write-ups for more information on ftp and
on other ftp commands.)
<p>
The following sample JCL statements are representative of those which
may appear in an MVS batch job.  These sample statements don't do
anything particularly useful and are shown for illustration purposes
only. The JOB statement is fully specified and uses the MSGCLASS=W
parameter.  It has a jobname consisting of an MVS userid (ABCDE) plus
exactly one additional character; you need to use your own MVS userid,
password, and account number.  The other statements show proper use of
SYSOUT=W, PRTCLAS=W, and UNIT=FTP.  DO NOT copy this JCL literally; you
MUST use whatever JCL is appropriate for your particular situation.
<pre>
  //ABCDE3 JOB (accountnumber),REGION=8M,TIME=2,
  //  MSGCLASS=W,PASSWORD=mvspassword
  //STEP1  EXEC  SAMPLE,PRTCLAS=W
  //TAPEIN  DD  DSN=SOMENAME,DISP=(OLD,KEEP),
  //  UNIT=CART,VOL=SER=123456,LABEL=(1,NL),
  //  DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLSIZE=6400)
  //DISKOUT  DD  DSN=WYL.AB.CDE.MYDATA,DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE),
  //  SPACE=(TRK,(30,10),RLSE),UNIT=FTP,
  //  DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=6400)
  //MYPRINT DD SYSOUT=W
  //
