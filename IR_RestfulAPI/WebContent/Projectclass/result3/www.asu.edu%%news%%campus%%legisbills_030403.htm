      <h2>Legislative bills cover diverse issues, may affect state universities</h2>
      <p>        Besides dealing with looming state budget crises, legislators have introduced
          more than 1,000 bills during the first session of the 46th Legislature.
          Here are some of the bills that may affect Arizona's universities and
      community colleges. </p>
      <p>. SB1133 and HB2408 - Research Funding. The companion
            bills would require the legislature to fund $29 million annually
        for 25 years from the general
          fund to pay for lease payment for research buildings and associated
        infrastructure at ASU and UA. ASU's portion for first-year certificates
        is $14 million.<br>
        . SB 1158 - Campus Sex Crimes Prevention. The bill would require some
          registered sex offenders to notify the sheriff within 72 hours that
          they are state or private employees or registered as a student at a
          state
          institution. The university would be required to release a campus advisory
          about the registered sex offender.<br>
        . SB1181 - Free classes for the Elderly. The bill would require the
          Arizona Board of Regents to conduct a feasibility study on allowing
          people, age
          65 and older, to audit ASU courses for free on a space available basis
          with the professor's permission.<br>
        . SB1277, SB1325, HB 2509, HB 2510 - Union Negotiations. The similar
          bills would give state employees the option to allow employee associations
          or unions to bargain on their behalf with the state for improved working
          conditions. Employees would retain the option to represent themselves.<br>
        . SB 1326 - State Employees, Payroll Deductions. The bill would permit
          universities, along with other state agencies, to allow their employees
          to pay for a variety of fees through payroll deduction as long as at
          least 1,000 employees, including faculty, are enrolled for the service.<br>
        . SB 1294 - Privatization of Residence Halls. The bill would require
          the Arizona Board of Regents to sell to the highest bidder at a public
          auction all university residence halls except those under lease-purchase
          agreements. The proceeds from the sale of any university property would
          revert to the state. Residence halls would be owned and operated -
          including security and maintenance - by a private contractor as long
          as their use
          as residence halls does not change. If usage changes, the property
          would revert back to the state.<br>
        . HB2243 - Law Enforcement Cooperation with Immigration and Naturalization
          Service. Arizona universities and community colleges would be prohibited
          from admitting non-documented immigrants and would be required to conduct
          citizen status checks for all international students at the beginning
          at each semester.<br>
        . HB2305 - Employee Health Insurance. The bill would increase the state's
          spending on its employee and retiree health insurance, and may allow
          the surviving spouse of a deceased employee to purchase up to 36 months
          of insurance at 102 percent of the group rate. On the approval of the
          joint legislative budget committee, the department of administration
          shall self-insure by Oct. 1. The department of administration may contract
          directly with preferred provider organizations, physician and hospital
          networks, indemnity health insurers, hospital and medical service plans,
          dental plans and health maintenance organizations for self-insurance.
          The department of administration by rule shall designate and adopt
          performance standards, including cost competitiveness, utilization
          review issues,
          network development and access, conversion and implementation, report
          timeliness, quality outcomes and customer satisfaction for qualifying
          plans. <br>
        . HB2320 - Violence Liability. The act amends Title 13, Chapter 31,
          of the Arizona Revised Statutes by adding a new section related to
          weapons.
          The bill would permit any state agency, person, organization or entity
          that establishes a gun-free zone, such as universities, to be liable
          for damages that result from criminal conduct against another person
          in the gun-free zone. The liability test is if a reasonable person
          believes possessing a firearm could have helped the victim defend against
          the
          criminal conduct.<br>
        . HB2403 - University Research and Development, Technology Transfer.
          The proposed amendment to the Arizona Constitution would allow the
          Arizona Board of Regents to hold stock or interest in private companies
          in exchange
          for university intellectual or technology property. The Bill would
          require passage at the legislative level and a vote of the people in
          the next
          general election.<br>
        . HB2498 - Internet access for state employees. The proposed bill bans
          state employees from knowingly using agency owned or agency leased
          computer equipment to access, download, print or store any information
          infrastructure
          files or services that depict nudity, sexual activity, sexual excitement
          or ultimate sexual acts. Employees in violation can be disciplined
          or dismissed by the employer.<br>
        . HB2518 - Residency classification for non-citizens. The bill would
          allow non-U.S. citizens to pay resident tuition rates at any state
          university or community college if they attended high school in Arizona
          for three
          years, received a GED, or graduated from an Arizona high school, and
          are affiliated with a state university or community college and have
          applied or will apply for U.S. citizenship. <br>
