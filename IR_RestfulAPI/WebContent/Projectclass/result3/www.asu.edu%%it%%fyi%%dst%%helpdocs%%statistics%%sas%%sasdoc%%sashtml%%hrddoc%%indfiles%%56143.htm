Learn to produce powerful displays of statistical data. Emphasized are     displays that reveal aspects of data not easily captured in numerical
summaries or tabular formats and diagnostic displays that help determine   if assumptions of an analysis are met. Clearly written, with solid
examples of careful analyses, this book is intended for users with basic   to intermediate levels of experience with SAS software and statistics.
Topics covered in this book include the role of statistical graphics in    data analysis, graphical standards for data display, and simple, enhanced,
and three dimensional scatter plots. With this book you will also become   proficient at displaying multivariate data and plotting variables and
observations together.
