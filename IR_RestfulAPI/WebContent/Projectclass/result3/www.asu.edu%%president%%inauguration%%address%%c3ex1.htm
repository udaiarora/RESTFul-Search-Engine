We have launched the Arizona         Biodesign Institute, a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary research program         and facility that will be the cornerstone of our research infrastructure         in this vital and burgeoning field. </p>      <p> This new enterprise will focus on designing new biodevices, biomaterials,         biotools, biosystems, and bioinformatic networks, all intended to directly         help people, and to lay down the foundation for new economic activity.         This research institute will serve as the prototype for the building of         a new entrepreneurial research spirit at Arizona State University, and         will enable us to enter the international competitive field of bioscience,         biotechnology, and biomedicine with a set of research teams, students,         and research facilities that will allow us to become globally competitive         in less than two years. </p>      <p> Catalyzing large-scale interdisciplinary research focused on designing         and meeting human health needs, the researchers at the institute will         pursue advances in fundamental science and engineering related to the         design of critical biotechnology solutions. We will be focusing on two         emerging areas of great contemporary importance: biologics and therapeutics         by design, and nano-scale biologic systems by design. </p>      <p>The work of the institute will significantly enhance our ability to develop         new classes of pharmaceuticals that will monitor and remediate environmental         change, rehabilitate motor function disorders, and initiate start-up biotechnology         companies. To carry out this ambitious research agenda, we will collaborate         with the University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University. </p>      <p>At a regional level, the Arizona Biodesign Institute will contribute         to the potential for a globally competitive and internationally recognized         biosciences cluster in metropolitan Phoenix, adding depth to the regional         technology mix and diversifying the state&#8217;s economic base. At an         institutional level, the Arizona Biodesign Institute represents the movement         of the research enterprise of this university from a slow-moving agency         model to a fast-moving enterprise model.</p>      &nbsp;<BR> </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
