Purpose</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The Department of Aerospace Studies curriculum consists of the general military course and history for freshmen and sophomores (AES 101, 103, 201, 203) and the professional officer course for juniors and seniors (AES 301, 303, 401, 403).</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
General Qualifications.</b> 
Students entering the Air Force Reserve Officers&#8217; Training Corps (AFROTC) must meet the following requirements: </p></div>
<ol>
<li>
be a citizen of the United States (noncitizens may enroll but must obtain citizenship before commissioning);</li>
<li>
be of sound physical condition; and</li>
<li>
be at least 17 years of age for scholarship appointment or admittance to the Professional Officer Course (POC).</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Additionally, scholarship recipients must be able to fulfill commissioning requirements by age 27. If designated for flying training, the student must be able to complete all commissioning requirements before age 29; persons in other categories must be able to complete all commissioning requirements before age 35.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Four-Year Program (GMC and POC)</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
A formal application is not required for students entering the four-year program. A student may enter the program by simply registering for one of the general military course (GMC) classes at the same time and in the same manner as other courses. GMC students receive two semester hours for each AES 100- and 200-level class completed for a total of eight semester hours. GMC students not on AFROTC scholarship incur no military obligation. Each candidate for commissioning must pass an Air Force aptitude test and a physical examination and be selected by a board of Air Force officers. If selected, the student then enrolls in the POC the last two years of the AFROTC curriculum. Students attend a four-week field training course at an Air Force base normally between the sophomore and junior years. Upon successful completion of the POC and the college requirements for a degree, the student is commissioned in the U.S. Air Force as a second lieutenant. The new officer then enters active duty or may be granted an educational delay to pursue graduate work.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Two-Year Program (POC)</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The basic requirement for entry into the two-year program is that the student have two academic years of college work remaining, either at the undergraduate or graduate level. Applicants seeking enrollment in the two-year program must pass an Air Force aptitude test and medical examination and be selected by a board of Air Force officers. After successfully completing a six-week field training course at an Air Force base, the applicant may enroll in the professional officer course (POC) in the AFROTC program. Upon completion of the POC and the college requirements for a degree, the student is commissioned.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
