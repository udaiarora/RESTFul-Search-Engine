      <h2>Consortium for Embedded Systems awards fellowship</h2>
      <p>The Consortium for Embedded Systems has awarded Christopher Ostler its first-ever graduate fellowship for the 2004 &ndash; 05 academic year. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;We are delighted to have Chris join our program as the first recipient of a graduate fellow award in embedded systems,&rdquo; says consortium Director Scott Coleman. &ldquo;This represents a key component in our goal of attracting and retaining top intellectual talent in Arizona to strengthen the embedded systems expertise.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>The consortium is an independent entity dedicated to developing a globally recognized center for embedded technologies &ndash; the tiny, ubiquitous computer systems that are found in everything from automobile sensors to smart appliances. Its members include universities and technology businesses working together within a unique collaborative model to build a framework of knowledge and expertise in embedded systems.</p>
      <p>The fellowships offer two years of support for advanced study. Recipients receive an annual stipend of $24,000 and an education allowance in lieu of tuition, fees and health insurance. </p>
      <p>For Ostler, a newly minted ASU bachelor&rsquo;s recipient in computer systems engineering in May, receiving the fellowship will allow him to focus full time on his doctoral studies. With a 6-month baby in tow and a family to take care of, the timing couldn&rsquo;t have been better.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I consider myself very fortunate and am grateful to have received this generous offer,&rdquo; Ostler says. &ldquo;It really took care of the immediate needs that we have, and I have the ability to focus on getting through the studies without the distractions of trying to find immediate income from somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Ostler&rsquo;s hopes to parlay his training in computer coding and work experiences as a software engineer and designer into cutting-edge research performed in the lab of Ph.D. adviser Karam Chatha, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;I first met Chris as a senior-year student in my Capstone Project class,&rdquo; Chatha says. &ldquo;In the project work, Chris demonstrated excellent computer engineering skills and an ability for independent work of outstanding quality. In other words, Chris possesses the key components that are required for success in graduate school. I look forward to guiding and collaborating with him on his doctoral research.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Chatha has expertise in all aspects of digital system design and teaches instructional courses in System-on-Chip (SoC)-based embedded systems as part of design laboratory that is funded by the consortium and the Fulton School. </p>
      <p>The consortium accomplishes its objectives by using the funds from its member organizations to attract and retain top experts in the target technology areas and to better prepare students for the real-world industry needs. </p>
      <p>The consortium programs provide direct industry involvement and feedback toward optimizing student courses and laboratory assignments, as well as providing students with access to real-world work experiences while obtaining their degrees.</p>
