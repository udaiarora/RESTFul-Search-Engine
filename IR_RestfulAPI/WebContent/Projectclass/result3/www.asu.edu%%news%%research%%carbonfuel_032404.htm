      <h2><strong>The Future of Energy is . Carbon, the Once and Future Fuel </strong></h2>
              <p>There is trouble in our desert oasis. Gas prices in the Valley are soaring. Smog is thickening. Every day, Phoenicians feel ever closer to debates about the competition between energy and the environment. What once seemed like an abstract problem that would be settled in Washington now becomes a pressing affair here at home. </p>
              <p>With our energy and our environment in mind, ASU's Department of Geological Sciences presents <strong>"Carbon's Future Role in Energy," </strong> the 2004 Robert S. Dietz Lecture. The lecture will be presented by energy expert <strong>Dr. Klaus S. Lackner, </strong>Ewing-Worzel Professor of Geophysics in Columbia University's Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering. </p>
              <p>The public lecture will take place <strong>Wednesday, March 31 at 7:30 </strong> pm in the <strong>Architecture and Environmental Design Building, Room 60 </strong>, Arizona State University, Main Campus. (See the end of this release for more details.) </p>
              <p>Lackner is a scientist and a visionary. He has been recognized by <em> Discover Magazine </em> as a researcher whose ideas could change the world. Presently he is developing innovative approaches to energy issues of the future.&nbsp; He has been instrumental in forming ZECA, the Zero Emission Coal Alliance, which is an industry-led effort to develop coal power with zero emissions to the atmosphere.&nbsp; His recent work is on environmentally acceptable technologies for the use of fossil fuels. </p>
              <p>"In his studies of worldwide energy consumption, Dr. Lackner combines a particle physicist's attention to detail with a geophysicist's appreciation for the big picture," said ASU Vice President for Research and Economic Affairs Jonathan Fink. "He presents rigorous analyses of the long-term climatic consequences of different energy policies. All of us who live (and bake) in Phoenix can attest to the timely importance of understanding the controls on rising global temperatures, as well as possible ways to reduce or reverse these trends." </p>
              <p>Lackner believes that fixing the energy infrastructure with new technology -- rather than simply expanding it to satisfy the needs of the ten billion people on the planet -- could solve many of the pressing environmental problems we face today and afford us all the energy we require to move responsibly into the future. </p>
              <p>According to Lackner, this change need not be disruptive. We may not have to give up on the energy sources that have worked for us in the past. Unlike many of his peers, Lackner believes that, rather than jumping to alternative energy sources such as photovoltaic energy or fusion, our problems could be solved through continued use of today's mainstay - fossil carbon based fuels. According to Lackner, we simply need to alter the ways in which fossil fuels are used. </p>
              <p>With this in mind, Lackner has urged the Bush administration to confront climate change. He has advocated the capture of carbon dioxide from the air in order to control emissions and contends that a transition to hydrogen-based fuels by itself will not solve the greenhouse gas problem. </p>
              <p>"Contrary to popular belief, fossil fuels are plentiful and inexpensive," says Lackner. "They are ill regarded mainly because of past environmental sins, because of the still uncontrolled emission of carbon dioxide, and because of the political dependencies that oil has created. New carbon based technologies promise plentiful energy without today's environmental concerns. </p>
              <p>"Such technologies could include the capture and permanent disposal of carbon dioxide and the complete elimination of all emissions to the air. Capture of carbon dioxide directly from the air not only allows for the control of carbon dioxide in the air, it also makes it possible to recycle carbon and base a renewable energy infrastructure on synthetic carbonaceous fuels rather than on hydrogen." </p>
              <p>Lackner's background in science is as diverse as it is distinguished. Lackner began his scientific career studying the phenomenology of weakly interacting particles. Later, while searching for quarks, he and George Zweig developed the chemistry of atoms with fractional nuclear charge. He is still participating in matter searches for particles with a non-integer charge in an experiment conducted at Stanford by Martin Perl and his group.&nbsp; After joining Los Alamos National Laboratory, Klaus Lackner became involved in hydrodynamic work and fusion related research.&nbsp; In recent years, he has published on the behavior of high explosives, novel approaches to inertial confinement fusion, numerical algorithms and self-replicating machine systems. </p>
              <p>The Robert S. Dietz Memorial Lecture Series seeks to commemorate ASU Professor Robert S. Dietz, a pioneer in the field of earth science. The annual series brings distinguished speakers to ASU who work in fields most closely related to Dietz's interests - plate tectonics, marine geology, planetary science, evolution and science in society. </p>
              <p>The public lecture takes place Wednesday, March 31 at 7:30 pm in the Architecture and Environmental Design Building, Room 60, Arizona State University, Main Campus. There will be a reception for Alumni and Friends with refreshments prior to the lecture at 6:30 in the same location. For more information, call 480-965-5081. </p>
