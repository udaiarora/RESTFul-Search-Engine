            <P>The National Security Education Program (NSEP) provides a unique 
            funding opportunity for U.S. students to study world regions 
            critical to U.S. interests including Asia, and Eurasia. NSEP was 
            designed to provide Americans with the resources and encouragement 
            they need to acquire skills and experiences in areas of the world 
            critical to the future security of our nation, in exchange for a 
            commitment to seek work in the federal government. As students of 
            other cultures and languages, NSEP Boren Scholars (undergraduate 
            students) and Fellows (graduate students) begin to acquire the 
            international competence needed to communicate effectively across 
            borders, to understand other perspectives, and to analyze economic 
            and political affairs. The National Flagship Language Program offers

              Scholarships for 
            Southeast Asian Students are being offered by the Nisei Student 
            Relocation Commemorative Fund (NSRC Fund). This Fund was founded in 
            1980 by Nisei (second generation Japanese in Americans) who had been 
            college students during World War II when they were forcibly 
            incarcerated in U.S. internment camps, abruptly halting their 
            education. Because of the compassionate intervention of the National 
            Japanese American Student Relocation Council, over 5,000 Nisei were 
            assisted in leaving the camps and continuing their education 
            elsewhere. Scholarships of $1000 or more will be awarded to 
            qualified students who will be attending an accredited vocational, 
            trade or cosmetology school or two- or four-year college or 
            university. Interest from the NSRCF endowment is awarded to 
            Southeast Asian students to help cover expenses during their first 
            year of college. Since 1983 the NSRCF has awarded more than $340,000 
            to 365 deserving students.</P>
