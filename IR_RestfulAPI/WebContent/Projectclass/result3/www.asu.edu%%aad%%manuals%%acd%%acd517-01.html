Student Employment is part of Student Financial Assistance and functions as a student personnel office, providing job advertisement and referral services, eligibility verification, student compensation administration, payroll verification, and policy interpretation.  Students may apply for on-campus and off-campus jobs throughout the year.<p>The office administers the student compensation plan and provides information to employers concerning wage levels, position classification, and change-of-level requests.  Assistance is provided in filling student positions by advertising job vacancies and referring eligible students to employers.  Departments with position vacancies must list these positions with the Student Employment Office.<p>Student Employment maintains job information on bulletin boards located in the Student Services Building.  New job listings are posted daily, Monday through Friday, except holidays.  The office promotes sound employment practices by ensuring a fair and equitable employment process.<p>Employment counselors are available to assist students in the development of job hunting or seeking skills.  Students are encouraged to explore career options and career pathing in their Student Employment experiences.<p>Questions regarding student Personnel Action forms (PAFs), time cards, and related forms should be directed to Human Resources.<p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>For information about employing international students, see <a href="acd517-02.html">ACD 517&#150;02</a>, &#147;Employment of Nonimmigrant International Students.&#148;<p>For detailed information about student employment eligibility criteria, see the <i>University Student Initiatives Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i> <a href="../usi/usi304-01.html" target="NEW">USI 304&#150;01</a>, &#147;Student Employment Program.&#148;<p>&#160;<p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
