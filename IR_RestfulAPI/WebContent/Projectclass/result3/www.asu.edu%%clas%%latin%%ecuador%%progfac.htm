  <h2>ECUADOR: The Amazon and the Andes Field School</h2>

    <img src="images/Tod.JPG" alt="Dr. Tod Swanson photo" class="imagefloatleft" />
<p><a href="mailto:Tod.Swanson@asu.edu">Dr. Tod Swanson</a> grew up in eastern Ecuador as the son of missionary parents.  He received a B.A. in Linguistics 
from the University of Minnesota and a Ph.D. in Religious Studies from the University of Chicago.  He has written 
various articles on the history of indigenous religion in North and South America including "Refusing to Drink with 
the Mountains: Traditional Andean Meanings in Evangelical Testimonies" in Martin Marty, ed., Accounting for 
Fundamentalism: The Dynamic Character of Fundamentalist Movements (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1994, 
pp. 79-98),  "An Ungodly Resemblance: Colonial Violence and Inca Analogies to Christianity" in Theophus H. Smith and 
Mark I. Wallace, eds., Curing Violence: Religion and the Thought of Rene Girard (Sonoma: Polbridge Press, 1994, pp. 
103-108), and "Weathered Characters: Envy and Response to the Seasons in North and South American Indian Morality" in 
the Journal of Religious Ethics (92 [1992]: pp. 601-630).</p>

<p>Dr. Swanson is currently the Director of the Center for Latin American Studies as well as an Associate Professor 
with the Department of Religious Studies both at Arizona State University.  During the summer months, he returns with 
his family to his wife's home community in the Napo Province of Ecuador where they are working with rain forest 
management techniques on land owned by the Quichua community.</p>

<img src="images/uzendoski.gif" class="imagefloatleft" />
<p><a href="mailto:muzendos@mailer.fsu.edu">Dr. Michael Uzendoski</a> first went to Ecuador in 1993 and since 1994 has worked 
with Amazon Quichua speakers of the Upper Napo.  He spent years learning and studying Quichua and has found that 
Amazonian Quichua is a rich and poetic language.  One constant in his research has been to find ways to document and 
translate the poetics of Amazonian Quichua verbal and narrative life.  He is also drawn to social theory.  In other 
projects, he has thought through the nature of Napo Runa notions of the "social" and sociality as connected to 
convivial states and the inseparability of the imaginary and material realms.  While in the field, he has become very 
aware that everyday assumptions that seemed matter-of-fact to him (like the idea of a "thing," a person, a plant, or 
"substance" itself) mean different things when one moves from Western to Amazonian social contexts.  These subtle 
everyday differences make the task of writing ethnography problematic, so Dr. Uzendoski has experimented with 
humanistic forms of writing that convey the complexity of these experiential issues.  A current writing project 
explores how value among the Napo Runa is infused by Amazonian cosmology and the metamorphosis of rainforest spirits 
and substances into human relations.  His research and teaching continually emphasizes that human worlds are defined 
by substances that elicit the imagination.  Consequently, the metamorphoses of social relations moves between the 
physical and imaginary realms.</p>

<p>During the academic year, Dr. Uzendoski, is an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Florida State University 
where he teaches courses on economic anthropology, peoples and cultures of Amazonia, symbol and ritual, and the 
conquest of the Americas.  He received his masters and his doctorate in Anthropology from the University of Viriginia 
and was awarded a Fulbright to lecture and research in Ecuador in 2002. </p>

      <p><strong>Luz Mar&iacute;a de la Torre Amagua&ntilde;a - Quichua Language Instructor</strong>.  Luz Mar&iacute;a De La Torre was born and 
raised in the Otavalo community in Ecuador and has an impressive professional record of research, teaching and 
community involvement.  Professor De la Torre has taught Quichua language and culture for many years at various 
institutions of higher education including: Universidad de San Francisco in Quito; the Pontíficia Universidad 
Católica del Ecuador; the Technical University of Loja (Ecuador); and Trent University (Canada).  She is a dynamic instructor who unfailingly holds the attention of her students.</p>

      <p>Her Otavalo community activities include serving as the president of the Fundaci&oacute;n Yanantin, an organization 
devoted to improving education in Quichua communities.  She has also served as the Coordinator for Bilingual 
Education for the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities in Ecuador (CONAIE).</p>

<p><a href="mailto:egbot@Ag.arizona.edu">Edward Gilbert</a> first became interested in South America as a member 
of the Peace Corps in 1997.  During his service, he lived and worked in a Quichua community in the Bolivian Andes 
as a Soil Conversation / Environmental Education volunteer.  His experiences in this ecologically and culturally 
diverse region instilled a strong appreciation for South America.  Shortly after Bolivia, he joined the Plant Biology 
graduate program at Arizona State University where he obtained his M.S. degree in December 2002.  Through his work 
with ASU, he again returned several times to Latin America as part of academic teams to collect and study the tropical 
flora in both Costa Rica and Ecuador.</p>

<p>Currently, he teaches the Neotropical Plant Biology course and co-teaches the the Amazonian Ethnobotany course 
with David Kiefer during the Field School's Summer Program.  During the remainder of the academic year, he is 
employed as the Assistant Curator / Database Manager for the University of Arizona herbarium.  One of his major 
interests is using advances in data and network technology to aid flora research and identification. He believes 
that such tools have an enormous potential in overcoming the many challenges associated with studying in the 
biologically diversity areas such as the Ecuadorian tropics.</p>

<p><a href="mailto:Dskseat@aol.com">David Kiefer</a>, M.D., who will be teaching the Amazonian Ethnobotany course with Edward Gilbert, is a board-certified 
family physician and a recent graduate of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona in Tucson, 
Arizona, a training program founded by Dr. Andrew Weil.  Dr. Kiefer graduated from the University of Wisconsin Medical 
School in Madison, Wisconsin, which is also where he completed a bachelor's degree in zoology along with additional 
training in environmental studies and conservation biology.  He completed his family medicine residency at the Swedish 
Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, working primarily in a community clinic offering family practice mixed with 
some complementary modalities (acupuncture, naturopathic medicine) to low-income and Spanish-speaking patients.</p>

<p>Dr. Kiefer has been involved in research and work activities in Latin America since 1990, including projects in 
Costa Rica (agroecology, rainforest conservation), Mexico (anthropology), Ecuador (ethnobotany), and Peru (rainforest 
biology).  Currently, most of Dr. Kiefer's teaching and research activities have been in the areas of herbal medicine 
and ethnobotany.  He has given lectures for Bastyr University (a naturopathic medical school outside of Seattle, 
Washington), the University of Arizona, the University of Washington, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, on a 
variety of topics from international health and herbal medicine to shamanism and evidence-based medicine.  His most 
recent publication was a review of Panax ginseng, the popular herbal tonic, for American Family Physician, a leading 
family medicine journal. </p>

<p><strong>Nina Kinti-Moss</strong> will be joining the field school to teach Quichua. Ms. Kinti-Moss holds a master's 
degree in social work from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. She has taught Quichua at the University of Kansas 
since 1997, and has authored many educational texts in that language. She is co-author of the article, "A Pan-Indigenous
 Vision of Indigenous Studies," which appeared in the Spring 2000 edition of the Indigenous Nations Study Journal.</p>

<p>In addition to teaching, Ms. Kinti-Moss is the founder, designer, and weaver with First Weavers of the Americas in 
her home village of Salasaca, Ecuador. This effort has elevated the quality of Salasacan weaving and increased the 
earnings of skilled Quichua weavers, thereby improving the quality of life in Salasaca. </p>
