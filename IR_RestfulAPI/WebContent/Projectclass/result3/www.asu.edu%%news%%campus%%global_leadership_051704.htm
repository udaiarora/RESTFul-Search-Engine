      <h2 align="left"><strong>U. S. and Chinese Executives Explore </strong><strong>Management and Leadership in a Global Environment </strong></h2>
      <p>Chinese and American executives will examine the complexities of taking a business enterprise global at an executive education forum in Shanghai on May 21. </p>
      <p>Robert A. Mundell, the 1999 Nobel Laureate in economics, will open the seminar, entitled "Management and Leadership in a Global Environment." A group of United States business leaders will then join Chinese leaders in panel discussions facilitated by Professors Jeffrey Coles and Robert Stearns of the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University (ASU). </p>
      <p>The forum is a component of the W. P. Carey MBA Shanghai, a two-year executive-style graduate program launched in September 2003 by the W. P. Carey School. Developed in partnership with the Shanghai National Accounting Institute (SNAI), a division of the Ministry of Finance, the program is the first-ever joint venture between an American business school and the Chinese government. </p>
      <p>The 65 students who comprise the first W. P. Carey MBA Shanghai class are CEO or vice president-level executives from China's largest state-owned enterprises, and officials of the government agencies that regulate the financial markets. Their presence in the program is representative of China's fast-track effort to prepare its business leaders for competition. </p>
      <p>"China is under enormous pressure to meet the challenge of readying its state-owned enterprises for global engagement as a member of the World Trade Organization," said Buck Pei, associate dean for Asia Pacific Programs at the W. P. Carey School. "For example, by 2007 all segments of China's financial services sector will be open to multi-national competition. Soon, Chinese firms will be looking at ways to establish themselves outside of China. The W. P. Carey MBA Shanghai is part of China's effort to acquire the expertise to accomplish these goals." </p>
      <p>At the same time, the W. P. Carey MBA Shanghai advances a vision of Arizona as a full player in the global marketplace. </p>
      <p>"The reason we launched this program is to make ASU a force rather than a place, as (ASU) President Michael Crow says," Pei commented. "This forum creates opportunities for Arizona business people to witness the vitality of Shanghai and the caliber of the executives who are our students. We expect that each person who goes with us will come back with the global mind set of a Marco Polo. Likewise, we also plan to bring the students to ASU this fall to witness the exciting ventures we are creating here in the Valley of the Sun. This has everything to do with the future of Arizona as well as Shanghai." </p>
      <p>Panel discussions will center on the critical factors in a decision to open and operate an enterprise outside of one's home country, such as first mover advantage, selection of a management team and other considerations. </p>
      <p>Panelists include: </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; Mark Blacker, Founder, Mark C. Blacker and Associates, Ltd. </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; Wm. Polk Carey, Founder and Chairman, W. P. Carey &amp; Co. LLC </p>
