          <h2> Awards highlight success of Camp Sparky &rsquo;s &lsquo;Big Camp&rsquo;</h2>
          <p>During an excursion to Mount Lemmon in Tucson this month, nearly 70 fifth-graders from Flora Thew Elementary School took part in &ldquo;Big Camp,&rdquo; a three-day summer adventure for at-risk youngsters.</p>
          <p align="left">The annual program is coordinated by Camp Sparky, an ASU student-run organization sponsored by the College of Education. The goal of &ldquo;Big Camp&rdquo; is to promote learning as being fun and to encourage the students to attend college.</p>
          <p align="left">&ldquo;We seek to inspire fifth-graders to love learning and have confidence in their future success,&rdquo; says Mike Devenny, program chair. &ldquo;Through unique learning experiences, we encourage them to pursue higher education. Camp Sparky members also develop commitment, awareness, leadership, and a sense of community.&rdquo;</p>
          <p align="left">Camp Sparky was recognized this spring with the ASU Student Organization Resource Center&rsquo;s (SORC) 2005 Outstanding Annual Program Award for its 2004 &ldquo;Big Camp&rdquo; excursion. The award honors student organizations and advisors who have made a difference in the areas of leadership, programming and service. This year&rsquo;s awards were presented in April at the SORC&rsquo;s annual Hall of Fame awards ceremony. </p>
          <p align="left">&ldquo;Camp Sparky members have really set the bar high for student organizations on campus and within the community,&rdquo; says Brian Goehner, coordinator of student involvement for SORC. &ldquo;They have sustained great leadership year after year, which is somewhat unique considering the constant student turnover. In addition, they have also been able to maintain a level of excellence within their programming.&rdquo;</p>
          <p align="left">Camp Sparky also received the 2000 and 2001 Outstanding Student Organization Award, which is considered SORC&rsquo;s highest honor. The organization has received eight awards since the inception of the SORC Hall of Fame ceremony in 1997.</p>
          <p align="left">&ldquo;It feels good to be recognized,&rdquo; Devenny says. &ldquo;It tells us what we&rsquo;re doing matters, and it tells us we&rsquo;re doing it well.&rdquo;</p>
          <p align="left">Anel Mendez, a fifth-grade teacher from Thew Elementary School, is grateful for the dedication of Camp Sparky members.</p>
          <p align="left">&ldquo;The volunteers are excellent role models for our kids,&rdquo; Mendez says. &ldquo;Our fifth-graders respect and look up to them. They have befriended our students, giving them an opportunity to see themselves as future ASU students.&rdquo;</p>
          <p align="left">This year&rsquo;s theme at &ldquo;Big Camp&rdquo; was &ldquo;Exploring Nature,&rdquo; with the goal of educating the youths on the effects humans have on their environment. To realize this goal, the students were taught how to use the &ldquo;Three Rs&rdquo; (reduce, reuse and recycle) around their home and school.</p>
          <p align="left">Activities to support this theme included making bird feeders out of water bottles; constructing kites from wooden dowels, cardboard, string and duct tape; learning basic first-aid skills; taking a nature hike; and discovering their natural surroundings through a scavenger hunt.</p>
          <p align="left">&ldquo;While &lsquo;Big Camp&rsquo; is only a few days long, a sense of community is developed by the end of the first day,&rdquo; Devenny says. &ldquo;Within that community, expectations are high that everyone will treat themselves and their peers with respect. They learn that they are more than the sum of their parts &ndash; and that together we can achieve great things.&rdquo;</p>
          <p align="left">The fifth-graders that attend &ldquo;Big Camp&rdquo; are able to participate free of charge through the fundraising efforts of Camp Sparky. </p>
          <p align="left">In addition to the annual &ldquo;Big Camp,&rdquo; Camp Sparky hosts a series of &ldquo;Day Camps&rdquo; conducted on Fridays for fifth-graders at several elementary schools sites. The day camps feature four themed activity stations that are coordinated by Camp Sparky members. </p>
          <p align="left">Mendez says her students have benefited academically from Camp Sparky&rsquo;s commitment to Thew Elementary School, and socially from their camp experiences.</p>
          <p align="left">&ldquo;During the various day camps that precede &lsquo;Big Camp,&rsquo; the students learn to work in groups by identifying and solving problems together teaching them life skills,&rdquo; Mendez says. &ldquo;During &lsquo;Big Camp,&rsquo; they learn to rely on each other; they learn interdependence and other skills that are needed in life.&rdquo;</p>
          <p align="left">Students interested in joining Camp Sparky can visit the Web site (<a href="http://www.campsparky.org">www.campsparky.org</a>) for more information.</p>
