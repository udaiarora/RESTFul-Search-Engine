      <h2>Studies examine evolution of two world-altering chemical processes in 
        biosphere, point to possible origin</h2>
      <p>Some of the most important evolutionary events in Earth's history didn't 
        just create new organisms -- they created new fundamental biochemical 
        processes. And where do biochemical processes come from? They evolve from 
        other biochemical processes.</p>
      <p>Two of the most important pieces of biochemical innovation that occurred 
        in the early biosphere - the development of photosynthesis (which made 
        light energy available to life) and of nitrogen fixation (which made atmospheric 
        nitrogen available to life) - may be related to each other because some 
        of their key enzymes appear to have evolved from a common ancestor that 
        may be part of a third, significantly different, biochemical process.</p>
      <p>"Photosynthesis was important because it gave life an enormous energy 
        source and ultimately put oxygen in the atmosphere," said Arizona State 
        University biochemist Robert Blankenship. "Nitrogen fixation -- making 
        atmospheric nitrogen bioavailable --was also a critical step in the early 
        development of life. We need a good source of nitrogen for proteins and 
        DNA, but the biggest source, the molecular nitrogen that we have in the 
        atmosphere, has a triple bond in it that makes it so inert that it's a 
        killer to get at."</p>
      <p>Two new studies, to be presented at the February 2003 NASA Astrobiology 
        Institute General Meeting by researchers at Arizona State University, 
        provide evidence for the long-suspected relatedness of the two biochemical 
        pathways, and find hints of other related pathways that may be key to 
        understanding the evolutionary history of both.<br>
        A critical part of the emerging evolutionary picture seems to be "horizontal 
        gene transfer" -- genetic change that occurs by the exchange of genetic 
        material between bacteria. This process allows for sudden evolutionary 
        leaps that are perhaps not possible through gradual genetic change and 
        natural selection. </p>
      <p>In a paper published in the November 22, 2002 issue of Science, Blankenship, 
        ASU biochemist Jason Raymond and colleagues show through a comparative 
        genomic analysis of five photosynthetic prokaryotic organisms that the 
        genes that code for the intricate molecular complexes that perform photosynthesis 
        seem to have originated through ancient genetic mixing that apparently 
        combined a variety of independently evolved metabolic processes. </p>
      <p>In one of the Astrobiology meeting papers, "Horizontal Gene Transfer 
        in the Evolution of Nitrogen Fixation," Raymond, Blankenship and Rice 
        University's Janet Siefert do an analysis of the genomes of a larger group 
        of bacteria and archaea, comparing in particular similar genes that code 
        for the protein nitrogenase, a critical enzyme in nitrogen fixation. </p>
      <p>"In the very early earth, there was probably some available nitrogen 
        in the form of ammonia or something else, so early life forms didn't have 
        to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. At some point though, things reached 
        a food crisis - you either find someway to get the atmosphere's molecular 
        nitrogen into the cycle or you die. A minimum input of nitrogen can't 
        sustain a big biosphere," noted Blankenship.</p>
      <p>"Nitrogen fixation is one of the most interesting biological processes 
        because it's so difficult to do chemically. Nitrogenase is a very complex 
        enzyme system that actually breaks molecular nitrogen's triple bond," 
        he said.</p>
      <p>The researchers find that similar or "homologous" nitrogenase genes exist 
        across a broad range of organisms, and appear to be related to other similar 
        genes coding for proteins involved in photosynthesis, as well as to other 
        genes in archaea and bacteria that do neither photosynthesis nor nitrogen 
        fixation. </p>
      <p>"We found a group of homologous genes that doesn't correspond to any 
        genes that go with photosynthesis or any that we know in nitrogen fixation 
        - we found these in a wide range of organisms," said Raymond.</p>
      <p>The analysis suggests that the related genes that code for neither nitrogenase 
        nor enzymes in photosynthesis may be "relics," coding for metabolic pathways 
        that are ancestral to both photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation. Horizontal 
        gene transfer appears to be responsible for the broad distribution of 
        the original gene and for its subsequent divergence and specialization 
        in the metabolic pathways of nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis.</p>
      <p>In the second paper, "The Evolutionary Relationship between Nitrogen 
        Fixation and Bacteriochlorophyll Synthesis," ASU's Christopher Staples, 
        Blankenship, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute's Biswarup Mukhopadhyay 
        examine the properties of enzymes created by these similar genes and finds 
        that nitrogenase, the photosynthesis related enzymes, and other homologous 
        enzymes all generally belong to a group of enzymes that break apart molecules 
        and are known as reductase enzymes.</p>
      <p>"We're purifying the proteins that the genes produce and will be looking 
        at catalytic activity. We will test to see how activity differs and also 
        to find what has been conserved and what has been changed in the active 
        sites," said Staples. "Changes in the enzymes' active sites lead to differentiation 
        in regard to what specific molecules they affect."</p>
      <p>The less-specialized reductase enzymes appear to be ancestral to the 
        others and were perhaps originally important in helping early prokaryotes 
        neutralize toxic substances in their environment. </p>
      <p>"There is a hypothesis that the ancient reductase, in the presence of 
        a reducing atmosphere, may have been a hydrogen cyanide reductase," said 
        Staples.</p>
      <p>The team thinks that they have perhaps found a living model for this 
        in Methanococcus jannaschii, a methane-producing archaea that performs 
        neither nitrogen fixation nor photosynthesis but produces a reductase 
        enzyme that the researchers suspect is used to break down hydrogen cyanide. 
      </p>
      <p>"We're testing to see if these organisms can grow in the presence of 
        cyanide and if they can use cyanide as a nitrogen source," said Staples. 
        "They don't appear to be able to use cyanide exclusively for nitrogen, 
        but they can grow in concentrations of it that would be deadly to most 
        organisms."</p>
      <p>While the search to discover the evolutionary history of the key chemical 
        processes of the biosphere involves some esoteric genomic and biochemical 
        detective work, Blankenship, Raymond and Staples point out that understanding 
        how the chemical processes of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation evolved 
        may have some large practical pay-offs.</p>
      <p>"Understanding the origins of nitrogenase, for example, links to things 
        like the synthesis of fertilizer," said Blankenship. "I come from the 
        Midwest where there are these huge anhydrous ammonia plants that are tremendous 
        users of energy - a fantastic amount of energy goes into the making of 
        ammonia. But that's exactly what this enzyme complex does: make ammonia 
        out of nitrogen. It's a bio solution to this incredibly important and 
        very expensive process of fertilizer production.</p>
      <p>"There's tremendous appeal in having a bioengineered version of nitrogen 
        fixation. If we understand this complex pathway and its origin and evolution, 
        then we can think more effectively about engineering it into other places. 
        The benefit to society of being able to engineer in nitrogen fixation 
        into most crop plants would be profound," he said. </p>
      <p>Founded in 1998, the NASA Astrobiology Institute sponsors scientific 
        research in a wide variety of disciplines aimed at asking and answering 
        large and fundamental questions about life in the universe. Astrobiology 
        is an exciting new discipline devoted to the study of life on Earth and 
        elsewhere in the universe - its origin, evolution, distribution, and future. 
        This new area of multidisciplinary study is bringing together the physical 
        and biological sciences to address some of the most fundamental questions 
        of the natural world.</p>
      <p>The NASA Astrobiology Institute is composed of over 700 researchers distributed 
        at more that 130 research institutions across the United States. Its central 
        offices are located at NASA Ames Research Center, in the heart of Silicon 
        Valley, California. Additional information about the NAI can be found
