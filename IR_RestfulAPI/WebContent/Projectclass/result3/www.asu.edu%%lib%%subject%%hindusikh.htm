      Many of the dictionaries and encyclopedias listed below provide supplemental bibliographies with their discussion, for example, of a particular diety, a philosophical or religious concept, or a survey article on a broad topic such as Hinduism, Sikhism, or Vedic literature. The periodical indexes described in this Subject Guide will also contain citations to books and articles. There are, however, some ready-made bibliographies on Hinduism and Sikhism which list both general introductions to and specific studies on these religious traditions.

        <br>
"The purpose of this volume is to give bibliographical guidance to persons . . . interested in learning more of the world's great religious traditions" (Preface). Contains chapters for Hinduism and Sikhism, both written by scholars, which offer a narrative introduction to the history and development of each tradition. Citations to books and articles are contained within the narrative as opposed to a separate listing. <BR>

        <br>
        Excellent bibliography of books, articles, and reference materials published through 1978 on all aspects of Hinduism with detailed annotations for each citation. The arrangement of citations follows an outline provided in the contents pages. This outline consists of twelve major categories (e.g., History of Hinduism, Hindu Ritual and Practice) and various subdivisions for each major category (e.g., History of Shavite Sects, Yoga and Related Practices). Following the outline for each major category and its subdivisions are narrative explanations of the scope of that category with appropriate references to other categories in the outline. <br>

        <br>
        Another excellent bibliography of books and articles published through 1978 stressing popular Hinduism, Hindu mythology, and the religion of contemporary India as opposed to the religious heritage of ancient India. Citations are arranged according to an outline provided in the table of contents but an author index and detailed subject index are included. One or two sentence non-evaluative annotations are given "when the title does not adequately identify the contents of the work" (Preface). <br>

        <br>
        Annotated, selected bibliography, consisting almost exclusively of English-language material, intending to offer the user a basic reading list for a number of religious traditions including Hinduism and Sikhism. Like Dell and Holland (Entries 2 and 3) above, Karpinski has arranged the citations according to an outline, though one far less detailed than Dell's. Consult the "Table of Contents" for this outline. <br>

        <br>
        Massive bibliography of some 28,000 books, articles, dissertations, and government documents. As is evident from its title, this bibliography is not limited to India or its religious dimensions. Citations are arranged alphabetically by author under headings given in a detailed 83-page "Outline of Headings." Each citation is numbered and the outline provides the number for the first citation under a particular heading, thereby making browsing possible. However, religious topics are scattered throughout the outline. There is both an author and subject index. No annotations are given and the coverage of Sikhs and Sikhism is limited. <br>

"This compilation lists over 11,000 research and general interest articles, research papers, notes, news and book reviews, from 231 journals . . . relating to Hinduism" (Preface). Also includes articles from two Indian newspapers and covers the period 1962-1983. Arrangement is alphabetical by author and subject. Note: Journals indexed are all published in India. <br>

        <br>
        Annotated bibliography of books and articles in English published since 1965. Citations are listed alphabetically by author under seven broad headings (e.g., Sikh History, Sikh Gurus) with no subdivisions listed in the table of contents. However, author and subject indexes provide the user a measure of precision these broad headings do not afford.

      Access to periodical literature, chapters from anthologies or Festschriften, and books is crucial to the study of Hinduism and Sikhism. The bibliographies listed above do provide such access but tend to be selective and often cover only a specific time period. Indexes generally provide on-going and more comprehensive coverage. The following is a listing of the indexes available and the annotations for individual citations will state whether coverage extends to periodical literature, books, chapters, or any combination thereof. These annotations will also briefly describe the internal arrangement of the indexes in order to facilitate ease of use.

        <br>
        This is the major English-language periodical index for religion. Published anually, it is arranged strictly by subject heading but does include an author/editor index. Articles can be found under broad headings (e.g., Hinduism or Sikhism) or specific headings for sacred literature or dieties (e.g., Vedas or Vishnu). No abstracts. <br>
        <br>
        <li><u>Religion Index Two: Multi-Author Works</u>. Evanston, IL: American Theological Library Association, 1960- . Annual. <br>
        <B>BL 48 .R42x HAYDEN REF (Located on Table 7B)</B> <br>
        <br>
        Companion volume to the <u>Religion Index One: Periodicals</u> (Entry 1 of this section) above, it indexes essays from collected works, festschriften, conference proceedings and congresses, and issues of regularly or irregularly published series and annuals. Like its companion volume, <u>Religion Index Two</u> is published anually, uses the same subject heading list, and arranged strictly by subject heading but includes an author/editor index. Provides access to material difficult, if not impossible, to locate otherwise. <br>
        <br>
        <li><u>Science of Religion: Abstracts and Index of Recent Articles</u>. Leeds: University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies, 1976- . Quarterly. <br>
        <B>BL 1 .S27x HAYDEN REF (Located on Table 7B)</B> <br>
        <br>
        This index serves as a nice companion to the <u>Religion Index One</u> (Entry 1 of this section). It indexes many journals not included in the <u>Religion Index One</u> and provides lengthy abstracts in English. Each quarterly issue begins with a table of contents listing broad categories (e.g., Vedic Religion / Hinduism, Islam) and the range of entry numbers for citations corresponding to that category. The fourth quarterly issue contains both an author and subject index for that volume providing the user with the entry number(s) for citations by a particular author or on a particular subject <br>
        <br>
        <li><u>International Bibliography of the History of Religions</u>. Leiden: Brill, 1 952&thorn;1973. (ASU doesn't own 1954 and 1964.)<br>
        <B>BL 1 .A1 I5x HAYDEN REF (Located on Table 7B)</B> <br>
        <br>
        Was an annual bibliography which attempted "to give as complete a list as possible of the books and articles relating to the History of Religions which were published during the year under review" (Preface). Citations are arranged following a detailed outline provided in a table of contents at the start of each issue which gives the page number on which a list of citations begins. There is no separate subject index. An author index was provided beginning in 1958. <br>
        <br>
        <li><u>Bulletin Signaletique 527: Histoire et Sciences des Religions</u>. Vol.33- . Paris: Centre de Documentation du C.N.R.S. 1979- . Quarterly.<br>
        <B>BL 1 .A1 B8x HAYDEN REF</B> <br>
        <br>
        This is a major international index and very comprehensive in its coverage of both periodical titles and subjects in the study of religion. The arrangement of citations follows the "plan de classement" or "general outline" printed in French and English at the start of each quarterly issue. A short abstract is given for each citation in French. Each issue does contain an author index (table des auteurs) and separate subject indexes for each principle division of the "general outline" (e.g., Index des Religions D'Asie). It should be noted that the subject headings are in French. The author and subject indexes found in the quarterly issues are cumulated in a separate fifth issue for each volume called the "tables annuelles." <br>
        <br>
        This index has undergone changes in its title and the subject matter was included with other disciplines in a single index prior to 1970. Fortunately, the numbering sequence of all the volumes has remained consecutive. Listed below are the titles of the index along with the volume numbers and years corresponding to that title as well as call number changes. <BR>

        <br>
        Very detailed bibliography of articles, books, festschriften, symposia, and conference proceedings on all aspects of Asian studies including philosophy and religion. Arrangement is by country (e.g., Cambodia, India) or region (e.g., East Asia, Soviet Far East) as listed in the table of contents. These geographic categories are further subdivided according to a "subject classification" list provided in each volume. Each volume includes an author index but no separate subject index. <br>

        Subject/Author index to over 500 Indian periodicals, journals, and newspapers in the humanities and social sciences. While not devoted exclusively to topics of religious interest, it does include headings and see-references for aspects of Hindu and Sikh religion and philosophy, edic literature, shrines, sects, etc.

      It is often helpful to have sources which will competently identify important individuals in the history of Hinduism or Sikhism, place-names, dieties, or religious/philosophical terms and concepts. The following dictionaries should be helpful for a range of such topics as explained in the individual annotations.
      <OL>
        <li>Dowson, John. <u>Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion, Geography, History, and Literature</u>. 11th ed. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1968. <br>
        <B>BL 1105 .D6 1968 HAYDEN REF</B> <br>
        <br>
        Long the standard dictionary of the field. Alphabetical arrangement of the names of gods, personal and geographical names, names of sacred and other literature, terms, and concepts. Definitions are derived entirely from the work of European scholars and often include references to or quotations from this scholarship. <BR>
        <BR>
        <li>Stutley, Margaret and James Stutley. <u>Harper's Dictionary of Hinduism: Its Mythology, Folklore, Philosophy, Literature, and History</u>. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1977.<br>
        <B>BL 1105 .S88x 1977 HAYDEN REF</B> <br>
        <br>
        Excellent dictionary of names and terms to complement Dowson (Entry 1 of this section) above. The Stutleys footnote their definitions with references to scholarship and when defining, for example, the name of a god or place cite its mention in sacred and authoritative texts. <BR>

        <br>
"Presents the basic terminology and doctrinal systems of the four great wisdom teachings of the East" (Intro.). While not devoted exclusively to Hinduism, one of its strengths is the overlap provided among traditions. Each definition begins with a letter indicating the tradition(s) to which it applies (e.g., H=Hinduism, T=Taoism) and the language of which the term defined is a part, including any equivalent it has in another of the five Asian languages covered, namely, Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan. Includes a good bibliography of primary and secondary sources for each tradition. <BR>

        <B>BL 1105 .W34 1968 HAYDEN REF</B> <br>
        <br>
        Lengthy discussions of terms, concepts, gods, place names, and sacred texts. While Walker's discussions are generally more detailed than those in the other dictionaries listed in this section, the terms, concepts, etc., chosen are more selective and idiosyncratic. Entries usually include references for suggested further reading. <BR>

        While perhaps not technically an encyclopedia, this source offers excellent survey articles on religions both present and past. Vol. II is entitled "Religions of the Present" and includes a 109-page article on Hinduism by a noted scholar. There is no separate article for Sikhism but it is mentioned in the article on Hinduism. There is, however, a separate article on Jainism. A select bibliography is appended to both articles. Vol. II contains a subject index for the set. <br>

        The two encyclopedias of religion mentioned below contain excellent survey articles on Hinduism and Sikhism and cover persons, places, concepts, dieties, and festivals for these traditions as well.

        Not an encyclopedia in the usual sense of the word. This is an ongoing scholarly study of Indian temple architecture arranged both geographically and chronologically. The encyclopedia is composed of two-volume sets; a volume of text and a volume of plates. Each volume of text treats a particular geographic area with individual chapters on a specific period within a stated timeframe and/or a particular region within the broader geographic area covered. These text volumes are followed by volumes of plates which are discussed and referenced in the chapters. Each two-volume set has a "site and temple" index and a comprehensive index is planned when the encyclopaedia is completed.

        This work offers commentary on 108 Upanisads. Subrahmanian divides the Upanisads into seven sections, beginning with what he calls the "ten major Upanisads," and followed by other groupings (e.g., Samanya Vedanta and Saiva Upanisad). It should be noted that the enumeration and grouping of Upanisads as well as determining whether one is "genuine" or not are problematic. Unfortunately, there are no references, footnotes, or supplemental bibliography to accompany the commentary such that it must be approached with some caution. Includes an index.
