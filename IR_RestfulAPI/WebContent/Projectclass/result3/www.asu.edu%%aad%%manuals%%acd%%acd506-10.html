These written plans must explain how annual performance evaluations are used in salary adjustments and in initiating performance improvement plans required under post-tenure review. The unit&#146;s written plans must be approved by the voting members of the unit&#146;s academic assembly as specified by the unit policies, the dean, and the campus provost.  College plans must be approved by the voting members of the college&#146;s academic assembly as specified by college policy and by the provost.  Unit plans should incorporate definitions and evidence as described in <a href="acd506-01.html">ACD 506-01</a>, &#147;Preamble for Promotion and Tenure.&#148;<p>The collection of supportive materials pertitnent to all such decisions will be the responsibility of the faculty member, except that the department personnel committees and the chairs will collect supplementary confidential evaluation letters where required.<p><hr><font size=+1><b> Purposes of Annual Performance Evaluations</b></font><p>Annual performance evaluations serve the following three distinct purposes:<br><p><ol><li>to comply with Board of Regents&#146; requirements for an annual review of all faculty with the purpose of encouraging the faculty member to establish goals for continued academic progress</li><p><li>to guide decisions about salary allocation<p>and</li><p><li>to institute the first step in the post-tenure review process for tenured faculty.</li></ol><p>Because the annual performance evaluation must serve three distinct but related purposes, the unit&#146;s written plan must incorporate Board of Regents&#146; requirements for an annual assessment as well as the requirements specified in policies governing salary adjustments and post-tenure review.<p><hr><font size=+1><b> Relationship to Probationary Review, Tenure Review, and Promotion Review</b></font><p>Annual evaluations do not cumulate into tenure, promotion, termination, or release decisions.  For probationary faculty, the annual evaluation should not be confused with the probationary review. Annual feedback on progress toward tenure for probationary faculty may occur at the same time and be based upon the same material as the annual performance evaluation, but probationary reviews are prospective and reflect the academic unit&#146;s estimate of the candidate&#146;s future promise.  Thus, the procedures and standards used in annual performance evaluations are different from those used in retention, promotion, and tenure reviews.  Annual performance evaluations are retrospective and summative, whereas tenure and promotion reviews are prospective and summative.<p>Typically, units have different levels of performance expected for annual performance evaluations (e.g., unsatisfactory, satisfactory, merit, and so forth) than for retention, tenure, andpromotion (which require excellence). Procedures differ in that the final decision about the performance level in an annual review is made by the chair or a personnel committee (with exceptions for appeals, as noted below), whereas the final decision in a probationary, tenure, or promotion review is made by the president based on independent assessments from the unit personnel committee, chair or director, college personnel committee, dean, and (in the case of tenure and promotion) the campus personnel committee.<p>Even though annual performance evaluations differ significantly from probationary, tenure, and promotion reviews, there are some common elements. Annual performance evaluations should be as similar as possible to the other reviews in terms of the categories of faculty work that are evaluated (e.g., teaching/instruction, research/creative activities, service); the definitions and scope of each of these kinds of faculty work, and the types of evidence that faculty are expected to provide for the review.<p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Procedures</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p><a href="acd002.html#departmentchair" target="New">Department chairs</a> and directors of academic units are responsible for conducting annual performance evaluations for all <a href="acd002.html#tenure" target="New">tenured</a> and <a href="acd002.html#ProbationaryAppointments" target="New">probationary</a> faculty.  Unit heads, supervising deans, and the campus provosts are responsible for ensuring the fair and consistent application of policy during annual performance evaluations.  Board of Regents&#146; policy requires that the unit&#146;s personnel committee or other peer evaluators must be involved, but it is the chair&#146;s or director&#146;s responsibility to see that these evaluations are completed by April 30 for all tenured and probationary faculty.<p>Faculty members are to be informed of the essential content of the evaluations.  To that end, procedures should:<p><ol><li> provide that each faculty member will be notified that he or she is expected to furnish to the unit head or peer committee, prior to the evaluation, information about the faculty member&#146;s performance and activities during the evaluation period.</li><p><li>provide that each faculty member will receive, annually, from his or her unit head, a letter commenting on his or her performance, including areas of strength, weakness, needed improvement, opportunities for growth, and expectations for future distribution of effort and performance<p>and</li><p><li>provide that the letter will include&#151;in the case of faculty who have not yet been tenured and/or promoted to full rank&#151;a statement that indicates that the procedures for the annual evaluation are not the same as the procedures for a tenure or promotion review.</li></ol><p>In years when merit money is available, such evaluations must guide the allocation of merit adjustments as provided in the unit&#146;s written plan.  However, the evaluations should be conducted whether or not merit money will be available.<p>For the annual performance evaluation to serve the three distinct purposes noted previously, it must be consistent with Board of Regents&#146; policy that guides annual performance evaluation, as well as Board of Regents&#146; and university policies governing salary adjustments and post-tenure review. To this end, the annual performance evaluation:<br><p><ol><li>should normally cover 36 months, with substantial emphasis on the current year for evaluation of teaching and instruction</li><p><li>must assess the faculty member&#146;s contributions in terms of teaching/instruction, research/creative activities, service, and contributions to the unit&#146;s affirmative action and diversity goals</li> <p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>Contributions to affirmative action and diversity goals may be incorporated into each of the other categories or may be consolidated into the service category.</td></tr></table><p><li>must provide four distinct measurements that distinguish between &#147;satisfactory&#148; and &#147;unsatisfactory&#148; performance in each of the following areas:  teaching/instruction, reseach/creative activities, service, and an overall assessment</li><p><li>must differentiate among various levels of &#147;satisfactory&#148; performance to guide decisions about merit-based salary adjustments (e.g., &#147;merit,&#148; &#147;exemplary,&#148; and &#147;high merit&#148;)</li><p><li>must be based on written expectations that both the faculty member and the unit head have agreed upon</li><p><li>must assess past performance as well as establish expectations for future distribution of effort and achievements</li><p><li>should take into account the distribution of effort across various types of faculty responsibilities, including negotiated flexible agreements<p>and</li><p><li>must be conducted each year, although units may differentiate between &#147;in depth&#148; evaluations conducted every three years and &#147;updated&#148; evaluations conducted annually by the chair.</li></ol><p>The criteria for and methods of determining the level of performance are guided by the written plan of the unit, but they must be consistent with college, university, and Board of Regents&#146; policies.  With regard to teaching, Board of Regents&#146; policy mandates &#147;a systematic assessment of student opinion be present [must be one] but not be the only component of the evaluation.&#148;  Additionally, the board requires consideration of &#147;student advising and mentoring whether classified as teaching or service.&#148;  Criteria for research/creative activities and service are specified at the unit level.<p>Distribution of effort for the unit as a whole normally will provide equal weights to teaching/instruction and to research/creative activities.  The distribution for individual faculty, however, may differ from the unit standard provided that a flexible performance agreement has been negotiated between the faculty member and the unit head, in accord with unit policies governing such agreements.  Normally, flexible performance arrangements will be available only to tenured faculty. The implications of such agreements for promotion to full professor must be considered.<p>Faculty who participate as affiliated or &#147;core&#148; faculty in another unit (department, center, institute, or program) may document their contributions to these programs and (if documented) these contributions should be taken into account in the annual performance evaluation.<p><hr><font size=+1><b> Appeals</b></font><p>Faculty may request a review of his or her performance evaluation to the next-higher administrative level above the person who made the initial performance recommendation.  For example, if a program director who is responsible to a department chair made the initial recommendation, the individual could request a review from the department chair, whereas if the department chair made the initial evaluation the individual could request a review from the dean.  The request for such a review must be made within 30 <a href="acd002.html#day">days</a> after the individual receives his or her written evaluation.  The final decision lies with the reviewer, who must complete the review within 30 days after it is requested. <p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>Thirty days is measured in 30 work days, summer excluded.</td></tr></table><p>There are no procedures for hearings unless a grievance is alleged.<p>Appeals of salary decisions may also be made.  Grounds for an appeal of salary decisions shall be failure to implement the unit&#146;s approved evaluation and salary plan consistently.  Appeals shall be filed first at the unit level and, if necessary, then at the next administrative level.  For colleges with departments, the unit appeal process shall be approved by a vote of the unit&#146;s faculty and academic professionals, and the college appeal process shall be approved by a vote of the college&#146;s faculty and academic professionals.  For colleges without departments, the college appeal process shall be approved by a vote of the college&#146;s faculty and academic professionals, and the appeal process at the next administrative level shall be determined by the provost in consultation with the college faculty and academic professionals.<p>An individual may grieve deviation from the Board of Regents&#146; or university&#146;s policies and procedures to the appropriate grievance committee.  Grievances based on discrimination are referred to the Office of Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action (EO/AA)<p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>For further information on promotion and tenure, see:<br><p><ol><li><a href="acd506-05.html">ACD 506&#150;05</a>, &#147;Promotion&#148;<p>and</li><p><li><a href="acd506-06.html">ACD 506&#150;06</a>, &#147;Evaluation for Tenure and Promotion.&#148;</li></ol><p>&#160;<p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
