The creation of the ASU Digital         Gateway will aggregate and leverage the university&#8217;s online resources         for the benefit of the community.</p>      <p> ASU&#8217;s online resources will serve the needs of teachers planning         curriculums, and provide interactive tools for learning and online discussion.         Students will be able to learn about research underway at the university,         and even pose questions to our researchers. Parents will find our online         resources equally valuable, and are certain to become more involved in         their children&#8217;s learning. </p></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
