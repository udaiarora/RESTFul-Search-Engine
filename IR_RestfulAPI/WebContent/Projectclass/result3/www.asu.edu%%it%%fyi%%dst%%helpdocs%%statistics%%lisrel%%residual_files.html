What are the LISREL junk files for and how to get rid of them?
</center></h2>
<p>
LISREL 8.3 at the end of each execution creates 2 files in addition to 
its output file. One of these files has a .DSF extension and is the Data 
System file.  The other has a .MSF extension and is the Model System file.
The creation of these 2 files is by design and they currently do not 
serve any useful purpose.  However, sometime in the long term future, 
the software vendor has plans to make a utility available that will use 
these files and create path diagrams.
<p>
To get rid of these file simply execute the following commands:
<blockquote>
rm -i *.DSF
<p>
rm -i *.MSF
</blockquote>
