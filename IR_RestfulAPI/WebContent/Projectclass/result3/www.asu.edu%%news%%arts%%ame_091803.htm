        Gary Hill's work in video and installation art has opened new possibilities
          for the use of developing media. Internationally exhibited, his work
          has been studied for its contributions to art as language and thinking
          as well as for its innovative uses of technology. Hill's lecture complements
          his exhibition, Language Willing, at the ASU Art Museum. </p>

        in motion capture and analysis, gesture recognition, media flow architecture,
        interactive environments and collaborative multimedia works. The final
        work will be presented in the world premiere of motione in April 2005. </p>

          County's Haven House shelter serves as a vehicle for the empowerment
          of domestic violence survivors as they learn interdisciplinary art
          skills and increase computer competency. The research explores a storytelling-centered
          learning experience in which shelter residents contribute images, text
          and sound bites toward the development of an interactive Web site and
          DVD on the subject of breaking the cycle of domestic violence and homelessness. </p>
