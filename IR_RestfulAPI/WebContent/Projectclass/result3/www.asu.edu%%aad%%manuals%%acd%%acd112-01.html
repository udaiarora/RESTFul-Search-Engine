<b><font size=+2>A.  Introduction</font></b>

<p>The Board of Regents, the university president, the <a href="acd002.html#facultymember">faculty</a> and <a href="acd002.html#academicprofessional">academic professionals</a>, and the administrators of ASU recognize the importance of providing efficient procedures for fair resolution of grievances without fear of retaliation on the part of persons involved.
Several avenues of appeal are available to grievants within the university. The preferred option is to resolve grievances internally at the level closest to the grievant(s) (i.e., chair or dean level). The <a href="acd002.html#academicunit">academic unit</a> and/or college ombudspersons facilitate this process. If the grievant(s) does not choose to follow this route, or this route has not provided acceptable resolution, the grievant(s) may use appropriate procedures as described in the <i>Academic Affairs Policies and Procedures Manual&#151; </i><a href="acd509-02.html">ACD 509&#150;02</a>, &#147;Grievance Policies and Procedures for Faculty,&#148; or <a href="acd509-03.html">ACD 509&#150;03</a>, &#147;Grievance Policies and Procedures for Academic Professionals.&#148;

<p>While grievant(s) are urged to seek resolution through an ombudsperson first, they are not obligated to do so. Faculty may take their case to the Clearinghouse Committee for assignment to one of three grievance hearing committees: The Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure, the Governance Grievance Committee, or the Board on Equal Opportunity. Academic Professionals may take their case to the Academic Professional Grievance Committee. The composition and general functions of each of these committees are described below. The detailed policies and procedures of each of these committees may be found in the <i>Academic Affairs Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i>ACD 509&#150;02, &#147;Grievance Policies and Procedures for Faculty,&#148; and ACD 509&#150;03, &#147;Grievance Policies and Procedures for Academic Professionals.&#148; Changes in these grievance policies and procedures require Academic Senate approval. The right of a faculty member or academic professional to be heard by the appropriate board or committee shall not be restricted.

<p>
<b><font size=+2>B.  Academic Grievance Procedures</font></b><br>

	<p>
	<b><font size=+1>1.  Ombudspersons</font></b><br>

		<p>
		<ol type="a"><li>A grievant may seek resolution through the faculty 
		<a href="acd002.html#ombudsperson">ombudsperson</a> or  an academic professional 
		ombudsperson.</li>
		
		<p>
		<li>Annually the faculty ombudsperson shall report to the senate and university 
		president a summary of the caseload for the year and any recommendations for policy or procedure changes arising from the work of the ombudsperson.</li>
		</ol>
	
		
	<p>
	<b><font size=+1>2.  Grievance committees</font></b><br>
	
	<p>A grievant may seek a formal hearing before a grievance hearing body. For faculty 
	that body is selected by the Clearinghouse Committee. For academic professionals, the 
	hearing body is the Academic Professional Grievance Committee. Detailed procedures 
	may be found in the <i>Academic Affairs Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i> 
	ACD 509&#150;02, &#147;Grievance Policies and Procedures for Faculty,&#148; or 
	ACD 509&#150;03, &#147; Grievance Policies and Procedures for Academic 
	Professionals.&#148;
	
		<p>
		&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i><b>a.  The Clearinghouse Committee</b></i><br>

			<blockquote><p>
			<ol><li>The committee shall be composed of the chairs of the Committee on 
			Academic Freedom and Tenure, the Board on Equal Opportunity, and the 
			Governance Grievance Committee.</li>
			
			<p>
			<li>The chair of the committee shall be rotated among the members, beginning 
			with the chair of the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure, followed by 
			the chair of the Board on Equal Opportunity, and then the chair of the Governance 
			Grievance Committee. The chair will serve one year, beginning June 1.</li>
			
			<p>
			<li>Functions of the committee
			
			<p>
			Upon written request of a grievant(s), the committee shall decide which of the three 
			grievance committees (noted above) shall hear the grievance. Jurisdictional 
			decisions shall be made with all three members present and shall be based on state 
			law; Board of Regents&#146; policies; and university rules and regulations, including 
			guidelines of the respective grievance committees. A two-thirds majority vote shall 
			decide the question. However, the grievant(s) may ask the committee to reconsider 
			its assignment; any decision after such reconsideration is final.</li>

		<ol type="a"><li>Senate committees generally will deal with matters of policy 
		which pertain to two or more colleges or schools or to the university as a whole.</li>
			
		<p>
		<li>Senate committees may, by majority vote, request the Committee on

		dissolve when its task is completed or it may be dissolved by majority vote of the 
		senate committee that requested its establishment.</li>

	specific task related to an area of responsibility common to both the senate and that 
	standing committee.<br>

	<p>
	<ol type="1"><li>Prior to February 1, the Committee on Committees shall prepare a list 
	of candidates for each vacancy. The list shall include two candidates for president-elect of 
	the Academic Assembly and two candidates for secretary of the Academic Assembly.  
	The number of candidates for elected committees shall exceed the number of vacancies.</li>

	<p>
	<li>The chair of the Committee on Committees shall take all steps necessary to ensure 
	that the first issue of <i>Insight</i> with a publication date after February 7 will  include an 
	announcement of the election, the list of candidates prepared by the  committee, and a 
	call for nominees.</li>
	
	<p>
	<li>A candidate named in a petition signed by at least 50 members of the Academic 
	Assembly and received by the chair of the Committee on Committees before 5:00 p.m. 
	on the 15th day following the publication of the first <i>Insight</i> containing the 
	election information specified in III.A.2. shall be placed on the ballot.</li>
	
	<p>
	<li>When the ballot includes more than two candidates for an office, the ballot shall be 
	prepared for preferential voting for that office, as specified in <i>Robert&#146;s Rules of Order,</i> latest revision, and the results of the election shall be determined as described 
	therein.</li>

	<p>
	<li>Prior to March 15, the chair of the Committee on Committees shall send an appropriate electronic or printed ballot to each member of the Academic Assembly. An electronic ballot must have the capability of recording who has voted in the election and must insure that no one may vote more than once in the election. Any printed ballot shall be provided with an unmarked inner envelope, in which the completed ballot is to be sealed, and a second addressed outer envelope, in which the sealed ballot is to be returned, and both shall be sent with each ballot. The outer envelope shall also include designated spaces for the signature and printed name of the elector.</li>

	<p>
	<li>The duration of the election shall be no less than ten days and include no more than a single weekend period. Only those ballots received prior to 5:00 p.m. on the final day of balloting shall be 
	valid. A ballot that arrives later shall be set aside unopened and preserved for 30 days 
	after the results of the election have been ratified.</li>

	<p>
	<li>A committee of three tellers shall be appointed by the senate president from a list 
	of six senators provided by the Committee on Committees, subject to the conditions 
	that<br>

		<p>
		<ol type="a"><li>no teller may have served as a teller for the Academic Assembly 
		election of the preceding year</li>

		<p>
		<li>no teller may have served on the Committee on Committees during the 12 
		months prior to March 15</li>

		<p>
		<li>the Executive Committee shall approve the appointments and the senate president 
		shall instruct the tellers prior to the election.</li>
		</ol>

	<p>
	<li>The printed ballots:<br>

		<p>
		<ol type="a"><li>Only the three tellers acting together shall open an outer envelope. The outer 
	envelope shall be opened only after the signature and name on it have been certified 
	and the receipt of the ballot recorded. The ballot, still in its sealed, unmarked envelope, 
	is then to be placed in a closed container. All  signed envelopes shall be preserved for 30 
	days after the results of the election have been ratified. If a second ballot is received 
	from a member of the Academic Assembly, it shall be set aside unopened. An outer 
	envelope, which does not include a name and signature that can be certified, shall be set 
	aside unopened. All envelopes set aside for these reasons shall be preserved for 30 days 
	after the results have been ratified.</li>
	
	<p>
	<li>The unmarked envelopes shall not be opened before 5:00 p.m. on the final day of balloting. The three tellers acting as a group shall open the container and the sealed envelopes and shall determine the validity of each ballot for each contested office. A ballot shall be excluded from the tabulation only for those contests for which the markings on the ballot are incorrect. The tellers shall report the results of the election to the president of the Academic Assembly within one week of the final day of balloting.</li>
</ol>	
	<p>
	<li>The electronic ballots:<br>

		<p>
		<ol type="a"><li>The electronic ballots shall not be tallied before 5:00 p.m. on the final day of balloting. The electronic tally shall be performed in the presence of the three tellers acting as a group. The tellers shall determine that no voter cast more than a single ballot. For any voter determined to have cast both an electronic and a print ballot, the electronic ballot shall be removed from the system, and the tellers shall determine that the electronic votes of that individual have been deducted from the electronic vote tally.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>

<p>
<b><font size=+2>B.  Ratification of the Election</font></b><br>

	<p>
	<ol type="1"><li>The tellers&#146; report to the president of the senate shall be conveyed to the Executive Committee before the last scheduled meeting of the academic year. If necessary, the Executive Committee shall hold a special meeting for this purpose.</li>
	
	<p>
	<li>The Executive Committee shall ratify the election and report the results at the last 
	senate meeting of the academic year.</li>

	<p>
	<li>At the last senate meeting of the academic year, the president of the senate will 
	entertain any motion brought forward that protests the procedures of the election.</li>
	
	<p>
	<li>If a motion of protest is seconded, a vote of the Academic Assembly will be taken to ratify or reject the election.</li>

	<p> 
	<li>Results of the ratified election shall be reported in <i>Insight</i> within 14 days after
