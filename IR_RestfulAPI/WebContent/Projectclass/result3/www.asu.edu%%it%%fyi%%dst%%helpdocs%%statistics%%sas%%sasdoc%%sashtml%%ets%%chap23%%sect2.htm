<P><A NAME="idxtf20006">&#13;</A>The examples shown in the following sections illustrate
the basic process you will use with the Forecasting System.
<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<P><H3><I>Specify the Input Data Set</I></H3>
Suppose you have a number of <I>time series</I>, variables recorded over time,
for which you want to forecast future values.
The past values of these time series are stored as variables
in a SAS data set or data view.
The observations of this data set correspond to regular time periods,
such as days, weeks, or months.
The first step in the forecasting process is to tell the system to use
this data set by setting the <TT>Data Set</TT> field.
<P>If your time series are not in a SAS data set,
you must provide a way for the SAS System to access the data.
You can use SAS features to read your data into a SAS data set;
refer to <I>SAS Language Reference</I>.
You can use a SAS/ACCESS product to establish a view of data in a
database management system; refer to SAS/ACCESS documentation.
You can use PROC SQL to create a SAS data view.
You can use PROC DATASOURCE to read data from files supplied by supported
data vendors; refer to <A HREF="../chap10/index.htm">Chapter 10, &#34;The DATASOURCE Procedure,&#34;</A> for more details.
<P><H3><I>Provide a Valid Time ID Variable</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxtf20007">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf20008">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf20009">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf20010">&#13;</A>To use the Forecasting System, your data set must be dated:
the data set must contain a <I>time ID variable</I> that gives the
date of each observation.
The time ID variable must represent the observation dates with
<I>SAS date values</I>
or with <I>SAS datetime values</I>
(for hourly data or other frequencies less than a day),
or you can use a simple time index.
<P>When SAS date values are used,
the ID variable contains dates within
the time periods corresponding to the observations.
For example, for monthly data, the values for the time ID variable may be
the date of the first day of the month corresponding to each observation,
or the time ID variable may contain the date of the last day in the month.
(Any date within the period will serve as the time ID for the observation.)
<P>If your data set already contains a valid time ID variable
with SAS date or datetime values,
the next step is to specify this time ID variable in the <TT>Time ID</TT> field.
If the time ID variable is named DATE,
the system fills in the <TT>Time ID</TT> field automatically.
<P>If your data set does not contain a time ID, you must
add a valid time ID variable before beginning the forecasting process.
The Forecasting System provides features that make this easy to do.
See <A HREF="../chap24/index.htm">Chapter 24, &#34;Creating Time ID Variables,&#34;</A> for details.
<P><H3><I>Select and Fit a Forecasting Model for each Series</I></H3>
If you are using the automated model selection feature,
the system performs this step for you and chooses a forecasting
model for each series automatically.
All you need to do is select the <TT>Fit Models Automatically</TT> button
and then select the variables to fit models for.
<P>If you want more control over forecasting model selection,
you can select the <TT>Develop Models</TT> button,
select the series you want to forecast,
and use the Develop Models window to specify a forecasting model.
As part of this process, you may use the <TT>Time Series Viewer</TT>
and <TT>Model Viewer</TT> graphical tools.
Once you have selected a model for the first series,
you can select a different series to work with
and repeat the model development process until you have
created forecasting models for all the series you want to forecast.
<P>The system provides many features to help you choose the best
forecasting model for each series. The features of the Develop Models
window and graphical viewer tools are introduced in later sections.
<P><H3><I>Produce the Forecasts</I></H3>
Once a forecasting model has been fit for each series,
select the <TT>Produce Forecasts</TT> button
and use the Produce Forecasts window to compute forecast
values and store them in a SAS data set.
<P><H3><I>Save Your Work</I></H3>
If you want only a single forecast, your task is now complete.
But you may want to produce updated forecasts later,
as more data becomes available.
In this case, you want to save the forecasting models you
have created, so that you will not need to repeat the model
selection and fitting process.
<P>To save your work, fill in the <TT>Project</TT> field
with the name of a SAS catalog member in which the system
will store the model information when you exit the system.
Later, you will select the same catalog member name when
you first enter the Forecasting System, and the model information
will be reloaded.
<P>Note that any number of people can work with the same project file.
If you are working on a forecasting project as part of a team,
you should take care to avoid conflicting updates to the project file
by different team members.
<P><H3><I>Summary</I></H3>
This is the basic outline of how the Forecasting System works.
The system offers many other features and options that you may need to use
(for example, the time range of the data used to fit models and how far into
the future to forecast).
These options will become apparent as you work with the Forecasting System.
<P>As an introductory example,
the following sections use the
<TT>Automatic Model Fitting</TT> and <TT>Produce Forecasts</TT> windows
to perform automated forecasting of the
series in an example data set.
