				<h1>New Look For DARS</h1>
				
				<p class="article">An end-to-end transformation for the degree audit system has kept university technical staff busy for a year, but a seamless transition is expected when students see the results in October.</p>
				<p class="article">The degree audit is an automated report that matches courses a student has completed with the requirements of a particular academic degree program. Students can request copies of their degree audit reports by logging in at the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/interactive/"><acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> Interactive Web site</a> and selecting &ldquo;Request&#47;View Your Degree Audit (<acronym title="Degree Audit Reporting System">DARS</acronym>)&rdquo;. The new system will return audits immediately, so students will no longer have a time delay.</p>
				<p class="article">The newest version of the Degree Audit Reporting System (DARS) provides bar charts and pie chart graphics that help students view their academic progress in a quick and easy-to-read way. Another new DARS feature that students will likely find appealing is the ability to expand or collapse course lists. The lists can now be viewed or printed by category in an outline format, rather than as one long printout.</p>
				<p class="article">The updates to the system are just the most visible part of a complete overhaul of the DARS application by its developers at Miami University. Since the new system displays information in a Web interface that runs in Windows, the application itself is now referred to as <acronym title="Degree Audit Reporting Windows System">DARWin</acronym>.</p>
				<p class="article">DARWin marks a transition for DARS from a mainframe application to a server application. Itâ??s the kind of change that affects many areas in <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>, and other parts of the university â?? because administrative, networking, database, and mainframe staff all have to be involved to make the implementation of the new system work.</p>
				<p class="article">Phase II of the DARWin rollout will be new Web interfaces for administrative functions.  Interfaces will be provided for the academic advisors to record student minors, certificates and emphasis areas, and to make necessary modifications to the individual studentâ??s degree program.  Another interface will allow DARWin to process transfer transcripts and post evaluation and articulation decisions back to the Student Information System.  The Graduation Office will be able to run audits to verify that graduating students have completed degree requirements.</p>
				<p class="article">The rollout is estimated to be completed at the end of the Spring semester of 2006.</p>
