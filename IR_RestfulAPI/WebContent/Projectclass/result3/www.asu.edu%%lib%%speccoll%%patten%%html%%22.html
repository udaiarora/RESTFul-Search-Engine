<P>Cogan has written an early health and nutrition book that also discusses
the recent plague at Oxford. It encourages "labour" or exercise of both
the body and the mind for good health. Cogan discusses the merits of various
foods and beverages, giving their histories when known, as well as their
medicinal properties. The author includes recipes for ales and other drinks.
He also has a section on the importance of sleep, including why night is
a better time to sleep than daytime and what kind of bed and sleep position
are best. Issues of love and lust are also covered, to complete the author's
discussion of the factors influencing good health.
