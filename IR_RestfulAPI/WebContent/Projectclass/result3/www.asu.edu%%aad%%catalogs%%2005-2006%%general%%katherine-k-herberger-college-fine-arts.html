Purpose</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts at ASU provides both preprofessional and professional education in the arts disciplines and an opportunity for nonmajors to become culturally literate through participation in the creative and performing arts.</p>
<p>
The college, through its programs in art, dance, music, and theatre, reflects a wide range of challenges facing the contemporary artist and scholar. The arts, as an integral part of the curriculum, offer the student a rewarding educational experience balanced and strengthened by studies in related fine arts areas, the humanities, social sciences, and the natural sciences.</p>
<p>
In addition to professional curricula offered in each department and school, the college provides courses designed to meet the specific educational needs of students pursuing majors in other colleges throughout the university. The cultural life of the university community is further enriched by study opportunities offered at off-campus sites. The Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts also offers community audiences many hours of cultural enjoyment through a myriad of art exhibitions, music and dance concerts, dramatic productions, operas, lectures, and seminars.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Organization</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The college houses the School of Art, the Department of Dance, the School of Music, and the Department of Theatre. An average of 2,600 students per semester enroll as majors in various degree programs offered through these units. The college also includes the ASU Art Museum and the Institute for Studies in the Arts.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Admission</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Students meeting the university requirements for admission may matriculate in the Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts. Separate admission procedures and approvals are required for some programs within the college. Students must contact specific departments or schools for details.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Transfer of Community College Credits.</b>
<a id="a22738"></a> 
The university standards for evaluation of transfer credit are listed under 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a11716">Transfer Credit</a>. Transfer students are encouraged to contact their department or school or the Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts Undergraduate Student Academic Services (GHALL 116) to ensure a smooth transition to the Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts. Credits transferred from any accredited junior or community college may be accepted up to a maximum of 64 semester hours. (A community college student planning to transfer at the end of his or her first or second year should plan to take community college courses that meet the requirements of the ASU curriculum selected. Students attending Arizona community colleges are permitted to follow the degree requirements specified in the ASU <i>
General Catalog</i>
 in effect at the time they began their community college work, providing their college attendance has been continuous.)</p>
<p>
Courses transferred from community colleges are not accepted as upper-division credit at ASU. Arizona students are urged to refer to the <i>
Course Applicability System</i>
 for transferability of specific courses from Arizona community colleges. For more information, access the Web site at 
<a href="http://ag.transfer.org/cag">ag.transfer.org/cag</a>.</p>
<p>
In choosing courses at a community college, students should be aware that a minimum of 45 hours of work taken at the university must be upper-division credits. While attending a community college, it is suggested that students select courses similar to ASU General Studies lower-division courses in the major field.</p>
<p>
For optimal course selection, access the ASU Transfer Guides on the Web at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/provost/articulation">www.asu.edu/provost/articulation</a>.</p></div>

College Degree Requirements</b>
<a id="a30730"></a></h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts degree requirements supplement the General Studies requirement. Descriptions of additional required courses follow. Students are encouraged to consult with an academic advisor to ensure that they comply with all necessary requirements.</p>
<p>
Fine arts majors must take at least six semester hours of fine arts course work in areas outside of the major school or department. These courses may be in art, dance, music, or theatre. A student may concurrently fulfill this requirement and the humanities and fine arts portion of the General Studies requirement by selecting approved courses as indicated in the <i>
Schedule of Classes.</i>
 This requirement may also be met by taking <i>
any</i>
 Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts course outside of the student&#8217;s major.</p>
<p>
All BA degrees require the equivalent of 16 semester hours in one foreign language except for the BA degrees in Theatre and Art with concentrations in digital art and studio </p>
<p>
art. Foreign language study is strongly recommended but not required for these degree programs. Course work may be selected in any language and must follow the sequence of language courses 101, 102, 201, and 202. This requirement may be fulfilled at the secondary school level or by examination. If acquired in secondary school, two years of instruction in one foreign language is considered the equivalent of one year of college instruction. Transfer students are placed in language study at the level above completed work.</p>
<p>
Candidates for the BM degree in Performance with a concentration in voice have specific foreign language requirements, which are stated in the degree requirements. There is no foreign language requirement for other concentrations of the BFA or BM degrees.</p></div>

However, to gain admission into certain undergraduate degree programs in the college, students must maintain a minimum GPA within their major and/or a minimum cumulative GPA. These minimum GPAs vary according to the given program.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Probation.</b> 
Any student who does not maintain good standing is placed on academic probation. A student on academic probation is required to observe any limitations or rules the college may impose as a condition for retention.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Disqualification.</b> 
A student who is on probation becomes disqualified if the student (1) has not returned to good standing or (2) has not met the required semester GPA.</p>
<p>
Disqualification is exercised at the discretion of the college and becomes effective on the first day of the fall or spring semester following college action. A disqualified student is notified by the Office of the Registrar and/or the dean of the college and is not allowed to register for a fall or spring semester at the university until reinstated. A student who is disqualified may not attend as a nondegree student.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Reinstatement.</b>

<h2>
Major Requirements</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The minimum requirement for a baccalaureate degree is the completion of 120 semester hours with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00. Of these 120 semester hours, at least 45 must be selected from upper-division courses.</p>
<p>

<a id="a18165"></a> 
The BA degree requires from 45 to 69 semester hours for the major. Depending on the major, 18 to 24 hours must be selected from upper-division (300- or 400-level) courses. The semester-hour requirements in the major are distributed between a field of specialization (30 to 53 hours) and one or more related fields. The exact content of the major is selected by a student in consultation with an advisor under the rules and regulations of the department or school concerned. A successful entrance audition is also required for admission to the BA degree in Music program.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) Degree.</b> 
The BFA degree requires 52 to 79 semester hours for the major. At least 30 of these hours, depending on the major, must be selected from upper-division (300- or 400-level) courses. The curriculum for the major is designed as preprofessional study. Auditions are required for entrance into Dance major classes, and auditions and/or interviews are required for admission into the BFA program in Dance. Specific information can be obtained through the department&#8217;s Advisement Office. </p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Bachelor of Music (BM) Degree.</b> 
The BM degree requires 79 semester hours for the major. The required number of upper-division (300- or 400-level) courses is dependent upon the area of specialization.

<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Academic Standards.</b> 
The terms of disqualification, reinstatement, and appeals are consistent with those set forth by the university under 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a27839">Retention and Academic Standards</a>. In addition, a student disqualified in any program is normally not eligible for reinstatement for two semesters.</p></div>

This wide spectrum of areas is supported by special programs and facilities that enrich the opportunities for professional training and musical growth. Music education and pedagogy are supplemented by the Piano and Guitar Preparatory Programs, the Music for Tots series, and special classes for certification in Orff and Kodály methods. Performance opportunities are enhanced by a wide variety of ensembles, including such groups as marimba, African drumming, and mariachi. Voice students may pursue training in opera or in Broadway musicals. Composition students work in the Electronic Music Studio, and all benefit from the Electronic Classroom, a state-of-the-art computer facility. A variety of community partnerships, including a gang intervention program, stem from the music therapy area. The scope and variety of the School of Music&#8217;s programs are made possible by the wide range of expertise of the faculty, who are performers, teachers, conductors, composers, and scholars recognized nationally and internationally.</p></div>

Department of Theatre. 
The Department of Theatre&#8217;s BA degree features a broad liberal arts education. The program&#8217;s mission is to educate imaginative, knowledgeable, skilled, and responsible artists, teachers, scholars, audience members, and advocates for the theatre of the future. Special strengths of the department include internationally acclaimed programs in theatre for youth; an outstanding playwriting area that infuses each specialization with new script work; multicultural courses; an acting concentration that allows work with nationally acclaimed directors and acting coaches; and a design and production area that provides for further specialization in costume, lighting, scene design, and theatre technology.</p>
<p>
Production is at the core of ASU theatre and the quality of the faculty, student body, and facilities attracts professionals to ASU. Four to six subscription series plays are produced annually in the 496-seat Galvin Playhouse and the smaller Lyceum Theatre. Additional student-directed shows are presented in the Prism Theatre and studios.</p>
<p>
Theatre-for-youth artists, students, and scholars are attracted to ASU by the opportunities to work on national K-12 theatre curricula and research projects, participate in theatre tours to area schools, and teach on and off campus. The Child Drama Special Collection in Hayden Library, which includes rare books, plays, and personal and national association archives, is the most complete and extensive collection of its kind in the English-speaking world and also contributes to the international recognition of the theatre-for-youth faculty.</p></div>
