 There are several ways to run a SAS program. You can use
</A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI><A name="z0761792">&#13; SAS Display Manager System, a windowing system that gives
you a text editor from which to submit programs, windows for the SAS log and
SAS output, and many other facilities</A><P>

<LI><A name="z0761793">&#13; interactive line mode, in which you submit programs
one
line at a time</A><P>

<LI><A name="z0761794">&#13; noninteractive mode, which executes a SAS program (stored
in a file) in your current terminal session</A><P>

<LI><A name="z0761795">&#13;
batch mode, which executes a SAS program (stored in a file) in a separate
session.</A><P>
</UL>

<P>The mode you use determines whether the graphics output
displays on your monitor. If you use display manager, interactive line mode,
or noninteractive mode, the SAS/GRAPH program
can display graphics output on your monitor as well as store the output in
a catalog.
<P>If you use batch mode, the graphics output is not displayed
on your monitor.  In this case, your program must send the graphics output
to a hardcopy device, permanent catalog, or a graphics stream file.  See <A href="z0696063.htm">SAS/GRAPH Output</A> for more
information on the destination of graphics output.
<P>Regardless of how you run your programs, SAS/GRAPH software
uses the values stored in the device entry or specified by graphics options
in a GOPTIONS statement to determine how to handle the graphics output.
<P>For more information on modes of operation, see <B>SAS Language Reference: Concepts</B>
and the SAS documentation for your operating environment.

<P><A name="z0761800">&#13;You can use RUN-group processing with the
GCHART, GMAP, GPLOT,
GREPLAY, and GSLIDE procedures to produce multiple graphs without restarting
the procedure every time.</A>
<P>To use RUN-group processing, you start the procedure
and then submit multiple RUN-groups. A <B>RUN-group</B> is a group of
statements that contains at least one action statement and ends with a RUN
statement. It can contain other SAS statements such as AXIS, BY, GOPTIONS,
LEGEND, TITLE, or WHERE.  As long as you do not end the procedure, it remains
active and you do not need to resubmit the PROC statement.
<P>To end RUN-group processing, submit a QUIT or RUN CANCEL
statement, or start a new procedure.
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When using SAS/GRAPH with
the ODS HTML statement, it is best to use the QUIT statement after each procedure
that uses RUN-group processing, rather than relying on a new procedure to
end the processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<BR><H3>With global and local statements</H3>


<P><A name="z0761803">&#13;
  Global
statements and NOTE statements that are submitted in
a RUN-group affect all subsequent RUN-groups until you cancel the statements
or exit the procedure. For example, each of these two RUN-groups produces
a plot and both plots display the title defined in the first RUN-group:  


</A>
<PRE>/* first run group*/
proc gplot data=sales;
   title1 'Sales Summary';
   plot sales*model_a;
run;

      /* second run group */
   plot sales*model_b;
run;
quit;</PRE>
<BR><H3>With BY statements</H3>


<P><A name="z0761804">&#13;
 BY statements persist in exactly the same way. Therefore, if
you submit a BY statement within a RUN-group, the BY-group processing produces
a separate graph for each value of the BY variable for the RUN-group in which
you submit it and for all subsequent RUN-groups until you cancel the BY statement
or exit the procedure. Thus, as you submit subsequent action statements, you
continue to get multiple graphs (one for each value of the BY variable). For
more information, see </A><A href="bychap.htm">BY Statement</A>.
<BR><H3>With the WHERE Statement</H3>


<P><A name="z0761805">&#13;
 The WHERE statement enables you to graph only a subset of the
data in the input data set. If you submit a WHERE statement with a RUN-group,
the WHERE definition remains in effect for all subsequent RUN-groups until
you exit the procedure or reset the WHERE definition.</A>
<P>Using a WHERE statement with RUN-group processing follows
most of the same rules as using the WHERE statement outside of RUN-group processing
with these exceptions: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>With the GMAP procedure, the WHERE variable must
be in the input data set.<P>

<LI>With a procedure that is using an Annotate data
set, the following requirements must be met: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>The ANNOTATE= option must be included in the action
statement.<P>

<LI>The WHERE statement must be executed before the
action statement.<P>

<LI>The WHERE variable must occur in the Annotate
data set.<P>
</UL>

</UL>
