      <h2>Faculty vote for president-elect in Academic Senate</h2>
      <p>Susan Mattson, professor of Nursing, and George G. Karady, professor of electrical engineering, both would like to serve as president-elect of ASU's Academic Assembly. </p>
      <p>Members of the Academic Assembly will make that decision in this spring's election. </p>
      <p>The Academic Senate office will e-mail instructions to all members of the Academic Assembly on the electronic voting process that begins the week of April 5. Deadline for returning ballots is April 16. </p>
      <p>Mattson, chair of the College of Nursing's Adult Health/Parent Child Division, has been on the faculty for nearly 11 years. </p>
      <p>As an Academic Senator for four years, she has watched change escalate at ASU, and she believes the pace will not slacken. </p>
      <p>"There are many issues and challenges facing the university community at this time. Salaries, promotion and tenure changes, plus/minus grading, health insurance, nonpermanent full-time faculty issues, increases in tuition and the university design team proposals - all continuing at full speed," she says. </p>
      <p>"I believe future Academic Senate presidents will be attending to these issues and challenges, in conjunction with the administration and the broader external community of Arizona. </p>
      <p>"The administration and Academic Senate must work together to view these challenges as opportunities, in an environment in which people are motivated to share great accomplishments." </p>
      <p>Mattson says that as Senate president, she would "continue to promote the endeavors of my predecessors in these areas, working cooperatively with faculty, administration and staff to achieve the best outcomes for all constituents. </p>
      <p>"I would like to have the opportunity to be the 'voice' of faculty through the shared governance at our university in these challenging and exciting days ahead." </p>
      <p>Mattson also has been chair of the College of Nursing's faculty governance assembly and a member of the university graduate council. </p>
      <p>Karady moved from industry to academia when he joined the ASU faculty in 1986. </p>
      <p>"I was proud to participate in the first phase of ASU's transformation to a diversified research university," he says. "This rewarding experience was both academic and personal. I witnessed the growth of the faculty Senate from a tolerated small body to a respected committee that significantly contributed to the creative development of the university. </p>
      <p>"Today, in fact, the leaders of ASU request opinions of the Senate and respect its suggestions." </p>
      <p>Karady says because he has benefited from the "diverse, multidisciplinary environment" for the last 18 years, he has the experience to serve as Academic Senate president. </p>
      <p>As president, he would work for effective communication of faculty and academic professional opinions and concerns to management. </p>
      <p>"The transfer of ASU into a leading university requires close cooperation between faculty, academic professionals and management. The Senate is the body that can facilitate this exchange of ideas." </p>
      <p>Karady was elected to the Academic Senate in 1989 and has served on numerous committees, including Financial Affairs, Academic Freedom and Tenure, Grievance Clearing House and Government Grievance. </p>
      <p>Voting members of the Academic Assembly are full-time faculty and academic professionals in tenure track and continuing status positions, including all administrators who have tenure and full-time and senior lecturers with three-year renewable contracts. </p>
      <p>For information, contact Darby Shaw at (480) 965-2222. </p>
      <p>Smith, with Public Relations, can be reached at (480) 965-4821 or (<a href="mailto:jps@asu.edu">jps@asu.edu </a>). </p>
