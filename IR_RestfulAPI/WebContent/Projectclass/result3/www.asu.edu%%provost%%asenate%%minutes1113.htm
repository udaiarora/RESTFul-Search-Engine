<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting was called to order at

3:20 p.m. by Senate President Doug Johnson.</font>

<p><b><font size=+0>2. Acceptance of Previous Minutes of October 16, 2000.</font></b>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The draft minutes of October 16, 2000,

were approved as corrected and published on the Academic Senate web site.

If there are further editorial corrections, please contact Darby Shaw at

the Senate office (965-9245).</font>

<p><b><font size=+0>3. Announcements and Communications.</font></b>

<br><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.A Senate President's Report</b>

(Douglas Johnson).</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you all for coming. There are

a number of items to cover today, and we will still try to finish by 4:30

p.m. We need your cooperation to keep our discussion within that time frame.

At our last meeting, people were leaving soon after 4:30 p.m.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been an exciting week with

the presidential election counts and recounts. There have even been protests

of the recounts. I guess in Arizona, we are still counting votes, but we

are pleased that Proposition 301 was successful. We have a number of issues

that the faculty will be faced with in the near future: Health care insurance;

many of you may know there has been discontinuance of services in the East

Valley Primary Care Physicians withdrawing from Intergroup. We are in the

process of filing a protest over that disruption of service. We are also

concerned that health care insurance prices are increasing dramatically

across the country, that the Department of Administration (in Arizona)

is in the process of re-bidding our contract a year earlier, and we are

trying to influence that bidding process. This topic will be discussed

at the Arizona Faculties Council meeting this afternoon in conjunction

with the Board of Regents meeting at U of A. We will keep you posted of

all new developments, but be prepared for a little bit of shock because,

unfortunately, we have a few insurance carriers who don?t believe they

are getting enough money from the university contract.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to call upon the representative

of the Provost for a report.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.B University Provost?s Report</b>

(Gale Hackett). I am sure you will all be disappointed to know that in

Dr. Glick?s absence, I have no report today (much clapping here).</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.C ASASU President?s Report</b>

(Alex Bainbridge).</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of exciting things for the

students: Proposition 301 passed. Thank you all very much. Also, we are

concerned about the Rio Salado Project and about the Tempe Town Center

and how that will affect the lives of students. Parking and infrastructure

on campus are other concerns we have. We will have to face these issues

over the next three to five years. A happy medium has been worked out about

parking in Structure I. Lot 59 may be replaced by a parking garage at some

point. We are working on web-based email for our students. It is just around

the corner. Information technology has it almost worked out (much clapping

here). Each semester students will be listing their email address along

with other information. Hopefully, we will all be able to keep in contact

and to send attachments back and forth. You should be able to check your

email anywhere now. It will be revolutionary for all our students on campus.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.D Past President?s Report</b>

(David Burstein).</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We tried to get Allan Price today,

and I am a poor substitute. As others said, Prop 301 passed. Equally important,

Prop 106 passed on redistricting. I hope that most of you supported both

of those.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legislative receptions are still

going on. Now there will be a large turnover in the legislature (it was

designed that way). The net effect of this is that there are a large number

of new people that need to be educated about what we are about as a university.

I am happy to say, I have met a number of these new people. I will mention

to you that the four people that I know, and have met recently, in my opinion

will offer us a breath of fresh air. I said all along when I was faculty

president that what we need in the legislature is not just someone who

is gung-ho over the university, but rather someone who can think for themselves

and is intelligent, and then we can make our case about the university.

There are three receptions this week. How many of you reside in District

27? That one is on Wednesday. Again you can sign on to ZSunDevils.com,

which has the directions and a map available. All receptions begin at 6:00

p.m. The one on Tuesday is in North Phoenix; the one on Wednesday is in

Tempe. The one on Thursday is in Mesa, District 29. In terms of propositions,

the impact of the propositions on us as a university system is probably

as good as we could expect, given the outcome of the voting process. Prop

301 will provide roughly 300 million dollars to the university system.

Both of the propositions, which will be giving money to health care from

the tobacco industry, have passed. By and large, it will not be that big

of a hit on the general fund, according to Alan Price?s analysis. What

I am not mentioning, the biggest hit on the general fund is the alt-fuel

issue. Even then, what we learned at the receptions is that the numbers

quoted in the media, such as 483 million, are guesstimates. Hopefully,

the legislature can take care of that this week. The bottom line for us

as a university, and as a university system, and for that matter education

in general in the state of Arizona, is that unless we are put into the

legislative scheme of things, into the general discussion of funding, upfront,

in terms of how the state wants to fund important items, we will continue

to get the leftovers. What I see around the university, and each of you

can probably attest to this within your unit, is the degree to which underfunding

controls what we can do for our students. If we want to reverse that, one

of the things that each of us can do as individuals is to attend our legislative

reception within our voting district, and voice our concerns to the legislators.

Only you can say what the lack of funding has done to your ability to help

your students. This country is run on anecdotes.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Brown: The last I heard, Mike

Gardner was 12 votes ahead. So, we are mirroring the national convention

(much laughter here). The other important thing I want to remind you of

is that you should all attend the coffees. The stranglehold has been broken,

and you may see some important new changes on the horizon.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past President Burstein: It could

be possible for Randall Gnant, if you believe the news, to become President

of the Senate. He told us at one of the legislative coffees that if he

did become president, he would strive for a rules change that would prevent

such an occurrence as the alt-fuel issue.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, each of our votes

counts.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: I myself

would like to see a gung-ho pro-university legislator come on line.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.E ASU East Senate Report</b> (Andy

Jackson).</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last Thursday we had our Academic

Assembly meeting, and we changed our format this time. At that meeting,

we knew that Prop 301 had passed and the Provost gave us an update. At

East Campus we have about 24 million dollars coming to us as a result of

our intensive capital investment program. We are in the process of signing

another agreement that will bring another 18 million to the campus for

capital improvements on our housing. There will be a big change in the

East Campus atmosphere over the next two to three years. The other thing

we spent our time on last Thursday was Learner Centered Education. We discussed

it as members of the Assembly, and then asked our students to give us their

input as well. I suggest that at Main Campus you also include students

in this discussion. We plan to carry our discussion to the Regents in January.

This coming Thursday, the Board will focus primarily on the Whistleblower

Policy, and at their January meeting they will probably focus on Learner

Centered Education.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: I have asked

Dean Anne Schneider to address the process of studying Promotion and Tenure

Guidelines for this campus. She has chaired the Task Force on Promotion

and Tenure, hard at work this year.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.F Dean Anne Schneider</b>: Some

of you may already know where we are, because we have posted our issues

on the web site of the Center for Learning and Teaching Excellence (CLTE).

In this process, we are trying to schedule three open hearings. One could

be next Monday, then one the week after Thanksgiving, and one on Reading

Day in December, if we can find rooms. The Task Force has worked for the

past year. We have agreed on a number of things, and we are studying a

way to use policy conventions to make these as concrete recommendations.

Many of you may remember a task force report on teaching, then one on service,

which both came out with thick documents. Then nothing ever happened. Our

task force took another tack in trying to figure out what we could accomplish

concretely, how might we actually do that, and what are the policy tools

that will allow us to do that. University policy should be the broad umbrella,

and the unit policy should be more specific and not as detailed. There

is a lot of diversity around the campus, and we do not want to handcuff

units in doing what they see as being appropriate. But it does need to

be within a broad understanding. The major changes we have summarized in

the one-page hand-out that you received today.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say that the most central

discussion elements of our report are the standards for promotion and tenure.

The task force recognized that in many units across the university, research

has been the only thing that you had to be "excellent" in. Mediocre teaching

or mediocre or non-existent service would have been sufficient. This is

not true in most units, but certainly is thought to be true for some. Terrific

teaching and mediocre research would have not been a successful combination.

The standard of research should appropriately be excellence, and if units

are not there yet, they should be. In addition, the standards for teaching

should also be excellence. With regard to service, our sentiment is that

in promotion from assistant to associate, junior faculty are shielded to

some extent from service. We tend to shield them to some extent from service,

particularly university, college and department service. The standard there

should be that you should have satisfactory or effectiveness in service,

but not excellence, at that point in their career. In departments where

Public Service is central to their mission, they could certainly have a

much higher standard for service. Then, with regard to promotion from associate

to full professor, we are trying to accomplish greater flexibility, along

the same lines as what was adopted for post-tenure review. We need to have

an overall record of excellence, and most faculty will continue to have

excellence in teaching, research and service, but that some faculty, a

few, may choose to spend more of their time on things they do best. This

will also benefit units, if some faculty spend more of their time on the

things that they do best. Therefore, it would be possible to be promoted

to full professor, based on an overall record of excellence, even if not

all three areas were at that same level, depending on the distribution

or effort.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to raise the standard for

teaching, I think we all realize that we need to have better evaluation

of teaching, more analogous to that which we use for research. And, we

are looking for ways to insure that there is actually a review of the instructional

material. I know that can be kind of a hot button issue. Your colleagues

at colleges around the country in fact review your research. What we are

asking is that we develop something analogous for teaching. We want to

revise our policy language to broaden the concept of faculty work, so that

things that involve integration across the categories of teaching, research

and service are recognized as integrated faculty work. We just do not want

things to fall through the crack on that score. The ACD Manual, as we looked

at it, does not provide us with common definitions, common evidentiary,

and there are places where the ACD Manual is actually contradictory. One

of the things we are doing is making concrete recommendations in the ACD

language. We will make recommendations for change on the letter that the

Vice Provost sends out to trigger review for promotion and tenure. A letter

could also be sent that triggers the annual performance evaluation, although

I do not think there is one now. The third thing we are looking at, assuming

that the Senate approves our recommendations for change, is that the units

will have to review their personnel policies to make sure that they are

brought into line with those changes; also, that they are in line with

current university policy on a number of counts, where they may not be

now. We will post our final report when it is completed. It will be on

the Center for Learning and Teaching web page, for all of you to review.

If you have comments, you may still send them to me. I have posted them

as well on that web page. Are there any questions or comments?</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Saenz: You talked about greater

flexibility and overall excellence, in promotion from associate to full.

How do you reconcile that type of guideline with the university?s push

to maintain Research I status, and to double the amount of research funding

for the university?</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean Schneider: That is a good question.

I think the university still has a high priority for excellence in teaching

and instruction. Over the thirty years a person may have after they are

tenured, some would contribute more to their units by concentrating on

the thing that they do best, and for some that may be teaching, and for

some public service, and for some research. Not everyone has to continue

doing the same thing with exactly the same distribution of effort.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Saenz: Then there is not some

incompatibility in what you are proposing?</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean Schneider: I do not think there

is. In the ideal world, someone who really loves teaching would concentrate

more of their effort on that, and someone who loves research and isn?t

such a hot teacher, would do more of that, but in fact we could value those

two people equally, and each could spend a little more time on what they

do best. That ideal world is a long way off, because that is not the way

the academic culture is right now. I would hope that this kind of change

would in no way detract from our ability to maintain Research I status.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Cochran: Could you say a few

words about the relationship of your recommendations to post-tenure review?

Does this describe at length how one gets promoted, or what the initiatives

are? And, if a faculty member is fired after they already have tenure,

because there is a different set of criteria and weights, what is the intent

of the task force with respect to post-tenure review at the unit level?</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean Schneider: Post-tenure review,

as you know, now permits flexibility, and promotion to full does not permit

flexibility. So, our intent is to bring those things closer together. We

did not think it is fair that faculty could negotiate a flexible agreement

with their unit, which we assume means that they are going to be maximizing

their contribution to their unit under post-tenure review, that they should

not then set themselves up in such a way that would prevent their being

promoted to full professor. We are trying to bring those two things closer

together.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: If you want

to make a quick escape, Anne, we will allow thirty seconds of silence (much

laughter here). I do want to thank Anne for coming to speak to us; this

task force is doing important work for the university, to shape things

for years to come. A lot of work is still to be done, and you as senators

will have an opportunity to influence the process by coming to these open

hearings as they are scheduled.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of the email list was discussed

to notify faculty of the dates of upcoming open meetings.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The greatest task this task force

may face is harmonizing the language that has occurred at different times,

post-tenure review, and language in the promotion and tenure model. It

is also an opportunity for all of us to go back to our units and to review

our bylaws on promotion and tenure policy. Some policy may need to be updated.

I realize this is a tedious process to accomplish, but in truth it could

prevent some future grievances at the Academic Senate Office, in having

your bylaws up to date that is.</font>

<p><b><font size=+0>4.&nbsp; Open Forum.</font></b>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No items were presented for discussion.</font>

<p><b><font size=+0>5.&nbsp; Unfinished Business (Motions for Second Reading).</font></b>

<br><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.A Executive Committee</b> (Douglas

Johnson).</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to report that the Tellers

Committee has submitted its report on the ballot for the revisions to the

<i>Academic

Constitution and Bylaws</i>. It was an email election, for the first time.

I want to thank the Tellers Committee for their contribution and time spent

on that process. We look forward to the possibility of more efficient elections,

using technology in the future.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Karady: Is the turnout more

or less than in the past?</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: We have

never done this method in the past, so we do not have a comparison to offer.

We thought that 211 votes in favor were a reasonable turnout.</font>

<br><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.B Curriculum and Academic Programs

Committee</b> (Michael Mayer).</font>

<br><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.B.1</b> <b>Senate Motion #2 (2000-01)</b>

was presented for a second reading. "The Curriculum and Academic Programs

Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted by

the College of Public Programs to <b>establish a Ph.D. in Public Affairs</b>."

<b>Rationale</b>:

The degree was initially called a Doctor of Public Administration, for

a number of reasons: It would be oriented toward practitioners, and it

would serve a regional audience. Subsequently, it was discovered that a

majority of graduates went into academic careers, and that about 1/3 of

the students did not come from the immediate area. It is being renamed

a Ph.D. because the definition of a Ph.D. is that of a research-oriented

degree. Students have always been required to advance the frontiers of

knowledge in the field. Coursework has always been designed to stretch

the conceptualization ability of the student. The student has always been

expected to be able to do independent research in the field, and must be

able to demonstrate this through the dissertation. Essentially, the degree

has always been a Ph.D., and thus a name change is appropriate. In addition,

the nomenclature of DPA is disappearing from the field of public administration.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there discussion of the motion?</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Moorhead: When will the Senate

vote on this item? (Today).</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We discussed a DPA earlier, and it

has not come back.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Mayer: It has not come to

the committee yet. It is being discussed by the Graduate Council. It will

then go to the committee and to the Senate, provided the Graduate Council

approves it.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Jackson: I sit on the Graduate

Council, and we have decided to break that into a two-part issue. The first

part concerns the change of major; the second part is just going to be

reported out. I will update you at the next Senate meeting.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: Hearing

no further discussion, we will vote on the motion. <b>Senate motion #2

(2000-2001) was approved by voice vote.</b></font>

<p><font size=+0><b>6.&nbsp; New Business </b>(Committee Reports and New

Motions)<b>.</b></font>

<br><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.A Executive Committee</b> (Doug

Johnson).</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Executive Committee will meet

on November 20, 2000. If you have business you wish the committee to consider,

please let me know.</font>

<br><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.B Committee on Committees</b>

(Brent Brown).</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please fill out the mini-preference

survey, if you have not done so already. A copy is in front of you, and

a copy is published on the Web. We have a number of committees that can

only be filled by Academic Senate members. If that needs to change, we

will need to have a bylaws change to accomplish that. We still need more

volunteers at this point. So, again, please fill out a survey form if you

have not done so previously, and give us your preference for committee

service next year.</font>

<br><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.C Curriculum and Academic Programs

Committee</b> (Mike Mayer).</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have information items from the

College of Education, including the re-establishment of a concentration:

Ph.D. Educational Psychology Learning; the disestablishment of a concentration:

Ph.D. Educational Technology Instructional Technology; and, in the College

of Fine Arts: The establishment of a concentration: BA Arts Digital Art

(These items were approved by CAPC at their meeting of November 1, 2000).

There are, in addition, three motions for first reading. These items were

distributed with the agenda for today?s meeting.</font>

<br><font size=+0><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate Motion #3: </b>"The Curriculum

and Academic Programs Committee recommends</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Academic Senate approval of a proposal

submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences for the implementation

of an MA in Asian Languages and Civilizations. Rationale: The program to

be implemented at ASU seeks to prominently prepare students for immediate

entry to the job market or for entrance to professional schools in such

fields as law, business, journalism, even medicine and engineering. It

will aim to attract students who seek a higher level of understanding of

the language and culture of Japan or China as a valuable asset in their

professional careers. At the same time, it will provide a strong start

for those who eventually go on to a doctoral program at another institution.

In keeping with the idea of advanced learning both inside and outside the

classroom, all degree candidates will be required to have spent at least

one academic year residing in the country of their specialization since

their graduation from high school."</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Grossman: Will this be an

open-ended program where other Asian languages may be added? For example,

Indonesian? Senate President Johnson: I believe they will have a mechanism

to add other languages later, but this is what they plan for now.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Mayer: If necessary, we will

go back to the committee with this for an answer.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Solis: Is this one year of

cultural experience under any circumstances--military--or other-- or does

it actually require direct language and culture experience?</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Jackson: The intent was to

directly immerse the student in the language and culture. Military would

not satisfy this requirement.</font>

<br><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: Please look

at this proposal as being somewhat innovative. There is the possibility

of being immersed in a culture, and there is opportunity to experiment

with how this is accomplished. Senator Mayer can provide further comment

at the next meeting, and we will have someone there at the next meeting

to represent this program.</font>

<br><b><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate Motion #4:</font> "</b>The

Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval

of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences for

the establishment of Undergraduate Certificates in American Public Policy,

Civic Education, and International Studies. Rationale: The Certificate

in American Public Policy is designed for undergraduate students anticipating

careers in government, public service, or public administration and/or

who are interested in understanding the dynamics of policy-making and administration

in American government. The Certificate in Civic Education is designed

to contribute to the preparation of undergraduate students for (a) careers

in primary and secondary education (where the teaching of government and

civics may be involved); (b) careers or voluntary participation in politics,

public service, and civic and social movements; and (c) further education

in law, journalism, business, history, sociology, political science, and

other fields where an understanding of questions of citizenship, leadership,

community, democracy, public responsibility, and ethics is crucial. The

Certificate in International Studies is designed to prepare students for

careers in government agencies, international governmental and non-governmental

organizations, multinational firms and banks, and for graduate studies

in International Relations or Political Science. These certificates do

not substitute for degree requirements in any subject, including Political

Science. The certificates will add a dimension and complement the student?s

chosen major."

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Baker: Have the courses been cross-listed?

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> Senator Saenz: Is West Campus going to offer

this certificate? We want to avoid duplication as much as possible, and

there are certain unique strengths that we may wish to preserve at each

campus.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: No representative could

be here from West today.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past President Burstein: There is no choice but

to duplicate programs at times.

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate Motion #5</b>: "The Curriculum and Academic

Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted

by the Graduate College for the establishment of a Graduate Certificate

in Statistics. Rationale: The proposed certificate seeks to provide statistical

training for graduate students at ASU and professionals in the metro-Phoenix

area. Statistical analysis is one of the primary tools of modern scientific

reasoning. Since the need to draw correct and defensible conclusions from

data arises so widely, statistical techniques are useful in almost all

disciplines. There is a consequent demand for professionals who are well

educated in statistics, and the demand is growing. The proposed certificate

seeks to address this need. In particular, the goal is to provide an opportunity

for students to enhance their ability to apply statistics in their chosen

field of expertise."

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Mayer: The proposal comes with a list of

classes for each major. These students may be working on a separate degree

program.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Blumenfeld-Jones: Is this an attempt to

bring students to campus that only want the certificate program?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Mayer: These certificates are between 15-18

hours in length within a discipline or major and with the intent to have

a specific area of expertise.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex Bainbridge: I am in my undergraduate program

in a BIS degree, and I am completing a Small Business Certificate program,

too.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: The intent is that students

would demonstrate a more comprehensive knowledge of statistics, within

their discipline area.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Fuse: If they take this program, would they

have to be admitted to a regular graduate program? (Not necessarily. They

could be an undergraduate taking graduate classes. Sixty hours are required

to be an undergraduate.)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: It is designed for graduate

students, and the idea is that it be interdisciplinary, inclusive in content.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Baker: There are a lot of statistics courses

throughout the disciplines. For instance, Educational Psychology has a

very good program. So, these courses can all be brought under one certificate

program? I would like to see the list of courses that could be used.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Karady: We have heard at ASU that there

are too many hurdles for students to complete their Programs, and we have

addressed this in the streamlining process. Now, with this type of certificate

program, we are making things seemingly more complex and complicated.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: This will not complicate

requirements for graduation. It is a certificate program.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past President Burstein: For many students, it is

taking the place of a minor.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Landers: I believe that the certificate

program is an outgrowth from the streamlining effort.&nbsp; It is a voluntary

program.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Mayer: It works for those that still have

elective hours, and this could provide a chance for some people to certify

an expertise within their major area.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Cochran: Could we have the answer to the

previous question. Is there a list of the courses that would apply for

this certificate?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Mayer: I can get a list.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Yao: It almost seems that there is an advantage

to obtaining this certificate, making it more desirable than a degree even.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past President Burstein: If that is all they get,

it is just a certificate. The idea is that they are obtaining a degree,

say in Psychology, that will say "certified in statistics" in that field.

It is not supposed to be in and of itself an end-result.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex Bainbridge: After four years, some students

have a need to add a professional certification to that experience, then

go off campus to seek employment. They can add this certification to their

degree program and be more marketable.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Yao: Are we competing with the University

of Phoenix? (We are always competing with the University of Phoenix. Much

laughter here.)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past President Burstein: We should put the bulk

of that proposal on the web for our senators to review.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Senate Motion #6</b>: "The Curriculum and Academic

Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted

by the College of Public Programs for the establishment of an Undergraduate

Certificate in Public Administration &amp; Public Management. Rationale:

The proposed certificate prepares students for citizenship, leadership,

and careers in governmental agencies and nonprofit associations. In this

certificate program, students learn about the context and principles of

public administration and how to apply them to situations commonly faced

by public administrators. Students also learn about the role of the public

administrator in the design, implementation, and evaluation of public policy.

Finally, they will learn how to lead change and address ethical issues

in public service."

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Baker: Do you suppose we could negotiate

with Public Programs, Political Science and American Humanics on this and

have just one certificate?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Johnson: I do expect in the future

that more academic units will be seeking to establish certificates; it

is becoming more and more common. It is really a marketing tool for students.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Baker: How do these certificates relate

to the new BIS degrees? (They don?t.)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>6.D Personnel Committee </b>(Jose Cobas).

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee met on November 7. Doug Johnson gave

us a plan of action concerning health insurance. Intergroup health plan

has recent changes. We discussed the need for the ASU Benefits Office to

take a more active role in the selection process for health carriers.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Fuse: Can you put the minutes of your meeting

on the web page? (Yes. When they are available, they will be posted at

the request of the Senate.)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were no further committee reports.

<p><b>7.&nbsp; Adjournment</b>.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There being no further business to consider, the

meeting adjourned at 4:25 p.m.
