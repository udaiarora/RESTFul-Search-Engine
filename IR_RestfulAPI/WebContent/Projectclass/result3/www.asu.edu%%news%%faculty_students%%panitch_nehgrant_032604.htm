      <h2>Heart Healthy - Grant aids research on coronary bypass surgery </h2>
      <p>By age 65, one in three people will develop coronary artery disease, by far the leading cause of death in America. For those who decide to go under the knife to unclog their hearts' plaque-filled vessels, almost half will be forced to schedule a return engagement when the once-repaired vessel re-narrows after the original surgery. </p>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/panitch.jpg" width="216" height="162" align="right">For Harrington School of Bioengineering Professor Alyssa Panitch at the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, helping to prevent this phenomenon, called restenosis, will not only take her on a rewarding research journey, but also provide her with new and valuable scientific training. Panitch recently received a 5-year, $700,000 National Institutes of Health (NIH) career development award for "A Peptide Approach to Improve Vein Graft Efficacy." </p>
      <p>"Restonosis typically happens when someone's artery is partially occluded because of plaque," says Panitch. "Typically, surgeons go in with a balloon catheter to expand out the artery, and it damages the endothelium and smooth muscle cells." </p>
      <p>Once the vessel is damaged, it can become blocked again in as little as six months to a year after the original <br>
  surgery. </p>
      <p>The NIH award allows for Panitch to broaden her research horizons. "The award itself is set up for people who are quantitative in nature or know more chemistry, and tries to transition them into more of a biomedical type of research," says Panitch. </p>
      <p>Panitch's prior training was mainly in the fields of polymer science and engineering. Her mentor on the NIH sponsored project, fellow bioengineering professor and center director at ASU's Arizona Biodesign Institute, Colleen Brophy, originally identified a small protein, called HSP20, which relaxes the smooth muscle tissue that surrounds the arterial wall. </p>
      <p>It takes only 13 basic building blocks of proteins, called amino acids, to make the biological active form of HSP20. </p>
      <p>"When the proposal was submitted, we knew that a small peptide fragment from the HSP20 protein that is 13 amino acids long - if you could get that inside a smooth muscle cell it would allow the vessel to relax," says Panitch. "Such an effect can be an important new tool in coronary bypass surgery, as the veins that are typically used in the procedure can go into spasm, causing the graft to fail in the long term." </p>
      <p>Her research will focus both on optimizing the bioactivity of the peptide and on how to best deliver the protein inside the cell in order to prevent the vein from going into its harmful spasm. In her approach, she packages the small peptide fragment of HSP20 inside a bundle of sugar molecules, called a hydrogel, that provides the HSP20 package with a safe harbor in order to reach its final destination at the appropriate time and prevent vein spasm. </p>
      <p>"For this vein graft, it's easy to smear the gel on the outside of the vein graft, and you get a sustained delivery," says Panitch. </p>
      <p>Panitch also will work on tweaking the structure of the hydrogel to make the HSP20 peptide work better by delivering the peptide over the appropriate period of time. For this research, Panitch also has been funded by a prestigious National Science Foundation CAREER award, given to young faculty deemed to be the future scientific leaders of the twenty-first century. </p>
      <p>Because the HSP20 therapy works directly to relax blood vessels, the strategy also can be expanded to prevent the debilitating effects of diseases such as stroke induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage in the brain. With the strong clinical potential of HSP20, Panitch has teamed together with fellow professors Colleen Brophy and Lokesh Joshi to start a small company called AzERx (Arizona Engineered Therapeutics) in the hopes of one day bringing this treatment to market. </p>
