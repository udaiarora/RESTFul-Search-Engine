<P>---. <I>William Morris, His Art, His Writings, and His Public Life:
A Record</I>. London: Bell, 1909. Appendix I: Chronological list of the
printed works of William Morris; Appendix II: Publications of the Kelmscott
P. Title in red and black. Printed at the Chiswick P. First ed. published
in 1897. Cheaper reprint in 1909. As the title of this work indicates,
Vallance intended to write only about Morris's public life, even though
he knew Morris personally. He details the circumstances surrounding the
publishing of this work in his preface, letting his readers know that he
had Morris's permission to write this work and is indebted to Morris for
permission to reproduce drawings, illustrations, etc. Morris's only request
was that the work could not be published until after his death. The author
has included a number of full page lates, including many examples of Morris's
wallpaper and tapestries. There are also several drawings of the Red House,
Kelmscott Manor and the house occupied by the Kelmscott Press. In addition,
several title pages are reproduced. PRB-108</P>

<P>---. <I>The Poems of Master Francois Villon of Paris</I>. London: Printed
for the Villon society for private circulation, 1892. Now first done into
English verse, in the original forms, with a biographical and critical
introduction by John Payne. No. 169. Definitive edition. Payne's translation
was first issued 1878. At the time at which Payne translated the poems
of Villon there were already four modern editions, but each of these, according
to Payne, is &quot;very incomplete and radically faulty in being founded
mainly upon the printed texts, which are known to be terribly garbled and
corrupt, and not upon the only sound basis, namely, a minute and critical
collation of the various manuscript texts in existence&quot; (Prefatory
Note). Payne notes that he has made use of the most current scholarship
available for Villon, who has been called the father of French poetry,
noting that little was known about him, even less than the information
on Shakespeare or Dante. &quot;Up to no more distant period than the early
part of the year 1877, it was not even known what was his real name, nor
were the admirers of his genius in possession of any other facts relative
to his personal history than could be gleaned, by a laborious process of
inference and deduction, from such works of his as have been handed down
to posterity.&quot; PRB-128</P>
