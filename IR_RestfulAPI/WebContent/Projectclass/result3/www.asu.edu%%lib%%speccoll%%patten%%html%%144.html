<p>Brunschwig was a Strassburg surgeon best known for his works in surgery
and pharmaceutical distillation (See PAT-104). This work is the first edition
of the English translation a Pharmacopeae for the poor. William Turner
is often called the Father of English Botany, because his was the first
original botanical work in English to have a scientific basis. All previous
English botanical works were based on European plants exclusively. To remedy
this, Turner's first publication in 1538, <i>Libellus de re herbaria novus</i>
(<i>The New Little Book about Plants</i>) describes plants from Northumberland
which had never before been mentioned in any botanical texts. Because Turner
refused to accept the teachings of the Church of England and became a vocal
spokesman for the Reformation, he was jailed for two years. Later he was
exiled to the Continent and all his published works were destroyed. He
made the most of his time spent in exile, meeting with botanists in Europe
as he travelled, and gathering botanical specimens. Following the death
of Henry VIII he returned to England and was appointed physician and chaplain
to the Lord Protector Edward Duke of Somerset. He published the first part
of his herbal in 1551, dedicating it to the Duke. When Edward VI died,
Mary I, a Catholic, became Queen. She had no tolerance for those sympathetic
to the Reformation and once again Turner's books were banned. As a result,
complete copies of the first part of Turner's <i>New Herball</i>, issued
separately, are almost never found; most of them were destroyed. When Turner
was exiled again, he continued his study of European plants while preparing
the second part of his herbal. After five years in exile he was once again
able to return to the English court. He published the second part of his
herbal in Cologne, in 1562, rather than in England, partly because he no
longer trusted the English, and partly because Birckman, his publisher
in Cologne, had access to the woodcuts used by Fuchs. Turner finished part
three of his herbal only a few months before his death in 1568. Turner
describes more than 200 species native to England, thereby adding plants
"whereof is no mention made neither of ye old Grecianes nor Latines." Arrangement
of the herbal is alphabetical, under each plant's Latin name, without any
attempt to show relationships.
