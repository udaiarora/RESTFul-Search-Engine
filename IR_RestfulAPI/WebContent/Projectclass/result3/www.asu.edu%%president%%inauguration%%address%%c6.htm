The core disciplines are but one element         of our intellectual identity. The traditional disciplinary organization         of universities may not be the optimal way to organize knowledge, or to         organize the institution itself, or to teach students, or to solve the         social, economic, and technological challenges confronting institutions         in the regions in which they are located. Accordingly, I encourage teaching         and research that is interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary.         I encourage the convergence of disciplines, where appropriate, a practice         that might more accurately be described as <em>intellectual fusion</em>.       </p>      <p> Programs that involve multiple departments and schools, that bring together         scholars from different disciplines, have unique strengths. In order to         overcome the limitations inherent in traditional scholarship, I would         like to see ASU undertake strategic recombinations of complementary academic         units to create programs that both maximize core strengths and facilitate         the creation of new knowledge. ASU already has a number of such programs         and schools, and has built a tremendous base of convergence, particularly         in the sciences and the arts. These programs represent intellectual fusion         at its best. </p>      <p>The motivation in creating interdisciplinary programs is not to eliminate         disciplines as we know them, or to transform core fields, but rather to         advance knowledge in the face of its rapidly changing nature, the explosion         of new knowledge that characterizes the academy in recent decades. It         is no longer adequate to neatly equate disciplines with departments. Rather         we must think in terms of programs comprised of disciplines construed         across departments and schools. </p>      <p> I recently heard a member of our political science faculty lament that         no other department of political science can &#8220;out-Michigan Michigan.&#8221;         In response I would suggest that we would rather wish to &#8220;out-ASU         ASU,&#8221; and to build a department with its own unique strengths, and         its own connections with other disciplines at ASU, focused on problems         of regional importance. By encouraging intellectual fusion, both core         departments and interdisciplinary programs at ASU will become greater         than the sum of their parts. </p>      <p><br>      </p>      &nbsp;<BR> </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="61%" align="left" valign="bottom"><a href="c5.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom" class="indent"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="c7.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="c7.htm"><img src="images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
