Cf. Henrey, B. Brit. botanical lit. I, p. 190. Evelyn's translation published

of J. Evelyn, Esq; to the folio edition of Monsieur La Quintiney: p. [1]-[4]
after p. xiv. Illustrations and plates are engraved. Page [1] at front
and p. [xxxvi] are blank. References: ESTC t146282. "La Quintinie spent
40 years with Louis XIV. Did Kitchen Garden at Versailles."
<P>George London and Henry Wise have abridged and edited La Quintinie's
work in order to help gentlemen who have planted fruit trees, but have
been disappointed in both the fruit and the trees, because they have neglected
the proper techniques.&nbsp; The editors announce in their advertisement
for this work that "out of a true regard to the publick, in respect of
Gard'ning, we communicate to the World these our Observations, which tho'
few, we hope may be of use.&nbsp; In the first place we think fit to remark
that we have gone through the Works of our learned Author with all the
exactness we possibly could, abstracting out of each Title, or general
Head, all that is useful; and have reduc'd into a proper method, that in
which the Original is so prolix and interwoven, that the Reader was rather
tir'd than inform'd."&nbsp; London and Wise go on to note that they have
even added some information when La Quintinie had neglected a particular
fruit.&nbsp; This work describes fruit and vegetable gardening, showing
pruning techniques on nine folded leaves of plates.&nbsp; Various varieties
of each fruit and their relative merits are fully discussed.&nbsp; The
work also contains a complete listing of the contents of each chapter.
