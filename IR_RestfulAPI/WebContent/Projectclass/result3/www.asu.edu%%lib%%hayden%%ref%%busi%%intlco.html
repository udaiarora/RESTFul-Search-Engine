    Japan has three major exchanges (Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya) and five local ones. First section companies are those listed on the major exchanges which, among other requirements, have at least 20 million shares outstanding. Second section companies are roughly those listed on the major exchanges with less than 20 million shares outstanding. The second section handbook also profiles separately companies listed on the local exchanges and those sold over-the-counter as well as a selection of unlisted companies. The one-page profiles arranged by industry provide brief overviews including basic financial and stock data. An alphabetic index by company name at the front of each section handbook locates companies in that handbook while the one at the back locates companies in the other section's handbook.<BR>
