                      <p align=left class=MsoTitle style='text-align:left'>The Personnel Committee met as needed on the first and third Tuesday of every month, commencing in August, 2001.&nbsp; During the year the committee worked on several issues, some carried over from the previous year, and some referred to the committee by the Libraries&rsquo; Librarians&rsquo; Council Review Committee.&nbsp; While the committee had other items it wished to tackle (in particular revisions to <i>Handbook</i> Sections K.1: Mentoring Program and J.1: Orientation Program), there were no outstanding items requiring attention at the end of the year.</p>
                      <p align=left class=MsoTitle style='text-align:left'>The committee&rsquo;s work is summarized below:</p>
                      <p align=left class=MsoTitle style='text-align:left'><b>Supplementary Reviews</b></p>
                      <p align=left class=MsoTitle style='text-align:left'>The Committee discussed this issue, and decided to wait until the new Associate Dean for Collections had been hired before proceeding with any revisions the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook sections related to supplementary reviews.&nbsp; This was an issue carried forward from the previous (2000-2001) Personnel Committee.</p>
                      <p align=left class=MsoTitle style='text-align:left'><i>Handbook</i> <b>Section I.1, Sabbatical Leave</b></p>
                      <p align=left class=MsoTitle style='text-align:left'>The Personnel Committee was asked by the Review Committee to look at section I.1: Sabbatical Leave, in an effort to clarify language related to the duration of sabbatical leaves for an academic professional.&nbsp; The committee proposed adding a paragraph to the handbook, using language of the ACD (Academic Affairs &amp; Procedures Manual), to emphasize the length of time for a &ldquo;sabbatical year.&rdquo;&nbsp; These changes were discussed at the Librarians&rsquo; Council meeting in February, and after discussion the proposed changes were withdrawn from further consideration.</p>
                      <p align=left class=MsoTitle style='text-align:left'><i>Handbook</i> <b>Sections E.2: Criteria, E.3: Requirements, G.2.1: Probationary Evaluation, and G.2.2: Continuing Appointment/Promotion</b></p>
                      <p align=left class=MsoTitle style='text-align:left'>The Review Committee also asked the Personnel Committee to examine all handbook sections used by probationary librarians to create their review packets, in particular the sections that emphasized academic professional <i>contributions and service</i>.&nbsp; After much discussion and drafting, changes were made to the following sections of the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook: E.2: Criteria, E.3: Requirements, G2.1: Probationary Evaluation, and G2.2: Continuing Appointment/Promotion.&nbsp; These changes were approved by the full Librarians&rsquo; Council at its March 2002 meeting.</p>
                      <p align=left class=MsoTitle style='text-align:left'><i>Marion Librarian</i> <b>Packets</b></p>
                      <p align=left class=MsoTitle style='text-align:left'>The Personnel Committee also completed drafts of the &ldquo;Marion Librarian&rdquo; sixth year packet, which includes both a sample cover letter and curriculum vita.&nbsp; Working with the Assistant Dean for Personnel, these drafts were approved, and will be available on the web for the 2002-2003 academic year.&nbsp; In addition, the committee worked with the Libraries&rsquo; Webmaster to post the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> year packets on the Library web site.</p>

                      <ol start=1 type=1>
                        <li>We announced that we would be seeking nominations and asked for nominations and or volunteers for the various positions available.</li>
                        <li>We were successful in nominating several candidates for each position.</li>
                        <li>Ballots were printed on colored paper with return address on the reverse.</li>
                        <li>Ballots were mailed in separate envelopes with a sticker, &ldquo;ballot enclosed.&rdquo;</li>
                        <li>Karie Pifer supplied labels for the ballots.</li>
                        <li>Council members were advised by E-mail that the ballots were in the mail.</li>

                        <li>The successful candidates were announced in SoundOff and by E-mail.</li>
