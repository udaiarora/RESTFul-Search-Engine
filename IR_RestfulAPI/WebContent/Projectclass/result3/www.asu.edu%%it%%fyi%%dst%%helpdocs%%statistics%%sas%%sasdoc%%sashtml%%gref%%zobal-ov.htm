<P><A name="z0749899">&#13; SAS/GRAPH programs
can use some of the SAS language statements that you typically use with the
base SAS procedures or with the DATA step, such as LABEL, WHERE, and FORMAT.
 These statements are described in the <B>SAS Language Reference:
Dictionary</B>.</A>
<P><A name="z0749900">&#13;In
addition,
SAS/GRAPH has
its own set of statements that affect only graphics output generated by the SAS/GRAPH procedures
and the graphics facilities Annotate and DSGI. Most of these statements are <B>global statements</B>. That is, they can be specified anywhere in your
program and remain in effect until explicitly changed or canceled. These are
the SAS/GRAPH global statements: </A>
<DL>
<DT>AXIS</DT>
<DD>modifies the appearance, position,
and range of values of axes in charts and plots.<P></DD>

<DT> FOOTNOTE</DT>
<DD>adds footnotes to graphics output.
This statement is like the TITLE statement and is described in that section.<P></DD>

<DT>GOPTIONS</DT>
<DD>submits graphics options that control
the appearance of graphics elements by specifying characteristics such as
default colors, fill patterns, fonts, or text height. Graphics options can
also temporarily change device settings.<P></DD>

<DT>LEGEND</DT>
<DD>modifies the appearance and position
of legends generated by procedures that produce charts, plots, and maps.<P></DD>

<DT>NOTE</DT>
<DD>adds text to the graphics output.
This statement is an exception because it is not global but local, meaning
that it must be submitted within a procedure. Otherwise, NOTE is like the
TITLE statement and is described in that section.<P></DD>

<DT>PATTERN</DT>
<DD>controls the color and fill of patterns
assigned to areas in charts, maps, and plots.<P></DD>

<DT>SYMBOL</DT>
<DD>specifies the shape and color of
plot symbols as well the interpolation method for plot data. It also controls
the appearance of lines in contour plots.<P></DD>

<DT>TITLE</DT>
<DD>add titles to graphics output. The
section describing the TITLE statement includes the FOOTNOTE and NOTE statements.<P></DD>
</DL>

<P>These statements are described in this chapter, which
also includes two Base language statements that have a special effect when
used with SAS/GRAPH procedures: 
<DL>
<DT>BY</DT>
<DD>processes data according to the values
of a classification (BY) variable and produces a separate graph for each BY-group
value.<P></DD>

<DT>ODS HTML</DT>
<DD>generates one or more files written
in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). If you use it with SAS/GRAPH procedures,
you can specify one of the device drivers GIF, ACTIVEX, or JAVA (ACTIVEX and
JAVA are only available with GCHART, GCONTOUR, GMAP, GPLOT, and G3D). With
the GIF device driver, the graphics output is stored in GIF files. With the
ACTIVEX device driver, graphics output is stored as ActiveX controls. With
the JAVA device driver, graphics output is stored a Java applets,. The HTML
files that are generated reference the graphics output. When viewed with a
Web browser, the HTML files can display graphics and non-graphics output together
on the same Web page.<P></DD>
