      <h2>New Regents Professor aims research at prevention </h2>
      <p>The idea of prevention has long been held as an important concept in maintaining a person's physical health. But for Psychology Professor Irwin Sandler, and his colleagues in the ASU Center for Prevention Research, the prevention model holds the key to strong mental health as well. </p>
      <p align="left">Trying to prove that connection through research and implement programs to take advantage of it, has been the driving force behind Sandler's work for the past three decades - work that has led Sandler to the honor of Regents Professor at ASU. </p>
      <p align="left">Sandler is one of eight new Regents Professors, one of the university's highest honors for faculty members, inducted during a ceremony Jan. 22. The others include Charles Arntzen, molecular biologist and the Florence Ely Nelson Presidential Endowed Chair; Ronald Carlson, English professor and author; Philip Christensen, Korrick Professor of Geological Sciences and Mars explorer; Gene Glass, professor of educational leadership and policy studies; Luis Gomez-Mejia, Horace Steel Arizona Heritage Chair in management; Stephen Pyne, life sciences professor and authority on fire; and Mary Lee Smith, educational leadership and policy studies professor. </p>
      <p align="left">Sandler began his journey in prevention research as a college student in the 1960s, a time when the field of preventative psychology was in its infancy. After earning his bachelor and master's degree at Brooklyn College, Sandler moved to the University of Rochester to work on his Ph.D. </p>
      <p align="left">Not sure what his future held, he went to work as a graduate researcher for Psychologist Emory Cowen, known as one of the founders of preventative <br>
  psychology. Sandler quickly found a connection with Cowen's concepts. </p>
      <p>"It became a passion almost immediately," he says. "It just made sense to me. The idea is interesting, 'How do you take a public health preventative approach and apply it to mental health?' That commitment to prevention research came from working with my mentor Emory Cowen." </p>
      <p>After a year with Cowen, in 1971 Sandler accepted a joint appointment with ASU and St. Luke's Health working as a psychologist in South Phoenix; and in 1975, a full-time position at ASU. </p>
      <p>Since joining ASU full-time, Sandler has been serving the community through preventative mental health initiatives. Using an approach of promoting resilience in children and families who have been exposed to life stressors, divorce, bereavement, poverty, major school transitions, the Center for Prevention Research, founded in 1984, has a full slate of prevention research as well as pre- and post-doctoral training programs. </p>
      <p>"The highlight of my work has been leading in the development of the Prevention Research Center - one of the leading prevention research groups in the nation over the past 20 years," says Sandler. "The Center has mobilized the work of over 25 faculty from multiple disciplines at ASU, and has been successful in bringing in over 30 million dollars in external research support. Most critically it has made a major contributions to the development of a field of prevention research." </p>
      <p>One of Sandler's key research focuses has been the effect of the stresses of divorce on kids, working with colleagues such as Sharlene Wolchik and Sanford Braver. </p>
      <p>"We are making real progress in the study of prevention," he says. "One surprising, but important finding has been to demonstrate that we can reduce the prevalence of a wide range of problem outcomes for children of divorce six years after their participation in a relatively brief program to promote effective parenting. We now have hard-nosed evidence that didn't exist when we started to support the claim that prevention works." </p>
      <p>Sandler says the research is now being taken to a larger scale in the community, with a partnership with groups such as the Maricopa County Family Court System. </p>
      <p>Overall, Sandler says the key to the research of the center is to develop a science that contributes to the community. He sees the importance of giving back to the community from his own life experience. </p>
      <p>As second generation immigrants in New York, Sandler's parents emphasized the importance of education and knowledge. Through the encouragement of his family, Sandler became, along with his brother, the first in his family to graduate from college. </p>
      <p>"I am grateful for the Regents Professor award, and see it as recognition of the impact of our work," he says. "Personally, I see the honor as evidence of a return on the investment society made in me - the free college education and a free graduate education I was given was an investment, and my work has been a return on that investment." </p>
