      <p>Arizona State University (ASU) is a robust economic engine for Arizona. 
        This paper describes ASU&#8217;s economic impact on the State, the various 
        ways in which ASU delivers economic value to Arizona, and specific policy 
        areas around which ASU will engage elected officials.<br>
        <br>
        <em><strong>ASU&#8217;s Economic Impact on Arizona</strong></em><br>
        Arizona State University is a major, multi-campus teaching and research 
        university. ASU comprises four campuses-- in Tempe, northwest Phoenix, 
        Mesa, and downtown Phoenix. With more than 10,000 employees, ASU is one 
        of the State&#8217;s largest employers. University enrollment currently 
        exceeds 57,000, with another 22,500 attending summer sessions. ASU is 
        one of the four largest universities in the country and awards more bachelors 
        degrees each year than all the other Arizona institutions combined.</li> </ul> 
      </p>
      <p>According to a December, 1999 ASU College of Business report, &#8220;the 
        total impact of Arizona State University on spending in the State is estimated 
        to be $2.3 billion. The University community serves to leverage each dollar 
        of State appropriations into $6.97 of sales for the State of Arizona. 
        The total employment impact of ASU, including University employees and 
        all other jobs indirectly induced, is 39,900 jobs. A job is created in 
        the State for every $8,120 of State appropriations.&#8221;</p>
      <p><span class="underline"><strong>How ASU Delivers Economic Value to Arizona</strong></span><br>
        Beyond the considerable direct expenditures ASU makes on Arizona goods 
        and services and the jobs these expenditures create, the University adds 
        value to the economy in a number of important ways. </p>
      <p><strong>Educates workforce for the knowledge-driven economy</strong><br>
        Arizona&#8217;s economy is evolving from one that is resource-based and 
        service-intensive, to one that is based on knowledge. The businesses most 
        likely to produce the greatest wealth for Arizona&#8217;s economy will 
        increasingly utilize complex, technology-based systems and products. Accordingly, 
        they need employees with &#8220;knowledge skills&#8221; to ensure their 
        competitiveness. ASU&#8217;s growing focus on applied, interdisciplinary 
        scholarship and science and technology produces graduates who can fill 
        these jobs. Arizona&#8217;s employers count on ASU to provide an appropriately 
        skilled workforce for the knowledge-driven economy.</p>
      <p><strong>Educates entrepreneurs</strong><br>
        ASU, through its College of Business, educates entrepreneurs who have 
        contributed to a notably vibrant small business climate. Cognetics Inc. 
        ranked Greater Phoenix #1 for the fifth straight year in their &quot;Annual 
        Index of U.S. Entrepreneurial Hot Spots.&#8221; This ranking is based 
        on the region&#8217;s superb record of producing a high number of new 
        businesses, as well as businesses that are fast-growing. Like the overall 
        Arizona economy, however, the majority of these firms are not technology-centric. 
        ASU will launch an initiative based on a renowned San Diego program that 
        will increase the quality and breadth of technology-based entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p><strong>Educates policymakers</strong><br>
        ASU&#8217;s Morrison Institute researches, informs and advises public 
        policy makers on choices and potential actions that will help the State 
        to prosper. ASU&#8217;s Seidman Institute collects and disseminates information 
        about critical local economic trends and conditions that helps Arizona 
        policy leaders navigate in a complex, information-driven world. With the 
        State&#8217;s looming fiscal crisis, ASU&#8217;s economic research and 
        policy analyses will be more important than ever to enacting sound economic 
        development policy. </p>
      <p><strong>Strengthens community institutions</strong><br>
        ASU is engaged and embedded in Arizona&#8217;s fabric of social, cultural, 
        artistic, intellectual, educational, economic development, and financial 
        institutions. For example, ASU is working with the K-12 system, the business 
        community, parents and others to improve Arizona&#8217;s uneven high school 
        graduation rate. Reducing the dropout rate will in turn lead to a stronger 
        Arizona workforce.</p>
      <p><strong>Generates business opportunities </strong><br>
        ASU&#8217;s technology licensing, research partnerships and knowledge 
        transfer mechanisms strengthen Arizona businesses. ASU provides product 
        development, process enhancement and marketing assistance to Arizona businesses, 
        which leads to increased profits. ASU is building a world-class technology 
        transfer and economic development team to further develop these partnerships, 
        with a focus on working with Arizona&#8217;s small and medium-sized technology 
        companies. </p>
      <p><strong>Spawns innovation</strong><br>
        In the past decade, nearly all major technological advances have been 
        grounded in basic scientific research. Each year, an estimated 60 to 75 
        percent of economic growth is driven by these advances. Intellectual curiosity 
        leads ASU scientists, engineers, and other university researchers to discovery. 
        Significant scientific breakthroughs, when transferred to intellectual 
        property, can have broad commercial applications and substantial impact 
        on Arizona&#8217;s economy.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Creates new enterprises</strong><br>
        As established corporations have become increasingly risk averse and reluctant 
        to license extremely early-stage technologies, a better path to commercialization 
        is often new enterprise formation. With Proposition 301 funding, ASU has 
        built a program to support faculty entrepreneurs. ASU is educating inventors 
        about entrepreneurship, providing financial support for technology development, 
        and linking inventors to resources in the business community that can 
        facilitate new venture formation and development. </p>
      <p><strong>Attracts talent </strong><br>
        ASU continues to win major research grants in fields ranging from planetary 
        sciences, to bioengineering, to psychology. This enhanced research portfolio 
        has increased ASU&#8217;s capacity to attract and retain highly-educated, 
        highly-paid workers. The many cultural amenities and other &#8220;quality 
        of life&#8221; activities provided by ASU also attract these workers, 
        who subsequently draw knowledge-driven businesses. Recent pioneering economic 
        development work by Richard Florida has shown that top knowledge workers, 
        who can live and work almost anywhere, are most likely to choose regions 
        with well-developed cultural amenities.</p>
      <p><strong>Attracts new businesses</strong><br>
        In addition to ASU acting as a magnet for creative and technology-savvy 
        workers, the University contributes to business attraction in other ways. 
        For example, when making site selection decisions, business prospects 
        typically consider the extent to which local universities partner with 
        industry, produce superior graduates, and are involved in the community. 
      </p>
      <p> <span class="underline"><strong>How ASU Could Enhance Arizona&#8217;s 
        Economic Development Strategies</strong></span><br>
        The Napolitano administration and the Legislature are faced with unprecedented 
        fiscal challenges. ASU is prepared to work diligently to help elected 
        officials and business leaders overcome these obstacles and strengthen 
        Arizona&#8217;s economy.</p>
      <p><strong>The State Constitution</strong><br>
        In order to be a full partner in university technology commercialization, 
        Arizona State University needs to be able to hold equity in companies 
        that are based on university-owned technologies. Holding equity will facilitate 
        better licensing agreements for start-up companies and universities. Equity-based 
        licensing encourages entrepreneurs to channel scarce cash resources into 
        their businesses. In the case of a successful IPO or acquisition, equity-based 
        licensing would allow ASU to generate a higher return on its investment 
        than would traditional licensing agreements. </p>
      <p><strong>Physical and Social Infrastructure for Early-Stage Technology 
        Companies</strong><br>
        Technology-based economic development, so important to Arizona&#8217;s 
        economic diversification and revenue stabilization, requires a more competitive 
        infrastructure to support the myriad needs of technology-focused companies. 
        These needs include formal and informal communication networks, technology 
        management programs, wet and dry lab space, telecommunications infrastructure 
        and appropriate office space. ASU will continue working in cooperation 
        with public and private groups across the State to ensure these infrastructure 
        needs are met.</p>
      <p><strong>Financial Infrastructure for Early-Stage Technology Companies</strong><br>
        While venture capital is a critical ingredient to a thriving technology 
        sector, it is by no means the only financing mechanism for many early-stage 
        technology companies. ASU will work to develop policies and accelerate 
        program initiatives to facilitate additional federal small business grant 
        awards (SBIR/STTR), pre-seed funding, angel investment, and small business 
        loan programs.</p>
      <p><strong>State Support for Universities </strong><br>
        ASU&#8217;s ability to deliver on its vast economic promise depends on 
        institutional vitality. The University has launched an unprecedented shift 
        in its culture to encourage faculty, staff and students to think and act 
        with a newfound entrepreneurial spirit. In light of the current financial 
        situation, ASU has limited its budget request to modest investments in 
        teaching and research. The University will continue to be realistic in 
        this manner and seek new ways to articulate the economic return on the 
        State&#8217;s investment in ASU. <br>
