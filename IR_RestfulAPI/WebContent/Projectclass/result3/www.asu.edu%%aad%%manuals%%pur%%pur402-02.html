Annually, a request for statements of qualifications and experience (ARFQ) is advertised publicly and mailed to a wide number of consultants, including <a href="pur004.html#Small Business">small</a> and <a href="pur004.html#Small, Disadvantaged Business">disadvantaged</a> firms.  Purchasing and Business Services (PBS) maintains a file of responses received from this request. When a project is approved, the director of PBS will appoint a selection committee to review the file and if possible,  develop a shortlist of the three best qualified individuals or firms  for the particular project.  The director of PBS or designee, in cooperation with the director of Capital Programs Management Group (CPMG) or designee, will conduct negotiations with the individuals or firms on the shortlist according to ranking until a satisfactory <a href="pur004.html#Agreement">agreement</a> is reached.<p>Construction related consultants may also be selected using this method.  Such consultants could include, but are not limited to, people or firms who provide soil tests, percolation tests, archeological surveys, inspections of materials, storage of materials, or cost analyses. <p><img src="purhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Procedure</b></font><a href="pur402-02table.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">D</font></a></center><img src="purhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p><hr noshade><table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1><tr><th>Responsibility<hr></th><th>Action<hr></th></tr><tr valign=TOP><td>Purchasing and Business Services (PBS)</td><td><ol><li>Prepare a request for statements of qualifications and experience (ARFQ) in contracting for design and construction consultation work with the university each year.</li></ol></td></tr><tr valign=TOP><td>Capital Programs Management Group (CPMG)</td><td><ol start="2"><li>Submit a Payment Voucher (PV) request to Purchasing and Business Services (PBS) for the advertising of the Annual Request for Qualifications and Experience (ARFQ).</li></ol></td></tr><tr valign=TOP><td>PBS</td><td><ol start="3"><li>Advertise the request in accordance with <a href="pur501-02.html">PUR 501&#150;02</a>, &#147;Advertising for Bids.&#148;</li><p><li>Send the request by e-mail or mail to a wide number of design and construction consultants, including small and disadvantaged firms.
