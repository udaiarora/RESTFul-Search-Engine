<H4>Arizona State University Criteria Checklist for
<BR>LITERACY AND CRITICAL INQUIRY - (L)</H4></CENTER>
<P> 
<P><U><B>Rationale and Objectives</B></U>
<P>Literacy is here defined broadly as communicative competence in written and oral discourse.  Critical inquiry involves the gathering, interpretation, and evaluation of evidence.  Any field of university study may require unique critical skills which have little to do with language in the usual sense (words), but the analysis of spoken and written evidence pervades university study and everyday life.  Thus, the General Studies requirements assume that all undergraduates should develop the ability to reason critically and communicate using the medium of language.

<P>The requirement in Literacy and Critical Inquiry presumes, first, that training in literacy and critical inquiry must be sustained beyond traditional First Year English in order to create a habitual skill in every student; and, second, that the skills become more expert, as well as more secure, as the student learns challenging subject matter.  Thus, the Literacy and Critical Inquiry requirement stipulates two courses beyond First Year English.  

<P>Most lower-level (L) courses are devoted primarily to the further development of critical skills in reading, writing, listening, speaking, or analysis of discourse.  Upper-division (L) courses generally are courses in a particular discipline into which writing and critical thinking have been fully integrated as means of learning the content and, in most cases, demonstrating that it has been learned.
<P>Students must complete six credit hours from courses designated as (L), at least three credit hours of which must be chosen from approved upper-division courses, <I>preferably in their major</I>.  Students must have completed ENG 101, 107, or 105 to take an (L) course.

<LI>ENG 101, 107 or ENG 105 must be prerequisites
<LI>Honors theses, XXX 493 meet (L) requirements
<LI>The list of criteria that must be satisfied for designation as a Literacy and Critical Inquiry (L) course is presented on the following page.  This list will help you determine whether the current version of your course meets all of these requirements.  If you decide to apply, please attach a current syllabus, or handouts, or other documentation that will provide sufficient information for the General Studies Council to make an informed decision regarding the status of your proposal.
