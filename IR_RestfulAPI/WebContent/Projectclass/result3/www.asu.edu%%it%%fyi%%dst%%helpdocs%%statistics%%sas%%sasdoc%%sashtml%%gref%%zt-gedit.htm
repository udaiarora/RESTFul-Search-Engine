 The graphics
editor is an interactive application that you can use from any GRAPH window
to modify graphs produced with SAS/GRAPH software
or imported from other graphics software.</A>
<P>You can invoke the graphics editor in several ways: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>To edit a graph that you are
viewing in the GRAPH
window, select Edit --> Edit current graph.<P>

<LI>To open a GRAPH window and invoke the graphics
editor without displaying an existing graph, select Tools --> Graphics Editor
from the SAS Explorer window.  After the window appears, you can either open
an existing graph or create a graphic image by drawing graphics elements in
the window.<P>

<LI>To open a GRAPH window and edit a graph that is
stored in a catalog, submit the GRAPH command from the command line of the
SAS Explorer window and add EDIT to the end of the command. Separate the two
commands with a semicolon (;). For example, the following statement opens
the GRAPH3 window, displays the specified graph, and activates the graphics
editor:  



<PRE>graph3 mylib.grafcat.slide1; edit</PRE><P>
</UL>

<P> You can use the graphics editor to change graphics
elements already displayed in the graph such as text, lines, and polygons,
or you can add graphics elements to the graph. You can create, delete, or
duplicate a graphics element and select, change, move, or resize it. You can
also change an element's properties, such as its color or fill pattern, or
its values, such as the coordinates of one of its points. For instance, you
can move a bar from one side of the display area to the other, make a copy
of it and place it in yet another place, and change its fill color and pattern.
You can undo and redo changes, zoom in or out on the display, move an element
to the foreground or background, and read in or link to another graph that
has already been created.
<P>After you have made changes, you can save your modifications
to a catalog and send the modified graph to an output device, such as a printer.
<P>For a complete description of the graphics editor, refer
to the SAS Help facility for SAS/GRAPH. 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifying your graphics output with the graphics editor
does not change the SAS programs that generated that output.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
