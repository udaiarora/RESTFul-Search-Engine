<U>Rationale and Objectives</U><P>

The lack of historical awareness on the part of contemporary university graduates has led recent studies of higher education to call for the creation and development of historical consciousness in undergraduates now and in the future.  From one perspective historical awareness is a valuable aid in the analysis of present-day problems because historical forces and traditions have created modern life and lie just beneath its surface.  From a second perspective, the historical past is an indispensable source
 of national identity and of values which facilitate social harmony and cooperative effort.  Along with this observation, it should be noted that historical study can produce intercultural understanding by tracing cultural differences to their origins in 
the past.  A third perspective on the need for historical awareness is summed up in the aphorism that he who fails to learn from the past is doomed to repeat it.  Teachers of today's students know well that those students do not usually approach questions
 of war and peace with any knowledge of historic concord, aggression, or cruelty, including even events so recent as Nazi and Stalinist terror.<P>

The requirement of a course which is historical in method and content presumes that "history" designates a sequence of past events or a narrative whose intent or effect is to represent such a sequence.  The requirement also presumes that these are human events and that history includes all that has been felt, thought, imagined, said, and done by human beings.  The opportunities for nurturing historical consciousness are nearly unlimited.  History is present in the languages, art, music, literatures, philosophy, religion, and the natural sciences, as well as in the social science traditionally called History.<P>
