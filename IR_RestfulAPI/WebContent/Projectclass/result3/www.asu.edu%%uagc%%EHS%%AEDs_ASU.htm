      <p align="left" class="style1"><strong>Preamble</strong></p>
      <p class="style1">Sudden cardiac death claims over 250,000 people each year. Most sudden deaths from cardiac arrest occur outside the hospital, and only 1 to 5 percent of these patients are estimated to survive to hospital discharge. Most people experiencing cardiac arrest have no history of severe heart disease, and sudden cardiac death is frequently the first manifestation of cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p class="style1">Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are one of the most important life-saving technologies in the past ten years. As AED implementation becomes the accepted practice, Fire Departments, EMS agencies and public access defibrillation programs will have a direct effect on the outcome of sudden cardiac arrest. Early defibrillation has been shown to be critical to improving survival.</p>
      <p class="style1"><strong>History</strong></p>
      <p class="style1">Defibrillation is a process in which an electronic device, called an automated external defibrillator, or AED, helps reestablish normal contraction rhythms in a heart that is not beating properly by delivering an electric shock to the heart. The AED is a lightweight portable device containing a battery, capacitors, and circuitry designed to analyze cardiac rhythm and inform the operator whether a shock is indicated. Information is transmitted to the device by electrode pads used for both monitoring and shock therapy. Once activated, AEDs have voice and text prompts to guide the user through a few simple steps. </p>
      <p class="style1">Early bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and rapid defibrillation are the two major contributors to survival of adult victims of sudden cardiac arrest. The American Heart Association believes that efforts to provide prompt access to defibrillation for victims of cardiac arrest are the next step in strengthening the chain of survival. However, it must be combined with other elements such as early access to Emergency Medical Services, early CPR and early access to Advanced Cardiac Care (Paramedics). &quot;Use of AEDs by first responders and laypersons has reduced time to defibrillation and improved survival from sudden cardiac arrest in several communities,&quot; one report from the AHA states. The initiatives at the state and federal level are paving the way for more widespread access to defibrillation, as legal barriers to public access defibrillation (PAD), both perceived and real, are slowly eliminated. </p>
      <p class="style1">The incorporation of the use of AEDs requires the development of intense training programs, the purchase of costly equipment and provisions for maintenance and replacement equipment. Respiratory arrest, not cardiac arrest, is the leading cause of death in children. In addition, AEDs are not to be used on children under the age of eight or under 80 pounds.</p>
      <p class="style1"><strong>History of Implementation at Arizona State University</strong></p>
      <p class="style1">In May of 1999, Governor Hull signed HB 2475 (Chapter 217 - 441R - S Ver of HB2475), which extended immunity from civil liability to certain AED users. SB 1070 requires that the Joint Legislative Budget Committee and the Governor's Office of Strategic Planning and Budgeting should include funding for the placement of automated external defibrillators in capital budgets for new state buildings each fiscal year. The provisions in the act become effective after June 30, 2003.</p>
      <p class="style1">Arizona State University will place AEDs in accordance with the Governors&rsquo; house bill into any new1 or renovated University building with the renovation2 costing $250,000.00 or more. AEDs shall be placed in the entire building, not just the renovated area. The guide that is used for determining the number of AEDs needed takes into account the type of occupancy, any limited or restricted access issues and distance to the AED (AHA guidelines). EH&amp;S Staff will do a plans review for proper placement of AEDs and with the guidance of the American Heart Association we have established the 3 minute rule. This rule states that no unit can be further than 3 minutes from the scene of the incident to the cabinet and back again. That, plus the placement in a central location (especially those with more than one floor), require one unit per floor. <br>
          <br>
          The only exception to this rule is residence halls. ASU has tested 2 different placements. In Palo Verde East there is an AED on each floor near the elevator, in the new Hassayampa Academic Village (as well as Manzanita Hall &amp; Palo Verde Main), we have the AEDs near the front desk where it is monitored 24/7. While both have their own advantages and disadvantages, we have agreed that only residence halls will be exempt from the &quot;one unit per floor&quot; and the &quot;3 minute rule&quot;. A final ruling on which placement is most advantageous is still pending.</p>
      <p class="style1">This program will require the cooperative efforts of many cross-functional departments, colleges, research facilities and supporting groups within the ASU environment to ensure that immediate medical attention is available to anyone needing assistance. Due to the availability of AEDs at various locations throughout the campuses, ASU&rsquo;s AED program is considered to be a Public Access Defibrillator (PAD) program where the general public does have equal access to the AED unit.</p>
      <p class="style1 style2"><sup>1</sup> State Owned/Leased or operated building that is constructed after July 1, 2003 that houses State employees must be equipped with AEDs.<br>
          <br>
          <sup>2</sup> Any state building renovated at a cost of at least $250,000.00 is to be equipped with automated external defibrillators. The renovation cost IS accumulative meaning when the total building renovation exceeds the $250,000.00 mark, AEDs must be placed. This may be over a number of projects or years but once the $250,000.00 mark is reached, AEDs must be placed. A renovation is defined as any modification to buildings, rooms, ceilings and general structure designed for occupancy.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="style1"><strong>How To Identify A Building Equipped With AEDs </strong></p>
      <p class="style1 style5">Any ASU building equipped with AEDs will and a vinyl ?AED Inside? as is depicted below <strong><em>(figure 1) </em></strong>. To locate an AED, a white ?V? shaped sign <strong><em>(figure 2) </em></strong> has been placed approximately 7 feet off the floor either immediately above or right next to the AED cabinet. </p>

      <ul class="style1">
        <li>Automated External Defibrillators are a life saving device and need to be treated as such.</li>
        <li>AEDs are purchased with a prescription similar to medications; therefore, possession of an AED in other than an emergency situation is a felony. </li>
        <li>AEDs have an internal program that recognizes specific cardiac rhythms and cannot be overridden. </li>
        <li>These devices have been used to save numerous lives so any tampering with or disabling an AED, causing it to not operate (or removing the defibrillation pads, battery or other related equipment) can result in negligence charges if it contributes to the death of an individual; </li>
        <li>Theft or destruction of an AED is a Class 3 felony punishable by a $150,000.00 fine and up to 7 years in prison. </li>
        <li>The AED cabinets are alarmed to alert for a possible medical emergency, only those authorized personnel are to ?test? this alarm. </li>
        <li>Report all emergencies to (9-1-1) and give as much information as possible. </li>
        <li>Report all damage/misuse or audible alarms from the AED to Environmental Health &amp; Safety (480-965-1823) or the Facilities Management Service Center (480-965-3633). </li>
        <li>Everyone is encouraged to attend a CPR/AED program offered through the American Heart Association, Red Cross, National Safety Council or American Safety &amp; Health Institute (ASHI). </li>
