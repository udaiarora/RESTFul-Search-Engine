      <h2>Maziarz moves into part-time role with President's Office </h2>
      <p align="left">When a job offer from the president comes along, one doesn't often turn it down. So for Jan Maziarz, when the opportunity came to join the office of President Lattie Coor in 1990, she jumped at the chance. </p>
      <p align="left"><img src="campus_images/Jan-Maziarz-1.jpg" width="180" height="269" align="right">Since that time, she has been a constant in the office, serving in a support role for Coor and now President Michael Crow, along with several members of their senior staffs, as an administrative secretary. </p>
      <p align="left">"Jan has the kind of 'can-do' spirit that helps get things done," says Crow. "What's more, she has exactly the skills and experience necessary to respond effectively and graciously to the many challenges, requests and tasks that we face daily at ASU." </p>
      <p align="left">As of July 31, her role will change as she retires as a full-time employee and rejoins the President's Office in a part-time role. Maziarz says she plans to take time to travel with her husband, and spend more time with her three granddaughters. </p>
      <p align="left">"I am really happy here," she says. "I just love to come to work. It is a great environment with Michael Crow and his enthusiasm. I think I will be getting the best of both worlds - I will be able to do more with my family and work here part time." </p>
      <p align="left">Maziarz first joined ASU in 1979, as a part-time word processor for Linda Van Scoy and then-provost Paige Mulhollan. When Coor arrived in 1990, she was asked to join his office full-time. </p>
      <p align="left">In 1995, Maziarz was appointed as an assistant to presidential advisor Petersen Zah, who is a former president of the Navajo Nation. For Maziarz, it was a chance to learn a great deal about a Native American culture to which she had little previous exposure. </p>
      <p align="left">"She has a genuine interest in learning about our students, their history, culture, lifestyles, goals and aspirations," says Zah, whom she worked with through 2003. "She has a hunger for learning and is just a great person. Jan is very much liked by the American Indian students. She gives them motherly advice and has a genuine concern for them." </p>
      <p align="left">Since 2003, Maziarz has served as an assistant to Presidential Advisor Jim O'Brien and Joyce Smitheran, director of the Office of the President and special assistant to the president. </p>
      <p align="left">Coor says Maziarz represents the best traits of what a President's Office staff member should be. </p>
      <p align="left">"Jan is talented, committed and compassionate, caring deeply about the university and all of the people within it, always carrying out her responsibilities with immense good cheer," says Coor. "She personifies all that is best about a truly caring university. We are fortunate that she will continue to be a member of the team in her new part-time role." </p>
      <p align="left">Campbell, with Media Relations &amp; Public Information, can be reached at (480) 965-7209 or (garycamp@asu.edu). </p>
