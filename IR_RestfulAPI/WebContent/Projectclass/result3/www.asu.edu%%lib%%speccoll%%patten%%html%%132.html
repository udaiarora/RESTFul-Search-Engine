This work has been heralded as a significant landmark in the
 history of classification, and de L'Obel is ranked among the
 greatest botanists of the 16th century.  Unfortunately, scholars
 do not know what part was played by Pierre Pena in the publication
 of this work, and it is believed that he abandoned botany in favor
 of medicine.  Although Pena's name appears first on the title page
 of this edition, it is still commonly referred to as de L'Obel's
 primary botanical work.  At the time of publication, this edition
 sold so few copies that its publisher, Thomas Purfoot, sold many
 of the leftover sheets to other publishers who supplied new title
 pages or used the pages to add to works by other authors. 
 As a result, this particular edition became quite rare.
  De L'Obel was the favorite pupil of physician and naturalist
 Guillaume Rondelet.  Upon his death in 1566, Rondelet bequeathed
 his botanical manuscripts to de L'Obel.  De L'Obel and his friend
 Pena decided to publish a joint botanical work based on these
 materials.  They left France and traveled to England to have
 it published, because English scholarship and publishing were
 then prospering under the rule of Elizabeth I.  They traversed
 the British Isles and incorporated in their writings plants that
 had not been known to William Turner.  De L'Obel's Latin was
 considered "barbarous," but his textual material was substantive.
  His system of classification is more advanced than those used
 by other contemporary botanists; arrangement is based mainly on
 difference of leaf characteristics.  In this work, <i>A New Daybook
 on Plants</i>, de L'Obel states his belief that plant classification
 could reveal the underlying unity of all forms of life.  He writes
 of this vision of a "universal order" where "things which are far
 and widely different become, as it were, one thing."  The Lobelia
 plant was named for him.
