June 30, 2003</p>
      <h2>ASU gains needed investment, nod of approval from legislature</h2>
      <p>        The 2003 Legislative Session ended June 19 with a budget in place that
          saw ASU's primary investor, the state of Arizona, through action of
          the state Legislature, appropriating $312 million as an investment
        in the university.</p>
      <p>In separate and unrelated action, the legislature
            also passed House Bill 2529, the research infrastructure bill that
            secures an investment of
          $440 million in state funds for research infrastructure at Arizona's
          three universities. ASU's portion will total about $185 million.</p>
      <p>"This
          year we saw unprecedented acknowledgement by our government leaders
        that investing in higher education is a key to the state's future," said
          ASU President Michael Crow. "With Arizona facing a $1 billion budget
          deficit, it is extraordinary that ASU has been allocated a 2004 budget
          that includes no cuts from the prior year."<br>
        Crow acknowledged his disappointment that the budget didn't include
          enrollment growth funds.</p>
      <p>"Had the state's budget outlook been different, I'm confident
          the enrollment growth funds would have been included in our budget,"
          Crow said. "We
          fought hard and convinced our legislators of the need to decrease class
          sizes, expand student interaction with tenured faculty and further
        develop the East and West campuses to handle increased enrollments. In
        the end,
          it came down to the money just not being there," he said.</p>
      <p>Milton Glick,
          executive vice president and provost, said, "The lack of enrollment
        growth dollars does leave us vulnerable in light of our growing
          enrollments. We intend to work with the colleges to help them provide
          students with adequate access to necessary classes, even if that means
          having a more limited menu of classes.</p>
      <p>"I know that our faculty and staff
          will do their very best, as they always have, to ensure students are
          able to progress toward their degrees,"
          he said.</p>
      <p>Glick also said the administration is very cognizant of the need
          for salary increases and "we are committed to making every possible
        effort in this arena."</p>
      <p>During interactions with the legislature this year Crow
          said it was important to keep a number of issues separate in order
        to ensure one didn't interfere
          with, or cannibalize, another.</p>
      <p>For example, he said, "We worked hard to
          keep the tuition increase from becoming a rationale for the legislature
          to follow through on proposed
          budget cuts, and we safeguarded Proposition 301 monies from being siphoned
          off to pay for the research infrastructure construction."</p>
      <p>The most surprising
          outcome of the session, by far, was passage of the research infrastructure
          bill.</p>
      <p>Even with a broad coalition of support from
          the business community, city government, and political heavyweights,
          such as Gov. Janet Napolitano,
          Speaker of the House Jake Flake, and Speaker Pro Tempor Bob Robson,
        the bill passed against all odds.</p>
      <p>George Watson, a professor of journalism &amp; mass
        communication and immediate past president of the ASU Academic Senate,
        said he was gratified
        the research infrastructure bill passed in a year when the budget deficit
        was more than $1 billion.</p>
      <p>"This is great news for all of us at ASU," said
          Watson. "If you look at other universities with strong, well-funded
        research programs, all
          of their other programs are top-notch as well. With state funding for
          research infrastructure, and the Proposition 301 monies available for
          research-related operations, other money is available to invest in
        and lift up those programs that aren't research intensive."</p>
      <p>Crow said the
          research infrastructure bill is for infrastructure alone - not operations,
          not staff, not overhead - which is why it was critically
          important to keep Proposition 301 funds out of the negotiation. He
        said the bill ensures investment capital that can be applied immediately
        toward
          research-intensive facilities. </p>
      <p>Crow said it's now up to ASU and the other
          universities to move forward to keep their commitments to the state.</p>
      <p>"We will build these buildings
          and implement programs in a way that will enable the buildings to pay
          for themselves," Crow said. "That means filling
          them with entities that have the capacity to pay their own way, or
        the ability to bring in funds from somewhere else to pay their way."</p>
      <p>He said
          the buildings are for the most competitive research with the highest
          probability for success. They will be built to benefit Arizona,
        using local workers and purchasing from local companies.</p>
      <p>The buildings
          will have more than an employment and economic benefit to Arizona.
        They will house programs that reach out to local schools,
          economically disadvantaged communities and citizens with debilitating
        illnesses.</p>
      <p>"The state of Arizona has put its faith in our ability to build
          an entire new technology-based industry that, over the next 10 to 20
          years, will
          transform Arizona to a knowledge-based economy with high wage jobs,
        world-class educational institutions and thriving enterprises that we
        can't even
          imagine today," Crow said.<br>
        He said more information about construction projects related to the
          infrastructure bill will be coming over the next few months.</p>
