  <b><a name=LABRIOLA>Labriola Center Becoming Recognized Internationally</a></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Visits to the Labriola website are increasing steadily and between 6 and 800 
  individuals take a look at our web page each month.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, some of those individuals have E-mailed requests for reference 
  assistance on a number of topics dealing with our Native population. Though 
  most of the inquiries have come from the United States and Canada, we have been 
  delighted to deal with queries from Waterford City, Ireland, Budapest, Hungary; 
  Naples, Italy; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Islamabad, Pakistan; and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>
  <b><a name=FOREIGN>Foreign Students Produce Theses on Native Topics</a></b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labriola Center has welcomed a number of international 
  scholars, who have worked with the Center's collections for their thesis topics. 
  Nina Hofer of Karl-Franzens-Univirsit&auml;t Graz, Austria, produced Boundaries 
  are all Lies: Ecofeminist Themes in Native American Poet Linda Hogan's Work, 
  and mailed a copy on its completion in 1996. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, in 1999, Gudrun L&uuml;gtenaar, 
  Universit&auml;t-Bremen, Germany, completed her study of the puberty ceremony 
  for Navajo women, Kinaald&aacute;, and sent us her Die Bedeutung der kinaald&aacute; 
  f&uuml;r die Navajo-Frauen. Finally, Gerry Raymond, of the Polytechnique, France, 
  is completing her dissertation on Navajo education and will soon be producing 
  copies in both French and English. <br>

    <td width="38%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, Peterson Zah, former President of the 
      Navajo Nation, donated his papers to the Labriola Center. There are 44 linear 
      feet of professional papers, newspaper articles, photographs, audiovisual 
      material and artifacts ranging in date from 1969-1994. Zah now serves as 
      Special Advisor for Native American Affairs to ASUs President, Lattie Coor.</td>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The papers have been processed and can be made 
  immediately available to researchers. A Finding Guide details the contents of 
  the collection. In the near future, the guide, along with others in the <a href="labriola.htm">Labriola</a>, 
  <a href="arizona.htm"> Arizona</a>, and <a href="chicano.htm"> Chicano Research 
  Collections </a> in the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/index.html">Department 
  of Archives &amp; Manuscripts</a>, will be available and searchable online. 
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collection contains material dealing with Zah's 
service as executive director of the nonprofit organization, DNA (Dinebeuna Nahiilna 
Be Agaditiahe) People's Legal Service in Window Rock. There is also material from 
his campaign activities in addition to his terms as Chairman (1983-1987) and President 
(1990-1994) of the Navajo Nation.
<p> <b><a name=WAUNEKA>Wauneka Biography </a></b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolyn Niethammer's long-awaited biography of 
  Navajo leader, Annie Wauneka, is now available in bookstores and from Amazon.com. 
  <i>I'll Go and Do More: Annie Dodge Wauneka Navajo Leader and Activist</i>, 
  covers the life of a remarkable woman from the time of her birth in 1918 to 
  her death in 1997. A daughter of the Navajo leader, Chee Dodge, Annie became 
  a vital force in the field of Indian health care and education. In 1963, President 
  Lyndon Johnson presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest 
  civil honor conferred by the President of the United States for service in peace 
  time. But that was just the beginning of service to her people. As she often 
  said, &quot;I'll go and do more.&quot;</p>
<p>
  <b><a name=MILLER>Miller &amp; Boette Donate Collections</a></b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labriola Center is always grateful to individuals who donate rare and one-of-a-kind 
  materials for use by students, researchers, and the public. These treasures 
  are much appreciated since the information would not be otherwise available.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Charlotte Huggins Miller (1904- ) was Field Representative at the 
  American Red Cross Pacific Area Headquarters in San Francisco. During this time, 
  she was often dispatched to National Disasters to work as an Emergency Family 
  Service Coordinator. One of her disaster jobs that gave her the most pleasure 
  and insight was the Navajo Nation drought and blizzard emergency of 1948 and 
  1949-1950. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Miller donated her collection of 5 letters to her family outlining her experience 
  on the reservation, along with 23 outstanding photographs of life on the reservation 
  and some rare pamphlets and other material.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also grateful to Mr. John Boette (1909- ), who donated books on some 
  40 tribes, part of the Indian Tribal Series published back in the 1970s. Each 
  book in the series was written by such distinguished authors as Henry Dobyns, 
  W. David Baird, Odie B. Faulk, Rennard Strickling, and others. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The histories include not only the more well-known tribes, but also has representation 
  from the Osage, Kalispel, Oneida, Mandan, Ponca, Kaw, Kenaitze, Chitimach, and 
  more. The individual volumes were read and approved by tribal members and in 
  many cases, autographed by the Chairman of the tribe.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each book was accompanied by sterling silver medals 
  produced by medallic sculptors for the Franklin Mint. The tribal seal is featured 
  on the obverse while artwork meaningful to the tribe appears on the reverse. 
  Each medallion is gracefully suspended within a solid block of crystal clear 
  Lucite and snugly encased in lined boxes.</p>
<p> <b> <a name=MANY>Many Tribes Represented at Parker Conference</a></b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colorado Indian Tribes hosted the 2nd State 
  Conference of Tribal Libraries, Archives, and Museums on February 8 and 9, at

<p> <b><a name=AMERICAN>American Indian Studies at ASU</a></b><br>
  <i>Adapted from ASU Insight, 2/9/2001:</i> </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arizona Board of Regents recently approved a bachelor of science degree 
  program in American Indian Studies at ASU beginning in the fall 2001 semester.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Carol Lujan is the director of the new degree 
  program, which will focus on American Indian Nations and offer the students 
  an opportunity to evaluate tribal issues within a domestic and international 
  context. According to Director Lujan, the degree will provide intellectual and 
  practical knowledge pertaining to American Indian culture, history, law, literature, 
  language, art, and government.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those graduating with an AIS degree will be eligible to fill tribal, state, 
  and federal level positions. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between February 14 and 16, 2001, the American Indian Studies Program at ASU 
  hosted the 11th Annual American Indian/Alaska Native Professors' Conference 
  and the 2nd Annual American Indian Studies Directors' Consortium. The purpose 
  of the conferences was to stimulate discussion on issues and concerns of American 
  Indian Studies and its increasing importance on the national and international 
  scenes.</p>
<p> <b><a name=CULTURAL>Cultural Sovereignty &amp; Native Rights</a></b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian Legal Program and American Indian Studies Program at ASU hosted the 
  symposium: &quot;Cultural Sovereignty: Native Rights in the 21st Century,&quot; 
  on March 6 and 8.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symposium addressed a number of critical issues facing Native Nations and 
  was designed to facilitate a dialogue about inherent sovereignty as a cultural 
  as well as political construct. Featured speakers were Vine Deloria, Jr., Professor 
  of American Indian Studies and Law at University of Colorado, and Kevin Gover, 
  Esq., Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Indian Affairs. </p>

  THE BOARDING SCHOOL EXPERIENCE</p>
<p align="left">
  <b><a name=THE>The Nunavut Atlas</a></b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nunavut Atlas was recently added to the Labriola Collection. The magnificent 
  book of some 260 glossy pages was published by the Canadian Circumpolar Institute 
  and the Tungavik Federation of Nunavut in 1992. Edited by Rick Riewe, the book 
  is divided into four sections: an index map of the Nunavut settlement area; 
  land use and wildlife maps for each of the 27 communities; land use and wildlife 
  map descriptions, which are illustrated with glorious photographs; and 6 foldout 
  maps. </p>
<p> <b><a name=STEREOTYPES>Stereotypes &amp; Mascots</a></b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is another &quot;hot topic&quot; that interests students for their research 
  papers. Philip Deloria writes in the Encyclopedia of North American Indians, 
  that the practice of appropriating Indians as mascots, good-luck charms, or 
  standard-bearers for nostalgia has a long history. In addition, he points out 
  that the continued use of Indianness as an important American symbol has raised 
  serious questions and dilemmas for Native people. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labriola Center aims to collect a broad range of material covering this 
  topic. Following is a partial list of titles that are available for study:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i><b>Images of Indians</b></i> [Videorecording], a five part series which 
    examines the Indian stereotype portrayed in movies and questions what the 
    effect of this Hollywood image has been on the Indians' own self image (NAPBC, 
    Lincoln, NE). Titles within the series are: <i><b>The Great Movie Massacre; 
    Warpaint and Wigs; Heathen Injuns and the Hollywood Gospel; How Hollywood 
    Wins the West; and The Movie Reel Indians</b></i>.</li>

    depictions of Hollywood's Indian and how those representations have reflected 
    larger changes in American society.</li>
  <li><b><i>The Hunt for Willie Boy: Indian Hating and the Popular Culture</i></b>, 
    by James A. Sandos and Larry E. Burgess (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), 
    1994. The authors attempt to recover Willie Boy's real story from the realm 
    of popular, Indian hating culture.</li>
  <li><b><i>Native Americans on Film and Video</i></b>, edited by Elizabeth Weatherford 
    (Museum of the American Indian), 1981. Here is a descriptive bibliography 
    of some 400 videotapes and films, the majority of which have been published 
    between 1970 and 1981. Some of the films are ethnographic documentaries, some 
    are fictional, while others focus on Native individuals.</li>
