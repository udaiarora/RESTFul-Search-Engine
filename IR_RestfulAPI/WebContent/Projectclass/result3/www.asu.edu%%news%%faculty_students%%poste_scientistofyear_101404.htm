      <h2>Biodesign Institute Director George Poste Named Scientist of the Year</a></h2>
      <p>George Poste, director of the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, has been named 2004 Scientist of the Year by <em>R&amp;D Magazine.</em></p>
      <p> <img src="facstudents_images/gposte-portrait.jpg" width="216" height="293" align="right">Poste&rsquo;s 38-year career has encompassed roles in academia, industry and government, and his expertise extends to disciplines as diverse as molecular biology, pharmaceutical development and biosecurity. </p>
      <p> The award honors Poste for his career accomplishments as a world-renowned researcher, scholar and policy maker. It also recognizes his leadership in establishing the Biodesign Institute as a confluence of leading edge technologies, says Tim Studt, editor-in-chief for <em>R&amp;D Magazine.</em></p>
      <p> Poste was recruited by ASU in May 2003 to lead the Biodesign Institute, an initiative aimed at helping transform ASU into a world-class research university. </p>
      <p><em> R&amp;D Magazine</em> is published for the research and development industry and is distributed to more than 80,000 scientists and engineers in industrial, academic and government research. Recent past recipients of the award include J. Craig Venter, whose company led the decoding of the human genome; Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web; Eric Lander, founder of the Center for Genome Research at MIT; Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems; and Nobel Prize winner Kary Mullis. </p>
      <p> Poste says his capacity for curiosity has always been a great motivator. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;I am never bored,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I am the quintessential kid in a candy shop when it comes to any facet of science or technology. Every single day I come across something that makes me say, &lsquo;Wow.&rsquo; &rdquo; </p>
      <p> Poste says his goal at ASU is to create a different kind of research institution, one that integrates the most dynamic components of science, including biology, engineering and computing. The organizational structure and physical environment of the institute have been designed to stimulate discoveries and translate these into new drugs, diagnostic products, medical devices or other developments that improve human health and advance national security. Poste believes there is an urgency for solutions to many pressing global health concerns. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;Our nation is asleep at the switch when it comes to being able to handle a public health crisis caused by infectious disease, whether caused by nature or bioterrorism,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We need faster diagnostics and better information linkages to spot the early signs of an epidemic. We need new classes of drugs, especially as antibiotic resistance becomes increasingly problematic. We need better ways to assess emerging diseases so we can develop vaccines before a sizable population is infected. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;It will take radical changes within government and academia to meet these challenges, including better linkages with industry. The Biodesign Institute at ASU is an incredible vehicle for positively affecting the future.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> Poste, the son of an auto mechanic, was raised in a rural area south of London . He says the bucolic setting instilled a respect for science and nature. After being encouraged by a high school biology teacher, Poste became the first member of his family to attend college. His first doctorate was in veterinary medicine from the University of Bristol, England, where he graduated first in his class. He also holds a doctorate in virology and a doctorate of science. Poste has received honorary doctorates in law and science for his contributions to international health policy, and he is board certified in pathology. </p>
      <p> Poste&rsquo;s wide diversity of knowledge and experience is unusual in the world of science, a field that more typically fosters hyper-specialization. He&rsquo;s a highly sought speaker who is engaged by groups as diverse as public health officials, NATO, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. </p>
      <p> Poste believes his grounding in veterinary medicine equipped him well for the interdisciplinary path his career would follow. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;Because veterinarians must diagnose and treat many species, there is greater focus on identifying the underlying cause of an illness,&rdquo; Poste says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a systems approach that develops strong analytical skills.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> In the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 , terrorist attacks, Poste&rsquo;s expertise began being tapped extensively to aid national security. He served as chairman of the task force on bioterrorism for the U.S. Department of Defense, a role he completed in May of this year. He is a member of the Defense Science Board that advises the Secretary of Defense, and he also serves on the Defense Department&rsquo;s Threat Reduction Advisory Committee. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences Working Group on Biological Weapons and the Forum on Microbial Threats, a project of the Institute of Medicine &rsquo;s Board of Global Health. </p>
      <p> When asked to lead the Biodesign Institute at ASU, Poste says he recognized an opportunity to more directly influence the challenges for which his expertise was being sought. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;The vision of ASU President Michael Crow for a &lsquo;New American University&rsquo; is compelling and echoes many of my own ideas about the transformation needed within our academic and research institutions,&rdquo; Poste says. &ldquo;But what convinced me that I had to be part of the vision was the incredible progress that had been made in what, at the time, was Michael Crow&rsquo;s first year at the helm of ASU. With that type of leadership, I knew we could create a program to produce profound benefits in my lifetime and chart a more integrated course for future generations of scientists.&rdquo; </p>
