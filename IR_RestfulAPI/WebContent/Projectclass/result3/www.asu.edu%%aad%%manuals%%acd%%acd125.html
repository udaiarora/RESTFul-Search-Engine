<p>
This policy defines the boundaries of acceptable use of ASU computing and communication resources, including computers, networks, electronic mail services, electronic information sources, voice mail, telephone services, and other communication resources. In addition, this policy reflects the goal of ASU to foster academic freedom while respecting the principles of freedom of speech and the privacy rights of ASU students, faculty, employees, and guests. 

<p>
ASU&#146;s computing and communication resources are the property of ASU. They are to be used for the advancement of ASU&#146;s educational, research, service, community outreach, administrative, and business purposes. Computing and communication resources are provided for the use of faculty, staff, currently admitted or enrolled students, and other properly authorized users. When a user&#146;s affiliation with ASU ends, ASU will terminate access to computing and communications resources and <a href="acd002.html#Account" target="New">accounts</a>. ASU may, at its discretion, permit the user to have the access to accounts and e-mail forwarded or redirected for a limited period of time.

<p>
Users of ASU&#146;s computing and communications resources are required to comply with this policy, other applicable ASU and regents&#146; policies and state and federal laws. When necessary, enforcement will be consistent with other applicable regents&#146; policies and ASU administrative policies and procedures.

<font size=+1><b><a name="Information">Information Posted to ASU Computers or Web Pages</a></b></font>

<p>
<b>Restriction on Use of ASU Web Pages</b>

<p>
<a href="acd002.html#ASU Web or Home Pages" target="New">ASU Web pages</a> may be used only for ASU business and only authorized individuals may modify or post materials to these pages. No other pages may suggest that they are university Web pages. If confusion is possible, pages should contain a disclaimer and links to ASU sites.

<p>
<b>Responsibilities of Individuals Posting Materials</b>

<p>
By posting materials and using ASU computing facilities, the user represents that he or she has created the materials or that he or she has the right to post or use the materials. The storage, posting, or transmission of materials must not violate the rights of any third person in the materials, including copyright, trademark, patent, trade secrets, and any rights of publicity or privacy of any person. The materials posted must not be defamatory, libelous, slanderous, or obscene. 

<p>
<b>Prohibition against Commercial Use</b>

<p>
The site may not be used for unauthorized commercial purposes. 

<p>
<b>University Control of ASU Web Pages</b>

<p>
The use of the site is at the sole discretion of ASU. ASU does not guarantee that the user will have continued or uninterrupted access to the site. The site may be removed or discontinued at any time at the discretion of ASU in accordance with ASU policy, or as needed to maintain the continued operation or integrity of ASU facilities. 

<p>
ASU makes reasonable efforts to protect the integrity of the network and related services, but ASU cannot guarantee backup, disaster recovery, or user access to information posted on personal computers or Web pages. 

<p>
Access to services and file storage may be approved for emeriti, retired staff, alumni, and guests.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b><a name="Electronic">Electronic Mail and Electronic Communications</a></b></font>

<p>
<b>Conditions for Restriction of Access to Electronic Mail</b>

<p>
Access to ASU e-mail is a privilege that may be wholly or partially restricted without prior notice and without consent of the user: 

<p>
<ol>
<li>if required by applicable law or policy</li>

<p>
<li>if a reasonable suspicion exists that there has been or may be a violation of law, regulation, or policy

<p>
or</li>

<p>
<li>if required to protect the integrity or operation of the e-mail system or computing resources or when the resources are required for more critical tasks as determined by appropriate management authority.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Access to the e-mail system may require approval of the appropriate ASU supervisory or management authority (e.g., department head, system administrator, etc.).

<p>
<b>Conditions for Permitting Inspection, Monitoring, or Disclosure</b>

<p>
ASU may permit the inspection, monitoring, or disclosure of e-mail, computer files, and network transmissions when: 

<p>
<ol>
<li>required or permitted by law, including public records law, or by subpoena or court order</li>

<p>
<li>ASU or its designated agent reasonably believes that a violation of law or policy has occurred

<p>
or</li>

<p>
<li>necessary  to monitor and preserve the functioning and integrity of the e-mail system or related computer systems or facilities.</li>
</ol>

<p>
All computer users agree to cooperate and comply with ASU requests for access to and copies of e-mail messages or data when access or disclosure is authorized by this policy or required or allowed by law or other applicable policies. 

<p>
<b>ASU Responsibility to Inform of Unauthorized Access or Disclosure</b>
        
<p>                    
If ASU believes unauthorized access to or disclosure of information has occurred or will occur, ASU will make reasonable efforts to inform the affected computer <a href="acd002.html#Account" target="New">account</a> holder, except when notification is impractical or when notification would be detrimental to an investigation of a violation of law or policy. 

<p>
<b>Prohibition against Activities Placing Strain on Facilities</b>

<p>                           
Activities that may strain the e-mail or network facilities more than can be reasonably expected are in violation of this policy. These activities include, but are not limited to: sending chain letters; &#147;spam,&#148; or the widespread dissemination of unsolicited e-mail; and &#147;letter bombs&#148; to resend the same e-mail repeatedly to one or more recipients. 

<p>
<b>Confidentiality</b>

<p>                          
Confidentiality of e-mail and other network transmissions cannot be assured. Therefore all users should exercise caution when sending personal, financial, confidential, or sensitive information by e-mail or over the network. 

<p>
<b>Electronic Mail as Arizona Public Record</b>

<p>                        
Most electronic information produced in the course of university business is considered an Arizona public record, and must be stored or deleted in accordance with <a href="acd002.html#Arizona Public Records Law" target="New">Arizona public records law</a>.  Consult with the university archivist for guidance on procedures for external storage or deletion of public records.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b><a name="Privacy">Privacy and Security</a></b></font>

<p>
<b>Routine Logging and Monitoring</b>

<p>
Certain central service and network activities from workstations connected to the network are routinely logged and monitored. These activities include: 

<p>
<ol>
<li>use of passwords and <a href="acd002.html#Account" target="New">accounts</a> accessed</li>

<p>
<li>time and duration of network activity</li>

<p>
<li>access to Web pages</li>

<p>
<li>access to network software</li>

<p>
<li>volume of data storage and transfers

<p>
and</li>

<p>
<li>server space used for e-mail.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Detailed Session Logging</b>

<p>
In cases of suspected violations of ASU policies, especially unauthorized access to computing systems, the system administrator concerned may authorize detailed session logging. This may involve a complete keystroke log of an entire session. In addition, the system administrator of the facility concerned may authorize limited searching of user files to gather evidence on a suspected violation. 

<p>
<b>Responsibility for Data Security</b>
         
<p>                   
Software and physical limitations, computer viruses, and third party intrusions can compromise security of data storage and communications. ASU takes reasonable precautions to minimize risk. Information Technology is not obligated to maintain backups of any file for any particular length of time. Users must protect and back up critical data. Individual users and departments should develop policies and practices to ensure regular backups of data and implement steps to ensure that all critical data is compatible with all current generations of computing equipment, storage media, and media readers. 
  
<p>
<b>Restriction of Access to Sensitive Data</b>

<p>                          
All ASU departments should implement policies to ensure that access to sensitive data is restricted to those employees who have a need to access the information. Passwords restricting access to information should be changed on a regular basis and systems should be developed and implemented to assure password records are regularly updated by appropriate supervisors. 

<p>
<b>Right to Examine Computers and Equipment</b>

<p>                            
University-owned computers and equipment may be examined to detect illegal software and to evaluate the security of the network.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b><a name="Violations">Violations and Enforcement</a></b></font>

<p>
<b>Reporting Violations</b>

<p>
Any actual or suspected violation of the rules listed above should be brought to the system administrator of the equipment or facility most directly involved. In the case of a serious violation, a report may be made to Information Technology or the Office of General Counsel.

<p>
<b>ASU Response to a Reported Violation</b>

<p>
Upon receiving notice of a violation, ASU may temporarily suspend a user&#146;s privileges or move or delete the allegedly offending material pending further proceedings. 
 
<p>                    
A person accused of a violation will be notified of the charge and have an opportunity to respond before ASU imposes a permanent sanction. Appropriate cases will be referred to the ASU disciplinary authority appropriate to the violator&#146;s status (e.g., Office of Student Life or employee&#146;s supervisor) or to appropriate law enforcement authorities. 
 
<p>                           
In addition to sanctions available under applicable law and ASU and regents&#146; policies, ASU may impose a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of <a href="acd002.html#Access Privileges" target="New">access privileges</a> to computing and communication <a href="acd002.html#Account" target="New">accounts</a>, networks, ASU-administered computing rooms, and other services or facilities. 

<p>                            
If ASU believes it necessary to preserve the integrity of facilities, user services, or data, it may temporarily suspend any account, whether or not the account user is suspected of any violation. ASU will provide appropriate notice to the account user. Servers and computers that threaten the security of university systems will be removed from the network and allowed to reconnect only with the approval of network administration. 

<p>
<b>Applicable Law and Policies</b>

<p>
ASU students and employees are bound by all applicable law and Arizona Board of Regents&#146; and university policies. For ease of reference, some frequently referenced policies in ASU manuals are listed in the cross-references at the end of this policy.  Some frequently referenced policies not in ASU manuals are listed in this section below. This list is not intended to be exhaustive nor to limit the applicability of any other law or policy.
