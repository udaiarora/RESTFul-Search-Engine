<P>The LP procedure solves linear programs, integer programs,
and mixed-integer programs. It also performs parametric programming,
range analysis, and reports on solution sensitivity to changes in the
right-hand-side constants and price coefficients.
<P>The LP procedure provides various control options and solution strategies. 
It also provides the functionality to produce various kinds of
intermediate and final solution information.
The procedure's interactive features enable you to take control of 
the problem solving process.   During linear or integer iterations, for
example, you can stop the procedure at intermediate stages 
and examine current results.
If necessary, you can change options or strategies
and resume the execution of the procedure.
<P>The LP procedure is used to optimize a linear function
subject to linear and integer constraints. Specifically, the
LP procedure solves the
general mixed-integer program of the form

</DL>
Linear programs (when <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S</I></SPAN> is empty)
are denoted by (lp). For these problems,
the procedure employs the two-phase
revised simplex method,
which uses the Bartels-Golub update of
the LU decomposed basis matrix to pivot between feasible solutions
(Bartels 1971). 
In phase&#160;1, PROC LP finds a basic feasible solution to (lp),
while in phase&#160;2, PROC LP finds an optimal solution, <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>x</I><SUP><I>opt</I></SUP></SPAN>.
The procedure implicitly handles unrestricted
variables, lower-bounded variables, upper-bounded variables,
and ranges on constraints.
When no explicit lower bounds are specified, PROC LP assumes that
all variables are bounded below by zero.
<P>When a variable is specified as an integer variable,
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S</I></SPAN> has at least one element.  Then, the procedure uses the
branch and bound technique for optimization.
<P>The relaxed problem (the problem with no integer constraints)
is solved initially using the primal algorithm described previously.
Constraints are added in defining the subsequent descendent
problems in the branch and bound tree.
These problems are then solved using the dual simplex
algorithm. Dual pivots are referred to as phase&#160;3 pivots.
<P>The preprocessing option enables the procedure to 
identify redundant and infeasible 
constraints, fix variables, and reduce the feasible 
region before solving a problem.
For linear programs, the option often can reduce the number of 
constraints and variables, leading to a quicker elapsed
solution time and improved reliability.
For integer programs, it often reduces the gap between an integer 
program and its relaxed linear program, which will likely lead to 
a reduced branch and bound tree and a quicker CPU time.
In general, it provides users an alternative to solving large,
complicated operations research problems.
<P>The LP procedure can also analyze the sensitivity of the
solution <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>x</I><SUP><I>opt</I></SUP></SPAN> to changes in
both the objective function and the right-hand-side constants.
There are three techniques available for this analysis:
sensitivity analysis, parametric programming,
and range analysis.
Sensitivity analysis enables you to examine
the size of a perturbation to the right-hand-side or
objective vector by an arbitrary change vector for which
the basis of the current optimal solution remains optimal.
<P>Parametric programming, on the other hand, enables you
to specify the size of the
perturbation beforehand and examine
how the optimal solution changes as the desired perturbation
is realized.
With this technique,
the procedure pivots to maintain optimality as the
right-hand-side or objective vector is perturbed
beyond the range for which the current solution is optimal.
Range analysis is used to examine the range of each
right-hand-side value or objective coefficient for which
the basis of the current optimal solution remains optimal.
<P>The LP procedure can also save both primal and dual
solutions, the current tableau, and the branch and bound
tree in SAS data sets. This enables you to generate
solution reports and perform additional analyses with the
SAS System. Although PROC LP reports solutions, this feature is
particularly useful for reporting solutions in formats
tailored to your specific needs. Saving computational
results in a data set also enables you to continue executing
a problem not solved because of insufficient time or
other computational problems.
<P>The LP procedure uses the Output Delivery System (ODS), a SAS
subsystem that provides capabilities for displaying and controlling
the output from SAS procedures.  ODS enables you
to modify the headers, column names, data formats, and layouts
of the output tables in PROC LP.
<P>There are no restrictions on the problem size in the LP procedure.
The number of constraints and variables in a problem that PROC LP
can solve depends on the host platform, the available memory, and
the available disk space for utility data sets.
