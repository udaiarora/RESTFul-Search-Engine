<h4 class="body">MISSION, GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</h4>

<p class="body">Arizona State University&#8217;s (ASU) goal is to become a world-class 
  university in a multi-campus setting. Its mission is to provide outstanding 
  programs in instruction, research, and creative activity, to promote and support 
  economic development, and to provide service appropriate for the nation, the 
  state of Arizona, and the state&#8217;s major metropolitan area. To fulfill 
  its mission, ASU places special emphasis on the core disciplines and offers 
  a full range of degree programs--baccalaureate through doctorate, recognizing 
  that it must offer quality programs at all degree levels in a broad range of 
  fundamental fields of inquiry. ASU will continue to dedicate itself to superior 
  instruction; to excellent student performance; to original research, creative 
  endeavor, and scholarly achievement; and to outstanding public service and economic 
  development activities. As a result of this dedication, ASU was named to Research 
  Extensive (formerly Research I) status in 1994, recognizing ASU as a premier 
  research institution.</p>
  
  
<h4>AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY </h4>
<p class="body">Mernoy E. Harrison, Executive Vice President for Administration and Finance 
  and William E. Lewis, Vice Provost for Information Technology share the responsibility 
  for coordinating the University&#8217;s efforts in the areas of business continuity 
  and disaster recovery. 
  In the event of an emergency affecting the University &#8211; DPS is contacted 
  at (480) 965-3456 or 911. Depending upon the nature of the emergency, University 
  Emergency Response Teams are deployed.</p>
  
<p class="body">When appropriate, ASU staff works with on-campus resources, federal agencies, 
  state and local governments, the media, and others to assure that the emergency 
  is effectively addressed. Mutual aid agreements are in place with our Department 
  of Public Safety and other law enforcement agencies to assist us in responding 
  to emergencies. The University also monitors and reacts to notices and advisories 
  from external sources including Homeland Security, the Governor&#8217;s Office, 
  etc.</p>

<h4 class="body">RESPONSIBILITY/AUTHORIZATION</h4>
<h4 class="body">Declare Disaster Emergency/Evacuation</h4>
<p class="body"><b>Primary &#8211; </b><br />
  Michael C. Crow, President<br />
  Mernoy E. Harrison, Executive Vice President, Administration and Finance</h4>
<p class="body"><b>Secondary &#8211;</b> <br />
  Milton Glick, Executive Vice President and Provost<br />
  Christine Wilkinson, Senior Vice President and Secretary of the University</p>
<p class="body"><b>Media Spokes Person</b><br />
  Nancy Neff, Assistant Vice President, Public Affairs</p>
<p class="body"><b>Teams</b><br />
  Policy and operations group members have been identified and teams will be formed 
  depending upon the emergency.</p>

  <h4>SUMMARY OF BUSINESS PROCESSES</h4>
  
  <p class="body">ASU is unique in its structure, culture, processes, products, services, and 
  physical facilities. Within our major areas, i.e., Information Technology, Facilities 
  Management, Public Safety, Student Affairs, Research, etc., each organization 
  has documents that address their own unique requirements and key personnel that 
  respond to the kinds of disasters that they anticipate. The Maximum Acceptance 
  Outage also varies by organization and depends upon the business function that 
  is being impacted.</p>
<p class="body">Colleges and departments work hard to reduce, mitigate, and reduce problems 
  from occurring as well as preparing in advance for problems that affect their 
  organizations. Equipment breakdowns, technical glitches or failures, power outages, 
  and human error do occur and are handled in the normal course of doing business 
  so a detailed listing of these impacts would be exhaustive.</p>
<p class="body">In the event of fire, earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters, major 
  accidents, acts of terrorism, large-scale military operations, chemical or biological 
  attacks that would affect the campuses, the safety and security of our students, 
  and employees (faculty and staff) is our first priority. To accomplish this 
  goal, we have business continuity plans in place to address how ASU responds 
  &#8211; recovers &#8211; and restores services in event of these emergencies.</p>
<p class="body">We evaluate and revise those plans as necessary to ensure quick communication 
  and action in the event of an emergency. We use every method of communication 
  available to us, including e-mail, voice mail, the ASU website home page <a href="http://www.asu.edu/">http://www.asu.edu/</a>, 
  external media, posters, and flyers. In addition, ASU has established an information 
  phone line (480) 727-9911 that updates the status of the University as needed 
  and provide instruction in the event of an emergency. We are in the process 
  of adding a toll-free version for out-of-town callers. </p>
<p class="body">We pilot tested a BIA survey document within two critical areas &#8211; Purchasing 
  and Business Services and DPS. (See Attachment) </p>
<p class="body">Given the size and complexity of ASU, however, we realize that the coordination 
  of the distributed disaster continuity and business recovery plans is a significant 
  challenge. Therefore to improve our current practice, ASU in partnership with 
  the University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University is going to purchase 
  Strohl System software. </p>
<p class="body">The Strohl System is designed for large organizations like ASU that has its 
  main campus located in Tempe and additional campuses in West Phoenix, East Mesa, 
  and the Downtown Center in Phoenix. With the Strohl System, the University will 
  be able to maintain the continuity and recovery plans, documents, and contact 
  and personnel information about employees from different colleges, departments 
  and locations into one central database. We anticipate purchase in FY 2003.

  that are underway is contained within this submittal.<br />
