It also means understanding how those   efforts can be used for the betterment of the world. &quot;I don't think anything   brings home the educational process more than students seeing what they are   doing having a positive impact on people's lives,&quot; Colledge said.</p>

To   date few people have considered the role that entrepreneurial activity can play   beyond improving employment. Based on our research, we contend that such   activity can directly confront social problems and create new societal   wealth.</p>

But this includes education not only at primary or post-matriculate   but also at higher levels. Recognising education as an important tool   of empowerment for all sections of society, more so for the upliftment of the   underprivileged sections, conscious efforts have been made to bring the later at   par with rest of the society. It includes provision of opportunities to students   belonging to marginalised sections for higher   learning.</p>
