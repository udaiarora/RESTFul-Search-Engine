      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a grandmother named Jackie Rifkin who's done great things for people's lives.  She's taught people who don't even speak English!  She's provided food for the poor, and reads books (and tells stories) to kids who don't have parents who can read to them.  When I grow up, I hope to achieve as much as my grandma has.
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandmother works with American and Mexican children ages two through five at a daycare.  She teaches them colors, numbers, letters, etc.  They look up to her.  She also goes every Sunday to a dining hall to help serve six hundred people.  While she's there, she laughs and makes jokes with the people to try to brighten up their day.  My grandma loves to bring clothes and books to especially the children there.
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandma teaches English to grown-ups who want to go to college.  Some only want a better life and want to be able to talk to their children.  To do so, they must know English.  She is a librarian, and was for twenty years at a school where some kids were poor.  She shared books with them and taught them how fun reading can be.  Since I was just a baby, my grandma has been there.  I hope to keep learning from her, and I want to be just like her when I'm older.
