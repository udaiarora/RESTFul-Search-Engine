Prior to coming to Arizona State University he was a Robert Wood Johnson Health and Society Scholar and a fellow at Harvard University 's Center for Society and Health. Dr. Haas' research addresses questions that lie at the intersection of social stratification, and the demography of health and aging. His research investigates health as both a cause and a consequence of the stratification process with particular attention to the processes that produce health disparities over the life course. He is currently working on a number of projects in this area. One project explores the relative contribution of early life versus adult factors in determining trajectories of aging and disability. Another investigates the mechanisms linking adolescent health to educational outcomes and the transition to the labor market. A third project examines the influence of childhood health in determining differences in labor market outcomes (earnings profiles, employment interruptions, asset accumulation) over the work career. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Hamilton<br>
</strong><em>Assistant Professor, School of Life Sciences </em></p>
<p>Dr. Hamilton's research focuses on the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the biological sciences, particularly evolutionary theory and systematics, as well as on the relationships between science and public policy. Two goals of this work are to use the tools of philosophy to clarify ideas and arguments with the hope of making progress in answering empirical questions and to bring careful thinking about science to discussions of values and policy in the classroom and in public forums. Within evolutionary theory, Dr. Hamilton is currently concentrating on natural selection. Does natural selection operate above the species level? In what sense are groups individuals with respect to selection's operation? What are the relevant cohesion relations between the individuals that make up various kinds of groups such that it makes sense to countenance the group as an evolutionary individual? This work is massively collaborative, and Dr. Hamilton is partnering with researchers in Arizona State University's Social Insect Study Group and the Center for Social Dynamics and Complexity. Before coming to Arizona State University, Dr. Hamilton taught at the University of Dar es Salaam, the University of San Francisco, and the University of California, Davis . At Davis he was a proud member of the Griesemer lab. In addition to his appointment at Arizona State University, Dr. Hamilton is an Associate of the Center for the History and Philosophy of Science at the California Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p><strong>Arthur Mason<br>
</strong><em>Assistant Professor, School of Justice and Social Inquiry </em></p>
<p>Dr. Mason, an anthropologist from the University of California, Berkeley (Ph.D., 2004), and will be joining the School of Justice and Social Inquiry at the beginning of the 2007-08 academic year. Dr. Mason was awarded a Fulbright research scholarship and is serving as the chair in the U.S.-Canadian Relations working group at the University of Calgary, in Alberta, for this academic year. This Fulbright residency is an ideal locale for Dr. Mason, as his work focuses on U.S.-Canadian policy in the context of Arctic oil and gas energy development. He is editing his dissertation into a manuscript, tentatively titled, ?Modernity and Decay of Alaska's Natural Gas Pipeline.? The manuscript is based on Dr. Mason's first-hand experience of the Arctic energy policy process. Between 2000 and 2003, Dr. Mason held various politically appointed positions for the State of Alaska including Associate Director of Energy in the Office of the Alaska Governor. His ethnographic account of how decision-makers manage the political dynamics of Arctic energy development will include ways in which northern indigenous communities are identified as key to making investment decisions. Dr. Mason's Fulbright scholarship also affords him the opportunity to refine his Russian language skills in anticipation of future comparative research on energy development in the Russian Arctic. Dr. Mason's recent publications on energy policy and planning include, ?The Condition of Market Formation on Alaska's Natural Gas Frontier,? in <em>Focaal, European Journal of Anthropology </em> (winter 2005/06), ?Images of the Energy Future? forthcoming in <em>Environmental Research Letters </em> (winter 2006/07), and ?Histories of the Future in Liberalized Natural Gas Markets,? forthcoming in <em>Public Culture </em> (fall 2007).<strong><br>
