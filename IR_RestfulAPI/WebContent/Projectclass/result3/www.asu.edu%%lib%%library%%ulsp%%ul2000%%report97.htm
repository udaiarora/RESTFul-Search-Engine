				  <p>The Strategic Plan of the University Libraries - UL2000 - was put into action in July, 1996. At that time, we observed that one compelling theme emerged from the planning process: a focus on the customer-driven enterprise.<br><br>
				  The principle of added value for the customer was agreed to as the focus of our decisions, to be interpreted in a constant and conscious manner:
				  <blockquote>
				  "Our philosophy is to work within the context of University priorities to prepare our customers to seek information successfully wherever it is, whatever format it exists in -- to help them learn the skills and behaviors necessary to conduct inquiry and research in any life situation."
				  </blockquote>
				  Following the initiative in the instructional area to enhance undergraduate instruction, ULVR is conducting the "Video Reinforcement Pilot Project," which involves videotaping certain courses in their entirety, making the video available to students for their review, in addition to the class lectures. This project is meant to assess whether students who are offered an opportunity to reinforce their understanding of a course by reviewing the class via videotape as often as they wish obtain measurably higher grades than a similar group who does not receive the video reinforcement. This is one of the ways the University Libraries help to prepare our students to learn the skills and behaviors necessary to conduct inquiry, as quoted above from UL 2000.<br><br>
				  The following tables illustrate steps that have been taken under specific strategic areas. These are the concrete evidence of progress toward our goals. However, what is not evident in these tables is the overall shifts the organization has taken to live up to the commitments restated above, from the first page of our plan. The various seminars and workshops, including group discussions that have taken place in Administrative Council meetings and in-house training sessions, have resulted in process changes at many levels. Decisions are being made with customer input, in more collaborative environments, focused on real customer needs (instead of our best assumptions regarding those needs) and with continuous improvement as a long-term goal.<br><br>
				  Seminars at the library-wide level such as Service Mapping, Leading Change; developing a definition and philosophy of customer service, defining the roles and responsibilities of Administrative Council as well as ground rules for discussions - all have prepared us for work at meetings within departments, teams, and taskforces. In the latter areas, the involvement of staff and customers in determining the future of departments where the leadership was undergoing change (Map Collection, Original Cataloging, now ILL) or examining a series of functions such as the Technical Services Review have produced solutions &/or methods that reflect the Core Organizational Values that we articulated in UL2000.<br><br>In the accompanying tables, various activities that demonstrate progress are referred to; sometimes the same activity appears in more than one initiative area. This is an outcome (whether planned or not) of ?low hanging fruit? or solutions that can address more than one goal. There is also a great deal missing from the brief description of accomplishment. To refer to the launch of new Library Home Pages ignores completely the work that had to be done to achieve this: successful transition to III; successful implementation of new attributes of this system, including Web interface to our catalog; successful taskforce, drawn from various departments and functional areas within the UL, working together on solving the problems solicited from (and volunteered by) customers - internal and external.
