    This is a very nice site because the basic information of the Brand, Slogan, Ad Agency, and year of the ad are included. Not all of the winners will be familiar to those in the U.S. because the slogans are from ad campaigns world wide over the last century. There are hot buttons for links to an example of the ad and any interesting sidelights of the ad for some of the slogans. While this is sponsored by <A

    <P>Advertising Campaigns are often found in announcement notices in <I>Advertising Age</I>, described in books and web sites on <A 
href="#S">Slogans</A> and <A href="#aw">Advertising Awards</A>, particularly the CLIO AWARDS for television, which is often broadcast like the Academy Awards (Oscars). ASU does collect books on advertising campaigns. Use the KEYWORD search to find your industry ("automobile", "beer", "beverages", etc.) and use the word "advertising" as another keyword. Older advertisements are more difficult to find because often they were not preserved. There is no index to advertisements at this time.</P><br>

    The best television commercials are almost all part of a major ad campaign for the product, but this book includes only the television advertisement. The analysis of the commercial is very helpful. Some of the entries have a small photograph of a scene from the commercial. The index includes almost any aspect of the commercial you might want to look up.<BR>
