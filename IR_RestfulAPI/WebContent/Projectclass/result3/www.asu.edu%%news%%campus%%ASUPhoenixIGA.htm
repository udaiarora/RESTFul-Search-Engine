          <p>April 22, 2005 </p>
          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">ASU, Phoenix agree on preliminary plan for downtown campus</h2>
<h2 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
          </h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">ASU and Phoenix staff members have outlined the key elements of a proposed intergovernmental agreement (IGA) to begin developing a 15,000-student campus in the city&rsquo;s downtown area. The agreement now moves on to the Phoenix City Council and the Arizona Board of Regents for approval.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            ASU will move five schools to the new Downtown Phoenix campus: the existing schools of nursing, journalism, and public programs, and the new University College and School of Global Health. KAET-TV/Channel 8, the university&rsquo;s PBS affiliate that has links to the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, also will move downtown. The campus will comprise an urban mix of academic facilities, residential facilities, ground-level dining and retail stores, park space and open pedestrian spaces.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            According to the proposed agreement, the city will acquire about 20 acres of land within the Downtown Redevelopment Area, bound by Van Buren Street, Filmore Street, First Avenue and Third Street; develop and finance academic and academic support space through the renovation of existing buildings and new construction; and build any necessary public infrastructure.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0;"><br>
            ASU will commit to operate and maintain all Downtown Phoenix campus facilities. The university estimates an annual investment of $40 million to $50 million for the costs of academic programs, administrative operations, maintenance and facility operations, and reserve fund contributions after all of the programs are moved and in place in Phase II. </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">These funds will be a combination of transferred funding of the relocated schools from Tempe to downtown Phoenix and enrollment growth occurring in the Downtown Phoenix campus. The university also will be responsible for the development of student housing and campus parking. On- and off-campus residential housing will be funded and constructed by the private sector.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            According to city leaders, the Downtown Phoenix campus will be a major step in building a vital downtown urban core that will serve as a magnet for new residential opportunities, expanded recreational opportunities for neighborhood residents, and new commercial development, dining and entertainment opportunities.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&quot;The Downtown Phoenix campus is the critical mass that will ignite downtown, and the ripples will be felt throughout the city, the Valley and statewide,&rdquo; says Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon. &ldquo;This project is the legacy of this generation of city and university leadership. No other city has ever invested in a state university this way, and no university has partnered with a city in this fashion. You cannot point to anything else that we&rsquo;ve done in Phoenix that is &ndash; or will be &ndash; as important as the Downtown Phoenix campus.&rdquo;</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            The proposed agreement will be voted on first by a Phoenix City Council subcommittee chaired by Councilman Greg Stanton, who has been a proponent of education and a downtown campus.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&quot;If the city can play a role in providing accessible higher education to the citizens of Phoenix and can enhance downtown at the same time, then I believe it&rsquo;s something we should do,&rdquo; Stanton says. &ldquo;ASU is growing, the city of Phoenix is growing, and this is a partnership that can work for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            The development of the Downtown Phoenix campus will provide a significant economic impact for Phoenix, as well as Maricopa County and the state. In addition to the economic impact, the fiscal impact from the one-time construction of the project and the ongoing operations of the campus is significant. According to the 2004 Elliot Pollack economic impact study on the Downtown Phoenix campus:</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&bull; An average of 1,300 jobs will be created annually, with an economic output of $166.8 million.<br>
&bull; At full build-out, the project is expected to create 7,700 jobs, with an annual ongoing operational impact of $569.5 million.<br>
&bull; During the construction phase, the state will collect an average of $5.2 million annually in taxes and fees. Revenues for Maricopa County would be $1.5 million, with $1.7 million going to Phoenix.<br>
&bull; The annual operational impact of a fully built-out campus will create revenues for the state of $18.7 annually, with another $8 million going to the county and $7.3 million to Phoenix.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            The new campus also will significantly benefit ASU and the state&rsquo;s university system.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&quot;Post-secondary student enrollment growth and demographic projections suggest that the increases we have experienced in recent years will continue for the foreseeable future,&rdquo; says ASU President Michael M. Crow. &ldquo;We believe that the state will be best served by providing affordable and convenient educational pathways for Arizona residents, as well as providing geographically and academically diverse program offerings.&rdquo;</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            Although ASU offers programs on three campuses and has limited offerings at its downtown facility, the university is constrained by a lack of adequate facilities.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            The first phase of the project, to be completed by fall 2006, would involve moving the College of Public Programs &ndash; which includes the Schools of Public Affairs, Social Work and Community Resources and Development, and College of Nursing &ndash; downtown. The new University College will operate downtown, and ASU will continue to offer existing extended education programs.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            Phase I will develop 300,000 square feet of academic and academic support space to accommodate a student body of 2,500 students, with on-campus housing for 250 students. It will cost about $100 million.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            Phase II involves further expansion of the campus, planned for fall 2008, using proceeds from a bond program that will be presented to the electorate of Phoenix in March 2006. The second phase will include renovation of the historic post office, as well as the addition of two new academic buildings that will house the Cronkite School and KAET. This will provide an additional 470,000 square feet of academic and academic support space to accommodate up to 8,000 students. Phase II will cost about $133 million.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            ASU and Phoenix will work together over the next five years to find the means to create additional academic space needed to allow the campus to grow to its target size of 15,000 students.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
              According to the terms of the IGA, ASU and Phoenix will cooperate in a number of ways:<br>
&bull; Phoenix will apply revenue from retail uses and other commercial endeavors first to the renewal and replacement account and second to reduce the city&rsquo;s debt.<br>
&bull; ASU and Phoenix will share equally the &ldquo;interim financing&rdquo; costs for up to three years.<br>
&bull; ASU and Phoenix will jointly pursue public private partnerships in developing the campus.<br>
&bull; ASU will engage in fundraising to support the campus and its operations. Funds obtained for capital facilities will be used to reduce the city&rsquo;s debt.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0;"><br>
              In addition, ASU will transfer the Mercado property, its current downtown facility, to Phoenix upon retirement of the existing debt.</p>
