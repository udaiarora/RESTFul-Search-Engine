      <h2><strong>Lecture and Exhibition on Commodore Perry and the Opening of Japan </strong></h2>
      <p>150 years ago, the 'opening' of Japan was an important event for both the U.S. and Japan, but the two cultures saw it very differently. </p>
      <p><strong></strong>        Two MIT professors-John Dower, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, and Shigeru Miyagawa, a linguist named one of 20 national "Shapers of the Future"- have designed an innovative exhibition to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Commodore Matthew Perry's 1853 journey to Japan.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This exhibition, entitled&nbsp; "Black Ships and Samurai,"&nbsp; will arrive in Tempe on April 22 for a one-week showing, direct from showings in Honolulu and Boulder.&nbsp; Sponsored by Arizona State University's Robert C. Staley Distinguished Visiting Professorship in East Asian Studies and the ASU Center for Asian Studies, it will form the center of a unique program of activities for the general public as well as special audiences of K-12 teachers and students and Arizona State University students. The exhibition will run from April 23 - 29, also in Lattie Coor Hall, room L-160.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>        Among the events is a public lecture by Professor Dower <strong></strong>entitled <strong>"Facing 'East,' Facing 'West': Commodore Perry and the Opening of Japan," </strong>on <strong>Thursday, </strong><strong>April 22 at 7:00 p.m. in room 170 of Lattie Coor Hall.&nbsp; </strong></p>
              <p>        Commodore Perry is credited with opening a secluded feudal Japan to trade with the United States, and the term "black ships" comes from the name the Japanese gave to Perry's gunboats, several of which were coal-burning steamships never before seen in Japan.&nbsp; The lecture and exhibition juxtapose Japanese depictions of Perry's arrival with images depicting the same encounter through American eyes.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>        Professor Dower's lecture will focus on the 1853 'opening' of Japan to U.S. trade and on the complex and often humorous perceptions and miscommunications that characterized the beginning of economic and cultural exchange between the two nations.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>        The materials in the exhibition include two scrolls of Japanese artwork; lithographs by William Heine, the young artist who documented Perry's mission; and a 30-foot horizontal scroll digitally displayed on a large-scale plasma screen.&nbsp; An interactive kiosk allows visitors to delve into the images.&nbsp; The exhibition is, in the words of one of its designers, "a balance between art and information..&nbsp; Text is interwoven throughout.&nbsp; Digital animation allows viewers to see details not viewable in any other way."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p>        The exhibition and Professor Dower's lecture will be integrated in the curriculum of the ongoing ASU National Consortium for Teaching About Asia (NCTA) Seminar in East Asian Studies for Secondary School Teachers. An Educators' Focus Group will allow K-12 teachers to discuss and evaluate the Black Ships and Samurai exhibit and web page as teaching tools. The exhibition will also be promoted as a field trip destination for school groups. </p>
              <p>        Exhibition co-creator John Dower is best known for his Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winning work on Japan under U.S. occupation from 1945-1952 and other work on Japan and the U.S. during World War II.&nbsp; His numerous publications include <em> War Without Mercy: Race and Power in the Pacific War</em>, which was honored with several prizes; <em> Empire and Aftermath</em>, a study of the life and times of the diplomat and later prime minister Yoshida Shigeru; <em> Japan in War and Peace: Selected Essays</em>; and <em> Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II</em>, which won numerous honors including the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.&nbsp; He was also the executive producer of a documentary film entitled <em> Hellfire-a Journey from Hiroshima</em>, which was nominated in 1988 for an Academy Award.&nbsp; He has now turned his energies to a long-term project to capture Japanese and American perceptions and images of each other during key episodes in their 150 year, sometimes tumultuous, relationship.&nbsp; The full project is entitled Visualizing Cultures and is part of MIT's OpenCourseWare (MIT OCW) initiative, a pioneering effort to make courses available to the general public via the Worldwide Web. </p>
        <p>        This lecture and exhibition have been made possible by an extraordinary gift of $500,000 from Robert C. Staley endowing the new Robert C. Staley Distinguished Visiting Professorship in East Asian Studies at Arizona State University.&nbsp; Robert C. Staley received a BA in Asian Studies at Monmouth College, Decatur, Illinois, and spent many years doing business in China and other regions of Asia.&nbsp; More recently he founded his own company, S.B. Partners, in Illinois.&nbsp; He is a member of the ASU College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Dean's Advisory Council.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>        The exhibition is also co-sponsored by the Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership. </p>
