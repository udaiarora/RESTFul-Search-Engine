<p>
These ethical principles and types of unacceptable behavior are organized around the individual faculty member&#146;s relation to teaching and <a href="acd002.html#student" target="New">students</a>, scholarship, university, colleagues, and community.  Since university discipline, as distinguished from other forms of reproval, should be reserved for faculty misconduct that is either serious in itself, or is made serious through its repetition or its consequences, the following general principle is intended to govern all instances of its application: University discipline which may result from violation of this code may be imposed on a <a href="acd002.html#facultymember" target="New">faculty member</a> only for conduct which is not justified by ethical principles and which significantly impairs the university&#146;s central functions.
