<P><A name="z0592574">&#13;  
Under other operating environments, a typical method of identifying a SAS
data library (or an individual file in a SAS data library) is to first use
the SAS LIBNAME statement or function within a SAS session or program to assign
a libref to the data library. (See </A><A href="z1name.htm">LIBNAME</A> for complete information about using
the LIBNAME statement under CMS.)  The libref identifies the library and some
of its characteristics to the SAS System. Thereafter, you can use the libref
as a convenient way of referring to the library in your SAS programs.
<P>However, keep in mind the following points when you
identify SAS data libraries under CMS: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Under CMS, you often do not need to assign a libref
to disk-format data libraries.  (For sequential files on tape or on disk,
a libref is always required.  A libref is also required for disk-format files
that are stored in an unaccessed SFS directory.) See <A href="zaccdisk.htm">Working with SAS Files on Disk</A> for an
explanation of how SAS locates disk-format data libraries. <P>

<LI>Under CMS, you can also use the CMS FILEDEF command
to assign a DDname to the data library. Thereafter, you can use the DDname
just as you would use a libref.  However, see <A href="#z-libadv">Advantages of Using the LIBNAME Statement or Function</A> 



for some important considerations. For information about the CMS FILEDEF command,
see <A href="#zfiledef">Using the CMS FILEDEF Command</A> 



.<P>

<LI>In DMS mode, which is accessible through the SAS
Explorer or the LIBASSIGN command, is the "New Library" dialog
for assigning librefs.<P>

 Although you can use the CMS FILEDEF statement to assign DDnames
to your SAS data libraries, there are several reasons for using the LIBNAME
statement or function (and librefs) instead:  </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>The CMS FILEDEF command is not portable to other
operating environments. The LIBNAME statement or function is portable with
minor changes to the <B>physical name</B> and options parameters.<P>

<LI>If you use the LIBNAME statement or function,
you can allocate your data library for only as long as you need it, and then
"free" (deallocate) it.  By contrast, DDnames that are allocated externally
remain allocated for the duration of the SAS session or job. (The LIBNAME
CLEAR statement clears an externally allocated libref, but it does not deallocate
the file. See <A href="zdealloc.htm">Clearing Librefs and DDnames</A> 



.)<P>

<LI>DDnames that are allocated externally cannot be
reassigned later by a LIBNAME statement or function.  You receive an error
message in the SAS log that states that the DDname is currently assigned.<P>

<LI>By using macro statements and the LIBNAME statement
or function, you can conditionally allocate files.<P>

<LI>You cannot assign an engine when you allocate
a file externally.  SAS uses the procedure described in <A href="zwithout.htm">How SAS Assigns an Engine When No Engine Is Specified</A> 



to determine which engine to use. It is more efficient to specify an engine
explicitly in a LIBNAME statement or function.  Also, the following SAS engines
must be specified in a LIBNAME statement or function because they are not
assigned by default: XPORT, BMDP, SPSS, SPSSX, OSIRIS, V5TAPE, V6TAPE, V7TAPE,
V8TAPE, and REMOTE.<P>

<LI>DDnames that are allocated externally are not
included in the list that is produced by the LIBNAME LIST statement or in
the LIBNAME window until after they have been used as librefs in your SAS
session. (See <A href="zas-list.htm">Listing Your Current Librefs</A>

<P><A name="z0592588">&#13;This section provides an overview of the
LIBNAME statement. For
complete information about the LIBNAME statement see </A><A href="z1name.htm">LIBNAME</A>.

</TD></TR></TABLE> 
<DL>
<DT><B>libref</B></DT>
<DD>is the logical name by which the library
is referenced during your SAS session.  The libref must begin with a letter
and must contain one to eight characters consisting of letters or numbers.
<P>When choosing a libref, follow the rules for SAS names,
but do not use underscores.  Also observe the restrictions listed in <A href="#zestrict">Restrictions on Librefs</A> 



.
<P>To read, update, or create files that belong to a permanent
SAS data library, you must include the libref as the first part of a two-level
SAS member name in your program statements, as follows:<FONT size="-1"><A href="#footnote1">(footnote 1)</A></FONT>    

<PRE><I>libref.member</I></PRE>
   <P></DD>

<DT><B>engine</B></DT>
<DD>tells SAS which engine to use for accessing
the library.  See <A href="zengines.htm#zines-t1">SAS Library Engines for CMS</A> 



for information about valid engine names. If you do not specify an engine,
SAS uses the procedures described in <A href="zwithout.htm">How SAS Assigns an Engine When No Engine Is Specified</A> 



to assign an engine for you. If the engine name that you supply does not match
the actual format or attributes of the data library, then any attempt to access
the library will fail.<P></DD>

<DT>'<B>physical-name</B>'</DT>
<DD>enclosed in quotation marks, describes the
physical location of the library. The <B>physical-name</B> can be specified
in the following ways: 
<P>
<DL>
<DT>'<B>filemode</B>'</DT>
<DD>specifies the disk-mode letter or the disk-mode
letter and optional filemode access number.  Use this form for <B>physical-name</B> when you want to use a filemode other than the default.  If you specify
the filemode as a pair of single quotation marks (  
<CODE><B>`'</B></CODE>) or as an asterisk surrounded by single quotation
marks (  
<CODE><B>`*'</B></CODE>), SAS uses
the standard CMS search order to locate an existing SAS library. If the library
exists on more than one minidisk, then SAS stops searching as soon as it finds
a member. Consequently, only the member on that minidisk is used. Otherwise,
if the library does not exist, the assignment defaults to the first R/W accessed
disk.<P></DD>

<DT>'<B>filetype filemode</B>'</DT>
<DD>specifies the filetype to be used for the
library and the disk-mode letter.  <B>filemode </B> can also include
a filemode access number. Use this form for <B>physical-name</B> when
you want to use the libref as an alias for the filetype.<P></DD>

<DT>'<B>filetype sfs-dir</B>'</DT>
<DD>specifies an SFS directory to be used as
a SAS library. Use this form for <B>physical-name</B> when you want
to use the libref as an alias for the filetype. <P></DD>

<DT>'<B>sfs-dir</B>'</DT>
<DD>specifies an SFS directory to be used as
a SAS library.<P></DD>

<DT>'<B>filename filetype filemode</B>'</DT>
<DD>specifies the complete CMS fileid.  Use
this form for <B>physical-name</B> with the BMDP, OSIRIS, SPSS, and
XPORT engines.<P></DD>

<DT>('<B>filetype-1 &lt;filemode-1 | SFS-directory-1></B>' . . .'<B>filetype-n &lt;filemode-n | SFS-directory-n'>)</B></DT>
<DD>specifies a concatenation of more than one library that
will be accessed by SAS in order of specification using a single fileref.
See <A href="z1106548.htm">Concatenating SAS Data Libraries</A>
for more information on concatenation of SAS data libraries.<P></DD>

<DT>'TAP<B>n</B>'</DT>
<DD>specifies the tape device for a sequential
library.  <B>n </B> is a hex character from 0 through F.<P></DD>

  There are
several advantages to using the LIBNAME statement
or function to make your SAS data libraries available to your SAS programs.
(See </A><A href="#z-libadv">Advantages of Using the LIBNAME Statement or Function</A> 



.)  However, in most cases you can also use the CMS FILEDEF command for this
purpose. 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot use the CMS FILEDEF command
to assign a DDname to a SAS data library that resides on an unaccessed SFS
directory.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<P>If you choose to issue a CMS FILEDEF command for a SAS
data library, then use the following form of the command:
<P>
<TABLE cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2">
<TR valign="top"><TD>
<B>FILEDEF</B> <I>DDname</I> DISK <I>dummy
filemode</I>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<DL>
<DT><B>DDname</B></DT>
<DD>is the libref that you want to use for the
data library.<P></DD>

<DT><B>dummy</B></DT>
<DD>specifies any valid character string for
the filename and filetype positions in the command.  You can use the same
value in both positions, and SAS will substitute the correct filename and
filetype.  Thus, you need to issue only one FILEDEF command per libref, regardless
of the number of SAS data libraries that have or will have that libref.<P></DD>

<DT><B>filemode</B></DT>
<DD>references the  correct  minidisk  for the
 data library.<P></DD>
</DL>

<P>Remember, though, that if you choose to issue your own
CMS FILEDEF command, you cannot subsequently issue a LIBNAME statement or
function that uses the DDname that is assigned by the FILEDEF command as a
libref.  
<BR><H3><A name="z-ddname">Using a DDname as a Libref</A></H3>


<P><A name="z0592643">&#13;
  After a DDname has been assigned,
you can use it in a SAS job
in the same way you would use a libref.  For example:    
</A>
<PRE>proc contents data=books._all_;
run;</PRE>
<P>The first time that the DDname BOOKS is used in this
manner, SAS assigns it as a libref for the SAS data library.
<P>When a DDname is allocated externally, it is not listed
by the LIBNAME LIST statement or in the LIBNAME window until after you have
used it as a libref in your SAS session. (See <A href="zas-list.htm">Listing Your Current Librefs</A>
