<p>
The <a href="acd002.html#boardonequalopportunity" target="New">Board on Equal Opportunity (BEO)</a> may be utilized for hearings on written <a href="acd002.html#Complaint" target="New">complaints</a> of unlawful discrimination not resolved under the procedures set forth in <a href="acd403.html">ACD 403</a>, &#147;Procedures for Resolving Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination&#148; or in accord with <a href="acd509-02.html">ACD 509&#150;02,</a> &#147;Grievance Policies and Procedures for Faculty.&#148; The BEO will review all requests for hearings, recommending denial or acceptance.

<p>
After accepting a request for hearing, the chair of the BEO and the director or an assistant director from the <a href="acd002.html#eo/aaoffice" target="New">EO/AA Office</a> will work together to arrange the hearing and gather the necessary information from the <a href="acd002.html#complainant" target="New">complainant</a> and <a href="acd002.html#respondent" target="New">respondent</a>.

<p>
A quorum of the BEO will convene as a hearing panel to hear the complaint, meeting afterward in a closed session to vote and determine whether discrimination has occurred.  The BEO panel will then report its findings and recommendations to the <a href="acd002.html#president" target="New">president</a>, who will make a final decision on the complaint.

<p>
The &#147;<a href="#Procedures">Procedures</a>&#148; section describes the composition of the BEO and details its review, hearing, and decision processes.

<p>
<b>Accessibility for Complainants with Disabilities</b>

<p>
All phases of the complaint procedures, including the hearing before the BEO, shall be made accessible to complainants or respondents with disabilities.  If auxiliary aids are requested to assist in participation at the hearing, reasonable efforts shall be made to provide them. Auxiliary aids may include the use of interpreters.

<p>
<b>Waiver of Time Limitation</b>

<p>
Any deadlines for providing information or for hearings specified by the BEO hearing procedures may be extended or waived for good cause at the discretion of the chair of the BEO or the president.

<p>
<b>Confidentiality</b>

<p>
The right to confidentiality of all parties involved in a discrimination charge shall be strictly observed insofar as confidentiality does not interfere with the university&#146;s legal obligation to investigate allegations of misconduct brought to the university&#146;s attention and to take corrective action.

<p>
<b>Retaliation Prohibition</b>

<p>
The university prohibits retaliation against anyone seeking redress under these procedures.  Any retaliatory action taken by a supervisor, manager, or employee of the university against the complainant, a witness, or any participant in the grievance process is prohibited and may be grounds for termination from employment.  Retaliation shall be regarded as a separate complaint under these procedures.

<font size=+1><b>Filing the Request for Hearing</b></font>

<p>
From the date the Office of Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action (EO/AA) or executive vice president and provost of the university/vice president/vice provost notifies the parties to a complaint that they may request a hearing before the BEO or in accord with ACD 509&#150;02, the parties have 30 <a href="acd002.html#day" target="New">days</a> to request a hearing.  In the case of a complaint filed against a unit such as the office of a dean or any <a href="acd002.html#department" target="New">department</a>, the respondent shall seek approval by the vice president/vice provost responsible for that area prior to requesting a hearing before the BEO.  A request to the BEO for a hearing shall be made on a Request for Hearing form (see <a href="acd404a.pdf">ACD 404A</a>), which is available from EO/AA.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Denial or Acceptance of the Request for Hearing</b></font>

<p>
Upon receipt of the Request for Hearing form, the chair will convene the BEO in person, by e-mail, or by telephone.  After reviewing the Request for Hearing form, the BEO may recommend denial or acceptance of the request. The decision must be made within seven days of receipt of the Request for Hearing form.

<p>
<b>Denial</b>

<p>
The BEO may recommend denial of the request for any of the following reasons:

<p>
<ol>
<li>The complaint of discrimination was not filed within 120 calendar days.</li>

<p>
<li>The complaint on its face fails to state a claim of unlawful discrimination.</li>

<p>
<li>The complaint may be more appropriately pursued through another avenue, such as the University Grievance Committee or the University Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure, because the central issue or issues are other than discrimination.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If the recommendation of the BEO is to deny the request for a hearing, the chair shall within 10 days inform the complainant, the respondent, and the president in writing, stating grounds for the recommendation to deny.

<p>
<b>Acceptance</b>

<p>
If the request for a hearing is accepted by the BEO, the chair shall within seven days of accepting the complaint, forward a copy of the request and the complaint to the respondent, requesting a written response within 15 days of receipt.  Concurrently, EO/AA will ensure that the complainant and the respondent each have a copy of this policy. Hearings involving allegations of <a href="acd002.html#sexualharassment" target="New">sexual harassment</a> will be completed and the report filed with the president within 90 days of acceptance of the request for hearing.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Preparation for the Hearing</b></font>

<p>
If the BEO determines that a hearing is warranted, the chair will:

<p>
<ol>
<li>Set a hearing date within 60 days of the receipt of the request for a hearing.</li>

<p>
<li>Notify the complainant and the respondent in writing at least 20 days before the hearing of the time and place of the hearing before the BEO and of their right to use counsel during the proceedings.</li>

<p>
<li>Meet with the complainant and the respondent and their counsel, if appropriate, before the hearing to narrow the issues and discuss any related matters.</li>

<p>
<li>Facilitate exchange of documents with the parties and provide copies of the parties&#146; documents to the hearing panel at least 15 days before the hearing.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The BEO shall convene as a body at the time and place indicated on the notice to the complainant and respondent.

<b>General Provisions for the Hearing</b>

<p>
The hearing is not a trial; however, witnesses shall be under oath.

<p>
Both the complainant and the respondent shall be present for all testimony.  At the request of the complainant or the respondent, witnesses shall be excluded from the hearing except while testifying.

<p>
The complainant or respondent or their counsel may challenge any member of the hearing panel for good cause, such as potential conflict of interest, bias, or other good cause for challenge.  The chair&#146;s decision on the challenge will be final; however, the challenge for good cause and the chair&#146;s decision will be part of the hearing record and noted in the report to the president.

<p>
The complainant and the respondent or their counsel shall have the opportunity to review all documentary information presented by the opposing party during the hearing.  The complainant and the respondent or their counsel shall have the opportunity to explain or rebut any oral or documentary information presented to the BEO.
