      <h2>Funding critical to lift quality, access</h2>
      <p>As the Phoenix metropolitan
          population continues to surge - growing from 3.5 million to eventually
          7 or 8 million - the college-age population
          is burgeoning. The Governor's Task Force on Higher Education estimates
          that by the year 2020, nearly 150,000 students will be enrolled at
        the three state universities and more than 200,000 students will be in
        Arizona
          community colleges.</p>
      <p>A healthy university system is vital to the future
          of the state. For many students, ASU increasingly has become the school
          of choice, with
          record enrollments in both size and quality for the past several years.
          The increased enrollment at ASU comes at a time when the University
        of Arizona is considering capping enrollment and Northern Arizona University
          is experiencing slower growth. Since Fiscal Year 2001, ASU has enrolled
          an additional 7,628 full time equivalent students - with no additional
          state investment for those students.</p>
      <p>"The fact that ASU, in recent years,
          has managed to increase in size while maintaining high quality is no
          small feat," says Virgil Renzulli,
          vice president for Public Affairs. "In fact, ASU has had numerous accomplishments
          to celebrate, while some universities across the country have experienced
          layoffs, hiring freezes, enrollment caps and/or program cuts."</p>
      <p>This academic
          year, ASU enrolled 173 National Merit Scholars, the most ever, and
        up from only 24 in 1992. Last year was ASU's most successful
          fund-raising year ever - capped by two $50 million gifts from individuals
          and $10 million from the Piper Memorial Charitable Trust. The university
          has attracted top faculty, scientists and administrators from some
        of the nation's most elite institutions. And, the people of Arizona,
        through
          their representatives, approved $185 million in long-term financing
        to build research infrastructure.</p>
      <p>ASU President Michael Crow says ASU's transformation
          is catching attention and causing people to not only stand up and take
          notice, but also to
          take a personal interest and make a commitment.</p>
      <p>"We have presented our
          goals in such a way that people see the end result - a stronger Arizona
          economy, a well-educated workforce, a nationally
          competitive university, and more high-paying jobs," says ASU President
          Michael Crow. "We haven't said, 'please help us because we need your
          help, please help us because we're underfunded, please help us because
          we lack resources.' These new sources of revenue sensed the energy
        of an enterprise wanting to move forward and all of those investments
        were
          a product of that."</p>
      <p>True to Crow's commitment, the university has been
          very entrepreneurial in its efforts to develop other revenue sources.
          But as a public institution,
          ASU still requires its major investor - the state of Arizona - to fund
          its core operating expenses.</p>
      <p>In its Fiscal Year 2005 budget request to
          the Legislature, ASU, with approval from the Arizona Board of Regents,
          is requesting an additional
          $58.6 million to cover unfunded core operating costs, primarily associated
          with the university's significant enrollment growth.</p>
      <p>"We are a very successful
          state university trying to become a unique national university in a
        unique place," says Crow. "We have a long way
          to go. The institution is probably funded at 50 percent of the level
          that's needed to carry out the mission we have. Tremendous things have
          been done with the limited funding. The people of Arizona are the most
          significant contributor to this institution and, person for person,
        they're also the most generous contributor."</p>
      <p>Crow says he and others will be making
          the case that ASU must have resources to maintain quality and to maintain
          access.</p>
      <p>"There are increasing numbers
          of qualified individuals who want what ASU has to offer, but we must
          have the resources to move forward," he
          says. "At this moment, when the university is becoming more diversified
          than ever, more accessible than ever, more open to qualified students
          than ever, more engaged in the community than ever, we have to advance
          this university by seeking additional resources from our prime investor
        - the people of Arizona."</p>
