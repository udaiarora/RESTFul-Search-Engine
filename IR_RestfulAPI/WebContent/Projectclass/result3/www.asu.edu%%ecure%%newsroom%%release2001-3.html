<h2>Press Release:<br />
    Conference Expands to Include E-Government
</h2>

<p>September 2001</p>

<p>Today, administrators in state and local government face a myriad of complex
challenges involving their electronic records. Due to rapid changes in
technology, the answers are often not obvious, and can be beyond the reach of
existing training programs and available policy.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, decisions must be made daily on questions like these: How do
you save and manage the electronic signatures that result from transactions on
your portal site? How do you identify and save state records that are sent as
e-mail? How can you prepare for the use of electronic records in litigation
defense? How can you describe and store electronic records for efficient
retrieval?</p>

<p>These are a few of the challenges to be addressed in a national two-day
conference to be hosted by Arizona State University.</p>

<p>On October 12th and 13th, administrators, technology professionals and
managers responsible for creating or maintaining electronic documents will
convene at 
<acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym>&nbsp;2001. 
Experts from across North America will present foundation sessions on
fundamental skills, case studies and leading-edge research on emerging
strategies. Topics will include selection, retention, protection and
accessibility for many types of electronic information.</p>

<p>Now in its third year, 
<acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym> has
been featured in the Chronicle of Higher Education and
Office.com. Building upon its successful programs for administrators
in higher education, the conference is being expanded this year to address the
needs of government employees.</p>

<p><acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym>&nbsp;2001
will feature a range of distinguished presenters and a unique interdisciplinary
approach. Attorneys, archivists, librarians, government administrators,
managers and technology professionals will interpret critical issues for you.
Small group discussion sessions will allow unparalleled post-presentation
access to the experts.</p>

<p><acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym>&nbsp;2001:
Preservation and Access for Electronic College and University Records is
co-sponsored by the Coalition for Networked Information and the Arizona State
Library, Archives, and Public Records, with the support of Bell and Howell
Information and Learning.</p>

<p>Group discounts are available. Early registration ends September 17th.
For additional program and registration information, see the conference Web
site at &lt;<kbd><a href="http://www.asu.edu/it/events/ecure/">http://www.asu.edu/it/events/ecure/</a></kbd>&gt;.</p>
