How do I Decode a File that is BINHEX Coded?
</center></h2>

<p><b>
Question:</b><br> 
I received an email message from a friend with an attachment.  The
atttachment says:
<p>
17KB  Applications/Mac-BINHEX40
<p>
I saved it onto my "m(?)" drive like the guys here told me to do
but I can't see it.  It's coded or something.  For example, one line says:
<p>
PFL"SB@3jgf&amp;ZG'9N)'%JBQpj)'&amp;ZC#"PGQ9Z)(4SEh9RD#"*)(GKFb"K)'GTFQ'
<p>
How can I look at this document, save it on to my disk and/or print it?

Response:</b><br>
BINHEX4.0 is a form of coding data that is transmitted over the internet.
You can decode the file by using a BINHEX converter, however, the easiest
way I know of converting the file and saving it to your disk is to use a
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) program for the Mac called Fetch.  Fetch will
decode and download the file from your AFS space/"m-drive" and save it on a
disk on the Mac.
<p> 
To use Fetch in this manner, you will need to do the following:
 <p>
Open Fetch.  For the host name enter "general.asu.edu".  Use your ASURite
id and password for the appropriate fields.  This should bring up a list of
files on your AFS space.  Go to the "customize" menu and select
Preferences.  Under "topic" go to "formats" and then check the BinHex4.0
box.  Click on OK.  Then highlight the name of the file and click on "get
file".  This should decode the file and download it to the disk of your
choice.
<p> 
Once the file is decoded, you can view it in or print from an application
that is compatible with the application that created the file.

Question:</b><br>
As a Microsoft Windows user, what options do I have?
<p><b>
Response:</b><br>
There is an unpacking utility called "Win Pack32 Delux" I found
on Windows95.com. It will allow you to view BINHEXed files. The URL for
the website is:
<p>
<blockquote> 
        http://www.windows95.com/apps/compress.html#586
</blockquote> 
<p>
Now as for using it we are not sure, we do not support this
product. We found something we hope will work for you though.
