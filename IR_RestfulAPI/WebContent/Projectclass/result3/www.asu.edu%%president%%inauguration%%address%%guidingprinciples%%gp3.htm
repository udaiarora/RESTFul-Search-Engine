I draw no distinction between the creative         expression of the artist and the physicist, or the musicologist and the         long-distance runner. Or the poet and the computer scientist. Creative         expression in all forms is our highest goal. Our objective is to provide         a setting in which creative expression can take place, where important         new poetry can be written and analyzed, or the work of a minor Jacobean         playwright may be evaluated. Where kinship practices of preliterate societies         in the Guatemalan highlands may be assessed, or the vortex dynamics of         the atmosphere of a distant star. The new molecule, the new minimalist         sculpture, the new defensive line formation in Sun Devil Stadium&#8212;these         are all forms of creative expression, and I hold all forms equal. How         could I not, as each are mechanisms through which the human spirit is         expressed?<br>      </p>      <p> If some among us are elected to membership in the national academies,         if others generate streams of revenue from the licensing of a new technology,         or if owing to the brilliant performance of the Sun Devils we draw 55,000         fans to every football game, we may all well be pleased, but I would suggest         that these are secondary returns to the intrinsic reward of creative expression         itself. </p>      <p>As members of an academic community, we live in a privileged setting.         In a sense, we are members of a privileged class. I am not suggesting         that we live in an ivory tower, but to some extent we are sheltered from         the mundane, complicated, and sometimes painful workaday world. In this         protected realm, it is our responsibility, it is our job, it is our privilege         to be creative. We should take this privilege to heart, and appreciate         the extent to which we have assumed a special responsibility to all of         society. </p>      <h2>&nbsp;</h2>      <h2>&nbsp; </h2>      </td>    <td align="center" valign="top"> &nbsp;<BR> </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="bottom"><a href="gp2.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="../images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="gp4.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="gp4.htm"><img src="../images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>    <td align="center" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
