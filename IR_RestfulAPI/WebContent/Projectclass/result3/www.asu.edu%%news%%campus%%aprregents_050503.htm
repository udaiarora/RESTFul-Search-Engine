      <h2>Regents approve new admission requirements for state's universities</h2>
      <p>        Establishing new 2003 - 04 university admission requirements, special
          class fees and new degree programs were key actions taken by the Arizona
      Board of Regents at its April 24 - 25 meeting in Tucson. </p>
      <p>Board president
            Jack Jewett of Tucson said establishing new admission requirements
            is the last cornerstone needed for full implementation of
          the board's Changing Direction Initiative, a series of new policies
        designed to give Arizona's three universities more flexibility in defining
        their
        niche while increasing the likelihood for student success. </p>
      <p>The board
          voted unanimously to support the new admissions policy, which assures
          admission for the top 25 percent of graduating Arizona high school
          seniors who have no curricular deficiencies. Formerly, the universities
          used grade-point averages and standardized test scores as criteria
        for assured admissions. </p>
      <p>The new admissions policy also delegates authority
          to the universities to admit students eligible for what was formerly
          designed as "conditional
          admission." This allows universities to review admissions of some student
          applications on a case-by-case basis where academic deficiencies exist.
          This designation was changed to Delegated Admission by the action,
        which requires students have a class rank in at least the second quartile
        or
          a grade-point average of at least 2.5. Under this designation, students
          must also have no more than two curricular deficiencies, of which mathematics
        or science cannot both be included.</p>
      <p>"It is important that the universities
          consider many factors for admitting students to our public institutions,"
          said Board President-elect Chris
          Herstam of Phoenix. "While we are awaiting the U.S. Supreme Court's
        decision on the Michigan case, which I hope is upheld, I think this action
        is
          critical to ensuring a fair and reasonable opportunity for admissions
        for all students."</p>
      <p>The board voted in favor of approving the university-recommended
          special class fees and deposits and special program fees for the 2003
          - 04 academic
          year. Among those fees approved for ASU is a $500 B.S. in business
        fee to cover both fall and spring semesters and $125 fee for each of
        the
          two summer sessions. The intersession fee for the program is $70. The
          fees will apply only to incoming juniors, and will not affect current
          juniors and seniors already admitted to the program, said Larry Penley,
          dean of the W. P. Carey School of Business. The additional fees will
          be used to raise the quality of students' educational experience, he
        said.</p>
      <p>Other ASU special program fees approved by the board include the
          Critical Languages Institute, CLI, $300; M.S.E. graduate professional
          certificate,
          $506; M.S.E. distance learning program, $506; M.S.E. accelerated weekend
          - evening program, $637; and the executive M.S.E. distance learning
        program, $786.</p>
      <p>ASU received board approval to implement a new doctoral program
          in religious studies on Main Campus and an interdisciplinary minor
        in organizational
          studies at ASU West.<br>
        The new doctoral program will train graduate students for careers as
          scholars and teachers and provide supplementary training for graduate
          students in a range of related programs, including history, anthropology,
          political science, journalism, secondary educations and justice studies.
          The new minor in organizational studies will increase students' understanding
          of organizational behavior and the dynamics of social processes in
          the workplace. </p>
      <p>The board is also considering a policy revision to expand
          the availability of tuition waivers to the children and spouses of
        Arizona military service
          personnel killed in the line of duty in response to a Presidential
        Executive Order, as well as to severely disabled combat survivors. Waivers
        are
          already provided for children and spouses of slain Arizona Peace Officers,
          fire fighters and emergency paramedics. The board is expected to vote
        on the measure in its June meeting.</p>
      <p>Work on a new multi-tier, 1,500 vehicle,
          $15 million parking structure is expected to begin in August on current
          lot 59, with occupancy expected
        by August 2004. </p>
      <p>Executive Vice President for Administration and Finance
          Mernoy Harrison said the new structure will become a signature gateway
          into the Main
        Campus from the north. </p>
