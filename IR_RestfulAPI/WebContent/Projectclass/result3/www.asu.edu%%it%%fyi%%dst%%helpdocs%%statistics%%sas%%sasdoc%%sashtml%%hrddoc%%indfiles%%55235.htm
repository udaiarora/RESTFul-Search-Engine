At last!  A comprehensive, applications-oriented mixed models guide for    data analysis.  Discover the latest capabilities available for a wide
range of applications featuring the MIXED procedure in SAS/STAT            software.  This practical guide integrates the theory underlaying the
models, the specific forms of the models for various applications, and     examples from many different fields of study using appropriate SAS code
with interpretation of results.
Specific models discussed include:  simple random-effect only, simple      mixed with a single fixed and random effect, split-plot, multilocation,
repeated measures, analysis of covariance, random coefficients, and        spatial correlation.
With a background in two-way ANOVA and regression and basic knowledge of
linear models and matrix algebra, you will benefit from the discussion     of basic to advanced topics in this book.  A working knowledge of
experimental design is also helpful.
