      <h2>Grogan helps others attend ASU, earns degree</h2>
      <p>        DeDe Grogan has worked for ASU's Child &amp; Family Services Office
        as an administrative assistant since 1996. She not only provides information
        and assistance to student parents, but also shares with them words of
        encouragement and friendship.</p>
      <p>Her co-workers agree Grogan is exceptionally
          good at cheering on student parents as they deal with the ups and downs
          of the college experience.
          She reminds them that with enough determination anything is possible,
          and she serves as the perfect example. </p>
      <p>For the past 11 years, Grogan
          has juggled a full time job, college course work and raising her son
          Seth. This week she is graduating from ASU cum
          laude with a bachelor of arts in English. </p>
      <p>Grogan says she really enjoys
        her job at the Child &amp; Family Services
        Office because she is able to help parents find the resources they need
        to make their dreams of graduating come true. </p>
      <p>"Many times I get parents
          who are upset or frustrated at not being able to find the resources
        they need for their families," Grogan says. "I
          have been given the wonderful opportunity of mentoring and even assisting
          families in finding those resources to make attending school and even
          graduating a reality. What more could someone ask for within a job?"</p>
      <p>After
          graduation she plans to continue working at ASU, but will take a break
          from school so she can spend time with her family before continuing
          her education.</p>
      <p>"After my small break I plan to enroll in the College of
          Education and work on a post-bac. This would certify me as a teacher,"
          Grogan says.
          "Then I plan to obtain my masters in early childhood Education with
        an emphasis on special needs."</p>
      <p>From there, Grogan wants to create special-need
          child care centers for various ages which would encompass all aspects
          needed by a child, teen,
          young adult, adults and families. </p>
      <p>Though she feels good about her latest
          accomplishment, Grogan says she owes much to her supervisors and her
          co-workers.</p>
      <p>"I am very lucky and
          grateful to have such a wonderful support system; everyone should be
          so lucky," she says. "I believe that support from
          family, friends and co-workers is the key to my graduating this May
        2003."</p>
      <p>Linda
          Sullivan, executive coordinator for Co-Curricular Programs, says Grogan
          is far too modest.</p>
      <p>"What sets DeDe apart from others is her unwavering
          commitment to achieving her goals, even when faced with personal and
          professional challenges,"
          Sullivan says. "As a full-time employee and mother, DeDe has had to
        make many difficult decisions and sacrifices over the years. She has
        done
          so with the knowledge that some day it would pay off for her and her
          family. Thanks to her persistence and dedication, that time has finally
          arrived."</p>
      <p>Maureen Duane works as a program coordinator, senior, for the
        Child &amp; Family
        Services Office, and says she loves working with Grogan because she "gets
        it." </p>
      <p>"She has a very strong work ethic and puts her heart and soul into
          her work," Duane says. "This is evident from her direct interactions
          with
          families to her advocacy efforts on behalf of all families."</p>
      <p>Duane says
          she is thrilled Grogan has decided to stay on with the department indefinitely.</p>
      <p>"Having worked with ASU families for 14 years now, I see
          DeDe as the perfect example of why student parents are here - they
        do it for their
          children, both as a way to improve their lives economically, but also
        to serve as a model of the importance of education," she says.</p>
