<h1 class="storyhead">National Science Foundation lauds 3 ASU researchers </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>Three young faculty researchers in ASU's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences are recent recipients of awards from the National Science Foundation that together total more than $1.3 million. </p>
<p>The awards are for individual projects as diverse as seismic data analysis, children's ability to regulate their emotions and the application of DNA as a nanoscale building material. </p>
<p>The three - Matt Fouch, Carlos Valiente and Hao Yan - were awarded Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grants by the NSF for their research. </p>
<p>This highly competitive award program is the NSF's most prestigious grant to junior faculty. It was established to help scientists and engineers develop simultaneously their contributions to research and teaching early in their careers. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Matt Fouch </strong></p>
<p><img src="http://asu.edu/news/stories/200605/images/Fouch_headshot_office.jpg" width="180" height="284" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right">To better understand and study earthquakes and volcanoes, geologists need to understand the structure and dynamics of Earth's interior. With this NSF grant, Fouch, an assistant professor in geological sciences, will develop semi-automated data analysis tools so that Earth science students can perform seismic research in the classroom, using real-time data from a variety of sources, including USArray, the seismic monitoring component of NSF's new EarthScope Program. </p>
<p>"There's no way to get samples from a wide range of places deep inside Earth," says Fouch, who was awarded a five-year, $492,000 grant. "But by bringing data from seismic stations around the world into the classroom, students will be able to image its interior in unprecedented detail." </p>
<p>"We are really excited to be supporting Matt Fouch through the first CAREER grant made under the new and growing EarthScope Program," says Kaye Shedlock, NSF's EarthScope program director. "Matt exemplifies the goals of EarthScope: bringing new ideas and interdisciplinary skills to bear on fundamental questions about the tectonics of North America." </p>
<p>"Bringing geophysical research into the undergraduate classroom is a challenge," Fouch says. "This project is one of the ways we can enable that. These projects will be truly hands-on research in a classroom setting, which I believe is the future of science instruction and an integral part of ASU's new School of Earth and Space Exploration." </p>
<p>The other focus of the grant will be to develop new data sets and numerical models that integrate results from EarthScope's Plate Boundary Observatory, which measures deformation at Earth's surface with USArray data that provides information about deformation within and beneath Earth's tectonic plates. More information about EarthScope is online at (www.earthscope.org). </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Carlos Valiente </strong></p>
<p><img src="200605_images/20060510_Valiente.jpg" width="180" height="254" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="left">Some children just seem to have an easier time in elementary school than others. They tend to have more friends, their teachers greet them with a smile and their grades are adequate. </p>
<p>Valiente, an assistant professor in the Department of Family and Human Development, wants to know why - and what can be done to help children who struggle academically. Funding from a five-year, $410,000 NSF grant will allow Valiente to investigate how children's ability to maintain emotional control affects their relationships at school and their performance on schoolwork. The findings, he believes, will provide information educators can use to promote children's early school success. </p>
<p>Valiente suspects that children who control their behavior get more help from their peers and teachers, and this helps them achieve. To investigate this hypothesis, Valiente's project will follow students from kindergarten to second grade to see how their emotion regulation and their social interactions affect their academic performance. During the five-year study, Valiente also will create workshops for teachers to apply these lessons. </p>
<p>"I hope to better understand how children's emotions and relationships influence their academic performance," Valiente says. </p>
<p>Valiente earned his bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from ASU before joining the faculty in 2003. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Hao Yan </strong></p>
<p><img src="200605_images/20060510_Hao-Yan.jpg" width="180" height="254" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right">The twisting, ladder-like structure of DNA is one of the most recognizable icons in all of biology. Now, researcher Yan is becoming a virtual Frank Lloyd Wright of DNA architecture, folding and fashioning DNA at the molecular level in a wide variety of new shapes to create strong nanoscale girders. </p>
<p>Yan, an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and a member of the Center for Single Molecule Biophysics in the Biodesign Institute, is the recipient of a five-year, $400,000 CAREER award for a project titled "DNA Directed Self-Assembly of Multicomponent Nanoarchitectures." </p>
<p>Yan's self-assembled DNA structures are providing the foundation for the burgeoning science of nanoarchitecture - building at the molecular scale DNA scaffolding for a broad range of technological applications important for human health and bioelectronic sensing devices. </p>
<p>"We are starting with an idea and structure from biology and now trying to apply DNA as a nanoscale building material," Yan says. </p>
<p>An initial partnership has been established between Yan's lab and Chandler High School to develop DNA architects. Part of the award will focus on science dissemination by bringing fun and exciting scientific experimental modules in DNA-based nanobiotechnology. Outreach efforts include expanding to additional Valley high schools, providing classroom support to teachers and a Web-based, how-to handbook of protocols. </p>
<p>A pair of faculty in the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, Cody Friesen and Karamvir S. Chatha, also received CAREER awards in 2006. </p>
<p>Friesen, an assistant professor in mechanical and aerospace engineering, will research ultra-thin metallic films used in computer technology and window coatings, and single-atom-thick films for fuel-cell catalysts. Chatha, an assistant professor in computer science and engineering, will develop advanced high-performance and energy-efficient microprocessor chips. </p>
