            LIST's Newsletter<br>
            September, 2003 </p>
          <p>&nbsp; </p>

        <h3>Good News for Spam Sufferers!</h3>
        Over the past several months, LIST has been contacted by a number of library 
        staff members concerned about a dramatic increase in spam mail delivered 
        to their Outlook Inbox. To address these concerns, Dean Schmidt has agreed 
        to a one-time bulk purchase of Spam Inspector, a spam-blocking software 
        tested and recommended by the campus IT department. 
        <p> </p>
        <p>In order to establish the number of licenses to be purchased, LIST 
          is scheduling an evaluation period for you to download, install, and 
          use the trial version of Spam Inspector during the month of October. 
          (Instructions below.) If you are satisfied with the results, we are 
          asking that you submit your name, location, and workstation ID # to 
          your ERR Rep, who will in turn submit the list to Rob Fidler at <a href="mailto:rob.fidler@asu.edu">rob.fidler@asu.edu</a>. 
          If you decide not to request this software, simply uninstall the application 
          through the Control Panel option &#8220;Add/Remove Programs&#8221; at 
          or before the end of the trial evaluation period. Please note: If your 
          computer is a LIST Managed machine, please contact Jeremy Kurtz at 5-1902 
          or via email at <a href="mailto:jeremy.kurtz@asu.edu">jeremy.kurtz@asu.edu</a> 
          if you wish to participate in this trial.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Spam Inspector is one of several spam-filtering products ASU&#8217;s 
          Information Technologies (IT) tested in recent months. A number of these 
          programs were found to be equally satisfactory in their performance 
          and ease of use. The decision to use Spam Inspector is based on the 
          numbers of existing campus users and a discounted pricing structure 
          for Arizona State affiliates. To evaluate Spam Inspector, download and 
          install the 15-day trial version available at <a href="http://www.giantcompany.com">http://www.giantcompany.com</a>, 
          between now and the end of October.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Make certain you download and install the trial version for Microsoft 
          Outlook 2000 and 2002, not any others. The application is supported 
          on the following operating systems: Windows 95/98/ME/NT4.0/2000/XP; 
          it works with Outlook 2000 and 2002, IMAP and POP mail. The software 
          does not work for web mail, and currently there is no version for Macintosh.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>&#8220;Overview&#8221; Page Added to Multi-Database Search</h3>
        By popular demand, we have created an overview and tour of the newly-unveiled 
        Multi-Database Search tool. The Multi-Database Search is the name given 
        to the search tool that is emerging from the ARL Scholar's Portal project 
        (more info from ARL at <a href="http://www.arl.org/access/scholarsportal/">http://www.arl.org/access/scholarsportal/</a>). 
        MDS is designed to search information from multiple data sources and then 
        provide a sortable listing of these resources that can contain direct 
        links to electronic journal entries, PDFs and, in some cases, full text. 
        It is often described as an &#8220;academic Google.&#8221; 
        <p>ASU Libraries' MDS is still in its infancy. Though the MDS is operable, 
          it is in active development and is constantly being improved. Currently 
          we are working on adding more resources and more search profiles to 
          the search engine as well as redesigning the current interface, which 
          includes creating more descriptive and help information, as well as 
          additional refinement of the interface&#8217;s look and feel.</p>
        <p>Check out the new overview/tour page at <a href="http://zportal.lib.asu.edu/zportal/MDSOverview.html">http://zportal.lib.asu.edu/zportal/MDSOverview.html</a>.</p>
        <p>We have high expectations for the Multi-Database Search and we need 
          your input to ensure that these expectations are met. Please send your 
          comments about the MDS to <a href="mailto:ScholarsPortal@asu.edu">ScholarsPortal@asu.edu</a>.</p>

        <h3>SilverPlatter Databases Successfully Migrated to SilverPlatter Internet 
          Service!</h3>
        SilverPlatter databases such as BIOSIS Previews, PsycInfo, and Periodical 
        Abstracts Full Text have been locally maintained for many years. Recently 
        we transferred these databases to Ovid's SilverPlatter Internet Service. 
        Ovid now hosts all our WebSpirs databases (over 40 databases). They provide 
        24/7 technical support at their site in Norwood, MA. This has allowed 
        us to give our users the same database service without the server administration 
        and software maintenance formerly required by the local databases. The 
        transition has been completely seamless to our users, has resulted in 
        better support for the databases, and has allowed us to simplify our database 
        pages by removing the little-used &#8220;Windows client&#8221; option.
<p>&nbsp; </p>
        <h3>New Databases Available</h3>

        <h3>Ask LIST</h3>

        <i>Please send questions on any library technology topic to Heather Knowles to 
        be answered in future columns.</i> <p> <b>Q. &nbsp; &nbsp; </b><strong>&quot;I've 
          been hearing about denial of service attacks a lot lately &#8211; what 
          exactly is a denial of service attack, and how does it affect me?&quot;</strong>
        <p> A. &nbsp; &nbsp; A Denial of Service (DOS) attack is the result of an attacker 
          using one or several computers' network bandwidth to &quot;flood&quot; 
          the network and virtually grind everything to a halt. A good analogy 
          of bandwidth and network traffic is the width of a freeway and cars, 
          respectively. The freeway is only so wide, and once it fills up with 
          cars, everything slows down. Essentially, a Denial of Service attack 
          is an attacker-induced network traffic jam.
        <p>This has happened on campus recently in the form of the SoBig and Nachi 
          worms. When a machine gets infected, the worm tries to infect any other 
          machine it can connect to, and this increased network traffic causes 
          the Denial of Service. You may have even noticed the effects of a DOS 
          attack yourself. Perhaps the most obvious recent result of a DOS attack 
          has been the inability to connect to your Outlook account, or one of 
          the remote library databases. And when a connection is made, the response 
          time is very slow. </p>
        <p>What this means to you is that it is important not to open any questionable 
          e-mail attachments, and to contact LIST if you suspect any unusual activity 
          on your computer. Fortunately, Library computers had very few instances 
          of these worms, so everyone is doing a good job and being proactive! 
          Every DOS attack thus far has originated from areas outside the Libraries, 
          which is something we can all be proud of.</p>
