&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of all the people and activities in the world, I picked my caring mom, Tomasa Hernandez.  She has done everything she can to help the homeless, school, and community.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she has clothes that she doesn't need, she donates them instead of selling them.  She inspired us to do the same thing.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a real poor homeless person in our community.  During the winter she gave him warm clothes because he was cold.  During Thanksgiving my mom gave him some food.  It gave my mom and us pleasure to know that we are helping others.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am starting to do what she has taught us.  When I have clothes that I outgrow I will donate them.  When I retire, I am going to make a place where homeless can come eat and get clothes donated by the other caring people.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Tavan Elementary School she tries to volunteer when the school needs help.  She is the first one to be informed if the school needs help because the people at Tavan know that she is a very good volunteer.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom has taught me a very useful lesson.  Every time someone is in need, I help them.  By living this lesson, my mom and I are making the world a better place.
