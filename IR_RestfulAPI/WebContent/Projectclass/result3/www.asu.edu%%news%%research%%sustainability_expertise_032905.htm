          <h2>ASU pushes sustainability research expertise</a></h2>
          <p> Research into sustainability &ndash; the area of science and technology that focuses on balancing society&rsquo;s advancement and growth with environmental conservation &ndash; is becoming an increasingly hot topic as experts struggle to deal with growing populations vying for finite resources. </p>
          <p> ASU is playing an increasingly important role in sustainability. Propelled by President Michael Crow&rsquo;s commitment to making the university a leader in sustainability research, education and solutions, ASU formed the International Institute for Sustainability (IIS) in 2004. IIS, which is led by Charles Redman, has sponsored lectures at ASU from nearly a dozen leaders in sustainability, and last month it conducted a workshop of 20 directors of the International Human Dimensions of Global Environment Change Program, an international science organization concerned with social science aspects of sustainability and global change. Now ASU sustainability experts are working closely with other organizations that foster greater human sustainability and environmental awareness. </p>
          <p> According to Jim Buizer, executive director of the ASU Office of Sustainability Initiatives and special adviser to President Crow, ASU recently joined the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) and the Education for Sustainability Western Network (EFS West). In addition, Buizer was elected to the EFS West executive committee and Redman was asked to serve on the advisory committee. David Pijawka, director of ASU&rsquo;s doctorate program in planning, has agreed to chair the EFS West curriculum development working group. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Joining these groups is useful because they serve an important networking function between universities and other organizations involved in sustainability, regionally and nationally,&rdquo; Buizer says. &ldquo;Being members of these groups shows we are serious about playing a leadership role in sustainability.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Supported by more than 500 academic, scientific environmental and business organizations, NCSE works to create and use environmental knowledge to help shape environmental decisions. Buizer said the group plays an important role in informing society about science, in working with regulating agencies of the U.S. government and in forming and expressing expert opinions on current environmental policy. </p>
          <p> An important issue before NCSE is urbanization and its impact on the environment. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;A key aspect of sustainability is to not push the environment beyond its capacity,&rdquo; Buizer says. &ldquo;We need to be smarter about growth of cities and urban areas. The United Nations estimates that there will be 1.6 billion more people on Earth (8 billion in all) by 2030. Virtually all of that growth will be in cities and urban areas, meaning nearly 60 percent of all people in 2030 will live in cities.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> EFS West is a professional organization of institutions, nonprofits and businesses interested in integrating sustainability into higher education in the West. It aims to make sustainability a foundation of all aspects of higher education in the western United States and Canada. This year, EFS West will expand to include Mexican universities. </p>
          <p> In addition to its work in education and research, an important goal of EFS West is to &ldquo;lead by example,&rdquo; Buizer says. As such, universities see new buildings as an opportunity to make a statement about sustainability. By constructing buildings that are &ldquo;green,&rdquo; those that meet LEED (leadership in energy and environmental design) certification, universities can make a statement about sensitivity to the environment. </p>
