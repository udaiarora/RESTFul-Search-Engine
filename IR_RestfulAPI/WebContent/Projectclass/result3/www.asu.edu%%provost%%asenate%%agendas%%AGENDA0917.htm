Fall 2001

<p><b>Title of Motion:</b> Request from the College of Liberal Arts and

Sciences to change the Name of Degree Program

<p>The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate

approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

to change the name of a degree program from BS in Computer Science to BS

in Computational Mathematical Sciences

<p><b>Rationale:</b>

<br>The proposed CMS degree is the natural evolution of Computer Science

for students interested in C.S. within the framework of a rich curriculum

provided by a Liberal Arts and Sciences training. Under the reformulation

of the degree, students are able to combine strong quantitative and computational

training with the development of fundamental skills in one or more areas

of the life or physical sciences. In particular, the ability to combine

these skills with the life sciences responds to the national need for scientists

qualified for professions in the new technologies and developments emerging

in computational molecular biology, genetics, protemics and biomaterials.

<br>Moreover, this refocus of the degree to Computational Mathematical

Sciences is accomplished by utilizing existing

<br>facility resources and expertise in CLAS; specifically in the Department

of Mathematics.

<p><b>SENATE MOTION #13 (2000-2001)</b>

<p><b>REQUEST FOR SENATE REPRESENTATION</b>

<p>Introduced April 30, 2001 by Douglas Johnson, Chair, Executive Committee

and following an unsuccessful motion to suspend the rules, will be held

over until the first Senate meeting in the fall.

<p>To: Doug Johnson, President, Academic Senate

<p>From: Christina Stage, Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies Program

- Director

<p>Date: April 5, 2001

<p>Re: Representation in the Academic Senate

<p>On behalf of the faculty of the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies

Program, I would like to request representation in the Academic Senate

at Arizona State University effective AY 01-02.

<p>As a faculty comprised entirely of lecturers, we were pleased to see

the amendment granting full-time lecturers membership in the Academic Assembly

pass and we look forward to participating in the April election. In addition

to Assembly membership, we would like to seek full representation by gaining

a seat in the Senate.

<p>We believe the faculty of the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies

Program (BIS) is eligible for representation in the Senate because BIS

is an academic unit that, is involved in the hiring of faculty, academic

professionals, and/or graduate assistants/associates (e.g., colleges, departments,

centers, and programs). The BIS is a degree granting program with a faculty

of nine (soon to be ten) lecturers. All our lecturers have full-time multi-year

contract positions and are not represented in the Academic Senate through

other departments or colleges on campus.

<p>We appreciate your consideration of our request and hope the Executive

Committee will allow the Senate to vote on our status. If you have any

questions or need further information to consider this request, please

do not hesitate to contact me at 727-7090 or chris.stage@asu.edu. Thank

you

<p><b>Title of Motion:</b> Request from the College of Liberal Arts and

Sciences for the Establishment of an Undergraduate Certificate in Symbolic

Systems

<p>The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate

approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

for the establishment of an Undergraduate Certificate in Symbolic Systems

<p><b>Rationale:</b>

<br>The certificate program in Symbolic Systems takes an interdisciplinary

approach to cognition, computation, and meaning. Course work is divided

evenly between Philosophy, Psychology, and Computer Science in order to

expose students to the subject matter from a conceptual, empirical, and

practical point of view. The Certificate would be of interest to students

generally, and would be of particular interest to majors in any of the

three disciplines who wished to add breadth to their degree through work

in other disciplines on topics of common interest.

<p><b>Title of Motion:</b>&nbsp; Request from the College of Liberal Arts

and Sciences for the Implementation of a New Degree Program, MS in Computational

Biosciences

<p>The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate

approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

for the implementation of a new degree program, MS in Computational Biosciences

<p><b>Rationale:</b>

<br>The implementation of this new degree program, MS in Computational

Biosciences recognizes the demand to increase the supply of high-quality

personnel who are trained to enhance the utilization of computational and

analytical techniques in the biosciences, and are able to contribute to

the growth of the Arizona bioindustries.

<p>With planning authority by the Board of Regents in January 2001, a coherent

interdisciplinary curriculum consisting of courses available in the participating

departments, supplemented with key new curricular components, has been

organized to meet the needs of students interested in professional careers

in the application of computers to biosciences.

<p><b>Title of Motion:</b> Request from the College of Public Programs

to Change the Name of an Academic Unit, Merge Two Degree Programs, Disestablishment

and Establishment of Concentrations

<p>The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate

approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Public Programs to Change

the Name of an Academic Unit, Merge Two Degree Programs, Disestablishment

and Establishment of Concentrations

<p><b>Rationale:</b>

<br>The name change of this academic unit is needed to provide a framework

that mirrors the convergent intent of the proposed curriculum revision.

Thus, the name change of the program from Walter Cronkite School of Journalism

and Telecommunication to Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass

Communication. The minor name change reflects the name of most academic

programs in the field and the name of the national professional association

(Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication). In addition,

in the converged world the term telecommunication has come to mean telephone

and computer networks, which does not accurately reflect what is taught

in the curriculum of the Cronkite School.

<p>In place of the School?s current two undergraduate majors (BA in Journalism

and Broadcasting) with a total of five concentrations, it is proposed that

the School of Journalism and Mass Communication merge our two majors into

one undergraduate major (BA in Journalism and Mass Communication) with

five re-constituted re-named concentrations that rearrange the School?s

current course offerings to better describe the emerging mass media fields

that are developing through convergence and the evolution of new media.
