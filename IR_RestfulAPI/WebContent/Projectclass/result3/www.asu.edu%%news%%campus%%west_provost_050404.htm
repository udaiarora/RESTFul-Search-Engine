      <h2>Committee narrows search for West campus provost </h2>
      <p>The search committee for the West campus provost position has identified three internal finalists. Each finalist will participate in a series of interviews, including an open forum on the Tempe and West campuses. ASU President Michael Crow and Executive Vice President and Provost Milton Glick will make the final selection. </p>
      <p>The internal candidates are: </p>
      <p>. Gail Hackett, vice provost and professor of counseling psychology and counselor education, Tempe campus. Hackett has been with ASU for 16 years. She has held several positions with increasing responsibility at ASU, first as director of the Division of Psychology in Education, and as associate dean for academic programs and personnel in the College of Education before assuming her current position in 2000. Prior to ASU, she held various academic and administrative positions during her five years at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and prior to that on the faculty for 13 years at The Ohio State University. She received her B.A. in psychology, an M.Ed. in counseling and a Ph.D. in counseling psychology from Pennsylvania State University. Hackett's open forum was held April 28, at the West campus. </p>
      <p>. Glenn Irvin, dean, East College and professor of English, East campus. Irvin has been with ASU for more than 15 years. He was a professor of English and the vice provost for academic affairs at the West campus before assuming his current position in 2003. Prior to ASU, he was the vice provost and associate vice president for academic affairs at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo for more than 10 years. He also held various academic and administrative positions at East Texas State University (Texas A&amp;M University, Commerce), where he was for more than four years. He received a B.A. in education, English major, an M.A. in English and a Ph.D. in English from ASU. Irvin's open forum is scheduled for 2 - 3 p.m., May 3, in the Kiva conference room at the West campus. </p>
      <p>. Mark Searle, vice provost for academic affairs and professor of recreation and tourism management, West campus. Searle has been with ASU at the West campus since 1995 where he started as the dean of College of Human Services and a professor in the Department of Recreation and Tourism Management. In 2002, he was named the vice provost for academic affairs. Prior to coming to ASU, he was director of a multidisciplinary research institute and professor at the University of Manitoba for nine years. He received a B.A. in psychology and political science from the University of Winnipeg, an M.S. in recreation administration from the University of North Dakota, and a Ph.D. in recreation administration from the University of Maryland. Searle's open forum is scheduled for 2 - 3 p.m., April 30, in the Kiva conference room at the West campus. </p>
      <p>"I congratulate the search committee members on their effort to secure excellent candidates for our consideration," says Glick. "Each of these candidates is a strong academic with successful leadership experience." </p>
      <p>Elaine Maimon, current ASU West provost, was recently named the chancellor of the University of Alaska, Anchorage. During Maimon's eight-year tenure, ASU West has grown from offering only upper-division courses and a few masters programs to a comprehensive campus with a full four years of undergraduate instruction and an expanded number of master's degrees. She has led the campus in applying principles of learner-centered education to classroom-based learning communities. Enrollment has grown 77 percent during Maimon's tenure as provost. </p>
      <p>A decision on Maimon's successor will be announced in May. </p>
