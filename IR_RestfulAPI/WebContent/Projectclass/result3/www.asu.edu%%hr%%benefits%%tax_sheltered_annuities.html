				  contribute, or on the interest or dividends that are earned. No income taxes
			  are paid until distribution is made. You have two choices in placing 
          your funds:</span></P>

              <li> If you are age 50 or older you can contribute   $20,500 in 2007.</li>
              <li> If you have been employed at the university for 15 or more

        money to another tax qualified account) at any time, or&nbsp;</li>
               <li class="style1"> You can withdraw 
          some, or all of the funds. If you elect to withdraw  funds, 
          the monies are treated as income and subject to taxation in the  year withdrawn.

              federal surcharge/penalty tax for early withdrawal of &nbsp; retirement funds.</li>
            </ul>

              a period of six months. </li>
