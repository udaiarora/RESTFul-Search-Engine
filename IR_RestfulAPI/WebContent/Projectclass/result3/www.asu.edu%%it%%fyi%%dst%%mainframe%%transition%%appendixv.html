    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">Mainframe Documentation</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Information Technology (IT) mainframe
    documentation takes two major forms: online and printed. The
    online documentation for a given mainframe is almost always stored
    on that particular computer and viewed through menus or &quot;help&quot;
    commands. Much of this online documentation consists of detailed
    information about that computer's operating system, application
    programs, and peripherals. On some of the IT mainframes, online
    &quot;news&quot; or &quot;info&quot; facilities provide users
    with additional, more general information.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The following table, broken down
    by operating system, provides the name of the command used to
    reference online documentation.</FONT></P>

    <PRE>

    Operating System     Help Command(s)
      IBM VM/CMS           HELP, NEWS
      IBM MVS/TSO          HELP, TUTORIAL(ISPF)
      VAX VMS              HELP, NEWS
      UNIX                 HELP</PRE>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">IT's printed documentation consists
    of locally-written documents (write-ups) which describe the specifics
    of using Information Technology's computers, networks and software.
    These are available at the Customer Assistance Center in Computing
    Commons room 202 and can be accessed online, too.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">An Information &quot;Transition&quot;</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As you might expect, Information
    Technology continues to use both online and printed documentation
    to inform the ASU community about its facilities and services
    and to provide detailed &quot;how-to&quot; information in many
    different areas. Recent years, however, have brought changes
    in the way that IT provides its online information. These changes
    include:</FONT></P>

    <OL>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">an increased use of electronic
      methods for distributing information</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">the distribution of &quot;electronic
      information&quot; to a larger audience from more accessible locations</FONT>
    </OL>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There's been an explosive growth
    in the use of electronic information resources such as Usenet
    (electronic news), FTP archives, Archie, Gopher, World Wide Web
    (WWW), etc. The popularity of WWW, for example, is evident when
    you see electronic addresses (URLs) presented in magazines, radio,
    and, increasingly, in television commercials. This growing interest
    in electronically providing and consuming information is as evident
    within the ASU community as it is outside, and it influences
    how Information Technology presents information.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Recently, IT developed an information
    system called &quot;FYI&quot; which makes extensive use of WWW
    pages. FYI includes descriptions of IT computing services and
    facilities, as well as detailed technical information. If you
    have a WWW browser, reference this URL <A HREF="/it/fyi/index.html">http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/</A>
    to view the FYI pages.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In addition to &quot;consumer
    demand&quot;, IT has other good reasons for using the newer electronic
    methods. Gopher and WWW pages can link to related documents on
    computers all over the world, not just information residing on
    the same machine. Hypertext documents allow the author to create,
    link, and share information from different media, such as text,
    graphics, video and sound. In addition, hypertext's non-sequential
    presentation of information allows the reader to explore and
    assimilate it in different ways. Besides these specific advantages
    to hypertext, IT can &quot;distribute&quot; changes in most of
    its electronically stored information faster than changes in
    printed counterparts.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This document's <A HREF="general.html">&quot;General
    Overview&quot;</A> section stated that client/server computing
    was &quot;the direction of the future.&quot; This computing trend
    applies to information systems in addition to statistical, compute
    and database servers. Information servers, including WWW, Gopher,
    news, electronic mail, and FTP servers communicate with clients
    on many different hardware platforms and operating systems. This
    allows a wider audience to access the information.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As an example of this wider audience,
    consider the <I>On-Line Unix Help System</I>, which displays
    a variety of information when you type &quot;help&quot; on &quot;general&quot;,
    &quot;stats&quot;, &quot;research&quot; and other Cluster computers.
    You may also view this same information with a WWW browser -
    you don't need access to the Cluster or a special userid/password
    to get it. The URL for the On-Line Unix Help System is 
<A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/dst/helpdocs/">http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/dst/helpdocs/</A>.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A new ASU student at home using
    Netscape through an Internet provider could view which statistical
    packages were available on the &quot;Stats&quot; servers and
    even download instructions for using those packages, without
    coming to ASU and without access to that server. (The student
    will need access to that server to use one of the statistical
    packages.) A veteran IBM MVS SAS user considering a transition
    to Unix might look at Help material from an office PC to see
    what this environment has to offer. In general, &quot;transitioners&quot;
    will be able to view Help information to explore their options
    before they move in a particular direction.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">Printed Documentation</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">IT recognizes that, in addition
    to the growing popularity and use of electronically stored information,
    many computer users continue to rely on printed materials. Many
    of the write-ups are stored electronically in formats that can
    be downloaded and printed locally at <A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/quicklook/">http://www.asu.edu/quicklook/</A>.
    Refer to this URL for further information: <A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/cacenter">http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/cacenter</A>.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">IT publishes an on-line magazine,
    <A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/insideit/">InsideIT</A>, on
    the first Wednesday of every month. InsideIT contains information
    on topics including internet, client/server computing and general
    Information Technology resources. To subscribe to InsideIT, go
    the InsideIT webpage, and click on the subscribe button.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Instructors and others may find
    the Computing Site personal computers to be an attractive alternative
    to the mainframe. To get more information on IT computing sites
    go to their FYI webpages at <A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/sites/">http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/sites/</A></FONT></P>

    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">Notes</FONT></H3>

    <OL>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Printed copies of the Transition
      Guide are available free of charge at the Customer Assistance
      Center.</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Customer Assistance Center
      also provides price lists for the software it sells. (IT negotiates
      with vendors for reduced software pricing and is often able to
      provide this discounted software through the Customer Assistance
      Center). Transitioners may wish to investigate the costs associated
      with moving their work to desktop platforms, that is, buying
      or licensing desktop computing alternatives to mainframe software.</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Transition information, including
      this Appendix, is available in hypertext format at
