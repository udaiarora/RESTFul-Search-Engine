These recommendations on faculty appointment and tenure shall be made according to the usual standards and, normally, according to the established procedures for such recommendations in the department and/or college.  No administrative appointment may carry faculty rank independent of a faculty position in an established department and/or college.  A person holding a faculty appointment does not lose that appointment by reason of appointment to, or relief from, the administrative appointment.  Administrators do not accrue time towards tenure, as administrators, although they do accrue time towards tenure if they also have a probationary appointment.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Nominations for Appointments to Administrative Positions</B></FONT><P>Appointment of the president of the university is the responsibility of the Board of Regents.  The Board of Regents has in recent years included faculty on a committee to confer with the board during the selection procedure.<P>The recommendation to the Board of Regents for the appointment of a dean of a college or school is made by the president, who normally confers with heads of the departments of the college or school concerned and normally seeks advice by the appointment of a faculty selection committee.<P>Every search committee formed to evaluate <A HREF="acd002.html#Applicant" TARGET="New">applicants</A> for an administrative appointment to the position of dean or <A HREF="acd002.html#vicepresident" TARGET="New">vice president</A> shall include a faculty senator recommended by the chair of the Faculty Senate.  The senator appointed to the search committee must be from outside the unit conducting the search.<P>Every member of the search committee shall receive in a timely manner:<P><OL><LI>minutes of every meeting of the committee</LI><P><LI>notification of the location of any correspondence, including intra-university memoranda, pertaining to the committee&#146;s task initiated by the chair, the chair&#146;s designee, or any other committee member<P>and</LI><P><LI>notification of any changes related to procedures or advertised conditions of the search.</LI></OL><P>Recommendations for appointment of a department chair shall originate with a selection committee organized under the direction of the administrator responsible for the hiring decision.  The committee confers with the faculty of the department and the officers of other schools or colleges which the department serves and makes its recommendations to the dean.  If a search limited to the department is conducted, then neither a Hiring Process Report nor a waiver is required for appointment of chairpersons selected using this procedure.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Offer Letters</B></FONT><P>All offer letters for administrative appointments with faculty rank must be signed by the executive vice president and provost of the university after review by the office of the vice provost.<P>When an administrative position is being offered to an individual who does not already hold an ASU faculty line, as when an outside search has resulted in the selection of a candidate from off campus, the offer letter provided to the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University for approval and signature must be accompanied by written documentation from the supervising dean and the chair of the <A HREF="acd002.html#academicunit" TARGET="New">academic unit</A> in which tenure or probationary status is proposed.  This documentation should describe the process of faculty involvement in evaluating the academic credentials of the candidate and should summarize the faculty recommendation on the appropriateness of the receiving unit as the academic home for the new administrator.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Interim/Acting Administrative Appointments</B></FONT><P>When a vacancy occurs in an administrative position and there is insufficient time for recruitment, the provost or president may make an interim or acting appointment, not to exceed 12 months in duration.  Such an appointment may be made only after consultation with faculty and other administrators as appropriate for the position to be filled.  In keeping with the university&#146;s commitment to <A HREF="acd002.html#equalemployment" TARGET="New">equal opportunity</A> and <A HREF="acd002.html#affirmativeaction" TARGET="New">affirmative action</A>, before an interim or acting appointment can be made, the administrator making the appointment must provide a written report to both the vice provost and the director of Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action (EO/AA).  The report should outline the consultative process, the terms and conditions of the acting/interim appointment, and specific efforts made by the administrator to ensure appropriate involvement and representation of women and ethnic minorities in interim and acting appointments.<P>&#147;Acting&#148; appointments are those without the full authority associated with the position.  &#147;Interim&#148; appointments are those with the full authority associated with the position.<P><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Cross-References</B></FONT></CENTER><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><P>See also:<P><OL><LI><A HREF="acd504.html">ACD 504</A>, <I>&#147;Conditions of Administrative Service</I> at ASU&#148;<P>and</LI><P><LI><A HREF="acd505-04.html">ACD 505&#150;04</A>, &#147;Recruitment/Appointment.&#148;</LI></OL><P>&#160;<P><HR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">ACD</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="acd001.html">contact</A> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="provost.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
