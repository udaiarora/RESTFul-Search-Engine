</ul>


<p>The Information Technology Computing Sites provide <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> students, faculty 
and staff the ability to print to several black and white laser printers. In addition, a color laser printer is available in the Computing Commons Atrium (<abbr title="Computing Commons">CPCOM</abbr> 102) and in the Coor Computing Commons (<abbr title="Lattie F. Coor Hall">COOR</abbr> 150).  Print jobs can be sent to either color printer from any <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> Computing Site.</p>

<p>Printing fees are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black and White 8.5" x 11" = $.08 per printed side *</li>
<li>Color 8.5" x 11" = $1.00 per printed side *</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to print, a positive balance of <a href="http://www.asu.edu/purchasing/suncard/dollars2.html">Sun Dollars</a> associated with your <a href="http://www.asu.edu/purchasing/suncard/"><acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> Sun Card</a> is required.  No other form of payment is accepted.</p>

<a name="laptop"></a>
<h3>Printing from a Laptop in Computing Sites</h3>

<p>Printing is now available to laptop computers via the PHAROS system.  To configure this service on your computer, please reference the appropriate instructional document from the list below.  These documents are provided in <acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> format.</p>

<li><a href="/it/tempe/classrooms/pdf/sites/Laptop_Printing_Mac.pdf">Laptop Printing Helpsheet for Macintosh OS X</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Your particular laptop may or may not have all the necessary driver files for use with the instructions provided.  For your convenience we've made those drivers available in a compressed file.  <a href="site-printer-drivers.zip">PC Printer Drivers</a> | <a href="HP_Printer_Descriptions.sit">Macintosh PPDs</a></p>

<a name="pharos"></a>
<h3>Change Made to PHAROS (Desktop Release)</h3>

<p>Starting in the Spring 2006 semester, the default printing methodology in the computing sites has been changed. Your Sun Dollar account will now be charged directly from your desktop by entering your <acronym title="Arizona State University Rational Information Technology Environment">ASURITE</acronym> ID &amp; password.  Swiping your Sun Card to "release" print jobs is no longer necessary, though that method will remain available for customers who'd prefer to continue using it.</p>

<h4><a name="general">General Questions</a></h4>
<a name="pay"></a>
<p><strong>Q.  Why do we have to pay for printing?</strong></p>
<p>A.  In the fiscal year prior to the implementation of the PHAROS system, <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> students, faculty and staff printed more than 15 million sheets in the Information Technology computing sites.  In order to continue to provide high quality printing, it is necessary to recover the costs of printing.</p>

<a name="quality"></a>
<p><strong>Q.  Since I'm paying for my printing, what level of quality should I expect?</strong></p>
<p>A.  We will offer print quality sufficient to submit work to a professor at <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> free of streaks, wrinkles and other blemishes.  If the print quality is below this standard, we will reprint your job free of additional charges.</p>

<a name="reimburse"></a>
<p><strong>Q.  There is a problem with my print job.  Can you reimburse my Sun Dollars?</strong></p>
<p>A.  No.  We are unable to reimburse Sun Dollars.  If there is a problem with a print job due to printer malfunction, we will 
reprint the job at no cost to you.  Please see computing site staff for assistance.</p>

<a name="lostcard"></a>
<p><strong>Q.  I need to print a document and I don't have my Sun Card.  What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>A.  With the change to Desktop Release in Spring 2006 it is no longer necessary to swipe your Sun Card.  An appropriate balance of Sun Dollars in your account will still be necessary.</p>

<a name="wrongfile"></a>
<p><strong>Q.  I accidentally printed the wrong file.  Can you print the correct file for me for free?</strong></p>
<p>A.  No.  Once you release a print job from your desktop you are charged for the output.  Please be mindful of what you're printing.</p>

<a name="blankpage"></a>
<p><strong>Q.  I sent a one-page document to the printer but two pages were printed, my document and a blank page.  Do I have to pay for this blank page?</strong></p>
<p>A.  Yes.  Your account will be debited $.16 for this document.  Please be sure to do a print preview prior to printing so you can verify that you will receive what you expect.  In Word and Excel, the page length of a document can be increased by unnecessary line breaks (pressing Enter too many times) or fields containing information off screen.  Print preview will show you exactly what you will receive when you print.</p>

<a name="papersize"></a>
<p><strong>Q.  What size paper is available in the Computing Sites?</strong></p>
<p>A.  The printers are stocked with 8.5" x 11" paper also referred to as "letter" or "<abbr title="United States">US</abbr> letter" and 11" x 17" paper.  We do not carry A4 or other size sheets of paper.  Transparencies may be printed on customer-provided media using the color printer in the Computing Commons Atrium.</p>

<a name="othermedia"></a>
<p><strong>Q.  I want to print on paper other than that provided in the sites.  Can I do this?  What will I be charged?</strong></p>
<p>A.  We provide 20lb. stock 8.5" x 11" white paper and 11" x 17" white paper.  If you would like to print to a different size paper, transparency film or other media, please ask for assistance from computing site staff.  User supplied media must be verified against the specifications of our printers to avoid damage.  You will be charged the same per sheet fee as if you were using the supplied paper.</p>

<a name="twocopylimit"></a>
<p><strong>Q.  Do you still enforce a two-copy limit?</strong></p>
<p>A.  No.  There is no longer a two-copy limit.  You may print as many copies for which you are willing to pay.</p> 

<a name="jobnotappearing"></a>
<p><strong>Q.  Why isn't my job appearing at the Print Release Station (PRS)?</strong></p> 
<p>A.  The default printing methodology has been changed for the Spring 2006 semester and using a <acronym title="Print Release Station">PRS</acronym> is no longer required.  By default your print output will be sent directly from your workstation to the printer.</p>

<h4><a name="howto">How To Questions</a></h4>

<a name="popupclient"></a>
<p><strong>Q.  When I print, I am asked for my <acronym title="Arizona State University Rational Information Technology Environment">ASURITE</acronym> ID and password.  Why?</strong></p>
<p>A.  Beginning with the Spring 2006 semester, your Sun Dollar account is now billed directly based on your <acronym title="Arizona State University Rational Information Technology Environment">ASURITE</acronym> ID and password.</p>

<a name="duplex"></a>
<p><strong>Q.  How do I switch between single-sided and duplex printing?</strong></p>
<p>A.  Duplex printing is no longer the default setting.  You may still choose to print your documents in duplex if you like, but you will still be charged $0.08 per printed side.  To duplex on a <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>:  From the File menu in an open application (such as Word), select Print.  In the Print dialog box, click the Properties button.  The controls for duplex printing can be found under the Layout tab in the box labeled "Print on Both Sides (Duplex)".</p>

<p>A.  On an iMac:  From the File menu in an open application (such as Word), select Print.  In the Print dialog box, select Layout from the drop-down menu.  Duplex printing is controlled by the box labeled Print on Both Sides.</p>

<a name="paperjam"></a>
<p><strong>Q.  What should I do when the printer displays a "Paper Jam" message?</strong></p>
<p>A.  Please contact site staff.</p>
