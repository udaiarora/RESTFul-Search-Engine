               <h3>What Is ASU Spam Filtering Service?</h3>

              <p>ASU has implemented software to help fight <a href="#spam">SPAM</a>.
                This filtering software allows you, the user, to set up and configure
                your own &quot;blacklists&quot;. </p>

                <p>By default, your ASU e-mail will not be scanned for Spam. Each
                  individual must first enable Spam filtering. Once enabled, e-mail
                  that is considered Spam will be placed in a quarantine area.
                  You can then view your quarantined e-mail with a web browser
                  and make adjustments to how the filtering works. E-mail that
                  remains in the quarantine area for more than <strong><font color="#FF0000">14
                  days</font></strong> will automatically be deleted.</p>

                <p>When you first enable filtering, you should <strong><font color="#FF0000">frequently</font></strong>
                  check (at least daily) your quarantined e-mail. Some e-mails
                  that are not Spam may be in here, such as newsletters, some
                  discussion lists and possibly vendor advertisements that you
                  may wish to receive. You can easily mark these to be delivered
                  instead of quarantined in the future. When selececting the e-mails
                  to be delivered, the e-mail addresses will be added to your 'whitelist'
                  and you will not have to re-add them. After a few weeks, you
                  will probably have things properly configured and will no longer
                  need to check your quarantined e-mail as often, possibly once
                  or twice a week. If you are expecting mail and do not see it,
                  be sure to check your quarantine.</p>

               <h3>How do I enable SPAM Filtering?</h3>

                <p>To enable Spam filtering for your ASU e-mail addresses, login
                to myASU at <a href="http://my.asu.edu/">http://my.asu.edu</a>,
                then select the SPAM tab. If you do not have the SPAM tab, please
                follow these steps to get to the SPAM filter:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Add the Spam Filter tab to your myASU layout through
                      the <em>Preferences</em> link in the upper left. This is a
                      several step process which includes adding a new tab, and then
                      the <em>Spam Filter</em> channel to your new tab. Detailed
                      instructions can be found at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/it/portalhelp/">http://www.asu.edu/it/portalhelp/</a>.</li>
                  <li>Once logged into myASU, you can click on the <em>emma</em> in the upper right. This will open a new window, from which
                        you can select <em>Spam Filtering</em> on the menu to the left.</li>
                  <li>Once within the filter, you will be presented with a list of
                      your ASU e-mail addresses that you can enable filtering for. It
                      is recommended that you enable filtering for your <a href="#destadd">Directory
                      Address</a> and your <a href="listserv_faq.htm">Destination Address</a>.
                      You may wish to enable filtering for your aliases as well, but
                      should only do so if they are actually receiving Spam. <br />

                </li>
                </ol>

				<h3>Managing Quarantined Mail</h3>

                <p>From the same Spam Filtering application in Emma, you can also
                  select the option to view your quarantined e-mail. This will
                  show you all e-mail quarantined in the last 14 days for all
                  of the addresses you have selected for filtering (grouped by
                  address). For each e-mail listed in the quarantined e-mail,
                  there are four things you can do:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong><em>View </em></strong>: Click on
                    the subject of the message (it will be underlined) and you
                    can view the raw contents of the message (message headers
                    and the body of the message).

                </li>
                <li>

                <strong><em>Deliver</em></strong> : Select
                  the messages you wish to deliver by checking the box next to
                  them.  Once you have the messages selected, click on the
                  "Deliver" button and the messages will be sent
                  to your regular mailbox for processing. Also, the senders will
                  be placed on a &quot;White List&quot;, so that future e-mails
                  from that address will be passed along directly to your mailbox.
                </li>

              <li>
                  <strong><em>Delete</em></strong> :  Select
                    the messages you wish to delete by checking the box next to them.
                    Once you have the messages selected, click on the "Delete" button.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em><strong>Nothing</strong> </em> : You
                    may also do nothing with the e-mail. In this case, it will
                    be automatically deleted 14 days after it was first placed
                    in your quarantined mailbox.
                </li>
              </ul>


              <p>Also note that there is a <em>Select All</em> function available
                as a convenience if you wish to delete or deliver all of the messages in
                the quarantine for a particular alias.  After pressing the <em>Select All</em> button,
                you can delete or deliver all messages by using the buttons mentioned above.</p>
              <p><strong>Typical Scenario</strong></p>
              <p> Initially, you will frequently check your quarantine mailbox;
                      at least once a day. Scan all messages in your quarantine mailbox.
                      If you see a message that is not Spam, click <em>Deliver</em>.
                      After scanning all messages and delivering anything that is not
                      Spam, click the <em>Delete All</em> button. </p>


                <p>After two or three weeks, you will probably not be catching anymore
                legitimate e-mail in your quarantine mailbox. When you are comfortable
                that this is the case, you can stop monitoring your quarantine
                mailbox daily. E-mails left in your quarantine mailbox will automatically
                go away after 14 days.</p>

              <p>If a message from a particular e-mail address keeps getting through
                the Spam filter (i.e. showing up in your normal mailbox), then
                you may wish to use the <em>Black List</em> function as described
                below. </p>

              <p><strong><em>Please note</em></strong> the SPAM filtering service
                does not perform<strong> <em>content filtering</em></strong>.
                In other words, e-mail is marked as 'spam' when <strong>the sending
                address is questionable</strong>, not when the certain words are
                in the subject line. </p>




              <h3>Managing Access Lists</h3>

              <p>From the Spam Filtering application in myASU, you can also
                manage access lists, specifically the <a href="#whitelist">White
                List</a> and the <a href="#blacklist">Black List</a>, for each
                e-mail address you are filtering for. To do so, first choose <em>Settings</em>                link above your primary address. Click on the <em>Manage</em>
                button beside the e-mail address you wish to manage.</p>


              <p>The <em>White List</em> is added to whenever you click the
                <em>Deliver</em> button for a quarantined e-mail. You may
                add and delete addresses from your <em>White List</em> from within the
                <em>Manage Access Lists</em> function. If you would like
                to allow all mail that has a From address in a certain domain
                to be delivered, you can add a <em>wildcard</em> record, by putting in
                the domain prefixed by the @ symbol, for example to allow all
                messages from hotmail.com to be delivered, you should add <em>@hotmail.com</em>.</p>
              <p>You add to and delete from the <em>Black List</em> by using
                the <em>Manage</em> function as well. The ASU Information
                Technology department recommends that you do not <strong><em>Black
                List</em></strong> e-mail addresses except in rare cases where you receive
                many e-mails from the same address. Having a large black list
                makes the filtering process more inefficient and should be used
                sparingly, if at all.</p>



                <h3>Setting Up SPAM Filtering for Multiple EPO Accounts</h3>
                <p>Some people have multiple accounts on the Electronic Post Office
                  (EPO). It may be because they have a second mailbox or they
                  maintain a departmental or consulting mailbox . If you have
                  multiple EPO accounts, you will first select which account you
                  are configuring filtering for. You can set up Spam filtering
                  for one or more of your accounts.</p>

              <p>If you have questions not answered here, please submit a question online at the <a href="http://asu.edu/askit/">Ask IT Web page</a>, or call the <a href="http://asu.edu/helpdesk/">IT Help Desk</a> at (480) 965-6500.</p>
             <h3>Definitions of Terms Used</h3>

              <p><strong>Spam<a name="spam"></a></strong>: Spam can be defined
                as unsolicited commercial e-mail. Generally, it is the unwanted
                e-mail clogging your inbox and preventing you from smoothly conducting
                your ASU business.</p>
              <p><strong>Directory Address<a name="diradd"></a></strong> Your
                official ASU e-mail address. This is the e-mail address that will
                appear in the various electronic directories at ASU. It is also
                the address that e-mail you send will appear to be from (if you
                send from an ASU e-mail system like Emma or Outlook /Exchange)</p>
              <p><strong>Destination Address<a name="destadd"></a></strong> The
                address where e-mail sent to your Directory Address (or any of
                its aliases) will be delivered. It is the physical address of
                your mailbox (e.g. asurite@imap1.asu.edu)</p>
              <p><strong>White List<a name="whitelist"></a></strong> The list
                of addresses that you want e-mail from, whether or not it looks
                like Spam. If e-mail is sent to you from one of these addresses,
                it will not even be checked to see if it is Spam. You have a separate
                White List for each e-mail address you are filtering for.</p>

              <p><strong>Black List</strong><a name="blacklist"></a> This list
                of e-mail addresses that you do not want e-mail from, whether
                or not it looks like Spam. If e-mail is sent to you from one of
                these addresses, it will be immediately rejected as undeliverable,
                without checking to see if it is Spam or not. You have a separate
                Black List for each e-mail address you are filtering for.</p>
