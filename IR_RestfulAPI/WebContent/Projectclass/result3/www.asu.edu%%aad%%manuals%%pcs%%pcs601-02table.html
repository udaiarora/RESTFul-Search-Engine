If the equipment is found in the location indicated on the &#147;Not Found&#148; report, the &#147;Found&#148; column next to the ASU PC&#035; should be checked.<p>If the equipment is found in a different building and/or room than indicated on the report, the department chair, dean, director, or designee:<p><ol><li>checks the &#147;Found&#148; column next to the ASU PC&#035</li><p><li>draws a line through the old building and/or room number and writes in the new building and/or room number<p>and</li><p><li>corrects any other discrepancies for the asset on the &#147;Not Found&#148; report (e.g., description, serial number, and model number).</li></ol><p>If the equipment is not found, Property Control checks the &#147;Not Found&#148; column next to the ASU PC&#035; and records &#147;Not Found&#148; equipment in Missing Inventory Status (MIS).<p>Note: This equipment remains in MIS for four years, and then is reviewed for final disposition.  It is no longer shown on the department inventory but remains on the property control system as missing. After a four-year period of remaining missing, the asset is reviewed for disposition.<p>However, equipment coded as &#147;Not Found&#148; may be found in future inventories.  Departments are notified when this occurs.<p>If the equipment should be deleted from the report, the department chair, dean, director,or designee checks the &#147;Delete&#148; column next to the ASU PC&#035; and retains a photocopy of the &#147;Not Found&#148; report for department files.<p>Within 30 days of the date of the &#147;Not Found&#148; report, the original &#147;Not Found&#148; report should be forwarded to Property Control for processing.<p>Note: Property Control reviews extensions to the 30-day period based on the number of assets on the &#147;Not Found&#148; report and departmental resources.<p>Return to <a href="pcs601-02.html#endtable">PCS 601&#150;02</a><p>&#160;</body></html>
