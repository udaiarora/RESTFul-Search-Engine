      <p><strong><font size="3">Early implants found to be critical in establishing 
        hearing pathway</font></strong></p>
      <p>Even before children talk, they are listening -- and their brains are 
        changing. </p>
      <p>A study comparing brain activity of children in response to sound, including 
        both normal and deaf children who have received cochlear implants at varying 
        ages, has given solid evidence for a specific, critical period during 
        early childhood when the neurological development of the human hearing 
        system occurs and is dependent on auditory stimulation.</p>
      <p>A report on the study, co-authored by Anu Sharma of the University of 
        Texas at Dallas, and Michael Dorman and Anthony Spahr of Arizona State 
        University, appears in the December issue of Ear and Hearing.</p>
      <p>Looking at brain wave response to sound stimulation, the study notes 
        that in hearing children there is a rapid development of neurological 
        pathways in response to sound at an early age.</p>
      <p>The study finds that deaf children with cochlear implants can show similar 
        neurological development, but only if they have implants before the age 
        of three and one-half. When children have implants between the ages of 
        three and one-half and seven, less than half show a response similar to 
        hearing children, and virtually none develop a normal response after the 
        age of seven. Early exposure of the nervous system to auditory stimulation 
        is apparently critical to developing the neurological pathway for hearing 
        response.</p>
      <p>"If you're a parent of a deaf child, this is information that you need 
        to consider. If you're a neuroscientist, this is the first documentation 
        of the existence a critical period for development of the human auditory 
        system," said Dorman.</p>
      <p>According to Dorman, the study began five years ago when Sharma, then 
        at ASU, suggested that the team begin collecting brain activity data on 
        a group of children with cochlear implants that the scientists were observing. 
        Sharma pointed out that a similar data set already existed for hearing 
        children, and a comparison might be useful.</p>
      <p>The brain wave dataset for normal hearing children indicated that brain 
        responses to sound are relatively slow at birth and then become more rapid 
        until the age of about four, when the increase begins to level off. The 
        data collected by Sharma, Dorman and Spahr indicated that children who 
        detect sound through cochlear implants can have brain wave responses that 
        fall along the same development curve, but only if the implants are made 
        before the age of three and one-half. Deaf children who had implants after 
        the age of three and a half were likely to have brain responses that were 
        significantly slower and outside the normal range. Almost all children 
        who had implants after the age of seven had brain responses to sound that 
        were significantly slower than those of hearing children.</p>
      <p>The team drew the conclusion that the brain's response to sound develops 
        during a specific period of early childhood and requires input, either 
        from the natural ear or from an implanted device, in order for the neural 
        pathway for processing hearing to form.</p>
      <p>"This turns out to be an important part of the story for parents. If 
        you implant under three and a half, you're catching the window of sensitivity. 
        Responses are within the normal range within six months of implanting," 
        said Dorman. "If you implant between three and seven, your odds of doing 
        well are poorer, but still fair. If you implant after seven, your odds 
        are very slim."</p>
