      <h2>Carnegie Foundation chooses History Department for long-range study </a></h2>
      <p>The doctoral program in the ASU Department of History is under a microscope, but the intense scrutiny is welcome. The Carnegie Initiative on the Doctorate chose the ASU program this year as one of only 10 partner history departments in a multi-year research and action project to improve doctoral education at American universities. </p>
      <p>The Carnegie Foundation chose leading graduate programs to document and analyze the character of their programs and to create models of success that other departments can emulate. </p>
      <p>"We're working with departments that are committed to being stewards of the discipline," says Chris Golden, Carnegie senior scholar. "We chose those departments which have a critical eye toward the future, who are willing to take risks and move the discipline forward." </p>
      <p>Factors that made the ASU Department of History an attractive partner for the project included its track record of producing successful Ph.D. graduates, with about 125 currently working in the field. It also has one of the largest and strongest public history programs in the country, and its own Preparing Future Faculty program to train doctoral students to be effective professors. </p>
      <p>The department also had just completed a substantive self-assessment, so it was already engaged in the process of self-analysis. Fifteen ASU history faculty and 15 doctoral students are on a Carnegie Initiative team, analyzing practices in doctoral education to determine which are important to keep, which may need changing and what new practices may be introduced. Alumni also are giving input. </p>
      <p>"ASU is way ahead of other history departments in terms of its Preparing Future Faculty program and its training for teaching assistants," says Kyle Longley, the professor who is heading the ASU team. "We have a lot of unique things to offer. We also have the advantage of being young, having had a doctoral program only since the late 1960s, while many schools are already set in their ways. </p>
      <p>"Our goal is to take our doctoral program to the next level, in size and diversity of the fields offered. We also want our students to have better use of technology, and we are currently developing online course materials so they know how to teach online. </p>
      <p>"We started by rethinking everything, and this semester we are creating a long-range plan. Over the next four to seven years we'll be measuring outcomes, in terms of student satisfaction, job placement, faculty satisfaction and research produced and publishing." </p>
      <p>Carnegie President Lee Shulman says the doctoral degree is critical to the improvement of all American education, since doctoral programs prepare and socialize teachers from elementary to graduate school. ASU's public history doctorate also prepares people to work in museums, state archives, historical societies, corporations, national parks and federal agencies. </p>
      <p>Other departments chosen as partners were at Duke, Ohio State, Texas A&amp;M, University of Texas at Austin, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the universities of Connecticut, Kansas, Minnesota and Pittsburgh. </p>
