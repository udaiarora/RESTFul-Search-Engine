<ul><b><li>The IRS Form 1098-T is an information form filed with the Internal Revenue Service.
<li>The IRS Form 1098-T that you received reports amounts billed to you for qualified tuition and related expenses, as well as other related information.  
<li>You, or the person who may claim you as a dependent, may be able to take either the tuition and fees deduction or claim an education credit on Form 1040 or 1040A for the qualified tuition and related expenses that were actually paid during the calendar year.
<li>The <a href="supplemental.htm">Form 1098-T Supplemental Information</a> that ASU is providing over the Internet can assist you and your tax preparer in completing your tax return.  Follow the instructions provided on the <a href="supplemental.htm">Form 1098-T Supplemental Information</a> page to view and print paid tuition information.
<li>There is no need to attach Form 1098-T to your tax return.
<li>All information and assistance that ASU can provide to you is contained in this notice.

<P ALIGN=left><b>Amounts Billed for Qualified Tuition and Related Expenses</b><br>
  <b>Box 2 </b>of Form 1098-T reports the qualified tuition and related expenses billed to you during the calendar year.  Qualified tuition and related expenses are sometimes referred to as qualified education expenses, although the terms are not always interchangeable.  For purposes of the Form 1098-T provided by Arizona State University, the following categories of charges are included or not included in qualified tuition and related expenses:</p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>ASU is choosing to report qualified tuition and related expenses that were billed during the calendar year, rather than the amount that was paid.  In general, qualified tuition and related expenses are considered to be billed when you register for classes.  The billed amount of tuition and fees reported in box 2 is reduced by the following deductions:</P>
<center>Qualified Tuition and Related Expenses Reduced By:</center>
<table width=550 align=center border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td valign=top>
<li>Current year reductions in billed amounts for semesters billed during the calendar year.  For example, a reduction due to withdrawal from classes.  The reductions may or may not have resulted in a refund, depending on whether the billed amounts had been paid prior to the reduction.
<li>Tuition charges waived during the calendar year due to the student?s status as a benefits eligible ASU faculty or staff member or the spouse or dependent of an ASU faculty or staff member.
<li>Tuition charges waived during the calendar year due to the student?s status as an eligible research or teaching assistant/associate.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Additional detailed information regarding the amount reported in box 2 is available by logging onto <a href="https://sec.was.asu.edu/intsite/Main">ASU Interactive</a> and selecting ?View Your IRS Form 1098-T Tuition Statement?.  From this page, select ?View 1098-T information and supplemental detail?           to view qualified tuition and related expenses billed by semester and type of fee.  This detailed information is supplemental and is not reported to the IRS.</p>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The amount shown in box 2 for qualified tuition and related expenses billed during the calendar year may represent an amount that is different from the amount actually paid during the calendar year, although for many students the amounts will be the same.  Under section 25A of the Internal Revenue Code and the associated regulations, a taxpayer may take a tuition and fee deduction or claim an education tax credit only with respect to qualified tuition and related expenses actually paid during the calendar year.  You may not be able to take a tuition and fee deduction or claim an education credit with respect to the entire amount billed and reported in box 2.

<p style="margin-top:0;"><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:12.0pt;"><b>Box 4 </b>of Form 1098-T reports adjustments made to qualified tuition and related expenses reported on a prior year Form 1098-T in Box 2.&nbsp; The amount reported in Box 4 represents a <strong>reduction</strong> in tuition billed during a prior calendar year.&nbsp; For example, if you were billed for Spring semester classes in December and withdrew from classes in January, Box 3 reports the decrease in billed tuition due to the withdrawal.&nbsp; The amount reported in Box 4 for adjustments to qualified tuition and related expenses may reduce any allowable education credit you may claim for the prior year.&nbsp; See IRS Form 8863 or IRS Publication 970 for more information.&nbsp; </span></p>
<P ALIGN=left><b>Scholarships or Grants</b><br>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The amount of any scholarships or grants reported for the calendar year and other similar amounts not reported (because they are not administered and processed by ASU) may reduce the amount of any allowable tuition and fee deduction or education credit that you are entitled to.</p>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Additional detailed information regarding scholarships and grants reported in box 5 is available by logging onto <a href="https://sec.was.asu.edu/intsite/Main">ASU Interactive</a> and selecting ?View Your IRS Form 1098-T Tuition Statement?.

<span style="font-size:12.0pt;"><b>Box 6</b> of Form 1098-T reports adjustments made to scholarships or grants reported on a prior year Form 1098-T in Box 4.&nbsp; The amount reported in Box 6 represents a <strong>reduction</strong> in scholarships or grants reported for a prior calendar year.&nbsp; The amount reported in Box 6 for adjustments to scholarships or grants may affect the amount of any allowable tuition and fees deduction or education credit you may claim for the prior year.&nbsp; See IRS From 8863 for how to report these amounts.</span>
<P ALIGN=left style="margin-bottom: 0"><b>Additional Information Reported</b><br>
There are three additional information boxes that may have a check mark in them.  </p>
<P ALIGN=left style="margin-top: 0;"><b>Box 7 </b>indicates, if checked, that Box 2 includes amounts for an academic period beginning in the next calendar year.  For example, if you registered for the upcoming Spring semester during November or December, this box will be marked.</p>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><b>Box 8</b> shows whether you are considered to be carrying at least one-half the normal full-time workload for your course of study at ASU for at least one academic period during the calendar year.  If this box is marked, you meet one of the requirements for the Hope tax credit.  You do not have to meet the workload requirement to qualify for the tuition and fee deduction or the lifetime learning credit.</p>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><b>Box 9</b> shows whether you are considered to be enrolled in a program leading to a graduate degree, graduate-level certificate, or other recognized graduate-level educational credential.  If you are enrolled in a graduate program, you are not eligible for the Hope credit, but you may qualify for the tuition and fee deduction or the lifetime learning credit.</p>
<P ALIGN=left><b>Attaching Form 1098-T to Your Tax Return</b><br>
You are not required to attach IRS Form 1098-T to your tax return.  The IRS Form 1098-T is not like the IRS Form W-2 obtained from your employer, which is required to be attached to the tax return filed with the IRS. The primary purpose of the IRS Form 1098-T is to let you know that ASU has provided required information to the IRS to assist them in determining who may be eligible to claim the tuition and fee deduction or an education credit.</p>
<P ALIGN=left><b>If Your 1098-T is Incorrect.</b><br>
The Social Security Number and address on Form 1098-T were obtained from information provided to ASU, although the address shown on Form 1098-T is irrelevant for IRS income tax filing purposes.  The single most important information on the form is your Social Security Number.  Your Social Security Number must be correct.  Please call (480) 965-9834 if the Social Security Number on your 1098-T is not the correct number.</p>
