      <h2>Entrepreneur competition ignites students' futures </h2>
      <p>Use-inspired research and technology transferable to business ventures is the rage for many faculty and researchers at ASU, but now a program in the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering is giving that opportunity to students. </p>
      <p>Entrepreneur 2004, the Fulton School Entrepreneurial Programs' annual competition, gave ASU students the chance to plan a start-up company based on their technical and innovative concepts with expert advisement and provides a forum for the start-up business to receive actual development funding and services. </p>
      <p>This year the competition also gave students from the College of Law and the College of Architecture and Environmental Design the chance to gain experience by offering consulting services to the business teams. </p>
      <p>Entrepreneur 2004, the Fulton School's third annual entrepreneur competition, was the largest yet, with a $100,000 gift from Intel Foundation and $50,000 dollars worth of services donated by Greenberg Traurig, Steptoe and Johnson, ASU Technopolis, The Business Leadership Development (BLD) Corporation, Managed Change Associates, Pearson &amp; Associates, HC Matrix, Six-9s Associates, and the Enterprise Network for the winning students. </p>
      <p>MotionEase, made up of electrical engineering graduate students Prem Kuchi and Raghuram Hiremagalur, clinched the winning title during presentations April 8. An additional seed investment was awarded to Custom Microfluidics, made up of Anil Vuppu, associate research scientist in bioengineering, and Tilak Jain, bioengineering graduate student. Twenty-one teams submitted business plans </p>
      <p>"This is such a wonderful program because we wouldn't have had the opportunity to meet investors and mentors such as these any other way," said Kuchi. "They gave us the confidence to get our vision to a business format from a research format, and ultimately to start the company of our dreams." </p>
      <p>MotionEase will receive funding to develop the initial phase of their start-up company, a computer vision system allowing for affordable and timely motion capture. The team also will receive professional assistance in technology commercialization and business formation; the opportunity to be incubated at ASU; and legal, management, marketing, entrepreneurial and financial consulting services provided by the involved companies. </p>
      <p>"This year's entrepreneurial competition was created out of the need to develop entrepreneurship among students within the university," said Michael Kozicki, professor of electrical engineering and director of entrepreneurial programs at ASU. </p>
      <p>"We have so many students coming up with ground-breaking ideas, and entrepreneurship has become such a must-have skill in today's marketplace," he said. </p>
      <p>This year students from the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, the W. P. Carey School of Business, and the College of Architecture and Environmental Design participated in the event hosted by the Fulton School, the Center for the Study of Law, Science &amp; Technology at the College of Law, and DESiGNSPACE at the School of Design. </p>
