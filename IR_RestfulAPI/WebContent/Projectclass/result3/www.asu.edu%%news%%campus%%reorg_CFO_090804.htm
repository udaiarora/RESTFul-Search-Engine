      <h2 align="left">ASU reorganization includes CFO search: Crow names Harrison as Capital Center provost </h2>
      <p>In a series of moves to better position the university for its wide-ranging mission, ASU President Michael Crow has appointed Mernoy Harrison provost of the Capital Center campus, launched national searches for a chief financial officer and a university budget director, and made organizational changes within his executive leadership team. </p>
      <p>"This is a complex time for ASU, and I have given considerable thought to how my executive team can be most effectively organized to carry out the large-scale undertakings that we must accomplish in order to move this university to the next level," Crow said. "We have been working at considerable speed, with outstanding results - but, as I've said previously, we're too far behind on the competitive front to relax our pace." </p>
      <p>One of the most critical areas at hand is the construction of the Capital Center campus in downtown Phoenix, and Crow is capitalizing on the experience of Harrison, who is executive vice president for Administration and Finance. Harrison will assume his new role as provost of the Capital Center immediately, reporting to Executive Vice President and Provost Milton Glick. </p>
      <p>Rather than replace Harrison as executive vice president of Administration and Finance, Crow said the position's portfolio of responsibilities would be divided among the leadership team: </p>
      <p>. A national search will be launched immediately to attract a top chief financial officer who will focus on the university's financial matters. The CFO will be responsible for Financial Services - Comptroller and treasury functions; Business Services - Purchasing, Auxiliary Business Services, including Parking and Transit, and the Book Store; Real Estate; and Facilities and Construction Management. Harrison will retain responsibility for these areas during the search. </p>
      <p>. Paul Ward, vice president and general counsel, will take on an expanded role as vice president of University Administration and General Counsel. In this new role, Ward will have responsibility for Human Resources, Department of Public Safety (DPS), Internal Audit, and Legal Affairs. As part of his office organization, Ward has named Nancy Tribbensee associate vice president for Legal Affairs, and Mary Stevens senior university counsel for Employment Relations. </p>
      <p>. All university planning processes will be integrated into a single office under the direction of Richard Stanley, senior vice president and university planner. The Budget Planning and Management Office and the office of Institutional Analysis and Data Administration will be moved into Stanley's organization. A national search has been launched to hire a university budget director. </p>
      <p>Harrison, who joined ASU in 1997, will use his experience in real estate development, construction and financial management to oversee the building of the university's newest campus, which is slated to serve 15,000 students and revitalize downtown Phoenix. </p>
      <p>"The successful construction of our Capital Center campus is vital to the future of ASU and the city of Phoenix," Crow said. "Mernoy's blend of skills, record of accomplishment, and knowledge of both the university and the city make him ideally suited to lead a task of this magnitude, importance and complexity." </p>
      <p>Harrison said the vision for and scale of the Capital Center campus project is something he is gratified to be a part of at its beginning stages. </p>
      <p>"I have always found great satisfaction in bringing a single new university building online, and I cannot resist the opportunity to be involved in the effort to build an entire campus out of the ground to help complete the skyline of downtown Phoenix and revitalize its economic base," Harrison said. "I look forward to working with Mayor Phil Gordon, the Phoenix City Council and the city professional staff to make this dream a reality." </p>
      <p>Crow said this reorganization comes at a particularly opportune time. <br>
"With the construction of the Capital Center campus, the build-out of our West and Polytechnic campuses, the expansion of the research infrastructure on the Tempe campus as well as other projects, the university requires a senior officer devoted exclusively to financial management," he said. </p>
      <p>"I am also very pleased," Crow added, "that Rich Stanley and Paul Ward, two senior university administrators of the highest caliber, have agreed to accept additional responsibilities on top of their current duties." </p>
      <p>Ward said his principal objective with the reorganization is to focus on service to the university community through improved delivery of human resources services at ASU. </p>
      <p>"The faculty and staff of ASU are a tremendous asset to this university, and I welcome the opportunity to focus on improving every aspect of our service on their behalf," Ward said. </p>
      <p>He said the new assignment of duties to Tribbensee and Stevens will enable him to focus on his new administrative responsibilities while retaining primary responsibility for legal affairs at ASU. Stevens will oversee legal advising that relates to personnel issues, and Tribbensee will oversee the provision of all other legal services and will have increased responsibility for the administration of the Office of General Counsel. </p>
      <p>All of the appointments are effective immediately. </p>
