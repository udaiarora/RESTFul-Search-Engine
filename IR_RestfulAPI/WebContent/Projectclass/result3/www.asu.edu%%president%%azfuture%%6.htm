      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Body" --> 
      <p>Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has argued:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The continued preeminence of American research universities is key 
          to the sustainability of the United States&#8217; economic strength 
          and resiliency.</li>
        <li> &#8220;State support, both for the university system and for small 
          businesses, has been an important element in the vitality of&#8230;significant 
          centers of commercial innovation and entrepreneurship where creative 
          ideas flow freely between local academic scholars and those in industry.&#8221; 
        </li>
        <li> &#8220;leadership [of State] policymakers will be a key element in 
          promoting an environment in which [States can] join with others in business, 
          labor, and education to realize the potential that technological change 
          has for bringing substantial and lasting benefits to our economy.&#8221; 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <br>
        Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has argued consistently 
        that the continued preeminence of American research universities is key 
        to the sustainability of the United States&#8217; economic strength and 
        resiliency.</p>
      <p>On October 29, 2002, Chairman Greenspan addressed the International Understanding 
        Award Dinner of the Institute of International Education. He praised the 
        contributions of the research institutions, and particularly research 
        universities of the United States to America&#8217;s economic prowess: 
        &#8220;In a global environment in which prospects for economic growth 
        now depend importantly on a country's capacity to develop and apply new 
        technologies, the research facilities of our universities are world class. 
        The payoffs--in terms of the flow of expertise, new products, and start-up 
        companies, for example--have been impressive.&#8221; And, as he noted 
        to the National Governors&#8217; Association, the work that takes place 
        at universities can have great impact on regional economies with stakeholder 
        and State support and engagement: &#8220;perhaps the most frequently cited 
        measures of our success have been the emergence of significant centers 
        of commercial innovation and entrepreneurship where creative ideas flow 
        freely between local academic scholars and those in industry. Not all 
        that long ago, it was easy to recite a relatively short list of places 
        where these activities were clustered. But we have witnessed in recent 
        years a great multiplicity of these centers of innovation. State support, 
        both for the university system and for small businesses, has been an important 
        element in the vitality of these centers.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Greenspan argues that it is the very culture and processes of the university 
        research system that have made such advances and continued success sustainable: 
        &#8220;what has made our research universities so extraordinarily productive 
        is their promotion of peer-reviewed scholarship and the value they place 
        on creativity and risk-taking. Although some innovations move quickly 
        from the development stage to applications, we usually cannot accurately 
        predict which particular scientific advance, or synergy of advances, will 
        ultimately prove valuable.&#8221; Greenspan gives the example of &#8220;our 
        experience with the laser, which had to wait for improvements in fiber 
        optics to yield important applications. Indeed, according to Nobel Laureate 
        Charles Townes, in the late 1960s the attorneys for Bell Labs initially 
        refused to patent the laser because they believed it had no applications 
        in the field of telecommunications. Our universities have shown the patience 
        and the flexibility to accept that uncertainty, confident that the rigorous 
        effort to explore ideas would eventually lead to discovery.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Our research universities are drivers of innovation and they are the 
        nurturers of many of the most creative and productive minds of our day&#8212; 
        the education that American universities provide is exceptional. And, 
        as Greenspan notes, that quality education seeds the robustness of our 
        economy: &#8220;What our colleges and universities produce is obviously 
        highly valued in today's economy. The rise in that value over the past 
        several decades has been reflected in a widening spread between compensation 
        paid to college-educated workers relative to those with less schooling. 
        This increased investment in college-trained human capital has resulted 
        in a flow of labor input into the economy that has made an important ongoing 
        contribution to U.S. economic growth.&#8221;</p>
      <p>The landscape, Greenspan asserts, has clearly changed dramatically in 
        the last century. Workers must now more than ever be proactive lifelong 
        learners, and America&#8217;s higher education system must respond to 
        that need as it has to the needs of workers and companies over the past 
        century. Today&#8217;s higher education system must look beyond disciplinary 
        silos as it is becoming increasingly clear that, &#8220;most great conceptual 
        advances are interdisciplinary and involve synergies of different specialities.&#8221; 
      </p>
      <p>If we are to continue to move forward economically, according to Chairman 
        Greenspan, the role of the States in supporting higher education, which 
        enables continued innovation, is key: &#8220;we are in a period of rapid 
        innovation that is bringing with it enormous opportunities to enhance 
        living standards for a large majority of Americans. Our ability to take 
        advantage of these opportunities is not only influenced by national policies 
        but is also determined importantly at the state level. States with more 
        flexible labor markets, skilled work forces, and a reputation for supporting 
        innovation and entrepreneurship will be prime locations for firms at the 
        cutting edge of technology. Not all new enterprises will succeed, of course. 
        But many will, and those that do will provide the impetus for further 
        economic progress and expanding opportunities in their communities&#8230; 
        leadership [of State] policymakers will be a key element in promoting 
        an environment in which [States can] join with others in business, labor, 
        and education to realize the potential that technological change has for 
        bringing substantial and lasting benefits to our economy.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Higher education institutions are increasingly playing a lynchpin role 
        in our ability to survive in the global marketplace: &#8220;in the twenty-first 
        century, our institutions of higher learning will bear the enormous responsibility 
        of ensuring that our society is prepared for the demands of rapid economic 
        change. We must ensure that teaching and research continue to supply the 
        creative intellectual energy that drives our system forward. As the conceptual 
        inputs to the value added in our economic processes continue to grow, 
        the ability to think abstractly will be increasingly important across 
        a broad range of professions. Critical awareness and the abilities to 
        hypothesize, to interpret, and to communicate are essential elements of 
        successful innovation in a conceptual-based economy.&#8221; Our higher 
        education system must continue to have the resources, Greenspan argues, 
        to be &#8220;a flexible education system--one that integrates work and 
        training and that serves the needs both of experienced workers at different 
        stages in their careers and of students embarking on their initial course 
        of study.&#8221; The history of America&#8217;s system of higher education 
        shows a thoughtful and agile system that has been, and must continue to 
        be, responsive to the needs of the population it serves. In the early 
        twentieth century &#8220;the scale and scope of higher education in America 
        was being shaped by the recognition that research--the creation of knowledge--complemented 
        teaching and training--the diffusion of knowledge&#8221; work that continues 
        to this day as we respond with research, teaching, training and broad 
        communication to the our nation&#8217;s future success.</p>
      <p>If we want to move forward and be economically competitive, Chairman 
        Greenspan argues, we must maintain our preeminence in research and higher 
        education: &#8220;if we are to remain preeminent in transforming knowledge 
        into economic value, the U.S. system of higher education must remain the 
        world's leader in generating scientific and technological breakthroughs 
        and in preparing workers to meet the evolving demands for skilled labor. 
        With two-thirds of our high school graduates now enrolling in college 
        and an increasing proportion of adult workers seeking opportunities for 
        retooling, our institutions of higher learning increasingly bear an important 
        responsibility for ensuring that our society is prepared for the demands 
        of rapid economic change.&#8221;</p>
