The effects of temperature and stress on the steady-state creep rate of these materials were examined. The stress exponent and activation energy for creep deformation were determined. The stress exponents for molybdenum-0.5% hafnium carbide and molybdenum were 4.1 and 2.27. The activation energies for molybdenum-0.5% hafnium carbide and molybdenum were determined to be 104 and 66 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The creep strength of molybdenum-0.5% hafnium carbon at a creep rate of 10<sup>-6</sup> was determined as a function of temperature and compared with that of molybdenum. Hafnium carbide particles were found to be effective in strengthening molybdenum at high temperatures. The steady-state creep rate of molybdenum-0.5% hafnium carbide was approximately two orders of magnitude lower than molybdenum and the creep strength of molybdenum-0.5% hafnium carbide was about two times greater than that of molybdenum over the entire temperature range. The microstructures of post-test molybdenum-0.5% hafnium carbide specimens were examined with a transmission electron microscope. The creep strength of molybdenum 0.5% hafnium carbide was correlated with its microstructures that developed during high temperature deformation. The results illustrate that the great creep resistance of this alloy was associated with the presence of HfC particles which retarded the movements of dislocations, resulting in a dispersion strengthening.<p><i>Materials Science and Engineering, A177 (1994) 89-94. </i><br><hr><p><a href="../5abstrac.htm#luo">Return to Abstract List</a></body></html>
