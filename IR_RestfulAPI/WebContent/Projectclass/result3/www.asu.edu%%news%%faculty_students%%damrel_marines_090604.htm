      <h2 align="left">Damrel teaches Marines about Islamic culture </h2>
      <p>In Baghdad, Iraq, Marines are continuing to battle insurgents, and in many cases these soldiers know little about Iraq's culture, religion and traditions - knowledge that could provide them with additional survival skills, according to ASU's David Damrel. </p>
      <p>"Everyday people encounter people with values and beliefs that may seem unfamiliar and exotic, but interaction, communication and success require awareness about 'others,' " says Damrel, an assistant professor in ASU's religious studies department. "It's one thing to be unaware of ideas, values and cultures, but choosing ignorance is not an option in a globalized world." </p>
      <p>Damrel shared his knowledge of Islamic culture last month with more than 80 members of Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron No. 1, which is based at the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma. The workshop focused on Islam and Arab culture and was offered as part of a three-week training program for Marine instructors. </p>
      <p>Damrel's talk explains some of the core religious and cultural values - ideas about honor and shame, dignity, hospitality, the expected behavior of women and men - that Marines and others might encounter in Arab Muslim societies. </p>
      <p>"If your knowledge of Arab culture and Muslim societies is based just on what you get in the news, you won't be able to understand just how important these values are in daily life," Damrel says. </p>
      <p>Damrel says learning about Islamic culture is not just a matter of how religion shapes the world, but also how men and women relate with each other - and what is and is not appropriate in different contexts. </p>
      <p>"Most Americans, and not just servicemen and servicewomen, get their ideas and impressions about Islam and Arab culture from a very diverse set of brief news stories and popular media," he says. "That almost always creates a skewed, judgmental and narrow perspective about a society, and says almost nothing about individuals. It also means that most Americans are never exposed to the more usual, everyday customs and values that shape people's lives in Iraq." </p>
      <p>Damrel's one-hour talk was coordinated through ASU's Building Great Communities (BGC) program, created to promote university-community alliances to address complex issues, such as the economy, the environment, social spending, communication and quality of life. </p>
      <p>"We hope that this is the beginning of a working relationship that will allow for the further exchange of training resources - in culture or other areas that ASU can assist with," says Barbara Shaw-Snyder, BGC director of community outreach. "This type of workshop crosses many educational boundaries for the military and the university through the exchange of ideas." </p>
      <p>Damrel hopes to speak with other groups to educate them about issues that shape the way people imagine Muslims. <br>
"First, people commonly equate being a Muslim with being an Arab, even though well over 80&nbsp; percent of Muslims worldwide are not Arabs at all," he says. "Second, there is a strong conviction that Islam is somehow medieval, or anti-modern, and that it promotes intolerance and violence more than other religions or secular world-views. These ideas are reinforced so much in news reports and popular culture that it can be difficult to get past the stereotypes and start to think about Islam and Muslims in new ways." </p>
