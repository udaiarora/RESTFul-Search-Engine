      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, my mom is the picture of selflessness.  She does not have a job, yet she works more than many that do have jobs.  She puts in countless hours volunteering in our schools, community and city.  She is always the first one to put her name on the sign-up sheet for the All-Car Crockett carnival.  She is the one who spends days getting donations of Christmas presents and food for under privileged families.  She is the one who says two extra hours at the soup kitchen.  She is the one who everyone knows to call when they need an extra volunteer because she can never say "no" to someone in need.  As long as there is a person to help, she will be kept awake at night thinking of ways to help them.  Nobody forces her to do this.  Many people in this community think, "What's the point?  I might as well go shopping.  I can't change the world."  But my mom knows that by handing someone a food box or giving them the jacket off her back, she has changed their world.  She rarely gets recognition for her deeds, but that is not what she desired.  All she wants is the satisfaction of knowing that she has made a difference in another human's day.  She restores the hope in others to keep trying in life, and that gives her the spirit to keep serving.
     	<p>
     	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., my mom pours her soul into what she does.  She has the same belief as he did that one person can, and will, make a difference in the lives of many.  Like Dr. King, she is an ordinary person who finds the place inside that enables her to do extraordinary things.  All of us have that place, and when we discover something we feel passionately about, and want to change, our ability to be strong and make the change will break through   At the homeless shelter where she volunteer hours each week, my mom fights for the people.  She helps those struggling to help themselves.  She paints friendliness and warmth on her face, even when she is worn-out and weary.  When you are around her, you cannot help but feel her energy, enthusiasm, and love for others.
    	<p>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom is the person to whom I look for leadership.  I know that by following her I will be an admirable person, and I will have nothing of which to be shameful.  I am proud knowing that she has shaped a great part of my character.  I have learned how to help, teach, and make a difference in the lives of others.  Her service to those in need has made her life a success beyond belief.  Hopefully by following her lead, I will change the life of one, if not many.
     	<p>
     	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A leader teaches those who want to serve, and in turn those people teach others that follow.  There are many leaders in this world, the best of whom being the unrecognized, ordinary people who devote their lives to service.  My mom is one of these people and in dedicating her life to serving and leading, her actions will never die.
