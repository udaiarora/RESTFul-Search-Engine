<p>Five years ago, Urbano Rios was working in the fields in Ohio, picking apples, strawberries, green chilies and tomatoes to support his family. He also was going to school at night, to learn electronics. But when his 3-year-old daughter, Milagros, was diagnosed with autism, he knew he had to take a different path. </p>
<p>?It broke my heart,? he says. ?I knew I had to help her, but how?? </p>

<p>The immigrant from Mexico put down his tools and enrolled in college, though he was still learning English. This month, he graduated from ASU with a degree in speech and hearing science, motivated by an urgent desire to help his daughter. </p>
<p>His family's difficult journey has taken them to Albuquerque, where he began school at the University of New Mexico, then to ASU because he wanted the best program possible. He has been working two jobs, sleeping five hours a night, spending as much time as possible with Milagros, who still does not speak ? but who is surrounded by love. </p>
<p>In the fall, his family will move to Flagstaff, where Urbano will enter a master's program at Northern Arizona University. He plans to become a certified speech-language pathologist. </p>
<p>?My reward will be when she communicates, when she says something clearly,? he says. ?I can tell just what she wants, by watching her eyes. But I will devote myself to her. There are many children who need my help, not just my daughter. I saw them when I was in the fields.? </p>
<p>Now 43, Urbano came to the United States when he was 20, working as a car washer and field hand, gaining his legal residency in 1993. After getting married, he and his wife worked in the fields together ? she would pick, and he would lift the heavy boxes to load them on the trucks. Later, he was a janitor, earning his GED so he could go to a vocational school to learn electronics. </p>
<p>Their daughter Sarai, now 9, was a talkative child. So when Milagros wasn't speaking by the age of 3, they realized something wrong. Now 8 years old, Milagros attends elementary school not far from her sister. Urbano's wife works in a school cafeteria so she can be home with the children after school. </p>
<p>?When I first met Urbano in my undergraduate language disorders class, he demonstrated a thirst for knowledge I had never seen before,? says Shelley Gray, an ASU assistant professor of speech and hearing science. ?He wanted to understand every detail I taught, and I later found out why. He and his wife were using every piece of information to help their daughter. </p>
<p>?After class one day, he told me that if he could unlock the secret to communicating with his daughter, he could share this knowledge with other families and help them love their children.? </p>
<p>Urbano volunteers with special-needs children at his daughters' schools. The children cluster around him, aware that he can read their hearts. He believes God is using him to help Milagros ? and the others. </p>
<p>?Urbano has been an inspiration to students and faculty alike,? Gray says. ?His amazing combination of intelligence, caring and determination has led to this achievement. I have no doubt that many children will benefit from his hard work, but most especially his daughter.? </p>
