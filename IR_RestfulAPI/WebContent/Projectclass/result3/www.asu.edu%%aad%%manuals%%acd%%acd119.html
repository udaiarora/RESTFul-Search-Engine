<img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2">

<p>
It is prohibited to unlawfully manufacture, sell, possess, distribute, dispense, or use controlled substances in the <a href="acd002.html#workplace" target="New">workplace</a>.

<p>
As a condition of employment, each employee must agree to:

<p>
<ol>
<li>abide by the terms of this policy statement

<p>
and</li>

<p>
<li>notify the Office of General Counsel of any criminal drug conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace within five days after such conviction.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The Office of General Counsel will coordinate with the appropriate university office to determine if further reporting of the conviction to a federal agency within 10 days is required under the &#147;Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988&#148;; General Counsel will maintain appropriate records to verify compliance with legal reporting requirements of the act.

<p>
Within 30 days after receiving notice of the conviction, sanctions will be imposed on the employee according to university disciplinary policy and may include termination of employment or required participation in a drug rehabilitation program.  However, appropriate disciplinary sanctions, up to and including termination of employment, may be imposed in the absence of a conviction after consulting with the Office of General Counsel.

<p>
ASU provides drug awareness programs and referrals to drug rehabilitation programs through the Campus Health Service, the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and Counseling and Consultation.
