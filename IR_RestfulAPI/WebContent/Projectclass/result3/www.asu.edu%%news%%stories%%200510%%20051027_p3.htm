<h1 class="storyhead">Study: College degree trumps Wall Street </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>The best path to financial security may not be through the stock market.</p>
<p>Putting money into a four-year college education turns out to be a better financial investment &ndash; to the tune of $1 million more over one&rsquo;s lifetime than people who have just a high school education.</p>
<p>The rate of return on the money spent to earn a bachelor's degree is 12 percent per year, compared with the long-run average annual return on stocks of 7 percent. The net return is overall costs, including individual contribution and state appropriations, as well as income sacrificed while earning that degree. </p>
<p>Despite the high return on investment, just 25 percent of the U.S. adult population has at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. In comparison, more than 50 percent of Americans invest in the stock market, according to the American Shareholders Association.</p>
<p>These findings are reported in a new ASU study, &ldquo;The Value of Higher Education: Individual and Societal Benefits.&rdquo; It is authored by Dennis Hoffman, professor of economics in the W. P. Carey School of Business&rsquo;s L. William Seidman Research Institute; Kent Hill, research professor in the Department of Economics and Center of Business Research; and Tom Rex, associate director of the Center for Business Research.</p>
<p>The higher education report is part of an effort launched by ASU President Michael Crow and directed by Hoffman to better understand the various factors that help cities grow and regions prosper.</p>
<p>Called the Productivity and Prosperity Project (P3): An Analysis of Economic Competitiveness, the initiative examines the elements that make a region thrive. </p>
<p>&quot;What we learn holds particular significance for regions like the Phoenix metropolitan area that are experiencing tremendous development,&rdquo; Crow says. &ldquo;P3 will examine a host of factors, including the business climate, development and multisector investment strategies, innovation and individual initiative, and knowledge and skills of the work force. This particular study looked at higher education and finds that it provides considerable value to individuals, economies where educated individuals reside, and society in general. Economies that invest in higher education have realized considerable growth and prosperity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The study concludes, from a broad survey of literature, that low family income is not the only impediment to college educational attainment among young adults.</p>
<p>Financial barriers do exist, but less than 10 percent of the youth population fails to complete college simply because of a lack of financial resources, largely because of existing government and scholarship programs that help ease financing burdens. Recent reports suggest that financial barriers have increased in the last several years, and addressing these financial concerns is important, but it is not be the only prescription for success.</p>
<p>&quot;The academic ability of the individual, which is shaped throughout his or her life by a variety of family and environmental factors, and the values and goals of the individual, which are strongly influenced by the education of his or her parents, are important determinants of educational attainment,&rdquo; Hoffman says. &ldquo;A lack of information on the costs and benefits of higher education may underlie these factors. Therefore, a clear understanding of the rewards, coupled with interventions that increase the chances of success, can help. And the good news is that increasing the success rate will reap returns for generations to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the financial benefits to the individual who earns a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, the average wage &ndash; even for those workers who do not possess a college degree or a high school diploma &ndash; is higher in communities with a substantial proportion of highly educated workers.</p>
<p>ASU researchers surveyed recent studies that determined, after accounting for a host of factors responsible for wage variation, a 1 percent increase of college graduates in a metropolitan labor force yields a 1.9 percent increase in the wages for high school dropouts, a 1.6 percent gain in the wages of high school graduates, and a 0.4 percent rise in the wages of the graduates themselves. </p>
<p>The researchers also use a statewide simulation based on Arizona data to measure the impact of permanently raising the share of college graduates in the labor force by 0.2 percent (a median annual rate of increase observed in econometric studies) on the local economy. The simulation factored in current state support levels and degree completion rates, as well as rates of local employment for recent local graduates.</p>
<p>Findings reveal that state investment is well worth the payoff. The costs in state support are offset by higher incomes across the entire labor force after about 13 years. After 20 years, the net social returns are estimated to be $364 million in today&rsquo;s dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;Higher education represents an economic investment with a very high return,&rdquo; Hoffman says. &quot;Private returns are almost twice the size of long-run returns on stocks, and the social returns serve as an added bonus. Undoubtedly, many people underinvest in education &ndash; and, as a result, fail to reach their economic potential. Breaking down all barriers will reap considerable returns to individuals and society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The authors conclude that educational attainment in the work force should be an important part of a state&rsquo;s broad economic development plan. But it needs to be part of a portfolio approach &ndash; one that incorporates higher education and is aimed at quality work force development, quality public infrastructure, an emphasis on quality of life and amenities, and efforts to attain and maintain a business climate conducive to attracting quality employment opportunities.</p>
