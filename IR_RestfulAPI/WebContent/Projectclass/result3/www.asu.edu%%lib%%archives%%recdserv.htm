           <h3> ARCHIVAL RETENTION FOR UNIVERSITY RECORDS</h3>
</center>

<h3>ARCHIVAL RETENTION</h3>
<p>
1) Archives select non-current records for permanent retention and public access. Archives generally
retain less than 5% of records produced by an organization.
<p>
2) In general, University Archives is interested in information that is unique to your office, particularly
correspondence, memoranda, annual reports, committee minutes, photographs and publications.
<p>
3) If you have materials that might be appropriate for Archives, please contact us before sending the
information. Different types of information are preserved at different University Archives storage
locations.
<p>
4) Send archival publications to: University Archivist, University Archives Building, -1006.
Interdepartmental mail is acceptable.
<p>
5) Send archival records (files) to: Hayden Library, Rm. 431. Use the standard archives storage boxes
ASU Stores Item # 609210. Number the boxes consecutively and fill them completely. Box tops must
fit snugly. Property Transfer Authorization Forms may be used to call movers for transferring archival
records.
<p>
6) Smaller batches of archival records can be sent by courier to Rob Spindler at the Luhrs Reading
Room, 4th Floor, Hayden Library. They can also be sent by interdepartmental mail to Rob Spindler,
Archives and Manuscripts, -1006.  
<p>

<h3>ARCHIVES SERVICES</h3>
<p>
1) Accession Records are sent back to the originating office as an acknowledgment of each shipment
or accession of university records. Accessions of archival publications are not acknowledged.
<p>
2) Each accession is inventoried at the file folder level. Copies of inventories are sent to the
originating department.
<p>
3) Offices may borrow back any file they have sent us. Files are usually retrieved within an hour for
pickup at Luhrs Reading Room by your courier. The courier will be asked to sign a Loan Form sheet.
<p>
4) Files are eventually rehoused, indexed and made available as an archival collection in the Luhrs
Reading Room. Descriptions of these collections are entered in the University Libraries Online
Catalog and in internationally accessible computer networks.
<p>
5) Archives staff are available to discuss selection of archival records, creation/approval of RRDS
forms and creation of filing systems and automated inventorying systems.
