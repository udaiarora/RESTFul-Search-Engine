                  Professor: Jannelle Warren-Findley<br>
				  8:30-11:30, T, COOR 4581</strong></p>
                <p>
  ?Historic Preservation for Historians? will introduce graduate students to the roles that historians<br>
                  Play in the practice of historic preservation: as those who research, document, and interpret the built environment.  The class will read fundamental texts that shape the field, use the Internet for research on policy issues, do field research and analysis at sites in the Phoenix area and participate in a team research project as the capstone experience.  The course is appropriate for students interested in community history, policy and planning, material culture studies and the use of the built environment as a historical document.<br>

                  <strong>HST 532- Community History (16676)<br>
                  Professor: Philip Vandermeer <br>
				  8:40-12:30, M, COOR 458</strong>1<br><br>
				 
                  This course explores aspects of the history of community in the United States from the colonial period to the present, with some greater emphasis on the 20the century.  It addresses the central elements of community in the American context such as family, neighborhood, voluntary organizations, and politics, and it examines the pursuit of community in various formats, such as rural villages, utopian societies, urban neighborhoods, and contemporary suburbs.  One part of the course involves reading various community studies; a second part covers primary materials used in community history, and students do several brief projects using a variety of these sources.  Finally, students will complete a 15-20 page paper on community history that will take one of three forms: a review of the literature on some aspect of community history; a research proposal including a summary of some relevant literature and preliminary assessment of primary sources; or a webpage including both primary material and an analysis of that material. <br>
                  Students are also responsible for presenting a thoughtful critique of one of the other papers<br>

                  TBD</strong><br>
				  <br>
                  This course has been specially designed for Deer Valley Unified School District American History teachers, as part of a U.S. Department of Education Teaching American History Grant.  Through a series of six web modules, teachers are introduced to the latest and best scholarship in six eras of American History:  Early American Colonization; Revolution/Declaration of Independence; Civil War and Reconstruction; Westward Expansion; From the Spanish American War to World War I; and Progressive Era and Immigration.  Each module contains lectures by ASU historians (Kaplan, Whittaker, Hirt, Longley, and Gratton).  Each also includes primary documents, multimedia materials, and classroom resources that can enrich and enliven the teaching of American history.  In addition to writing assignments, pedagogical applications, and on-line discussions, participants will meet with the historians in two all-day sessions to allow for more discussion on content, historical thinking skills, and best practices in teaching history.<br>

                  <strong>HST 591- FOREIGN RELATIONS (01414)<br>
                  Professor: Kyle Longley<br>
				  12:40-3:30, M, COOR 4581</strong><br><br>
                  This will be a writing seminar that focuses on U.S. foreign relations from the colonial period to the present.  The student will write a paper that examines some form of international exchange between the United States and other countries.  There are many areas to research including different regions of the world, chronological periods, and issues ranging from cultural interactions to military ones.  The student will emerge from the class with better research tools and writing abilities.<br>

                 <strong> HST 591- WEST / ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY (72058)<br>
                  Professor: Paul Hirt<br>
				  12:40-3:30, TH, COOR 4581</strong><br><br>
                  American West/Environment is for students doing research on any aspect of the history of the American West, including what used to be called "frontier" history, as well as anyone doing research in environmental history.  The title does not mean that you must do something on the environmental history of the West.  I am flexible about the definition of "West" and "environmental history" in order to give you an opportunity to pursue research relevant to your thesis or dissertation topic. There will be only a few common readings.  The course will primarily focus on research and writing.  Besides your diligent work on your own topic, work for the class will involve reading, editing, and commenting on each others' work throughout the semester.  Each of you will produce three consecutive drafts of your paper, getting comments from the entire class on your first two drafts.  It will be intensive and time-consuming, but you will hopefully come out of the course with a publishable essay, advance work on your thesis or dissertation, an improved ability to frame, research, draft, and complete a scholarly article, and honed skills in critical editing. <br>

                  <strong>HST 591-COMPARATIVE COLONIALISM (73086)<br>
                  Professor: James Rush<br>
				  1:40-4:30, T, CDS 143</strong><br><br>
                  This seminar examines the 19th and 20th century global era of High Colonialism from a comparative perspective. Through common readings and class discussions, seminar members will develop a grasp of the era as a whole and then embark on research projects designed for subsequent comparative analysis. We will be interested in not only how imperialism remapped much of the Asian and African world but also how colonial powers reshaped the societies they colonized. Topics will range from imperial penetration and conquest to colonial goals and practices regarding education, public health, religion, commerce and industry, race, gender, governance, and ?law and order.? By comparing and contrasting British, Dutch, French, Spanish, and American approaches to these issues individually, we will hope to gain a nuanced understanding of the modern colonial world; at the same time,  we will explore the way that Western colonial powers collectively fashioned a global matrix that shaped the world we live in today, very aptly termed ?postcolonial.? The instructor?s expertise is in Southeast Asia?hence, British Burma, British Malaya, French Indochina, the Dutch East Indies, and the Spanish and American Philippines. Class members who wish to do so, however, will be encouraged to explore topics on British India and the major Western colonies of Africa and the Pacific. <br>

                  Professor: Karen Smith<br>
                  6:40-9:30, W, COOR 4581</strong><br><br>
                  This seminar will explore the various research tools and techniques public historians need to use in all aspects of public history, from preparing legislative histories, working on a team land use history, conducting oral interviews to writing a targeted research paper, typically a chapter of a Master?s thesis. The seminar offers a pragmatic and ?hands-on? approach to public history, taught by current practitioners. We will have guest speakers on a variety of topics, including using history to prepare documentary productions. Our focus will be on acquiring new research tools and refining writing and communication skills.</p>

                  <strong>HST 591- The World in North America: Migrants' Transcultural Linkages, 1830s-2000s (76542)<br>
Professor: Dirk Hoerder<br>
6:40-9:30, T, COOR 120</strong><br>
<br>
In this graduate research seminar, in a first, theoretical part, the issue of state formation and nationality will be analyzed historically in terms of "late-coming" unifications and statehoods. The structural-institutional aspects will be contrasted with migrant agency and flexibility. Is there one single model of acculturation or do regional cultural differences and, in this special case, the duality of national culture have to be taken into account. Finally, the differences/ similarities/ hierarchies between "national" and "ethnic" and "native" cultures will be discussed and assessed.<br>
In a second part, the historic many-cultured composition of Canadian and the two other North American societies will be surveyed and analyzed (1830s-1950s). In a third part, the focus will be on the present multicultural society. Requirements: In addition to English, knowledge of French is desirable but no prerequisite. Spanish, also desirable, would permit a better analysis of the role of Mexicans and Latin American migrants. Note: As with any comparative and global history, more than one language is necessary to understand historic developments and incorporate historiographies outside of the English-language realm. Each student is required -- in addition to the readings -- to chair one session and structure the classroom discussion and to present a research paper contextualizing the life-writing of one immigrant or immigrant family.<br>

                  This readings course focuses on the development of federal-Indian policies and programs that have been implemented by the U.S. government to assist American Indians. Starting with George Washington with the policies of treaty making, Jeffersonian, Jacksonian, Indian Removal, Peace, War, Allotment, Citizenship, Boarding School, Indian Reorganization, Termination, and Self Determination will be covered in the course for their origins, developments, impacts and native responses based on literature written about them and primary documents involved.<br>

                  The readings in this core course represent major themes of the past generation in the social and economic history of the United States from roughly the arrival of the ?new social history, or ?history from the bottom up? in the late 1960s and early 1970s to the present.  These themes include:  immigration and internal migration, class formation, the transitions to commercial and industrial capitalism, (sub)urbanization, natural resource development, and the growth of systems of mass transportation and communication.  Particularly for the period after 1880, the course emphasizes as well the growth of the modern state, consumerism, and the environmental movement.<br>

                  This course will explore some of the most important themes about Europe and the world, from the medieval and early modern periods when the world had a greater impact on Europe than Europe did upon the world, on to the modern period when Europe?s impact upon the rest of the world has been greater. The course will begin with a historiographical overview before proceeding through the medieval (1000-1500), early modern (1500-1750), and modern (1750-2000) periods, which will often involve many references to contemporary Europe (since the 1970s). The books to be read include 5 medieval ones, 9 early modern titles, and 16 modern books, which comprise the reading list for graduate students in European History. Additional readings will include four new titles on the relationship of Western Civilization and World History and on the roles of religion  food, and consumerism in world history. Several European and Non-European faculty will participate in hourly conversations at the beginning of most sessions. Student attendance and discussion will constitute 1/4 of the grade. Students will each give two 20-minute oral reports on 2 of the 30 books on the doctoral list for 1/4 of the grade. The last half of the grade will be based upon a 5-page paper on Medieval Europe and the World, a 5-page  paper on Early Modern Europe and the World, and a 10-page  paper on Modern Europe and the World. Professor Adelson will preside over all classes and grade all the papers.<br>

                  This seminar will consider refugees and displaced persons from the perspective of the humanities, a view often lost in the overwhelming emphasis on policy and advocacy.  It will explore how humanists?from artists to philosophers to historians?have addressed the question of loss of place.  We have evidence that human beings were cast out of their homes even before recorded time, and canonical documents on ancient eras, such as the Bible and the oral histories of indigenous persons, show that displacement has always been part of human experience. The seminar will begin with a joint contemplation of humanist approaches to refugees, found in reading, images, performances and lectures given by a variety of humanists.  Each participant will then define a humanistic research theme and carry out work on this topic during the remainder of the semester.  Each will present their findings to the class and submit a final version at the end of the term. The seminar will be directly linked to the Institute for Humanities Research/Department of History web site ?Refuge and Rejection,? and participants will be invited to contribute to this medium during the term.  Participants? final research projects will be considered for formal publication on the Refuge and Rejection web site. For more information about the seminar, please contact Professor Gratton via email:  brian.gratton@asu.edu.  You may access the prototype of the Refuge and Rejection website at:  http://www.asu.edu/clas/history/proj/refugee/ This course is offered by the Department of History but is intended for graduate students in any humanities field, so long as the student receives prior approval from Professor Gratton.  Please contact him at brian.gratton@asu.edu. <br>

                    Professor: R. Fuchs and D. Bivona<br>

                  Although the twentieth century has smugly labeled the nineteenth century as the age the age of repression, the Victorians in England and the moralists in France had, if anything, a culture-wide obsession with sex. The marital theme in Victorian fiction, the invention of the new field of "sexology," debates about gender roles and their relationship to biological "instincts," assertions linking poor women with ?immoral sexuality,?  considerations of masculinity and femininity, speculations about sex in the afterlife or whether masturbation caused blindness or insanity, or the preoccupation with the nocturnal adventures of vampires and other unwholesome creatures: all these things indirectly testify to the fact that men and women in London and Paris found sex to be an endlessly fascinating -- if ofttimes indelicate -- topic.  In this course, we will cover this topic as broadly as possible in England and France (London and Paris)  within the constraints of a one-semester course. Our approach will be interdisciplinary. Readings will include passages from Freud and other Victorian sexologists, contemporary critical theory (Butler and Foucault), novels and poetry of the period, as well as historical documents and monographs.   Enrollment limited to 8 graduate students from History and 8 graduate students from English.<br>
