          <p>Arizona State University is setting a "New Gold Standard" for American universities - one that measures a university's academic quality by the education that its graduates have received, rather than by the academic credentials of its incoming freshman&nbsp; class.</p>
          <p>"Most&nbsp; institutions judge their academic quality by who they exclude; we will&nbsp; be judged by who we include," says ASU President Crow.</p>
          <p>ASU is one of the premier metropolitan public research universities in the nation. Enrolling more than 58,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students on three campuses in metropolitan&nbsp; Phoenix, ASU maintains a tradition of academic excellence in core disciplines, and has become an important global center for innovative interdisciplinary teaching and research. ASU offers outstanding resources for study and&nbsp; research, including libraries and museums with important collections,&nbsp; studios and performing arts spaces for creative endeavor, and unsurpassed&nbsp; state-of-the-art scientific and technological laboratories and research facilities.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;In addition to the historic campus in Tempe, a college town in the midst of a dynamic metropolitan region, the university&nbsp; comprises two&nbsp; newer campuses with more specialized missions: ASU&rsquo;s West campus, in northwest&nbsp; Phoenix adjacent to Glendale, and ASU&rsquo;s East campus, a polytechnic college, in Mesa. In downtown Phoenix, ASU's Extended Campus offers academic programs and professional certificate programs, with a full campus being planned for the near future. </p>

          <p>The ASU College of Extended Education, headquartered at ASU's Downtown Center, advances the university's community outreach mission by extending education to adult learners interested in completing their degree or pursuing professional development. The College provides quality education to this population through convenient course offerings on evenings and weekends, multiple off-site locations, flexible programs and alternative delivery mediums such as the Internet. The College's university-wide collaboration efforts link students to credit classes, bachelor through doctorate degree programs, certificates, community enrichment programs and professional and workforce development. </p>

          <p> At ASU's Polytechnic campus students gain knowledge through action. Academic programs focus on a polytechnic education, meaning an applied approach.

The campus, located in southeast Mesa, is a small residential college environment, with access to all the amenities and resources of a large university.
