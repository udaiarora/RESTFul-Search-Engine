			 <P>Congratulations on your employment at Arizona State University. We
				look forward to helping make your transition into the ASU community as pleasant
				as possible.</P> 
			 <P>The Benefits Eligible New Employee Envelope contains instructions and forms necessary to enter you into our
				Human Resources Management System (HRMS) and to insure that ASU complies with a
				federal law requiring all of our employees to verify their employment
				eligibility. Entry in HRMS is the key to your being paid and receiving all
				other services. You may submit your <A HREF="../forms/paypack.pdf">payroll
				paperwork </A>in person when you arrive on campus at the HR Employee Service
				Center located in the University Services Building, or during your HR Employee
				Orientation. You also have the option to mail notarized verification and
				payroll forms prior to your arrival to: ASU HR Employee Service
				Center, P.O. Box 875612, Tempe, Arizona, 85287-5612. Early submission of
				these papers expedites  new employee processes. </P> 
			 <P>The Benefits-Eligible New Employee Envelope also contains
				a map that is color-coded to the location of services; a checklist of tasks
				necessary to obtain parking, computing and other services; and information
				about orientation. HR Employee Orientation is designed to acquaint new
				benefits-eligible faculty and staff with ASU, provide onsite sign-on for
				services, and provide information about major benefits such as health insurance
				and retirement plans. The Benefits Guide can be read
				prior to attending an orientation to get a general overview of the benefits
				available to employees, and specific questions can be answered by the benefits
				experts during the orientation session.&nbsp; For additional information you may
				visit the <A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/hr/benefits/index.html">Benefits </A>web site. </P> 
			 <P> HR Employee Orientation sessions are scheduled every Monday. You must be pre-registered to attend. You may ask your department to
				register  you on a day you will be able to attend, or you may register
				yourself by calling (480) 965-4751 or e-mail
				<A HREF="mailto:lps@asu.edu">lps@asu.edu</A>. When registering
				please include your name, ASU ID # (if issued), contact phone number and your
				employment category, i.e., faculty, post-doctorate, academic professional,
				service professional, or administrative or classified staff. More Orientation
				details can be found at the <A HREF="../new_employee.html">new employee web
				page</A>. </P> 
			 <P>Attention to these details along with your department's submission
				of the Hiring Process Report (HPR) before the start of your employment will
				ensure that your paychecks and your insurance benefits begin without delay and
				will expedite delivery of other services. </P> 
			 <P>Welcome to ASU! </P><BR> <B><A HREF="../benefits/documents/newemployeechecklist.pdf">NEXT PAGE
