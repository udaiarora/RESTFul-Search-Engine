Upon notification, occupants should immediately begin an orderly evacuation of the building by the nearest exit or as advised otherwise.  Elevators may not be used.<p>All occupants must assemble at a safe distance from the building and may not re-enter until permitted by an emergency official.  Persons having information regarding remaining occupants should advise emergency personnel immediately of their location or other vital information.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Exits</b></font><p>In order to conduct a safe evacuation, all exits must be free at all times of obstructions, including combustible materials, furniture, refuse, or other stored items.  Exit doors may not be obscured or concealed in any way with decorations such as mirrors or draperies.  Fire exit doors must remain closed at all times.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Evacuating Persons with Disabilities</b></font><p>The notification, protection, evacuation, transportation, and medical attention of persons with special needs will be given the highest priority in all emergencies.  The order to evacuate will be determined by the emergency personnel responding to the incident. In cases of evacuation, the Disability Resource Center (DRC) at the Tempe and West campuses will be notified immediately. The actual physical evacuation of persons with disabilities will be performed only in genuine emergencies, and not as part of regular drills or false alarms.<p>During evacuation, building occupants should attempt to assist persons with disabilities to designated areas of rescue assistance or from the building.  If this is not possible, persons requiring assistance in evacuation should wait in a designated area or adjacent to a stairwell, taking care not to block the path of other persons using the stairwell.  Emergency workers should be made aware of the locations of any persons remaining inside the building.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Staging Areas</b></font><p>In the event of a building, an area, or an entire campus evacuation, you will be notified where staging areas are located. Food, water, first aid, shelter, and information will be available at these staging areas. <font color=#FFFFFF>skip navigation bar</font><p><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">DPS</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | DPS&#160;manual&#160;<a href="dps001.html">contact</a> | Department&#160;of&#160;Public&#160;Safety&#160;Web&#160;<a href="dps.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
