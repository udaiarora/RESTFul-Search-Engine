<P>While SAS/AF Version 7 software does not support build-time development
of FRAME entries in the CMS or OS/390 environments, you can port applications
developed in other desktop environments to a mainframe. This section describes
<P>
<UL>

<LI>development tips that you can use when developing applications
that you port to CMS or OS/390<P>

<LI>host-specific behavior for SAS/AF visual components running on
programmed symbol graphics devices (such as 32xx terminals)<P>

<LI>host-specific behavior for SAS/AF visual components running on
vector graphics devices (such as 31xx terminals)<P>
</UL>

<P>Note that while a component or control may display properly, some associated
methods may not work in the mainframe operating environment. For example,
the _setCursorShape method enables the user to set the cursor shape used when
the cursor moves over a visual control. On programmed symbol graphics devices,
terminal buffering prevents SAS/AF from detecting cursor movement unless the
ENTER key or a PF key is pressed.

<P>When you develop a frame for use in a mainframe environment, it is recommended
that you port the frame to the target platform to view the frame using the
same display that your users will use. The sizing of visual components on
a frame can be affected by the host environment due to differences in the
system fonts between the development and run-time environments. Currently,
font sizes can vary depending on the display device used. Known font sizes
for mainframe devices include 9x12, 9x16, 9x14, 8x14, and 6x12 font sizes.
In addition, you may want to leave scrollbars turned on for your frames to
ensure that all users will be able to see the entire layout.
<P>It is also important to test a SAS/AF application on all display devices
used by your mainframe users. You may find that applications developed with
many different types of graphical components may not work well on programmed
symbol devices but will work correctly on vector graphics devices.
<P>Also, keep in mind the following restrictions when developing frame-based
applications for use in a mainframe environment:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Text and graphic alignment may differ between the build-time environment
and the mainframe run-time environment. Since programmed symbol devices use
a fixed font that must be aligned to a cell boundary, objects placed on a
frame in a build-time environment that does not have that restriction may
appear differently at run-time.<P>

<LI>Certain events or functions that are supported in other environments
do not work in OS/390 or CMS, including mouse movement, drag and drop, double-clicking,
selecting either mouse button 2 or 3, and others.<P>

<LI>Some 3270 display devices have a very limited color selection.
When a color such as gray is displayed on a terminal that must choose, for
instance, between black or white, some visual objects on the frame may not
appear or may disappear into the background of the frame.<P>

<LI>Once a SAS window has entered a "wait for input" state,
the user must respond before output or updates to other windows can occur.<P>
</UL>

classes running on CMS or OS/390 and displayed on a terminal that supports
programmed symbol graphics (such as 32xx terminals). The following table contains
