      <h2>Mossman earns recognition, continues research in radiation</h2>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/Mossman_022103.jpg" alt="Mossman" width="164" height="167" align="right"> 
        Since he first set foot on the campus of Wayne State University in 1968, 
        Kenneth Mossman has been studying physics and biology. </p>
      <p>For his dedication and countless contributions in the area of health 
        physics and research Mossman, health physics professor and director of 
        the University Office of Radiation Safety at ASU, was presented with the 
        2002 Health Physics Society Founders Award.</p>
      <p>In an article presented at the 47th Annual Meeting of the Health Physics 
        Society, Rick Jones, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Department 
        of Energy wrote, "Dr. Mossman is the model of a consummate health physicist, 
        unselfishly giving of himself to provide exceptional service to the Health 
        Physics Society, his many students over the years and to his colleagues, 
        who have depended upon him for sound, technically-defensible knowledge 
        in radiation biology and, more specifically, the risks of radiation exposure 
        and the low-level effects of radiation in humans." </p>
      <p>Mossman said he had always been interested in the areas of physics and 
        biology, but it was reading a book by Erwin Schroedinger that fueled his 
        motivation to pursue a career in health physics.</p>
      <p>"Reading Erwin Schroedinger's little book 'What is Life?' was particularly 
        enlightening because of its interesting discussion of life processes from 
        a physicist's perspective," he says.</p>
      <p>Currently, Mossman is conducting research on nuclear regulatory science 
        and policy, which has focused on strategies to reconfigure the regulatory 
        framework for U.S. radiation protection with the goal of maintaining or 
        improving public and worker health and safety, while reducing regulatory 
        compliance costs. A description of Mossman's work was published in the 
        January 2003 issue of "Environmental Health Perspectives."</p>
      <p>In addition, Mossman is advising governments on radiation science and 
        policy and developing a system of radiation protection for the environment 
        in collaboration with the International Commission on Radiological Protection 
        (London) and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic 
        Cooperation and Development (Paris).</p>
      <p>Mossman says promoting safe practices involving nuclear technologies 
        is his main objective.</p>
      <p>"In my capacity as director of the ASU Office of Radiation Safety, I 
        am responsible for making sure that radioactive material, lasers and X-ray 
        machines are used safely in research and instruction," he says. "Nuclear 
        power and medical X-rays are two examples of how society benefits from 
        radiation. However, the uncontrolled uses of radiation may be potentially 
        hazardous. I have a long standing interest in promoting safe uses of radiation 
        technologies for the betterment of society."</p>
      <p>Mossman served as assistant vice president for research at ASU, 1990 
        - 92; as a faculty member at Georgetown University, 1973 - 90; and was 
        professor and founding chairman of the Radiation Science department in 
        Georgetown's Graduate School from 1985 to 1990. </p>
      <p>Mossman earned a B.S. in biology from Wayne State University; M.S. and 
        Ph.D. degrees from the University of Tennessee in radiation biology; and 
        a M.Ed. degree in higher education administration from the University 
        of Maryland.</p>
