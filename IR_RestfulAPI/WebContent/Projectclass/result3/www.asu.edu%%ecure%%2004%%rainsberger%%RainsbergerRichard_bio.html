		<acronym title="Family Educational Records and Privacy Act of 1974">FERPA</acronym> policy

		<acronym title="Family Educational Records and Privacy Act of 1974">FERPA</acronym> workshops 
		at the annual meeting of

		<p>In 1997, he also published the <acronym title="American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers">AACRAO</acronym> <acronym title="Family Educational Records and Privacy Act of 1974">FERPA</acronym> Guide for Secondary Education. His 
		other current pursuits are evaluating states' open records laws in relation to <acronym title="Family Educational Records and Privacy Act of 1974">FERPA</acronym>, 
		federal legislation on digital signatures, the impact of high technology initiatives on 
		<acronym title="Family Educational Records and Privacy Act of 1974">FERPA</acronym>, and outsourcing. He regularly writes his "<acronym title="Family Educational Records and Privacy Act of 1974">FERPA</acronym> Doctor" column for two national 
		professional publications.</p>
