LIST's Newsletter<br>
January, 2003

</center>
<br>
Happy New Year to everyone! This year, there?s one resolution LIST can help you 
keep: to protect your computer from viruses and hackers. Keith Swartz tells you how below.
<p><br>

<h3>
How to Protect Your Computer</h3>
<b>1.  Avoid High-risk behaviors:</b>
<p>
The following activities are among the most common ways of getting computer 
viruses. Minimizing the frequency of these activities will reduce your risk 
of getting a virus:
<ul>
<li>Freely sharing computer programs and system disks </li>
<li>Downloading executable software from public-access bulletin boards </li>
<li>Opening e-mail attachments without first scanning them for viruses. </li>
<li>Opening any e-mail attachment that ends in .exe, .vbs, or .lnk on a computer 
running Microsoft Windows </li>
</ul>
<p>
It?s best to regard all e-mail attachments with suspicion, even when they?re 
from people you know. Remember, computer viruses often spread by sending themselves 
to addresses found on infected systems, unbeknownst to the system?s user. 
<p>
Caution is important, but don?t be so afraid of viruses that you fall for hoaxes. 
If you receive an email apologizing for sending a virus and giving instructions 
to get rid of it by deleting certain Windows files, don?t do anything until you?ve 
investigated and made sure there really is such a virus and this is the way to 
get rid of it. If you?re not sure, call Keith!
<p>
<b>2.  Take Preventative Measures:</b>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have a secure password using combinations of upper and lower 
case letters, numbers and symbols. For example, turn ?smith? into ?$m1tH?. And 
never use the same character combination for both your user name and your 
password ? this will make your system more vulnerable to hackers.</li>
<li>Make sure virus detection software is running on your computer. There are 
two general functions that antivirus programs perform: scanning for and removing 
viruses in files on disks, and monitoring the operation of your computer for 
virus-like activity (either known actions of specific viruses or general 
suspicious activity). Most antivirus packages contain routines that can perform 
each kind of task. </li>
<li>Keep your virus detection software updated! Virus patterns change all the time, 
and you must update your virus pattern files regularly for full protection. Most 
computers in the Library are set to auto-update every week.</li>
<li>Quarantine infected systems. If you discover that a system is infected with 
a virus or has been hacked into, immediately isolate it from other systems. In 
other words, disconnect it from the network and don't allow anyone to move files 
from it to another system. </li>
<li>Check your antivirus software settings to make sure appropriate scans are enabled.  
You can check this by right-clicking on the Vshield icon in the lower right corner 
of the screen and go to Quick Enable.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<b>3.  Be Alert to Unusual Activity</b>
<p>
If a hacker succeeds in getting into your computer, they may not be detected by your 
antivirus software, but there will be other signs that something is amiss. For example, 
your hard drive may suddenly be full because the hacker is using it to store and share 
large files. Or there may be a hidden program running on your computer ? a blank space 
among the program icons at the bottom right of your screen is a clue. Another recent 
hacking attempt resulted in missing McAfee icons in the lower right of the screen 
(Vshield and VirusScan Console).  The hacker turned off antivirus so he could drop 
his payload undetected, and then prevented antivirus from being restarted.  Everyone 
should regularly take a moment to check and make sure McAfee antivirus is active. 
<p>
Remember that Keith is here to help you with your computing needs, so if you need 
more information about this or any other computer-related issue, don?t hesitate 
to contact him at 5-2854 or through Outlook.
