      <h2>No simple explanation exists for gasoline price increases </h2>
      <p>The soaring price of gas in the Valley and across the nation has consumers wondering if they are being fleeced by local distributors or international corporations - but there are several factors that figure into the recent price hikes, according to an analysis in the current issue of the <em>Arizona Blue Chip Economic Forecast</em>. </p>
      <p>"Many consumers in the Valley have concluded that they are victims of corporate price gouging when it comes to Arizona's above-average gas prices," according to Arizona Blue Chip topics editor Elliott Pollack. "Some have even called for additional government regulation on the matter. In reality, the idea of the existence of some form of local market failure is largely unfounded." </p>
      <p>In 2002, the price of crude oil was responsible for 43 percent of the average retail price for a gallon of regular grade gasoline. Federal and state taxes accounted for 31 percent of the price we pay. The remaining 26 percent of the price of gas is determined by processing (13 percent) and distribution (13 percent). </p>
      <p>"Gasoline taxes have been fairly stable in recent years," Pollack said, " and healthy competition in the marketplace has kept distributor profits at competitive levels. On the other hand, the price of crude oil has been increasing for months, and we have not expanded our refining capacity in many years." </p>
      <p>"Foreign countries have a disproportionate influence on prices. The members of OPEC account for more than one-third of the world's crude oil production and hold roughly two-thirds of the world's reserves. If OPEC announces plans to decrease crude production for 'price stability' reasons, the price of oil and gasoline will rise. These price increases are directly attributable to worries over supply constraints." </p>
      <p>The United States has the ability to release a portion of its oil reserves onto the market to increase supply and drive down prices. But, the use of reserves is considered a short-term solution to crisis situations. World events also affect the price of oil and gasoline. In times of war or political instability, uncertainty enters the marketplace and the price of oil increases. </p>
      <p>"Increases in the price of oil directly translate into gasoline price hikes," Pollack said. "The price of oil is soaring, therefore the price of gas is increasing. This is the primary reason we are now paying more at the pump. </p>
      <p>"Western states on average pay more than any other region within our country. Eliminating the MTBE additive from Arizona's gas blend may widen our available supply. However, Arizonans will always pay a little more for gasoline due to distance from the primary supply, and due to regional refining capacity." </p>
      <p>Without significant changes to Arizona's dependence on California's refineries, Arizona's gas prices will always be higher and more volatile than the U.S. average. "One specific strategy for limiting Arizona's dependence on California would be to construct a local refinery," Pollack said. "The reality is that in a growing state like ours, demand for gasoline will only rise in the future. While advances in the development of affordable and efficient energy alternatives are possible in the long run, for the time being, we may need to revisit the trade-offs between environmental concerns and economic concerns." </p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the <em>Arizona Blue Chip</em>, Editor Tracy Clark surveyed the panel members on the outlook for the national economy through 2005. " The consensus forecast indicates that the panel believes the Fed will largely be successful in keeping inflation in check," Clark reported. " The panel expects housing starts to remain healthy at the national level, but higher interest rates will slow the rate of growth. Industrial production is expected to finally recover enough to make an impact on employment." </p>
      <p>The main risks to the panel's forecast appear to be international, according to Clark. "The economy is vulnerable to further terrorist attacks, and any uncertainties on the international scene." </p>
      <p>The <em>Bank One Arizona Blue Chip Economic Forecast </em> includes the consensus forecast of economists from 19 groups and institutions. It is published by the Bank One Economic Outlook Center, an affiliate of the L. William Seidman Research Institute in the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.
