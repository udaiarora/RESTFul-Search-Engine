      <h2 align="left"><strong>Nursing academy names Malloch, Mattson as Fellows </strong></a></h2>
      <p align="left">Nursing professors Susan Mattson and Kathy Malloch have been selected for fellowship in the American Academy of Nursing (AAN).</p>
      <p> Since its establishment in 1973, there have been 1,500 inductions into the Academy, with 63 new Fellows being inducted this year.</p>
      <p> The AAN comprises 1,500 qualified and savvy nurse leaders who are at the top of their profession, having accomplished extraordinary milestones in their nursing careers. AAN members have been identified by their peers to be the best and brightest in their nursing discipline.</p>
      <p> The new Fellows will be formally inducted into the American Academy of Nursing during the AAN&rsquo;s 31st annual meeting and conference Nov. 13 in Washington, D.C. </p>
      <p> To be considered for this honor, two individuals who already are members of the organization must sponsor a prospective Fellow.</p>
      <p> The criteria for selection requires evidence of outstanding and broad contributions to nursing and health care, as well as evidence of strong potential for continuing influence on nursing practice and health policy aimed at improving the health of the American people.</p>
      <p> &ldquo;Being selected is definitely an honor, especially to be recognized and nominated by your peers,&rdquo; says Karen Sousa, interim dean. &ldquo;We congratulate Susan and Kathy on this prestigious nomination and are proud of their significant accomplishments.&rdquo;</p>
      <p> Mattson, who joined the faculty in the College of Nursing in 1993, earned tenure in 1996 and was promoted to full professor in 2001, also is president-elect of ASU&rsquo;s Faculty Senate. She received a Ph.D. from Claremont Graduate University in 1987. Her research focuses on women&rsquo;s health, particularly addressing the topic of domestic violence across cultures.</p>
      <p> Mattson has received several grants and has published extensively in the most prestigious journals in women&rsquo;s health. She also contributes time by serving as a reviewer for one of the best-regarded journals in maternal-health nursing. She serves on the editorial advisory board for the Association of Women&rsquo;s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses journal, <em>AWHONN Lifelines,</em> and as a book review editor for Health Care for Women International.</p>
      <p> In 1996, the Association of Women&rsquo;s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses honored Mattson with its Award for Excellence in Nursing Education. During her 1998-99 sabbatical leave, she was granted and completed a year as a nurse scholar at the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Md. </p>
      <p> Mattson is co-editor of a first, second and third edition of &ldquo;Core Curriculum for Maternal Newborn Nursing.&rdquo; The book provides nursing considerations associated with every stage of pregnancy and childbirth.</p>
      <p> Malloch, a faculty associate at the College of Nursing, is president of Kathy Malloch Associates, a national health care consulting firm. Malloch has been a registered nurse for 30 years and is a nationally known writer and speaker. </p>
      <p> She serves as president of the Arizona State Board of Nursing, senior consultant for Tim Porter-O&rsquo;Grady Associates, and member of the editorial board of the <em>Creative Nursing Journal,</em> the publication of Creative Healthcare Management, and <em>Patient Care Management Journal. </em>Malloch received a Ph.D. in nursing from the University of Colorado.</p>
      <p>Malloch is co-author of the book &ldquo;Quantum Leadership: A Textbook of New Leadership.&rdquo; The book offers advice to health care leaders on the proper behaviors and strategies of leadership.</p>
      <p> Mattson and Malloch join six other ASU nursing professors in the academy.</p>
