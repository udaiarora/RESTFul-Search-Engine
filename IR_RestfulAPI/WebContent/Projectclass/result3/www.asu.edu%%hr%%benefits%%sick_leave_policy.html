				eligibility for family leave as described in

				<A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/spp701-01.html">SPP 701-01</A> Sick
				Leave - General Policy states, sick leave may be used only when an
				employee:</P> 
			 <UL> 
				<LI>is unable to perform assigned duties because of illness,
				  injury, pregnancy, childbirth, or </LI> 
				<LI>related medical conditions and must be absent from work to
				  obtain health-related services not reasonably available before or after the
				  employee's regular work hours or </LI> 
				<LI>is absent due to illness or communicable disease within the
				  employee's immediate family, established household, or in situations which
				  place primary responsibility for care on the employee. </LI> 
			 </UL> 
			 <P>It is highly recommended to establish standards similar to the
				following:</P> 
			 <OL> 
				<LI>All requests for use of sick leave must be approved by the
				  employee's supervisor. The employee must notify his or her supervisor on the
				  first day of an absence and periodically thereafter in the event of an illness
				  of more than five working days. </LI> 
				<LI>Within the unit, establish a request/notice procedure. For
				  example, an employee is to notify his or her supervisor within one half hour of
				  the employee's start time, and upon return complete and submit a leave request
				  form within two days. </LI> 
				<LI>Only an individual aware of the employee's absence can sign the
				  employee's time sheet, preferably the supervisor. Such a practice helps to
				  assure accuracy and accountability in the recording of absences. </LI> 
				<LI>A supervisor needs to be aware of an employee's sick leave
				  balance. An employee may request sick leave beyond what has been accrued. Under
				  such circumstances, the employee may, if desired, request to use accrued
				  vacation leave (if eligible to do so), and/or request a leave without pay. The
				  supervisor needs to be able to inform the employee of the number of leave
				  without pay hours and vacation hours approved. </LI> 
				<LI>Excessive absenteeism or extended absence may warrant a request
				  for a physician statement in support of the leave request. It is important for
				  all employees within the unit to be informed of the conditions or circumstances
				  which would require the providing of a physician statement. </LI> 
				<LI>In addition, once an attendance standard has been established
				  within a unit, an employee's lack of compliance in meeting the standard can be
				  addressed. Sick leave does not preclude a supervisor from addressing the
				  performance issues resulting from poor attendance. A performance standard can
				  be based on the operational needs of the unit and/or the average attendance
				  pattern of the typical employee within the unit. Oftentimes the standard is
				  defined in terms of the frequency and/or duration of absences. </LI> 
				<LI>If in connection with absenteeism the employee self identifies
				  a disability, consult with the <A HREF="http://www.eoaa.asu.edu/">Affirmative
				  Action unit</A> and <A
				  HREF="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/spp105.html">SPP 105 Americans with
				  Disabilities</A> before proceeding with any form of disciplinary action. </LI> 
			 </OL> 
			 <P>Any questions regarding the interpretation of SPP policies on sick
				leave, the application of sick leave and the employee's performance directly
				related to the sick leave contact your <A HREF="/hr/partners/index.html">HR
				Partner</A>.</P> 
			 <P><B><A NAME="Vacation"></A>Vacation Leave</B><BR> In order to
				understand the definition and application of the University's policy on
				vacation leave refer to
				<A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/spp702-01.html">SPP 702-01</A>
				Vacation Leave - General. The policy provides information on approval, accrual
				and accumulation, and the payment of hours upon termination. Encouraging the
				use of vacation leave can generate well rested employees who are more
				productive and effective. Vacation leave may be used in connection with family
				leave when the reason and circumstances are consistent with the purpose of and
				eligibility for family leave as described in
				<A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/spp705-02.html">SPP 705-02
				</A>.</P> 
			 <P>It is highly recommended that the following guidelines are
				established for vacation leave:</P> 
			 <OL> 
				<LI>Within the unit, a request/notice procedure. For example, an
				  employee is to submit a vacation leave request for one day or less at least
				  forty-eight hours in advance and two weeks in advance if the request is made
				  for more than one day. </LI> 
				<LI>The only one who signs the employee's time sheet is an
				  individual aware of the employee's absence, preferably the supervisor. Such a
				  practice helps to assure accuracy and accountability in the recording of
				  absences. </LI> 
				<LI>Be aware of an employee's vacation leave balance. An employee
				  may request vacation leave beyond what has been accrued. Under such
				  circumstances, a supervisor needs to be able to inform the employee of the need
				  to request leave without pay. It is also advisable to alert employees when
				  their vacation balances exceed the maximum allowed, leaving them vulnerable to
				  losing accrued leave. </LI> 
				<LI>The approval or disapproval of vacation leave is at the
				  discretion of the supervisor and must take into account the operational needs
				  of the unit. If a supervisor is unable to accommodate the employee's request to
				  take vacation during a particular period of time, perhaps alternate dates could
				  be considered and discussed. </LI> 
				<LI>If the employee's attendance has been poor and has had an
				  adverse affect on the individual's performance and/or the operation, the
				  supervisor may want to consider not approving a leave request for vacation.
				  Approving vacation under such circumstances may send the wrong message, which
				  is that the employee's continued absence does not constitute a performance
				  issue. </LI> 
			 </OL>

				vacation leave, the application of vacation leave and the employee's
				performance can be directed to an <A HREF="/hr/partners/index.html">HR
				Partner</A>.</P>

				on jury duty refer to
				<A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/spp704-03.html">SPP 704-03</A>. The
				policy provides information on notification, absence reporting, and fees and
				travel reimbursements associated with jury duty and material witness service.
				It is important for a supervisor to communicate to the employee his or her
				obligation to remit fees received for jury duty less traveling expenses to
				Cashiering Services; call 965-7468 for further guidance. A supervisor may
				request documentary evidence of the summons or subpoena, but in doing so should
				be consistent in requiring such documentation of all employees within the
				unit.</P>

				training offered by the Guard or Reserves is required. In responding to a
				request for military leave, a supervisor can require supporting documentation
				which indicates whether or not the training is required in order for the
				employee's status in the military to remain active. If the training is not
				required, the supervisor can exercise discretion in approving the leave request

				allows employees to voluntarily transfer accrued vacation leave to other
				employees who are unable to work because of a catastrophic illness or injury,
				or who are absent due to catastrophic illness/injury within the employee's
				immediate family, established household, or in situations which place primary
				responsibility for care on the employee. "Family Medical Leave" (<A
				HREF="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/spp705-02.html">SPP 705-02</A>) is not
				additional leave, rather, it is to be used concurrently with Compassionate
				Leave. Conditions and procedures for compassionate leave transfer are
