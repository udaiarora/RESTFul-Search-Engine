<p><font face="Verdana">ASU Police Services Key Control handles all requests
for keys to ASU Main Campus buildings and is open from 8:00 AM to 4:30
PM, Monday through Friday (excluding University holidays).&nbsp; Police
Services works in conjunction with the Facilities Management Key Shop to
fill requests for keys.</font><font face="Verdana"></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Copies of the current Key Policy and Procedures,
the Key Action Form, and the Approval Authority Form may be obtained by
calling 965-6090. A copy of the Key Action Form can also be printed from
the ASU DPS web site at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/dps/police/konline.htm">http://www.asu.edu/dps/police/konline.htm</a>
The Key Policy is published in the <i>Department of Public Safety Policies
and Procedures Manual</i>, as <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/dps/dps206.html">DPS
206</a>, "Building Access Services."&nbsp; The normal procedure for requesting
ASU Main Campus keys is as follows:</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Verdana">Complete a Key Action Form. Make sure all information
is filled in correctly and that an Authorized Signer approves the request.
Instructions for completing the Key Action form are included on the back
side of the form.</font></li>

<br><font face="Verdana"></font>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Verdana">The original form must either be brought to the front
desk of the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/dps/police/map.htm">DPS Administration
Building</a> or be mailed to ASU DPS at mail code 0804.</font></li>

<br><font face="Verdana"></font>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Verdana">Forms that have been completed correctly will generally
be processed within two working days from the day the request is received.
For example, if Key Action Forms are received by Key Control on Monday
before 4:30 PM the key(s) will be ready after 10:00 AM on Wednesday of
the same week.</font></li>

<br><font face="Verdana"></font>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Verdana">The keyholder or their designee may pick up the requested
keys at the front desk of the DPS Administration Building, from 8:00 AM
to 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday. Anyone picking up keys must know for
whom and for what building the keys have been requested. Authorized pickup
persons must also present a valid form of picture identification upon request.</font></li>

<br><font face="Verdana"></font>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Verdana">All lost or stolen keys must be reported to ASU Police
Services within 24 hours of the discovery of their loss. Please call Key
Control at 965-6090 to file a loss or theft report during normal working
hours. Keyholders are responsible for all keys issued to them and will
be charged a fine if their keys are lost or stolen. Please refer to the

for more information.</font></li>

<br><font face="Verdana"></font>&nbsp;
