      <h2><strong>ASU among top institutions for Fulbrights; 8 students receive grants </strong> </h2>
      <p>With the announcement of eight student Fulbright award winners so far this spring, ASU is rolling toward another banner year for the prestigious awards. Last year a record 10 ASU students won Fulbrights for a year of graduate study and research abroad, landing ASU seventh in the nation among public schools and 20th overall. </p>
          <p>This year's Fulbright winners are Gabe Burnett, industrial engineering senior; Trevor Helminski, art history senior; Alan Fortuna, biology and society senior; Catherine Duquette, theatre graduate; Jessica Thompson, anthropology doctoral student; Wing-Yan Choi, finance senior; Daniel Allen, education graduate; and James Deyo, senior majoring in French, political science and management. </p>
          <p>Though they are the first ASU students to receive notification of their grants from the U.S. Student Fulbright Program so far this year, others may continue to be announced through the summer.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>Fulbright grant contestants apply for a particular country and find specialists who are willing to work with them on their chosen course of study. They receive full travel, living and academic expenses for an academic year. </p>
          <p>ASU students tend to have compelling, well thought-out project proposals, says Janet Burke, associate dean of the Barrett Honors College. Many are building on their bachelor's honors thesis, or their master's or Ph.D. projects. Other keys to their success are the mentoring and the overseas connections of ASU faculty. </p>
          <p>"ASU faculty members are remarkably well connected worldwide, and they are very willing to use their connections to secure important letters of affiliation from host countries," says Burke. "They also tend to work closely with students on their intellectual projects and to write strong, detailed letters of recommendation. </p>
          <p>"Also, the faculty campus committees that help me evaluate student applications are heroic in their work. They often spend hours reviewing applications and interviewing students. Often, these same professors invite individual applicants to work with them further, and they lend them books and put them in touch with persons who can help them even more." </p>
          <p>Burnett, 22, plans to study wind energy forecasting at the Technical University of Denmark, seeking to improve the viability of wind energy as a major electricity source. About 20 percent of Denmark's electricity is supplied by wind energy. </p>
          <p>Helminski and Fortuna, both 21, will study in Germany. Helminski will examine the avant-garde stage photography of Ruth Berlau as it existed within the political culture of post-war Germany. Fortuna plans to study the popularization of eugenics in 20 th century Germany, comparing it to the idea of eugenics in American society and the issues raised by human cloning and genetic modification. </p>
          <p>Duquette, 23, will travel to Spain to study Spanish surrealism within the context of theatrical performance theory. Deyo, a 42-year-old who returned to college three years ago after a career in the hospitality industry, will go to Romania as part of an international team to reform the university system as the country prepares to join the European Union. </p>
          <p>Choi, 21, will study the Hong Kong stock market in China, an extension of her honors thesis in the Barrett Honors College; Thompson, 25, will analyze fossil bones at Blombos Cave in South Africa; and Allen, 23, will study the privatization of public education in Brazil. </p>
          <p><em>Auffret, with Media Relations &amp; Public Information, can be reached at 480-965-6991 or (sauffret@asu.edu). </em></p>
