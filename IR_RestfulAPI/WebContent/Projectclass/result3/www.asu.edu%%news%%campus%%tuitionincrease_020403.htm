      <h2>ASU President Michael Crow makes tuition increase recommendation - Providing 
        quality education and increased access are first priorities </h2>
      <p>Arizona State University President Michael Crow announced today he is 
        recommending to the Arizona Board of Regents that state resident and nonresident 
        undergraduate students pay a $ 1,000 annual tuition increase (to $3,508 
        for residents and $12,028 for non-residents) for the 2003-04 academic 
        year. Crow also recommends resident and non-resident graduate students 
        pay an additional $1,200 annually for tuition. If the Board approves the 
        increase at its March 6-7 meeting, ASU's tuition level would remain in 
        the lower one-third of all U.S. public universities.<br>
        Crow said revenues generated from a tuition increase would substantially 
        improve the university's ability to provide financial aid, enhance the 
        student academic experience, and provide greater support for faculty.</p>
      <p>ASU's overarching goal is to provide access to as many academically qualified 
        students as possible, regardless of financial need, he says. Although 
        tuition at Arizona's state universities is currently ranked near the bottom 
        for large state universities in all 50 states, Arizona fairs poorly (46th) 
        when ranked for its accessibility because so little state financial assistance 
        is currently available for students. </p>
      <p>"Any tuition increase will be accompanied by a commensurate increase 
        in financial aid, which will make the state's universities more - rather 
        than less - affordable for the neediest families," said Crow. Approximately 
        44 percent of the revenue from a tuition increase will be returned to 
        students in financial aid assistance and the amount available for need-based 
        financial aid will more than double under this plan, he said. </p>
      <p>Providing the highest quality education to students is ASU's top priority. 
        Increasing tuition, which currently is $2,508 a year for undergraduate 
        Arizona students, will assist in achieving this goal since all additional 
        tuition revenue not going into financial aid will be used to enhance academic 
        programs and provide increased attention to student advising. </p>
      <p>"ASU recognizes the difficulty a tuition increase may impose on some 
        families, and the university is committed to do everything possible to 
        mitigate the effects by making more financial aid available, while improving 
        accessibility for students with unmet financial needs, as determined by 
        federal guidelines," Crow said.<br>
        Currently, tuition covers only a fraction of the university's cost of 
        educating a student. According to calculations by U.S. News &amp; World 
        Report, at ASU it costs $13,500 to educate each student. </p>
      <p>In addition to an increase in tuition, Dr. Crow is also recommending 
        the following increases in special program fees, and course fees:</p>
      <p>. Nursing 381 Nursing Practice I, $65/student <br>
        . Nursing 382 Nursing Practice II, $100/student<br>
        . Critical Languages Institute application fee, Summer Special Program, 
        $300/student</p>
      <p>Special fees for selected Undergraduate Professional Programs:</p>
      <p>. ASU College of Nursing upper division BSN degree students, $1,000 annual 
        program fee (contingent upon receiving grant funds to cover this fee).</p>
      <p>.ASU Main, W. P. Carey School of Business upper division student B.S. 
        students:<br>
        Fall and Spring $250/semester<br>
        Summer Sessions I and II, $125/session<br>
        Intersession/Winter Session, $70 </p>
      <p>Special fees for Selected Graduate Professional Programs 2003-04: (Note 
        these fees reflect enhanced services connected to these specialty degree 
        programs.)</p>
      <p>ASU Main College of Engineering and Applied Sciences: (resident and non-resident 
        students)</p>
      <p>. Graduate Professional Certificate and M.S.E. Distance Learning Programs 
        $569/credit hour<br>
        . Accelerated Weekend M.S.E. program and Accelerated Evening M.S.E. Programs, 
        $700/credit hour.<br>
        . Executive Master of Engineering Distance Learning Program , $850/credit 
        hour.</p>
      <p>Proposed Fee Ranges for Selected Graduate Professional Programs for 2003-2006<br>
        .Note: The proposed fees for MBA and JD students are being increased within 
        a range previously approved by the board. The fees will be presented to 
        the board for consideration at the April meeting.</p>
      <p>ASU Main W. P. Carey School of Business: <br>
        . New ONLINE MBA program, $15,000-$20,000/year ($17,000 for 2003-04)</p>
      <p>Other Fees:<br>
        . Application fee for resident undergraduates, $25/student<br>
        <br>
        Arizona state law requires that public university presidents announce 
        publicly the university's recommendations for tuition and fees for the 
        coming year at least ten days in advance of the Arizona Board of Regents 
        tuition hearing. The hearing, scheduled for 4:30-7 p.m., Feb. 27, will 
        be held statewide at 12 campus sites simultaneously, via interactive television. 
        The hearings will also be broadcast live on cable TV. Students and other 
        constituents are encouraged to attend and will have the opportunity to 
        share their comments with Regents. The ASU sites include the Main campus 
        W. P. Carey School of Business-C wing, room 328; the West campus Sands 
        Building, room 125; and East campus Academic Center, room 145. The hearing 
        will also be broadcast on Channel 61 and 13 respectively.</p>
      <p>During its March 6-7, 2003 meeting to be held at ASU, the board will 
        also set residence hall rates and mandatory fees. Graduate program fees 
        and other fees will be set during the board's April meeting in Tucson.
