      <p><font size="3"><strong>Professor receives honor for distributed computing work</strong></font></p>
      <p>        Personal digital assistants ride around Stephen Yau's laboratory strapped
      to remote-controlled toy monster trucks.</p>
      <p>They look like normal PDAs,
            but these personal digital assistants incorporate reconfigurable
        context-sensitive middleware. This software, in development
          in Yau's lab, allows the PDAs to do the right thing at the right time
          and at the right location while the PDAs' environments are dynamically
        changing.</p>
      <p>Designing this middleware is only the latest project in a long
          and productive career for which the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
          Engineers
          (IEEE) Computer Society has honored Yau, a computer science and engineering
          professor at ASU, with the Tsutomu Kanai Award. The award, named for
          the former president of Hitachi, recognizes an individual who has made
          a lasting contribution to the field of distributed computing. Yau has
        worked in the area for more than 30 years.</p>
      <p>"As distributed systems software
          became more important, I gradually switched my research into that area,"
          Yau said. "When you're working with an emerging
        technology, you can do a lot more."</p>
      <p>Distributed computing systems are
          comprised of multiple computing units interconnected by networks or
        data switches. Yau has worked to solve
          both practical and theoretical problems related to software design
        and development techniques in distributed computing systems. He used
        and
          advocated object-oriented design techniques before they were widely
        accepted and applied to software development, and his work led to practical
        and
          easy-to-use distributed software development methods that integrate
        software components from various sources.</p>
      <p>In addition, over the years Yau has mentored
          more than 90 Ph.D. students and more than 115 M.S. students; served
        as president of two professional
          organizations and editor-in-chief of Computer, the IEEE Computer Society's
          flagship publication; published more than 170 papers; and established
          three annual or biennial international conferences in the field of
        software and applications, especially for distributed computing systems.</p>
      <p>Yau has
          accomplished much of this while serving as an administrator as well
        as a researcher and educator. In 1972 he became chair of the computer
          sciences department at Northwestern University, which merged with the
          electrical engineering department during his tenure. He headed the
        computer
          and information sciences department at the University of Florida from
          1988 to 1994 before coming to ASU to chair the department of computer
        science and engineering, a position he resigned in 2001. </p>
      <p>"Now I have
          more time for research and other scholarly activities," Yau said. "Usually
          once people are in administration, their research slows
          down or they give it up. Instead, I put in overtime so that I could
        still push forward on research, mentor students and play various leading
        roles
        in professional activities. Some might call me a workaholic."</p>
      <p>Yau was
          presented with the Tsutomu Kanai Award, which includes a $10,000 honorarium,
          at the International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized
        Systems April 9 - 11 in Italy. </p>
