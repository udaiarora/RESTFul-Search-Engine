<p>George Sand, pseudonym of Aurore Dudevant, was the most famous woman writer
in 19th-century France. A prolific writer of novels, stories, plays, essays,
and memoirs, she represented the epitome of French romantic idealism and unconventional
iconoclasm to the whole of Europe, including Russia. </p>

<p>Born Amantine Aurore Lucile Dupin, July 1, 1804, she was married at 18 to
Baron Casimir Dudevant and had two children. Profoundly unhappy in the
marriage, she left her husband, established herself in Paris with another man
in 1831, and out of financial necessity began writing. Her first independent
novel, Indiana (1832; Eng. trans., 1978), the story of an unhappy wife who
struggles to free herself from the imprisonment of marriage, explicitly called
a form of slavery, made her an overnight celebrity. Subsequent novels, such as
Valentine (1832; Eng. trans., 1978) and, most notably, Lelia (1833; Eng.
trans., 1978), astounded her readers with their frank exploration of women's
sexual feelings and their passionate call for women's freedom to find emotional
satisfaction. Sand never advocated &quot;free love&quot; but remained an
idealist, exalting the idea of marriage between equals and condemning the
social system of male dominance that made such marriages impossible. Legally
separated from her husband in1836, she kept up a furious pace of literary
composition throughout her life to support herself and her children. Her
reputation for iconoclasm grew not only from the themes of her novels but from
exaggerated reports of her unconventional behavior: her occasionally masculine
clothing, her habitual smoking, and her series of love affairs with such
well-known artists as Alfred de Musset and Frederic Chopin. </p>

<p>Beginning in the late 1830s, Sand turned to a new arena of controversy,
writing didactic novels that advocated a mystical Christian socialism. Books
such as The Companion of the Tour of France (1840; Eng. trans., 1976) and
Horace (1841) idealized working-class characters and denounced bourgeois
materialism. Staunchly republican in her sympathies, she not only wrote novels
that helped to spread revolutionary French ideas throughout Europe, but was
actively involved as a political pamphleteer during the uprisings of 1848 that
toppled the French monarchy and established the short-lived Second Republic.
Disillusioned by the return to authoritarian rule under Napoleon III, however,
she withdrew from politics to her country estate at Nohant, thereafter
confining herself to a purely literary advocacy of nonviolent revolution. </p>

<p>Sand's important work of this period also includes her most ambitious novel,
Consuelo (1842; Eng. trans., 1846), and its sequel, The Countess of Rudolstadt
(1843; Eng. trans., 1870), with an artist heroine; successful plays; and such
pastoral novels as The Haunted Pool (1846; Eng. trans., 1976), The Country Waif
(1847; Eng. trans., 1976), and Fanchon the Cricket (1848; Eng. trans., 1977),
now her most widely read works. Her letters and journals have also been
published in English. In the eyes of many critics her masterpieces are her
autobiography, Histoire de ma vie (Story of My Life, 1854-55), and a series of
descriptive, meditative travel essays, Lettres d'un voyageur (Letters of a
Traveler, 1834-36). Sand also provided an inspiring model of the independent
woman writer for such Englishwomen as Elizabeth Barrett Browning and George
Eliot. After her death on June 8, 1876, her stature was recognized in tributes
by such literary masters as Turgenev and Flaubert. </p>
