       Dear ASU Student,<br />
       <br />
       You are receiving this notice because you have indicated that you would like to work and earn the amount of your Federal Work-Study (FWS) award during the upcoming academic year. You can use your award to apply for on or off-campus jobs advertised under the Work-Study program. These include Community Service and America Reads positions. </p>
     <p>New FWS jobs are posted daily on our Web site at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/fa/employment">www.asu.edu/fa/employment</a>. A job search menu allows you to select jobs by job type, category, location and more. Select the jobs of interest to you and contact the employer directly by following the instructions listed on the job posting. Employers currently looking for student workers include the Student Financial Assistance office, America Reads/Counts program, Jumpstart, as well as several academic departments and off-campus agencies. Once you are hired in a FWS position, you may start working on the first day of classes (August 21, 2006) or later. You may earn your FWS award amount during the entire academic year (August 21, 2006 - May 11, 2007).</p>
     <p>Remember that FWS is disbursed in bi-weekly paychecks for hours actually worked. Therefore it will not pay your university charges. The program is federally funded and is subject to the availability of funds. </p>
     <p>Another great opportunity to find part-time, on-campus employment is to attend an <strong>ASU Student Employment Job Fair</strong>. Here you can meet directly with on-campus employers, complete applications and discuss their job openings. Dates and locations are as follows:</p>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>Friday, August 18, 2 â?? 4 p.m.</strong> <br />
         <strong><a href="http://www.asu.edu/map/c2.html">Student Recreation Center</a> </strong>at the <strong>Tempe </strong>campus<br />
         <strong><a href="http://www.asu.edu/tour/downtown/rescomm.html">Residential Commons Multipurpose Room</a> </strong>at the <strong>Downtown Phoenix </strong>campus</li>
     <li><strong>Tuesday, August 22, 11 a.m. - 1 p.m.<br />
       <a href="http://www.asu.edu/map/polytechnic/p_a2.html">Student Union</a> </strong>at the <strong>Polytechnic </strong>campus</li>
     </ul>
     <p>ASU departments employ more than 7,000 students in jobs ranging from Library and Office Assistants to Lab Aides, Lifeguards and more. Working on campus is a great option since university employers are often more flexible about scheduling your work hours around your classes and travel time is seldom a problem. As a reminder, money earned is a resource for meeting your educational expenses and therefore money you don't have to borrow and repay later. In addition, when you complete your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the following year, you can deduct your Work-Study earnings from your reported income (Worksheet C). FWS earnings are treated as financial aid on this form and are not considered income when calculating the Expected Family Contribution (EFC).</p>
     <p>We are happy to welcome you to ASU and hope that your Work-Study experience is a successful and rewarding one. If you have any questions, please call our office at (480) 965-5186 or visit one of our<a href="http://www.asu.edu/fa/contact/"> locations</a>.</p>
     <p>Sincerely, </p>
     <p>Arizona State University<br />
Student Financial Assistance/Student Employment</p>
