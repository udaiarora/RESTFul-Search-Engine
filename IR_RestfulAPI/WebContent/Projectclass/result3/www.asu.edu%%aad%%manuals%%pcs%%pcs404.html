If the vehicle is not identified or tagged within two weeks, the department should contact Property Control.<p>The ASU PC&#035; is affixed inside the driver side door or other visible locations.  Vehicles are permanently identified by scribing the ASU PC&#035; on the passenger side of the vehicle.<p><b>Retagging Vehicles</b><p>Vehicles costing more than &#036;5,000 shall remain identified as university- or sponsor-owned equipment as long as they are owned by or otherwise in the custody, possession, or control of the university.  Such marking and identification are removed or obliterated from a vehicle only when sold, disposed of, or scrapped.  Should the ASU PC&#035; number be accidentally or mistakenly obliterated, defaced, or removed, the vehicle is retagged using the identical ASU PC&#035;.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Tagging Vehicles Costing Less than &#036;5,000</b></font><p>Property Control does not identify or tag vehicles with an acquisition cost of less than &#036;5,000. If the department has an interest in identifying and tagging vehicles costing less than &#036;5,000, the department may use identification labels available from ASU Property Control. Also, the department may use Property Control&#146;s Web site to add noncapital property to the database.
