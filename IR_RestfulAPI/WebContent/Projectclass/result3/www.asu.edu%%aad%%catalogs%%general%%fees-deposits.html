Students may enroll in the tuition installment plan over the phone using SunDial, on the Internet through ASU Interactive, in person, and by mail. Students must reenroll in the plan each semester.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1762848"></a>All students are eligible to enroll in the plan after they register for classes. If students receiving financial aid choose to enroll in the plan, all tuition charges are paid by financial aid and any remaining financial aid is refunded to the student. Students with financial aid continue to have the option to hold their classes at no extra cost rather than enrolling in the plan. </p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1762849"></a>Upon enrollment in the plan, tuition is billed in three installments on the Student Account Receivable System. For example, for the fall semester, the first billing statement is mailed in early August, with tuition due on August 25, September 25, and October 25.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1762850"></a>Students are charged a per semester administrative fee to cover costs associated with enrollment in the plan. The fee is billed on the Student Account Receivable System and is due at the same time as the first installment. The fee is nonrefundable, even if students withdraw from classes. The per semester enrollment fee is $75.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1762851"></a>Once a student enrolls in the plan for a given semester, he or she is not withdrawn from classes during the current semester. Students must withdraw from classes if they decide not to attend. If students enrolled in the plan do not make scheduled payments, the students are prohibited from registering for classes in future semesters and are blocked from receiving university services, such as transcripts. Former students with outstanding tuition charges are referred to an outside collection agency.</p><p class="FM-B-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1762854"></a><a name="marker-1762852"></a><a name="21832"></a>OTHER FEES, DEPOSITS, AND CHARGES</p></div><div><h6 class="FM-D-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1762857"></a><a name="marker-1762855"></a>Class <a name="marker-1762856"></a>Fees and Deposits</h6><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1762858"></a>Certain university classes require payment of fees or deposits for materials, breakage, and rentals.

The following is a summary of the general guidelines used to determine residency for tuition purposes. All of the evidence is weighed under the presumption that a nonresident student&#8217;s presence in Arizona is primarily for the purpose of education and not to establish domicile and that decisions of an individual about the intent to establish domicile are generally made after the completion of an education and not before.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1763587"></a>To obtain resident status for tuition purposes, independent students must establish their residence in Arizona at least one year before the last day of regular registration for the semester in which they propose to attend ASU. Arizona residence is generally established when individuals are physically present in the state with the intention of making Arizona their permanent home.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1763588"></a>Mere physical presence in Arizona for one year does not automatically establish residency for tuition purposes. Adult students and emancipated minors must combine physical presence in Arizona for one year with objective evidence of their intent to make Arizona their permanent home. If these steps are delayed, the one-year period is extended until both presence and intent have been demonstrated for one full year. In addition to physical presence and intent, the student must demonstrate financial independence for the two tax years immediately preceding the request for resident classification. The student must demonstrate objective evidence of self-support and that he or she was not claimed as an income tax deduction by his or her parents or any other individual for two years. An adult student is defined as being at least 18 years of age at the beginning of the domicile year. For a complete definition of an emancipated minor, refer to the Arizona Board of Regents&#8217; residency classification policies, available in the Residency Classification section, SSV 140.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1763589"></a>No person is considered to have gained or lost resident status merely by attending an out-of-state educational institution.</p></div><div><h6 class="FM-D-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1763590"></a>Aliens</h6><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1763591"></a>Students who are aliens are subject to the same requirements for resident status as are U.S. citizens.

If military service is concluded while enrolled, students do not lose resident status while they are continuously enrolled in a degree program.

This procedure requires students to complete <br>and file an Arizona residency information form. This form is required of all new and returning students as part of the admission or readmission process. Students classified as nonresidents who believe they may qualify for resident status must file a petition with the Residency Classification section. This petition must be filed by the last day of regular registration. A student seeking resident status must also file supporting documentation necessary to provide a basis for residency classification (source[s] of support, driver&#8217;s license, voter&#8217;s registration, vehicle registration, etc.). Students whose residency petitions are in process at the fee payment deadline are responsible for paying nonresident tuition. However, an appropriate refund is issued if resident status is later granted for that semester.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1763615"></a>Any student found to have made a false or misleading statement concerning resident status is subject to dismissal from the university.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1763616"></a>Failure to file a timely written petition for reclassification of resident status for tuition purposes constitutes a waiver of the student&#8217;s right to apply for the given semester.
