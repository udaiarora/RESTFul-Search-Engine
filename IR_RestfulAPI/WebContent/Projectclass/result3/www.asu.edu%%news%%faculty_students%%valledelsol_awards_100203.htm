      <h2>Duarte, Molina earn honors from Hispanic group</h2>
      <p>        Hispanics at ASU are achieving success in a variety of ways.
        Stella Pope Duarte and John Molina, M. D., are just two of the 10 individuals
        who
          were honored at Valle del Sol's 13th Annual Profiles of Success Hispanic
        Leadership Awards Luncheon, Sept. 5.</p>
      <p>Valle del Sol, a local non-profit
          community-based organization serving the Valley for more than 33 years,
          presented Duarte with the Latino Excellence
          in Arts/Culture Award and Molina with the Rosa Carrillo Torres Humanitarian
          Award.</p>
      <p>Duarte was born and raised in Phoenix and began her literary career
          in 1995 after she had a dream in which her departed father told her
        that her destiny was to become a writer. A year later, Duarte signed
        her first
          book contract with Bilingual Review Press for her initial collection
          of short stories, "Fragile Night." For this collection, she won a creative
          writing fellowship from the Arizona Commission on the Arts and was
        named a candidate for the prestigious Pen West Fiction Award.</p>
      <p>Duarte, who has
          been an adjunct professor of education for more than 10 years at ASU,
          says writing has been her creative outlet of expression
          and communication about the Hispanic culture and people. Building awareness
          of the Hispanic population is something she is passionate about.</p>
      <p>"There
          is a huge voice out there, which is the Hispanic voice, and they are
          taking their position in leadership roles and becoming the movers
          and shakers," Duarte says. "Now the media has to look at them with
        a different eye, not just the tragic stories or stories about their failures."</p>
      <p>In
          2001, Duarte was awarded a second creative writing fellowship for her
          recent novel, "Let Their Spirits Dance." The novel portrays a Chicano
          family from Phoenix who journeys to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington,
          D.C., to fulfill the mother's promise to touch her son's name on the
          memorial wall before she departs this life. For her work, Duarte won
          first place in the 17th Annual Arizona Author's Literary contest. She
          also won second place in the River City Writing Awards from the University
          of Memphis and has been short-listed in the Fish Anthology in Ireland.
          This year, Duarte will receive the Fiction Award for her book by Arizona
          Highways.</p>
      <p>Duarte earned an associate degree from Phoenix College and a
          bachelor's degree in education and masters in educational counseling
          from ASU. </p>
      <p>Molina
          is a physician and founder of Las Fuentes, a health care clinic in
        Guadalupe, where he grew up. He earned a bachelor's degree in psychology
          from ASU, a medical degree from the University of Arizona, did his
        residency
          in OB/GYN and is currently a third-year law student at ASU's College
          of Law. Achieving his dreams is something Molina has managed to do
        with the help of his community.</p>
      <p>"What has and continues to motivate me are
          the lives of the people I see around me," he says. "My mission to complete
          medical school was triggered
          in the 80s, when I saw the suffering of the people in my community,
        who were seeking health care they could afford. Community support is
        what
          moved me through this whole process."</p>
      <p>Through ASU's College of Law, Molina
          says he has gained a deeper appreciation for the diversity of the law
          program.</p>
      <p>"It's amazing to hear different
          perspectives about the law," says Molina, who is part Native American
          and Mexican American. </p>
      <p>Molina, who plans to
          receive his law degree in December 2004, says he would like to work
        as a consultant for non-profit health care clinics,
          developing programs and working with risk management. In addition,
        Molina has one more dream he would like to pursue.</p>
      <p>"I've decided to run for governor
          in 2006," says Molina, who plans to begin campaigning after he finishes
          law school. "The position of governor
          is such an important position that affects the quality of life for
        people and the state. I figure learning about the law is the first step
        to achieving
        this."</p>
