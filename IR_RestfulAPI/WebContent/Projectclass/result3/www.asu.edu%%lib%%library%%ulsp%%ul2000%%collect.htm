				  <h2>I. Alternative Access</h2>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Organize the Libraries for the selection, procurement, and delivery of electronic resources, including methods such as digitized text and images.<br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The Libraries have not yet organized effectively for this programmatic initiative: a fresh, high-profile approach is needed at this time.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Immediate implementation.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Increase in external/internal customer satisfaction with the ease and timeliness of identifying and procuring electronic resources, as measured by reduced complaints and positive survey results. Increase in the number of electronic resources, digitized text and images will be one output indicator of probable success.</li><br><br>
				  
				  </ul>
				  			</li>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Conduct a thorough process analysis of the Libraries' document delivery service and statistical information needs, with the goal of building upon and improving our current program. Combine Interlibrary Loan and document delivery services to provide transparent access, or a single "front door" for customers seeking resources not owned by ASU.<br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The Libraries' decisive shift toward document delivery in lieu of ownership requires a service that is user-friendly and timely, as well as one that provides the statistical information necessary for collection management in an access mode. The service as presently constituted, in spite of committed effort, has not been as effective as it needs to be. This is especially critical in view of the implicit promises made to customers when we shift toward more access, less ownership.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Immediate implementation.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Increase of customer satisfaction with document delivery and Interlibrary Loan Services as measured by reduced complaints and positive survey results. Increase in the use of these services and the number and scope of customers using these services will be key output indicators.</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
				  			</li>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Develop a written collection development policy that favors acquisition of electronic publications, databases, and other products that meet established compatibility standards that maximize system inter-operability and ease of use by library users. The policy should also include a statement that describes the circumstances under which the Libraries will acquire products that do not support this inter-operability.<br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Seamless access is absolutely dependent on the development of such compliance standards.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Written policy in place by January, 1997.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Customers report that their time searching through the Libraries' databases is utilized more effectively, that they spend less time looking for the correct terminal and, instead, are able to concentrate their efforts on the topic of their research.</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
				  		</li>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Empower ASU representatives to the Arizona Universities Library Council's Collection Development Group to make resource sharing decisions that will promote the sharing of human and intellectual resources among the state's university libraries.<br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Until now, the ASU has not been a decisive player in the shared collections aspect of this consortium, which has excellent potential for mutual benefit in provision of information resources.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 3:</strong> Immediate implementation.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Increase in the number of client resource needs met from AULC Libraries in a more timely fashion than from other sources. Increase in the number of consortial agreements among AULC libraries related to identification and acquisitions of, and access to, resources will be a key output indicator.</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
				  		</li>
				  </ul><br>
				  <h2>II. Setting Priorities, Maximizing Value In The Collections Program</h2>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Appoint and empower a collections related group to identify and prioritize statistical and management information needs, including information about the physical collection, alternative access methods, and customer needs.<br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> A unified approach is needed throughout the libraries; such data are critically important in making budgetary decisions that maintain customer service at acceptable levels.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 2:</strong> Immediate implementation. Begin regular data collection as soon as the new system is implemented -- sooner for data that is not system-dependent.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Customer collections needs are met in a more responsive, timely manner. Increase in the availability of useful, timely, convenient statistical/management information will be a key output factor.</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
				  		</li>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Redesign the budget allocation process and the fund structure within the new automated system; longer planning cycles should be part of this redesign.<br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> With collections buying power declining year by year, the currently inflexible system must be made more responsive to a constantly changing environment.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 2:</strong> Completely changed fund structure, planning schedule, should be implemented as soon as possible and no later than July, 1998.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Customer needs met in a more flexible manner.</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
				  		</li>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Increase the flexibility of selection by the use of strategies such as selection teams with broader assignments. At the same time, retain the current number of selection hours. Both this and the previous strategy require redesign of the present allocation system.<br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Flexibility in allocation processes must be matched by new patterns of collaborative practice among selectors.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 2:</strong> Immediate implementation with pilot team.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Customer needs met in more flexible manner.</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
				  		</li>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Expand efforts to gather information about University program planning and priorities and seek more effective uses for current information, as well as new sources of information (example: the academic Deans).<br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Though excellent progress has been made in recent years in garnering critically useful information from the campus, as economic problems increase, more difficult decisions must be made. This recommendation builds on a solid beginning.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 4:</strong> Immediate implementation.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Customers satisfied by decisions that are more consistent with University priorities.</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
				  		</li>
				  </ul>
				  <h2>III. Refining The Conservation/Preservation Program</h2>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Acquire the appropriate expertise to manage the Libraries' conservation/preservation program.<br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> This critically important program has been without appropriate leadership for too long. </li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 3:</strong> As soon as possible.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Customers have better access to library materials as a result of the reduction of preservation backlogs, more timely return of treated materials to shelves.</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
				  		</li>
				  <li>Strategy: Write a comprehensive preservation and disaster plan that includes prioritization of what gets preserved, how to stabilize the physical environment, etc.<br><br>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> With limited resources, guidance is needed in making choices within the preservation effort.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Priority 3:</strong> As soon as possible; document completed by January, 1997.</li><br><br>
				  <li><strong>Performance Outcome Measure:</strong> Long term outcome will be access to preserved materials by future generations of customers.</li><br><br>
				  </ul>
