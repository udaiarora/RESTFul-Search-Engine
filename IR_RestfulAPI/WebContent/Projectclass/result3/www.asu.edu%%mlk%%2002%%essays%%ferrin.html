      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom is always out helping others.  One time she gave a lady some money just because she was a poor lady out on the streets gathering cans for money.  One time she saw a man with a shirt that said, "I am poor and hungry," and she went and got a cheeseburger for him.  Her name is Jenni.  She is always trying to set an example, too.
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so thankful for her and everyone else in my family.  I love everyone in my family.  Everyone is looking out for each other.
