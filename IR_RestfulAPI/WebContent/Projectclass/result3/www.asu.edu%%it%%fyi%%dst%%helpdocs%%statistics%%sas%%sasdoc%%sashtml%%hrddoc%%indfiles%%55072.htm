A Step-by-Step Approach to Using the SAS System for Univariate and Multivariate Statistics
</H1><P>
<I>by Dr. Larry Hatcher and Dr. Edward J. Stepanski</I><P>
A user-friendly guide beneficial to both researchers and students of the   social sciences, this book provides a very comprehensive introduction of
the SAS System and elementary statistical procedures. Step by step, this   book guides beginners through the basic concepts of research and data
analysis, to data input and on to ANOVA and MANOVA. The more advanced      researchers will find the presentation of sophisticated statistical
procedures invaluable. With this book you will learn to write SAS          programs, interpret results, perform statistical analyses without a
broad mathematics background, and summarize results in American            Psychological Association format.
