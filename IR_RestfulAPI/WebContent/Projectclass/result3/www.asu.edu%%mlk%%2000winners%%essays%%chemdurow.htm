        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Another Hero</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I met a hero last 
        year, quite by chance. I hadn't intended to find such a person the weekend 
        I visited my sister at her University. However, amidst the hugs and the 
        chatter about college life entered a most extraordinary person. His name 
        is Mike Cottingham.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I was taken aback 
        when Mike came into my sister's dorm room, laughing and eager to make 
        plans for a fun night out. Mike was in a wheelchair, and at first I was 
        a bit hesitant around him. He immediately put me at ease with his wit 
        and self-effacing humor. I learned that Mike has always lived in a wheelchair. 
        Some people might use such a disability as an excuse for being unsuccessful, 
        just like some people might use the color of their skin or their economic 
        status to excuse their shortcomings. Mike didn't. The university offered 
        Mike a scholarship not only because of his academic excellence but also 
        because of his extensive volunteer work. Mike works for free, helping 
        kids cope with disabilities. He works with them at sports camps, teaching 
        wheelchair basketball and tennis. Mike spends each summer traveling throughout 
        the United States volunteering for handicapped kids. He counsels them, 
        is a friend to them, and teaches them what you look like does not make 
        a difference in the kind of person you are.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Mike views his handicap 
        as an opportunity to help others. He is proud of who he is. Mike taught 
        me that what you look like should never make you feel inferior. Just like 
        Martin Luther King, Mike helps everyone see that what matters most of 
        all is following your dreams and treating people with kindness. He is 
        a hero.</font></p>
