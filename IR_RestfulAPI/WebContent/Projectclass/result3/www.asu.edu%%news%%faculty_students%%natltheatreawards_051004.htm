      <h2 align="left"><strong>ASU Herberger College theatre students win national awards </strong></h2>
      <p>TEMPE, Ariz. - Three theatre students from the Herberger College of Fine Arts at Arizona State University have been honored with national awards for their work, from playwriting to set design. </p>
      <p>Katherina Hantke, a master of fine arts student in scenography, won the prestigious Barbizon Award for Theatrical Design Excellence in set design at the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival in Washington, D.C. </p>
      <p>Hantke, an international student originally from Chile, was selected from among eight regions representing the U.S. and Puerto Rico and won for the <em> Our Town </em> and <em> subUrbia </em> sets she designed for the ASU Herberger Mainstage Season. She was awarded a $500 honorarium and an all-expense paid trip to New York to visit the designers at Barbizon, Inc., a theatrical lighting company.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>"I am very proud to have represented our school and especially my mentors at this important competition," said Hantke. </p>
      <p>Hantke has a dance background and has been studying scenography at the Herberger College for two years, with four productions to her credit.&nbsp; Her set design for ASU's 2002 production of <em>Heat </em> was a finalist in the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival's regional competition last year. </p>
      <p>Kristyn Benedyk, a master of fine arts student in playwriting, was one of two ASU students to win the PEO (Providing Educational Opportunities for Women) Scholar Award.&nbsp; Benedyk will receive a one-time gift of $10,000 to help fund professional development activities that include attending a Kennedy Center Playwriting Intensive and the World Interplay Playwrights Conference in Australia next year.&nbsp; She was one of 80 winners chosen from thousands of applicants.&nbsp; The PEO award is for women who are pursuing advanced degrees or are engaged in advanced study and research at an accredited institution. </p>
      <p>"The first person I contacted about the scholarship said the awards go mainly to Ph.D. students and asked me if I still wanted to proceed," said Benedyk. "I'm sure glad that I did!" </p>
      <p>Benedyk has written 10 plays.&nbsp; Her thesis play, <em>Stolen Children</em>, is a harrowing tale from the history of early Arizona, when orphans were shipped from New York to local homes and racial turmoil erupted between Anglo and Mexican families.&nbsp; The play will be presented during the ASU Herberger Mainstage New Plays Festival next April.&nbsp; One of Benedyk's other plays, <em>Wild Mustangs</em>, recently won fourth place in the University of Tulsa New Works for Women Playwriting Contest. </p>
      <p>Another successful Herberger College playwriting graduate student, James E. Garcia, just received word from ASU Public Events that it will commission him to write a new play about Hispanic World War II veterans. The play will be produced as part of ASU Public Events' 2005 Beyond Broadway season.&nbsp; It is the first time that Public Events has commissioned a college student to write a work for its performance season. </p>
      <p>"This is a play about the realities of war and the impact on the development of what became the nation's largest minority group" said Garcia. "World War II not only changed the global landscape, but altered the social, political and economic destiny of Hispanics in the United States." </p>
      <p>Garcia's most recent play <em>American Latino Redux </em> just ended a successful run during ASU's New Plays Festival.&nbsp; Last year, his 10-minute play <em>The Crossing </em> won first place at the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival. </p>
      <p>Garcia will develop the new play in collaboration with the University of Texas at Austin College of Fine Arts, University of Texas at Austin Performing Arts Center and Colores Actors-Writers Workshop in Phoenix.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>"We are proud of these students' creativity and hard work, and congratulate them on their recent awards," said Margaret Knapp, interim chair for the Department of Theatre. "Their dedication and collaborative spirit is what makes our department a unique place to study and prepare for a career in theatre." </p>
      <p>The Department of Theatre in the Herberger College of Fine Arts at ASU provides a comprehensive range of courses in performance; directing and stage management; scenography; playwriting; history, theory and criticism; film studies; and theatre for youth. Its Theatre for Youth program is nationally ranked in the top 3 and its creative writing/playwriting program is ranked 15 th among public institutions by <em>U.S.News &amp; World Report. </em> To learn more about the Department of Theatre, visit <a href="http://theatre.asu.edu">http://theatre.asu.edu </a>. </p>
