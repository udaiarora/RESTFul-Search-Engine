<P><A NAME="idxtf90155">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf90156">&#13;</A>This section describes the diagnostic tests
used to determine the kinds of forecasting models 
appropriate for a series.
<P>The series diagnostics are a set of heuristics that provide
recommendations on
whether or not the forecasting model should contain a
log transform, trend terms, and seasonal terms.
These recommendations are used by the automatic model selection
process to restrict the model search to a subset
of the model selection list.
(You can disable this behavior using the 
Automatic Model Selection Options window.)
<P>The tests used by the series diagnostics will not always 
produce the correct classification of the series.
They are intended to accelerate the process of searching
for a good forecasting model for the series,
but you should not rely on them if finding the very best 
model is important to you.
<P>If you have information about the appropriate kinds 
of forecasting model
(perhaps from studying the plots and autocorrelations shown
in the Series Viewer window),
you can set the series diagnostic flags 
in the Series Diagnostics window.
Select the &#34;YES&#34;, &#34;NO&#34;, or &#34;MAYBE&#34; values for the
<TT>Log Transform,</TT> <TT>Trend,</TT> and <TT>Seasonality</TT> options 
in the Series Diagnostics window as you think appropriate.
<P>The series diagnostics tests are intended as a heuristic tool
only, and no statistical validity is claimed for them.
These tests may be modified and enhanced in future releases
of the Time Series Forecasting System.
The testing strategy is as follows:
<P><OL>
<LI> <B>Log transform test.</B>
<A NAME="idxtf90151">&#13;</A>The log test fits a high order autoregressive model 
to the series and to the log of the series and compares
goodness-of-fit measures for the prediction errors of the 
two models.
If this test finds that log transforming the series is suitable,
the <TT>Log Transform</TT> option is set to &#34;YES,&#34;
and the subsequent diagnostic tests are performed
on the log transformed series.
<LI> <B>Trend test.</B>
<A NAME="idxtf90152">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf90153">&#13;</A>The resultant series is tested for presence of a trend
using an augmented Dickey-Fuller test and
a random walk with drift test.
If either test finds that the series appears to have a trend,
the <TT>Trend</TT> option is set to &#34;YES,&#34;
and the subsequent diagnostic tests are performed
on the differenced series.
<LI> <B>Seasonality test.</B>
<A NAME="idxtf90154">&#13;</A>The resultant series is tested for seasonality.
A seasonal dummy model with AR(1) errors is fit and the 
joint significance of the seasonal dummy estimates is tested.
If the seasonal dummies are significant,
the AIC statistic for this model is compared to the AIC for
and AR(1) model without seasonal dummies.
If the AIC for the seasonal model is lower than that of the 
non-seasonal model, the <TT>Seasonal</TT> option is set to &#34;YES&#34;.
