                        Symposium </h2>
                        <p>University of Texas, Austin<br>
                        January 29-30, 2004 </p>
                        <p><strong>Remarks by President Michael M. Crow</strong> </p>
                        <p>I am very honored to have been invited to speak here
                          today.  Let me begin by offering some perspective
                          about ASU and its demographic context.  ASU is
                          the only public university in a city with a population
                          of 3.5 million that is projected to grow to about 10
                          million in the next four decades.  Within the
                          next eight years, metropolitan Phoenix will have no
                          majority population whatsoever.  Our institution,
                          however, remains approximately 75 percent white and
                          25 percent or less non-white in its student body population.  We
                          have a tremendous amount of work to do in this context,
                          and we are engaged in this work on the front lines.  </p>
                        <p>I thought that today I would not talk about that front
                          line engagement, but about the complexity of the task
                          before us.  Because I will say to you now, and
                          defend my statement later, that the mere attainment
                          of mathematical diversification of student body numbers
                          is not the attainment of diversification of education
                          in the United States.  </p>
                        <p>In 1954 our society and institutions were not open.  The
                          very concept of diversity was understood by only a
                          few.  Universities were not leading centers for
                          social change and diversification.  At the time,
                          in fact, our nation's universities were mirrors of
                          the rest of society, if not actual leading centers
                          defending the lack of diversification.  Universities,
                          in fact, maintained their core cultures unaltered despite
                          all that was going on around them. </p>
                        <p>Fifty years later&mdash;now, 2004&mdash;our institutions
                          are opening slowly. The numbers are changing. But
                          the core culture of universities is not changing. 
                          The concept of diversity is well understood by most,
                          but poorly implemented. Universities are bellwether
                          institutions&mdash;they have changed to some extent and accomplished
                          much, but academic culture remains fundamentally unaltered.
                          Universities are still very much institutions in which
                          change is occurring at the margins, with the old academic
                          culture maintained at the core, and people of all backgrounds
                          moving through that core in the same way.  </p>
                        <p>Fifty years is just a few days in the life of a university
                          because universities&mdash;this thousand-year-old institutional
                          form&mdash;change very slowly.  So it is not unrealistic
                          to start thinking about what change we want 50 years
                          from now.  In 2054 the very concept of diversity
                          will change as we become a nation with no majority
                          population.  In 2054, with no majority population,
                          we will be able to label ourselves nothing other than
                          what Governor Wilder has suggested&mdash;all of us
                          Americans, with no other label. We will be living in
                          a post-dominant-culture America. Hallelujah: &nbsp; no
                          dominant culture. </p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, universities are not evolving quickly
                          enough to meet the challenges of this post-dominant-culture
                          America.  Universities are, in fact, in many
                          ways the keepers of the keys&mdash;in control of many
                          of the variables that maintain certain elements of
                          the existing dominant culture. Inside our academic
                          institutions, our university culture itself remains
                          elitist, European in origin and cultural centrism,
                          exclusive, incomplete, slow to change, and not adaptable.
                          Of course, there are certainly meaningful exceptions
                          to this. </p>
                        <p>In my mind, we have to find ways to reconsider the
                          very design of our institutions to truly educate for
                          a diverse America.  Because, again, to be diverse
                          is not only a function of the numbers.  It is
                          time for us to design universities that can do the
                          following kinds of things&mdash;and I know that many of us
                          try to do this, but it is not a central part of the
                          design of our institutions. </p>
                        <p>We must find ways to reach into all our communities
                          with warmth and openness.  One of the things
                          I have learned in Arizona is that we send out a lot
                          of signals that are not necessarily received warmly.
                          We are not reaching across ethnic boundaries with our
                          signal strength&mdash;at least not at ASU.  We have
                          not figured out how to do this. </p>
                        <p>We have to learn how to communicate and teach between
                          all ethnic and cultural perspectives.  Not with
                          a dominant cultural perspective and marginal alternative
                          cultural perspectives, but across all of these.  We
                          have not figured out how to do this yet. </p>
                        <p>We have to move past the Eurocentric philosophical
                          focus of the university.  That is the same philosophical
                          focus that enabled the climate in which segregation
                          and apartheid exist.  Therefore there are clearly
                          some limits to that philosophical focus, and it cannot
                          be our only guiding frame.  We have to move past
                          that and replace it with an American philosophical
                          focus. </p>
                        <p>We have to move our universities&mdash;our educational enterprises-to
                          new measures of success.  Test scores reveal
                          but little.  We need to look at things like transforming
                          our community.  What has been the impact of our
                          institutions in the communities we are charged with
                          serving? &nbsp; What is the product of our university? &nbsp; We
                          must not only consider the quality of students admitted
                          to the university as the sole measure of success of
                          the institution. </p>
                        <p>We have to accelerate our academic cultural transformation
                          in every discipline, not just cultural disciplines,
                          not just ethnically oriented disciplines, but every
                          discipline&mdash;civil engineering, for example. </p>
                        <p>Where are we? &nbsp; We are moving too slowly.  We
                          are unable to see the cultural box in which the university
                          is presently trapped.  We need to embrace cultural
                          diversification in America and change the culture of
                          the university itself as a critical first step.  </p>
                        <p>At the end of the day&mdash;a thousand years after
                          the formation of this institutional model&mdash;how can we
                          still look, smell, and feel like Oxford and Cambridge
                          and other institutions that we hold in such high esteem,
                          when those institutions themselves have not embraced
                          all that we are addressing here? At ASU we see ourselves
                          as an institution redesigning itself into a new kind
                          of American university.  We will probably take
                          the label that Governor Wilder has suggested to us&mdash;&ldquo;Americans
                          First&rdquo;&mdash;and strive to create a uniquely
                          American institution, with all that we represent, setting
                          new standards, moving in new directions, and redefining
                          what education and diversity are all about. </p>
