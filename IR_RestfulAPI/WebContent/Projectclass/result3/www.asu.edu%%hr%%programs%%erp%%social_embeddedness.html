Social Embeddedness at ASU is a university-wide, interactive, and mutually-supportive partnership with the communities of Arizona.&nbsp; Essentially, social embeddedness means that both the community and the university benefit from and rely upon each other.&nbsp; At ASU, this vision involves the ongoing integration of five innovate and distinct, yet interrelated, actions:			 <UL style="margin-bottom: 0">		       <LI>Community Capacity Building - enabling community-based organizations and institutions to become strong and effective by providing support, training, and access to resources and information. </LI>		       <LI>Teaching and Learning - involving faculty, staff, and students in solving problems facing communities.</LI>		       <LI>Economic Development - responding to the needs of the university and the needs of communities as ASU pursues its role as an economic engine. </LI>		       <LI>Social Development - enhancing the well-being of the diverse people and communities of Arizona, by working closely with public and private institutions.</LI>		       <LI>Research - advancing relevant inquiry by valuing community input, knowledge, and needs.</LI>	        </UL>	         <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align:left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only programs or projects that have been implemented since August 1, 2002 and have demonstrated positive results will be considered for the award.&nbsp; The project must be institutional work done in the name of Arizona State University rather than individual or group community service.</p> 			 <BR>			 Employees may be classified			 or administrative staff, academic or service professionals, or faculty. A team			 may be comprised of any group of ASU employees and include members from the			 community who partnered with ASU on this project.<BR>			 <BR><B>Selection			 Process</B><BR>Recipients of the President's Medal for Social Embeddedness will			 be determined by a review group appointed by the President.
