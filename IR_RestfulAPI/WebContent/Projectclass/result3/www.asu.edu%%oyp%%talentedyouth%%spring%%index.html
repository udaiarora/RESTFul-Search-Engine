            <h3> <strong> Let Your Fingers do the Talking </strong></h3>
            <p> <strong>This course is for talented 3rd grade students. </strong> Let Your Fingers Do the Talking is a course designed to teach students to &ldquo;say what they mean&rdquo; and &ldquo;mean what they say&rdquo; using the fourth most commonly used form of communication in the United States - American Sign Language. Students will synthesize the elements of this language to develop meaningful communications through the use of signs, gestures, and facial expressions. Students will integrate the concepts of art, music, and mathematics, as they explore the movement, patterns and frequencies of sound waves. The art of role playing and video recordings will set the stage for students to examine the culture and history of deaf and hard-of-hearing communities to provide a context for students to make real-life applications and extensions to a variety of everyday situations.</p>

            <h3> <strong> Engineering A to Z </strong></h3>
            <p> <strong>This course is for talented 4th and 5th grade students. </strong> When we think of every day life most of us take a lot of daily conveniences for granted. Take for instance the toaster you use to toast your bread in the morning. Have you ever thought about the electricity that makes it work or how it gets all the way to your house? Or what about the road you take to go to school in the morning? What about the car that you ride in? The music that you listen to in your CD or MP3 player, the airplane you fly on to go on vacation, sending an email to a friend and a myriad of other things that are just &ldquo;part of your daily life&rdquo; are all in some way or another associated with at least one field of engineering. When you think about it, engineers impact your life on a daily basis. Who are these Engineers? What do they do? How do they do it? How do I become one? In this course students will have the opportunity to explore the many different engineering disciplines, their applications, learn basic applied science and math principles used in the different fields and work on in-class projects that will reinforce the concepts learned from each field. At the end of the course, the student will have a better understanding about engineering, and the diversity that the field offers.</p>

            <h3> <strong> Present Yourself with POWER: PowerPoint Basics</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>This course is for talented 4th and 5th grade students.</strong> Present Yourself with POWER: PowerPoint Basics provides a fun and challenging way for students to learn PowerPoint Basics. PowerPoint is a great tool for students of all ages to explore their creativity. The days of overheads and picture slides is coming to an end, and are now rolled into one computer-based program. While exploring their minds and sharing their favorite things with their classmates, students will learn basic computer use and PowerPoint skills such as developing slides, adding text, pictures and backgrounds. In addition, students will learn how to save a presentation, use the internet to gather ideas and graphics, understand the importance of color selection, explore their inner creativity, and gain or enhance their public speaking skills. By the end of the course, students will be able to create a basic PowerPoint presentation.</p>

            <h3> <strong> Art Up Close: History through the Language of 20th Century Artists </strong></h3>
            <p><strong>This course is for talented 6th and 7th grade students.</strong> Ever wonder how to decipher the meaning of a painting or poem, or what a piece of music represents, or what the emotions in a dance are trying to say? The role of art in society is to represent the world's social and cultural changes. Art of all kinds can express a variety of themes such as emotion, political views, fantasy, or dreams. The art fields of visual arts, music, dance, and creative writing all have similarities in their representation of history and cultural change. Through this class students will learn history of the 20th century through the eyes of such artists as Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir&oacute;, Martha Graham, John Cage, Jackson Pollock, Frank O'Hara, Merce Cunningham, Salvador Dali and others. Students will learn to understand art, discover and try their methods, and learn how to express their own voice. </p>

            <h3>Astrobiology: The Search for Life in the Universe </h3>
            <p><strong>This course is for talented 6th and 7th grade students.</strong> Humans have always looked up into the night sky and wondered if Earth is the only planet with life. How did life on Earth begin? Are there other thinking beings in the Universe? This course will introduce students to astronomical and biological topics related to the origin of life on Earth and the possibility of life elsewhere. Students will explore the formation of stars and planets, the life cycle of stars, the evolution of planets in our Solar System and the discovery of planets around other stars. From an exploration of the history of life on Earth, students will also uncover clues about what scientists expect to find in other places in the Solar System and on planets around other stars. The course will end with a hypothetical search for life on planets around another star. In this exercise, students will apply their knowledge of life on planet Earth to new and exciting possibilities on alien worlds!</p>
