                                <P align=center>Bibliographies identify research that has been done on various subjects; they often cite primary materials that are available in manuscript or printed form. Graduate students must consult these works in order to avoid missing significant materials that may not be in this library. Undergraduates will also discover that using these tools will help them make better use of this collection, because bibliographies often bring together, in one list, material that may be scattered throughout the library, in books, articles, or government documents.&nbsp; <BR>

It contains abstracts from American and foreign journals on all aspects of U.S. and Canadian history from the prehistoric period to the present.

                                    These are interdisciplinary indices.&nbsp; Not only are articles indexed by author and subject (keywords from the titles), but there is a unique approach in the "citation index": the bibliographies in the articles are indexed by the cited authors' names so that it is possible to determine who has cited a given author. This kind of indexing does not depend on the vagaries of subject headings and may turn up some material that you could not find otherwise. Book reviews are indexed also, by reviewer and by the author of the book reviewed.&nbsp;&nbsp; History article, particularly those of an interdisciplinary nature can appear in either, but not always both indices.&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of the web version(which allows one to search both indexes) is strongly recommended. <BR>

                    From 1936 to 1938, over 2,300 former slaves from across the American South were interviewed by writers and journalists under the aegis of the Works Progress Administration. These former slaves, most born in the last years of the slave regime or during the Civil War, provided first-hand accounts of their experiences on plantations, in cities, and on small farms.&nbsp; This web site provides an opportunity to read a sample of these narratives, and to see some of the <BR>
