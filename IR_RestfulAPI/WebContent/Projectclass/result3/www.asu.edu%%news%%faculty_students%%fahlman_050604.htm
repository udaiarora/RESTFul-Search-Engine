      <h2>Fahlman focuses on 'painter of modern life' </h2>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/Betsy-Fahlman.jpg" alt="Betsy Fahlman" width="180" height="276" align="right">Betsy Fahlman's fascination with artist Guy P&egrave;ne du Bois' work started when she was given an assignment as an undergraduate student in an art class at Mt. Holyoke College. Even though he was her second choice, she enjoyed studying his work and life so much, she stuck with him through her Ph.D. dissertation. </p>
      <p>While he may be an underappreciated American artist, Fahlman, ASU professor of art history, trusts that her new book and the two exhibitions planned in New York, one of which coincides with the book release, will change that. </p>
      <p>"I hope my book and the James Graham &amp; Sons gallery exhibitions of his work will dazzle people and get them to think P&egrave;ne du Bois' work was better than anyone has ever realized," says Fahlman. </p>
      <p>Her recent book, "Guy P&egrave;ne du Bois, Painter of Modern Life" started as two separate 15-page essays for the exhibitions. The project just kept expanding, says Fahlman. </p>
      <p>Her relationship with James Graham &amp; Sons started when they began planning for a P&egrave;ne du Bois exhibition and soon realized that his extensive work called for two separate exhibits, one for his work between 1903 to 1924 and a second for his later work, to be held in 2006. </p>
      <p>Fahlman had a good foundation on the painter, but as she began to write the book she learned even more about his life. "I found letters and works of his that I did not have access to when working on my dissertation," says Fahlman. "Word got out that I was working on this project and more things came out of the woodwork." </p>
      <p>Her book is the most comprehensive study of the artist, according to James Graham &amp; Sons. </p>
      <p>P&egrave;ne du Bois was born 1884 in Brooklyn, New York. He found his subjects in daily life, painting the people he observed in city parks, cafes, cabarets and the opera. As a young man, he studied with artists William Merritt Chase and Robert Henri. In 1905, he traveled to Europe with his father, and for a period of time, he studied at the Atelier Colarossi and took private lessons from Th&eacute;ophile Steinlen. In 1924, he and his wife moved to France for a six-year visit, a period that will be explored in the second exhibition. During the Depression, he returned to the United States where he remained until shortly before his passing in 1958. </p>
      <p>The book gives an extensive chronology of P&egrave;ne du Bois' life and showcases a number of his pieces, which highlight his artistic style changes during the decades of his life. The cover features his work "Carnival," a flapper inspired image . </p>
      <p>"I kept worrying that I missed something while working on the book. Deciding which images to include and where to place them in the book was challenging, but I think it's a nice 15-page essay," jokes Fahlman of her 176-page book. </p>
      <p>The first of the two exhibitions in New York will be May 6 - July 9. Alumni in the New York area have been invited to a lecture by Fahlman at James Graham &amp; Sons May 8 and a luncheon to follow at the home of a Herberger College of Fine Arts scholarship patron Mary deLiagre, a former movie star.
