	Ethnobotany</a> (1-3 credits).  This is a basic, introductory course designed to review the different 

	aspects of ethnobotany, including people's past and present use of plants for food, medicine, shelter,

	other cultures, including modern North America, will take place.  This class is crosslisted under the 

	Anthropology (ASB), Plant Biology (PLB), and the Religious Studies (REL) rubrics.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/clas/latin/ecuador/Courses/relied.html">IED/REL 494/591: Teaching 

	Indigenous Culture</a> (1-3 credits).  This course is designed for educators.  Participants are immersed 

	in the same field experiences of Andean/Amazonian culture as students in the other classes.  However, following 

	the day's learning experiences, students enrolled in this class will meet to discuss the special challenges 

	involved in teaching what they have learned to K-12 or community college classes.  Students will also visit 

	Quichua schools and interview Quichua educators.  This class is crosslisted in Indian Education (IED) and 

	Religious Studies (REL).  Course requirement: To design a unit for teaching some aspect of Andean/Amazonian 

	culture in a K-12 or community college class.  The lesson plans and teaching resources should be in a fixed 

	format (whether video, paper, or a Power Point presentation) that can be shared with other teachers.  

	Conversational competence in Spanish is desirable but not required.  If the course participant does not speak 

	Spanish, they will join the students from REL 305.  Participants who do speak Spanish will work with the students 

	who are enrolled in "Field Study of Andean/Amazonian Culture II".  In either case, participants will use their 

	class field experiences as material for designing a teaching unit rather than writing a critical journal or 

	research project.</p>



	<p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/clas/latin/ecuador/Courses/nursing.html">NUR 394/598: International Community/ 

	Public Health Nursing</a> (3 credits).*  Engage and analyze the health issues, priorities, systems (public

	<p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/clas/latin/ecuador/Courses/rel305.html">REL 305: Myth, Ritual, and Symbol: 

	Amazon and Andes (3 credits).*</a>  This course is a field study of Andean/Amazonian myth, ritual, and symbol.  

	Students read background articles on various topics and then observe living examples of Andean/Amazonian myth, 

	ritual, and symbol in their lived contexts.  Field learning experiences are followed by guided class discussion 

	of Andean/Amazonian symbols in English.  This course is appropriate for undergraduates or for graduate students 

	who do not have strong Spanish skills.  It fulfills the ASU General Studies requirements in 1) Literacy and 

	Critical Inquiry, and 2) Humanities and Fine Arts.  (Graduate students can enroll in this course under the 

	REL 494 rubric.)  Course requirement: Critical field journal analyzing the learning experiences of each day.</p>



	<p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/clas/latin/ecuador/Courses/rel332.html">REL 332: South American Religious 

	Traditions</a> (3 credits).*  This course is appropriate for undergraduates or for graduate students who do 

	not meet the Spanish skills requirements for "Field Study of Andean/Amazonian Cultures" listed previously.  

	All materials will be translated into English.  This course fulfills the ASU General Studies requirements in 

	1) Humanities and Fine Arts, and 2) Global Awareness.  Course requirement: Critical field journal analyzing 

	the learning experiences of each day.</p>



	<hr />

	<p><strong>Grading policy and deadlines for turning in assignments:</strong> Because
	  the faculty will not 

	return from Ecuador until after Summer grades are due, all students will
	  receive "Incompletes" which will

	be converted to grades by October 1st, 2007.  Undergraduate courses have
	  two important components: 1) 

	participation in the various field learning experiences; and 2) the critical
	  field journal. The journal 

	must be typed and turned in by September 15th, 2007. No journals will be
	  accepted after September 15th. 

	Grades in graduate courses are based on three components: 1) participation;
	  2) the critical field journal; 

	and 3) the research project.  The journal must be turned in by September
	  15th, 2007. The research project 

	must be turned in by October 15, 2007.</p>



	<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Course syllabi and grading policies tentative until the first day of class.</p>

	<hr />

	<p><strong>*Further explanation of field course work:</strong> REL 305, REL 332, and ASB/REL 494/591: Field 

	Study of Andean/Amazonian Cultures I & II provide different rubrics for a field study of the oral history, 

	literature, art, and religious life of the Quichua people.  In all of these classes, each afternoon is 

	structured around a particular learning encounter or series of encounters with the Quichua world.  

	For example, the class observes an Amazonian healing ceremony or listens to elders recount their memories of 

	the Amazonian rubber boom or learns about the meaning of traditional hunting grounds while camped out in the 

	rainforest with a Quichua family.  Following the experience, students write about the event in a journal.  

	After the class has had time to write in their journals, the class meets for a discussion of the event.</p>



	<p>The key difference is that REL 305 and REL 332 are carried out in English and do not require Spanish.  

	The entire class works together as a group in various field learning experiences. These classes are primarily 

	designed for undergraduates and can be used to meet ASU General Studies requirements.  Graduate students who 

	do not speak Spanish may also enroll in these courses.  ASB/REL 494/591: Field Study of Andean/Amazonian 

	Cultures I & II are primarily designed for graduate students although undergraduate students who are proficient 

	in Spanish are welcome to enroll.  All students in these courses must have the ability to speak and understand 

	Spanish.  Greater flexibility for individual or small group field research is also built into these courses. </p>
