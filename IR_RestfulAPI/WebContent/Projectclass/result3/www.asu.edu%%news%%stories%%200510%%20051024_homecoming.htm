    FestDevil 2005 &#8212; Not your typical family reunion</p>
              <p>                Homecoming 2005 at ASU is being billed as &ldquo;not your typical family reunion.&rdquo;<br>
                <br>
  And it&rsquo;s true. FestDevil 2005, Sparky&rsquo;s Family Reunion, is for the Sun Devil family and friends. That&rsquo;s a pretty big group.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/Sparky_Homecoming_logo.gif" width="200" height="102" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">Sparky&rsquo;s Family Reunion will include a giant Block Party, a bigger-than-ever parade, a Battle of the Bands and much more on Oct. 29.<br>
  <br>
  The Block Party, scheduled for 11 a.m. &ndash; 3 p.m. on and around Alumni Lawn, will include tents sponsored by nearly 40 ASU colleges and departments, music, food, art, literary events, activities for children, and mixing and mingling by ASU grads, students, community members, faculty and staff.</p>
              <p>There will be four stages for music. One will be devoted to the Battle of the Bands, where bands with an ASU connection compete to be the best band.<br>
                <br>
                The Alumni Stage will feature Comeback Buddy, a Buddy Holly tribute band playing all of his hits.<br>
                <br>
                On the ASU Downtown Phoenix Stage, the Screamin&rsquo; Javelinas will perform classic rock and Top 40 cover tunes. <br>
                <br>
                The Hispanic Business Students Association Stage will feature DJ Joe Dean, ASU Mariachi Diablos del Sol, the ASU Salsa Show Team and the SRP Second Shift Band.<br>
                <br>
                Members of the Class of 1955 &ndash; the &ldquo;golden class&rdquo; this year &ndash; will be special guests at the Block Party as well, and will be riding through campus on Ollie the Trolley.<br>
                <br>
                The Block Party also includes the annual Herberger Alumni Art Walk, from 10 a.m. &ndash; 4 p.m., with 25 artists exhibiting &ldquo;a kaleidoscope of juried fine art,&rdquo; ranging from jewelry to wearable art to photography, ceramics and painting, and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Book Fair.</p>

              <p>The book fair will feature ASU alumni who have published a variety of books, from Robert Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Power of Handshaking&rdquo; to T.M. McNally&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Goat Bridge.&rdquo; Books signed by the authors, also will be available, and there will be tours of the Piper Writers House.<br>
                This year, there will be a special area for future Sun Devils. In front of the Foundation Building, at the corner of College Avenue and University Drive, the children&rsquo;s area will include interactive games, science experiments &ndash; and a special appearance by Clifford the Big Red Dog, courtesy of KAET-TV/Channel 8.<br>
                <br>
                The Homecoming Parade steps off from Myrtle Avenue at University Drive at 11:30 a.m. and will continue east on University Drive to McAllister Avenue.<br>
                <br>
                This year, there will be two parade grand marshals: Raymond C. Singh, 14, the youngest student currently enrolled at ASU, and William &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Kajikawa, who graduated from ASU in 1937, earned his master&rsquo;s degree in 1948, and coached football at his alma mater from 1937 &ndash; 1978.<br>
                <br>
                Singh, who took his first &ldquo;classes&rdquo; at ASU as a 4-year-old student at what was then the Center for Academic Precocity, is a freshman studying aerospace engineering. He hopes to join NASA some day.<br>
&ldquo;He loves to design things,&rdquo; says his father, Raymond Singh of Scottsdale. &ldquo;We knew he was precocious when he was reading at 2 1/2. He has always loved machines, and drawing them.&rdquo;<br>
Singh is a student at the Barrett Honors College, as is his sister, Virgilia, who is a junior at ASU. Singh also has a 10-year-old brother, Nicholas.<br>
<br>
Kajikawa, or &ldquo;Kaji&rdquo; as he is called, began coaching the Arizona State Teachers College freshman football team in 1937, when the team was known as the Bulldogs. He coached freshmen under nine head football coaches before retiring in 1978.<br>
<br>
Kaji also was head basketball coach for nine years, and he coached baseball during the infancy of that sport at ASU. He was inducted into the ASU Hall of Distinction in 1982.<br>
The parade, with about 100 entries, will include bands, university officials riding in antique or unique cars, student-built floats, dancing and performing groups, and even a flyover by an Apache helicopter group. <br>
<br>
New this year is a float from the Department of Theatre, which will showcase its student production of &ldquo;The King Stag&rdquo; (Oct. 28 &ndash; 30 and Nov. 3 &ndash; 6 at the Paul V. Galvin Playhouse).<br>
<br>
The actors will be in full costumes and have enormous puppets riding with them. David Saar, director of &ldquo;The King Stag,&rdquo; who also will be riding in the car, is an ASU graduate and founder and artistic director of Childsplay.<br>
<br>
Getting to the Block Party and parade will be easier than ever this year.<br>
<br>
Drivers can leave their cars at the Tempe Sports Complex, at the corner of Warner and Hardy, or Benedict Field at Guadalupe and Kyrene, or at the Fifth Street and Farmer surface lot, located on Fifth Street just west of the Ash Avenue Railroad alignment in downtown Tempe.<br>
<br>
Buses will run every 15 minutes inbound (northbound) from 10 a.m. &ndash; 3:30 p.m., and every 15 minutes outbound (southbound) from 3:30 &ndash; 9 p.m. Volunteers will be on hand at the three locations, handing out free bus tickets.<br>
<br>
A number of other events are planned throughout Homecoming Week, beginning Oct. 24. All of this activity culminates with ASU taking on the Washington Huskies at 3:30 p.m. in Sun Devil Stadium.<br>
<br>
The Block Party and Homecoming Parade are sponsored by the Arizona Republic, the city of Tempe, Coca-Cola, Hensley/Budweiser, Entertainment Solutions and Infinity Radio (KZON, KOOL, KMLE).<br>
