      <h2>The musical,<em> A Chorus Line</em>, closes out Lyric Opera Theatre 02/03 season </h2>
      <p>The Herberger College of Fine Arts Lyric Opera Theatre in the
        School of Music presents A Chorus Line, the riveting musical by Michael
        Bennett.</p>
      <p>Billed as the "one, singular sensation," this musical faces head on
        the hopes, fears, frustrations and insecurities of a group of dancers.
        The stage itself serves as the set for Michael Bennett's riveting musical
        featuring a Broadway chorus audition where a director demands the dancers
        publicly share their most intimate memories and inner demons. This Lyric
        Opera Theatre production is true to the original - "workshopping" the
        musical. The cast, selected from auditions held in October, took part
        in a 12-week rehearsal workshop in the School of Music's Broadway Scenes
        class taught by senior lecturer Joann Yeoman.</p>
      <p>The premise for A Chorus Line is simple: dancers audition for parts
        in the chorus of a Broadway show. As they go through the process, they
        open up to the director and to each other. At the end of the show, eight
        successful dancers are left standing on the stage. The ending brings
        back all the dancers in a glitzy song and dance number performed by the
        entire cast.</p>
      <p>WHEN: April 25, 26, 30, May 2, 3, 4, 7:30 p.m.; April 27, 2 p.m.</p>
      <p>WHERE: Evelyn Smith Music Theatre, Music Building, 40 E. Gammage Parkway,
        Tempe</p>
      <p>TICKETS: $14 adults, $12 seniors, faculty and staff; $5 students.</p>
      <p>INFORMATION, TICKETS: 480-965-6447</p>
      <p>JoAnn Yeoman, who has taught in the Herberger College departments of
        dance and of theatre, in addition to the School of Music, brings to Lyric
        Opera Theatre practical experience and extensive knowledge from her career
        as a performer and choreographer in theatre in New York City and across
        the country.</p>
      <p>She has worked with many of the greats, including A Chorus Line's Michael
        Bennett. Her stint with Bennett especially came in handy during her spring
        semester workshop class for Lyric Opera Theatre's production of A Chorus
        Line. Yeoman and the other members of the Lyric Opera Theatre faculty
        and staff are staging the smash Broadway musical just as the original
        was - beginning with an intensive 12 weeks-long workshop for the student
        performers. </p>
      <p>Not wanting to rely on only her stage background for the workshop, Yeoman
        arranged for her students to have a master class with Tony Award winning
        Donna McKechnie. The dancing and singing star, was on campus in early
        April to work with the students. McKechnie is one of the original cast
        members of the Broadway debut of A Chorus Line in 1975. Yeoman also had
        Pamela Blair, who played the original Val in the 1975 production, visit
        a workshop session.</p>
      <p>"A Chorus Line is a big production, showcasing 20 major roles and an
        ensemble of 30 or more," says Yeoman. "There is a variety of strengths
        in the cast and it's my job to bring them together and make them look
        good." She points out that the production has an interdisciplinary cast
        - in addition to students in the Music Theatre Performance program, there
        are students in Biology, Computer Science, Dance, Television Broadcasting,
        Theatre and Voice.</p>
      <p>"The workshop concept enables the cast members to get to know one another
        while developing their characters and experiencing a great deal of choreography,"
        says. "The workshop is really a bonding experience and is in keeping
        with the origins of A Chorus Line."</p>
