        <h2><B>ASU researchers win top NSF grant for mathematics education study</FONT></B> </h2>
                  <P>Arizona State University researchers have been awarded a $1.8 million grant from the National Science Foundation to conduct a three-year study designed to examine how and when children learn mathematics in the middle grades and determine more effective strategies for improving mathematics understanding and achievement among children with the greatest need.</FONT></P>
                  <P>The grant was awarded through the NSF&rsquo;s Research on Learning in Education program, the most competitive and prestigious research competition in the education sciences sponsored by the NSF.</FONT></P>
                  <P>In collaboration with the Creighton Elementary School District in central Phoenix, the project will focus specifically on the development of rational number knowledge among students as they progress from grades six through eight.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
                  <P>&ldquo;We will be working in schools, under the conditions in which children typically are expected to learn about fractions, ratios, decimals, percents and linear algebra, to examine both, how they learn these concepts over the course of the middle grades; but also to uncover how we can stimulate faster and better learning in our schools where there is the highest need,&rdquo; said James A. Middleton, project director.</FONT></P>
                  <P>&nbsp;</FONT> <BR>
                      &ldquo;Our approach is aimed at understanding both the intellectual resources individual children bring to bear in developing rational number understanding, and the classroom dynamics and instruction that impact student- learning and achievement most,&rdquo; said Middleton, who currently serves as interim director of the Division of Curriculum and Instruction with the College of Education.</FONT></P>
                  <P>With this goal in mind, a multidisciplinary team of researchers has been assembled to conduct the study, including: Middleton (Mathematics Education), Alfinio Flores (Mathematics Education), Jae Meen Baek (Mathematics Education), Marilyn Carlson (Mathematics), Robert Atkinson (Educational Psychology, Technology), Marilyn Thompson (Measurement and Methodological Studies), and Roger Milsap (Psychology).</FONT></P>
                  <P>&ldquo;We are working with our close partner, the Creighton Elementary School District, to follow a group of children at two schools for three consecutive years of development,&rdquo; Middleton said.&nbsp; The Creighton district governing board unanimously endorsed the program, and expressed thanks for the continued support of ASU researchers in the effort to improve instruction in the district, he said.</FONT></P>
                  <P>Because the research team will focus its efforts on such a large group of children for such an extended period, the results of the study are expected to make a significant impact on mathematics achievement in the Creighton district and beyond.</FONT></P>
                  <P>&ldquo;Never before has such a complex subject been studied at such a depth, for such a length of time, with so many children.&nbsp; This is a seminal model for research on learning in schools.&nbsp; It is highly rigorous science, but conducted in the ecology of school environments such that useful models of teaching, learning, and curriculum will be developed and disseminated nationally,&rdquo; Middleton said.</FONT></P>
                  <P>The Creighton project furthers the mission of ASU&rsquo;s Office of University-School Partnerships.&nbsp; Established by ASU President Michael Crow in June 2003, ASU University-School Partnerships were conceptualized as initiatives offering support in four areas: early childhood education; teachers; educational leaders; and students, schools and families.&nbsp; </FONT></P>

                  <P>&ldquo;This award significantly furthers ASU&rsquo;s effort to engage the pre-k-12 sector in meaningful partnerships that advance the knowledge base and make a difference for students,&rdquo; said Eugene E. Garcia, vice president for university-school partnerships and dean of the College of Education.</FONT></P>
