            <p><strong>University Design Team Phase I Report and Recommendations</strong></P>
            <h2>Preface</h2>
            <p>The University Design Team (UDT) envisions ASU as a single research 
              university, with multiple campuses sharing the ASU identity, and 
              yet each with its own character and spires of excellence. The recommendations 
              in this report represent the <em>beginning</em> of the conversation 
              about possible program realignments designed to facilitate the strengthening 
              of the ASU brand and the differentiation of the four campuses. </p>
            <p>The 
              Team recommends that the next steps in the process be consultative 
              and deliberative, as decisions such as these must consider a multitude 
              of factors.  The process must include an analysis of enrollment 
              impacts, constituencies served, program interdependencies for faculty 
              and students, financial resources, organizational alternatives, 
              space, research, accreditation issues, etc. on a case-by-case basis.  
              Further analysis of these factors is necessary to determine the 
              extent to which individual program realignments may actually achieve 
              desired outcomes (e.g., dispersion of student enrollment, sharpened 
              research focus, quality improvements).   Another critical recommendation 
              of the Team is that the further deliberations involve the affected 
              units, faculty, and other relevant constituencies to ensure issues 
              are fully assessed.  Finally, the Team would stress the imperative 
              that the next steps be initiated with dispatch. </p>
            <h2>Team Charge</h2>
            <p>Within the context of preparing a five to ten year &#8220;road map&#8221; 
              to accommodate increasing numbers of students, the University Design 
              Team was charged to:</p>
            <h3>Phase I</h3>
            <ul>
              <li> Determine 
                the identity and character of the four different campuses.<br>
                How does one establish differentiation among the four campuses?  
                Do they have distinctive missions, thrusts, and/or topical clusters 
                of programs?   Do they all have the ASU brand?  <br>
                </li>
              <li>Recommend 
                programs that are needed at the campuses to support or define 
                those identities in charge # 1.<br>
                Should existing programs on one of the campuses be moved to 
                reinforce the identity of another campus?  Should new programs 
                be started that help build the image of a particular campus?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Phase II</h3>
            <ul>
              <li> Determine 
                how the various university services need to be provided.<br>
                Should support services be centrally organized and managed 
                or should they be decentralized to the campuses?  How much autonomy 
                should each campus have in the various service areas?  Should 
                the roles of the Graduate College, College of Extended 
                Education, and the Office of VPR be revised?  (Also coordinate with the other task 
                forces, such as the admissions standards, University College, etc.)<br>
                </li>
              <li>How 
                should we manage enrollment within and among campuses?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Imperative to Plan</h2>
            <p>The need to do this type of planning and potential reorganization 
              of the university is driven by the desire to increase the capacity 
              of the university to serve students, to increase quality, and to 
              increase research productivity.  Given that ASU Main is essentially 
              capped at its current enrollment and some ASU Main programs will 
              need to grow, other ASU Main programs and significant university 
              growth must be accommodated at the other three campuses and through 
              extended education. </p>
            <h2>University Identity</h2>
            <p>Prior to discussing campus identities, the Team felt it necessary 
              to identify the characteristics of ASU and the common elements the 
              four campuses must share as parts of ASU. The common elements are 
              intended to define a single university with multiple campuses that 
              shares the characteristics of the most successful state university 
              systems in the U.S. The unique qualities of each campus must be 
              embedded in the fundamental qualities of ASU, yet demonstrate the 
              opportunity for a distinct character. The common elements could 
              define ASU as the primary brand and allow each campus&#146; differentiated 
              identity to represent secondary brands.</p>
            <p>Thus, the four campuses of ASU should share the following 
              core elements and values. Within the approved differentiation stated 
              in their missions, each campus shall:</p>
            <ul type=disc>
              <li>Offer degree programs at the baccalaureate, master&#8217;s and 
                doctoral levels.</li>
              <li>Conduct programs of research and creative 
                activities.</li>
              <li>Offer programs leading to professional 
                degrees at the baccalaureate and post-baccalaureate levels.</li>
              <li>Promote continuing and extended education, 
                and encourage faculty and staff to be engaged with the greater 
                metropolitan region. </li>
              <li>Serve the needs of women, minority, 
                disadvantaged, disabled, and non-traditional students.</li>
              <li>Seek racial and ethnic diversification 
                of the student body and the faculty and staff.</li>
              <li>Support activities designed to promote 
                economic, cultural, and social development of the state.</li>
              <li>Commit to student success in all aspects 
                of their academic and personal development.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Campus Identities</h2>
            <p>Guided by the &#8220;one university with multiple campuses&#8221; 
              model for ASU, the UDT considered existing strengths and future 
              potential to identify the distinguishing qualities, or secondary 
              branding, of the four campuses. The following set of descriptors 
              for the campuses emerged:</p>
            <table width="100%" border=1 cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0>

            </table>
            <h3>ASU Downtown</h3>
            <p>ASU Downtown would focus on connecting to the downtown community.  It 
              would do so through programs that: build on the emerging clinical 
              biosciences thrust, serve the needs of downtown professional communities, 
              and enhance ASU&#146;s connections to the downtown 
              arts community.  ASU Downtown could become a focal point for centers 
              and institutes that serve the broader region and that draw on university-wide 
              expertise.  Within all of these possibilities, Downtown would not 
              develop as a traditional, four year campus, but rather focus on 
              upper division, graduate, or otherwise self-contained programs that 
              do not require a broad array of lower division course offerings 
              or support services.</p>
            <h3>ASU East</h3>
            <p>ASU East is envisioned as the campus whose focuses will be professional 
              and applied programs, with a strong emphasis on technology that 
              distinguishes the curricula and out-of-class experiences of students, 
              faculty, and staff.   ASU East will offer a multifaceted student 
              life, including a wide array of support services that serve a diversity 
              of students.</p>
            <h3>ASU Main</h3>
            <p>ASU Main would continue to focus on developing the profile of a research-intensive 
              institution with the qualities and programmatic diversity of non-land 
              grant AAUs.  As programmatic themes, ASU 
              Main would emphasize global and trans-disciplinary initiatives.  
              As the largest campus, ASU Main would be distinguished by its comprehensive 
              student life, including intercollegiate athletics and Greek life.</p>
            <h3>ASU West</h3>
            <p>ASU West would be known as the campus that focuses on studying 
              and addressing metropolitan and social/cultural issues. It would 
              continue to develop the interdisciplinary thread among programs 
              and would &#8220;carry the torch&#8221; for ASU&#8217;s community 
              embeddedness mission. Like ASU East, West would offer the full, 
              four-year university experience to students, including the necessary 
              support services.</p>
            <h2>Program Structures and Distribution</h2>
            <p>Given these distinctive features, the UDT discussed the many possibilities 
              for the redistribution and restructuring of programs offered throughout 
              the university. The sections that follow discuss issues and concerns, 
              principles to guide reorganization, organizational alternatives, 
              general studies and seamless transfer, core liberal arts and sciences, 
              and potential program alignments based on campus identities.</p>
            <h3>Issues &amp; Concerns</h3>
            <ul type=disc>
              <li>Members of the Design 
                Team felt there was inadequate time to properly understand the 
                dynamics of individual programs and departments as a basis for 
                making strong and informed recommendations.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul type=disc>
              <li>There is great concern about the process that will follow this 
                report. The Team believes it is absolutely critical that relevant 
                constituencies be involved in further assessing the viability 
                of the &#8220;recommendations&#8221; and, if viable, how to accomplish 
                program moves, consolidations, organizational structure, etc. 
                When recommendations affect units at more than one campus, those 
                multiple units should work together on implementation (e.g., how 
                computer science has been managed between Main and East). </li>
              <li>Recognizing the 
                good of the greater university is the primary driver for reorganization, 
                it would be desirable for reorganization to benefit programs in 
                demonstrable ways (e.g., increased centrality to new campus mission, 
                increased visibility, additional resources) 
                and present the opportunity to enhance individual program success.  
                <i></i></li>
              <li>Resources are a concern.  The Team believes if programs are to move 
                from one campus to another, all of the resources needed to support 
                students, faculty, and other program requirements must be provided 
                at the new campus.  This includes the requirement that sufficient and appropriate 
                space be made available to support relocated programs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Principles to Guide Program Reorganization</h3>
            <p>Decisions 
              about program structure and reorganization must be based on many 
              factors.  Some that were most relevant in the discussions of the 
              Design Team are noted below:</p>
            <ul type=disc>
              <li>Centrality to campus identity - movement of programs from one 
                campus to another should clearly support the distinctions among 
                campus&#8217; identities.</li>
              <li>Goodness of fit - programs should support and enhance the stated 
                purposes and goals of the campus, college, and department. </li>
              <li>Interdisciplinary dependence - the degree to which a program&#8217;s 
                courses serve other students or its students&#8217; require courses 
                in other disciplines (beyond general studies) should be considered. 
                The same issue applies to faculty relationships with other programs.</li>
              <li>Duplication of programs - offering similar or the same programs 
                at multiple campuses may be necessary in some cases (e.g., English, 
                arts, teacher preparation, business, communication, nursing). 
                Market demand (student and employer) should be the primary factor 
                that drives duplication. In these cases, there should be sufficient 
                and appropriate differentiation among programs based on campus 
                identity.</li>
              <li>Collaboration among programs - all programs, wherever they are 
                located, should be encouraged to collaborate and interact with 
                related programs at other campuses for the benefits such collaboration 
                brings as well as to ensure appropriate differentiation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Possible Organizational Framework</h3>
            <p>Three 
              different organizational structures for administering programs within 
              the one university with multiple campuses model were discussed:</p>
            <ul type=disc>
              <li>Distributive - related programs or units located at more than 
                one campus, differentiated based on distinct campus missions, 
                and administered by a single academic unit within the university. 
                This model requires a commitment to the same level of quality 
                wherever programs are offered (e.g., similar or the same faculty 
                at all locations). Each campus could have an appropriate array 
                of these &#8220;headquarters&#8221;, consistent with campus missions.</li>
              <li>Duplicative - similar programs or units located at more than 
                one campus, differentiated to the extent possible based on distinct 
                campus missions, and administered at the campus level. To ensure 
                the validity of the &#8220;one university&#8221; brand, formal 
                coordination among duplicated programs is imperative.</li>
              <li>Unique - unique programs within the university primarily offered 
                at one campus and administered at the campus level. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>All 
              three organizational models presume the use of extended education 
              strategies to offer programs at other campuses, off campus, and 
              via technology, as necessary.  Faculty could be asked to teach at 
              more than one campus under any of these models.  </p>
            <p>Appropriate 
              organizational structures should be evaluated on a case-by-case 
              basis for each program or program area.  </p>
            <h2>Potential Program Ideas</h2>
            <h3><strong>Common General Studies and Seamless Transfer</strong></h3>
            <p>To 
              reinforce the notion that ASU is a single entity, it is strongly 
              recommended that there be a university-wide set of general studies 
              requirements.  The implementation and methods of delivery of general 
              studies might differ on each campus.  However, there should be a 
              common set of curricular objectives, experiences, and student learning 
              outcomes (&#8220;core competencies&#8221;) for the entire ASU undergraduate 
              student body.  ASU also needs to measure the success of students 
              in attaining those outcomes, no matter where the students are located.  
              In the same vein, transferring from one campus to another should 
              not be difficult for students.  Program and campus requirements 
              should be articulated such that course credits taken at one campus 
              transfer without question to any other campus. </p>
            <h3><strong>Core Liberal Arts and Sciences</strong></h3>
            <p>East, West and Main, as full-service, four-year university campuses, 
              will need to offer a range of &#8220;core&#8221; liberal arts and 
              sciences courses to meet student needs for general studies. However, 
              separate disciplinary departments in each general studies area are 
              not required on each campus to meet these needs. It is recognized, 
              however, that there may be sufficient student demand to establish 
              &#8220;duplicate&#8221; degree programs and organizational units in the liberal 
              arts and sciences on the three campuses. The breadth, depth, and 
              content focus of these offerings, programs, and units should be 
              developed in relationship to the differentiated identities of the 
              campuses. </p>
            <h3><strong>Potential Program Alignments with Campus Identities</strong></h3>
            <p>The Team discussed many academic programs in the university and 
              their fit with the four campus&#8217; identities, assuming that 
              achieving campus distinctiveness will require redistribution of 
              some programs. While the list that follows may not be exhaustive, 
              the matrix demonstrates the Team&#8217;s thinking process as it 
              relates to these programs.&nbsp;<BR>

              The Team discussed the potential realignment of several centers 
              and institutes, recognizing the potential for such entities to further 
              reinforce the campus&#8217; identities. As an example, the Morrison 
              Institute could fit with the identity of ASU Downtown or with the 
              social and metropolitan focus of ASU West. It probably is best to 
              consider centers and institutes as a part of further studying the 
              appropriate campus locations for related degree programs and departments.</p>
            <h3>Potential New Programs for ASU</h3>
            <p>In 
              addition to examining existing programs, the Team was charged to 
              identify programs not currently offered at any ASU campus, which 
              might bolster the identity of the four campuses.  A partial list 
              of degree programs that could be added include: allied health fields 
              (Downtown, East, West); applied math (East); arts administration 
              (Downtown); art therapy (Downtown); environmental and land use planning 
              (East); fire and police science (Downtown, East); general engineering 
              (East); gerontology (West); public health (Downtown); and, urban 
              studies (Downtown, West).  It is quite possible that some existing 
              certificate programs could be added to this list as well.  </p>
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Critical to the success of ASU, as one university with multiple 
              campuses, are common values and characteristics shared by all campuses, 
              distinctive identities for each campus that celebrate their unique 
              contributions to the greater good, and distribution of programs 
              among the campuses to realize those identities and best position 
              the university to meet the many imperatives it will face over the 
              next several years.</p>
            <p>Achieving this vision of the university and campuses requires 
              deliberation and consultation with many constituencies.  Many potential 
              changes were discussed by the UDT and summarized here, but work 
              remains to be done to ensure the impacts and consequences of possible 
              decisions are well understood. </p>
            <p>Finally, the Team would argue for swift follow-up to this 
              report.   The process to move these discussions to decisions should 
              be initiated immediately.  And, not withstanding the need for a 
              deliberative process, making some careful, yet speedy decisions 
              could demonstrate early success in this process to transform the 
              university. </p>
