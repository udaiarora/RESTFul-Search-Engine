      <h2><strong>Preparing for Growth, ASU's Core College Creates Divisional Dean Positions </strong></h2>
      <p>The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Arizona State University's largest college, currently composed of 39 schools, departments, programs, centers and institutes representing the university's traditional core academic disciplines, is about to re-organize to help its units manage resources more effectively and to respond to the opportunities and challenges of&nbsp; ASU's projected growth and change. </p>
      <p>As of July 1, 2004, the college is adding four divisional deans for undergraduate programs and&nbsp; for the faculties of the humanities, sciences, and social sciences, replacing a past administrative organization of three associate deans for academic programs, personnel, and research and facilities. The divisional deans will report to ASU Vice President and Dean David A. Young. </p>
      <p>"The university is currently engaged in rapid growth and dynamic transformation as we move to meet the needs of the state and President Crow's vision of the 'New American University'," Young noted. "The college's new administrative structure will allow us to be fully responsive to the challenges of dramatic change and will empower our units and faculty to participate fully in what we anticipate will be an exciting future for ASU." </p>
