					    <h3>Response Update #1: </h3>					    <p>It has come to our attention that the Law Library book return, suggested as an alternative location to return materials without parking, is only available when the Law Library is closed. As a result the best option for returning materials without too much difficulty parking may be at the Noble Library outside book return. There is a short term metered parking lot to the north of the Goldwater Engineering Center, which is just to the north of the Noble Library (see <a href="http://www.asu.edu/map/b2.html">online map</a>).</p>
					    <p>The library will also investigate other possible locations for returning materials.</p>

			          <h3>Response Update #2</h3>
			          <p>It was suggested that the library add printing for the wireless network in Noble Library. We are pleased to announce that we now have printing available for the wireless network in all Tempe campus libraries. </p></td>

				      <p>I always study at the Quite Study Room. In the morning the tempreture is good, but getting late, like afternoon, it is getting freezing. I always wear warm jacket. Most my friends said the same thing.<br>
				      </p>
				      <h3>Library Response:</h3>
				      <p>We have also noticed that the temperature in all the libraries varies widely. The reason for this is that the campus sets a single temperature for the building. Depending on how hot it is outside, it can feel freezing or warm, depending on where the room is and how many windows there are. Unfortunately, it would cost the university too much to let us change the thermostat up and down. So a lot of the library staff also have to adjust what they wear - or store lots of sweaters in their offices. </p></td>

					    <p> I just wanted to say that the nite guys are really really nice. They helped me out with my stuff a lot and even went beyond from what they 'are supposed' to do.

				      <p>I have fairly good vision, but I dread having to get on a computer anywhere on ASU campus that is not hooked up to a flat screen simply because the refresh rates are way too low. Writing a Word document on a computer with a low refresh rate that you do not have the ability to manually change is a marathon task. If we would at least be allowed to change refresh rates, everything would be awesome. </p>

				      <p>We have trouble with the refresh rates on some of the monitors too! We're working with our Library Systems and Information department to figure out if we can make some improvements in this area. <br>

					    <h3>Suggestion/Comment:</h3>
					    <p>Thank you for posting rule signage to the quiet study room in Hayden - adjacent to the cafe. As a frequent user of the quiet room, I rely on absence of noise to focus my studies. It is to this end that I would like to request additional signage for the room. I think the sign currently on one the room's doors is perfect; however, I think many people don't see it as they enter the room. I am suggesting placing additional signs on the other door to the quiet room as well as one for each of the larger tables within the room. People still believe the room is for group study. Many times I have informed people of the rules which can be uncomfortable for all involed; please place additional sign in the quiet room. Thank you very </p>

					    <h3>Library Response:</h3>
				      <p>Thanks so much for taking the time to give us some feedback regarding your experience in the Quiet Study Room. We are constantly trying to evaluate how our spaces are configured and signed. We have found that <b>too</b> <b>many</b> signs aren't effective, but neither are <b>too few</b>. So we will be putting up a few more signs and hope very much that will help with this situation. If you continue to experience this problem please let us know. We may be able to rearrange the furniture as well to encourage more quiet study.</p></td>

				      <h3>Suggestion/Comment:</h3>
				      <p>After two semesters of making the third floor of Hayden Library my home and quiet refuge, I, after much annoyance, finally feel a strong enough urge to complain about a  librarian who  in my opinion, is the noisiest person I have ever encountered in any library! When they talk to anyone they make no attempt to talk quietly. They have no regard for any of the library patrons who occupy the desks and computers- their loud behavior is very rude to those attempting to concentrate.</p>
				      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
				      <h3>Library Response:</h3>				      
				      <p>We are very glad that you have found an area in the Hayden Library that you feel is conducive to your work. However, there are areas in the library that are not &quot;zoned&quot; for quiet work, and the government documents reference area on Level 3 that you describe is one of them. This area is for customers to consult with library staff, and library staff to consult with each other. If that isn't an environment that you work well in, we encourage you to use one of the other more quieter areas of the library to set up and work. There is a room that is specifically set aside for Quiet Study on the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/lowcon/">Lower Concourse/Entrance</a> level of the library. Also, if you explore Hayden Library, you will find nooks and crannies (one student call them "secret spots") where you can spread out and work in peace. For example, we can recommend areas in the back of the Periodicals, Videos and Microforms section on the lower level, in the open area on Level 1 (near the former front doors of Hayden), around the atrium on Level 2 and in certain areas of the perimeter of the Levels 2 and 3 where there are tables. </p>

				      <p>Please acquire the current journals for <a href="http://www.healthyeatingclub.org/APJCN/ProcNutSoc/2000%2B/2005/2005.htm">Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition</a>. The current electronic subscription ends with the 2002 journals.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Library Response:</h3>
				      <p> Thank you for your suggestion.  The journal appears to be online at the website you gave me through 2003.  An online subscription costs about $125 US, and I will add it to our list of journals to consider for purchase.  If our budget is enough to cover the cost of new subscriptions, we try to subscribe to journals that we know our users would like to have, so we use that list to choose new subscriptions.  <br>

It was an inadvertant omission that the response to your comment was not posted yesterday when this page was updated. The response has been posted now (the original comment was submitted on 3-30-2006). But to reiterate, there should be absolutely no exceptions to the requirement of ASU affiliation to use the Hayden Library after midnight. The supervisors of the evening shift have been reminded of that. If at any time you feel that you are being mistreated, please contact the evening shift supervisor, Stephen Pelphrey. </p>				      <p>&nbsp;</p></td>

					    <p>If the library wants students to know they can study all night, wouldn't it make more sense to have signage that highlights that the library is &quot;OPEN 24 HOURS&quot; and then say something like &quot;ASU ID required midnight-7am&quot; rather than highlighting that &quot;LIBRARY CLOSES AT MIDNIGHT&quot; and then putting the Carpe Noctem information further down? </p>
					    <p>I've overheard other students complaining that the library is not open 24 hours like other college libraries, so obviously some are not getting the message the way signs are written now.<br>

				      <p> I am very upset by the doscriminatory treatment I have received by the night shift.&nbsp; I am not a member of ASU (student, staff, etc...) and I was at Hayden one noght a while ago.&nbsp; I was approached at midnight and was aksed to present my Sun Card... I told them I don't have one and they told me I had to leave.&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; But sitting next to me (I was on a computer by the reference desk) was a man who was not a member of asu either (he had told me as much a half hour earlier because we were griping about how us non-ASU members have to use certain computers).&nbsp; He was not asked to leave, but I was, and I found out later that thos other man is a friend of one of the people that works there.&nbsp; So how come he gets to stay and I'm not?&nbsp; it's very very unfair.&nbsp; <br>

				      <h3>Library Response:</h3>
				      <p>We are quite concerned about this situation, and have contacted the night shift staff and their supervisors. We take security issues in the library quite seriously, and in no way should this situation be happening. There should not be any exceptions whatsoever to the policy that overnight library access is restricted to ASU students, faculty and staff. We have contacted the overnight shift and their supervisors to remind them of this policy and made it clear that there are to be no exceptions.</p></td>

				      <p>This is another great suggestion. We are very interested in offering this type of service to our community, and know that this would be of great help to classes who are assigned a particular video to view. The library administration is evaluating the spaces within the Hayden Library to see if we can create some rooms with this function. </p></td>

					    <p>&nbsp;</p>					    <h3>Suggestion/Comment:</h3>
					    <p>I have a complaint and a suggestion: Last semester I accidentally left my sun card in a photocpoy machine downstairs by the current periodicals. I found out that I had lost it about a week later, and went to the library to see if they had it. I went to the lost and found at circulation, and they said &quot;no, no one had turned it in.&quot; I asked if there was another location in the library that may have a lost and found, and they said &quot;no.&quot; After checking other places I had to buy another Sun Card for 25 dollars. Now I find out that the library did in fact have my card, but it was downstairs at the PVM service counter. I never even knew they had a lost and found! Would it be possible for lost Sun Cards to all be kept in ONE location, preferably up in circulation's lost and found? It was very annoying that thay had it all along and I still spent money on a new one? At least make the staff at circulation aware that there are other places that have lost and found!<br>
					      <br>
                        </p>
					    <h3>Library Response:</h3>
				      <p>Thanks for letting us know about this situation. We're so sorry you had to spend $25 for a replacement card when we actually had found the original! You no doubt had better things to spend that money on. At the Hayden Library there is only one official Lost and Found (at the Circulation Desk near the entrance), and we've asked all the staff in the other areas of the library to turn things into that location. That way customers like yourself wouldn't have to be wandering around the library checking at every possible point for your lost items. Unfortunately sometimes our staff forgets this, and the items don't get turned into the Circulation Desk. We're going to remind everyone to remember to do that. </p>

				      <p>Would it be possible to get the music at Cafe Biblioteca turned WAY down?? Or perhaps changed to some soft classical music instead? The current selection is too loud and not very conducive to studying.<br>
				      </p>
				      <h3>Library Response:</h3>
				      <p>We have sent your comment to the Cafe managers so they are aware of the concerns about the volume of the music. If you need to study in a quiet location and are disturbed by the music in the Cafe area we can suggest other indoor and outdoor areas that could be appealing. Indoor areas include <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/level1/">Level 1</a> by the old library entrance/emergency exits (a personal favorite of many because of all the windows), the Brown Bag study room on the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/lowcon/">Lower Concourse</a>, and many areas of the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/lowlevel/">Lower Level</a>. Outdoor areas include both the ground floor and the &quot;moat&quot; around the old library building directly across from the MU. There are picnic tables dispersed around those areas and it is generally very very quiet. </p>

				      <p>Would it be possible for ILL to demagnetize the books they get from other libraries? It is so inconvenient to have to empty my bag every time I check a book out from ILL and it sets the alarm off. Thanks.<br>

				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>It must be annoying to have the alarm go off all the time. We've checked with ILL and we have good news and bad news for you. The <i>good</i> news is that we can demagnetize books that come through ILL and are going to try to do so more consistently. The <i>bad</i> news: the libraries we borrow these books from may have a different system that our de-magnetizers don't work on. In those cases, the alarm may still go off. </p></td>

				      <p> Sometimes during the day I see a fair number people camping out in front of the few public terminals there are. I am a community card member and I have no choice anymore but to use the public terminals. But as often as not they are all taken and a lot of times by peoople just playing games or chatting for hours on the web. And I don't want to have to wait in line to ask the reference librarian either. Can't we put those public terminals on a timer or something like that so everyone has a fair shot at them? </p>
				      <h3>Library Response:</h3>
				      <p>Thank you very much for your feedback. We have received other comments about how busy our workstations are during the day as well. We are happy to report that are working on making some adjustments to the public workstations so that our customers have a fair chance at accessing them. </p>

                                  <br>
            The Salvation of La Pur&iacute;sima (ISBN: 1915745550) Publisher: Floricanto Press.<br>
                                        <br>
            The novel deals with a group of Mexican migrant workers, and the repurcussions of a failed border crossing. It is a book which would be of interest to many in your community, particularly during this time of immigration policy review and debate.<br>

            Many of you have asked about why a large percentage of the men&acirc;&#8364;&#8482;s room doors have been removed from the stalls. While we know that this removal causes discomfort for some, it was a step the libraries felt was necessary.<br>

            The bathrooms at Hayden library became synonymous with inappropriate behaviors. Despite the increased police presence in the building at various times during the day, calls made by staff to report activities of a unwelcome nature taking place in the bathrooms rose precipitously until we were forced to take action.<br>
                                        <br>
            Removing the doors in the bathroom on the Lower Level was a sad step, but it has proven to be an effective deterrent against unwarranted conduct in the libraries. We understand and apologize for the inconvenience, but we also hope you can appreciate the difficulties of the situation and the need to put the safety of library customers ahead of personal comforts. <br>

                              <p>I am very upset about the changes that have occured lately in the basement study rooms. I have been a regular visitor of these rooms for the last couple of years and have been holing up in them because it is one of the only places on this huge campus where I can be free from any sort of distraction. I am also upset that now there can only be one student in these study rooms at a time. My study partners and I have relied on these rooms for reasons already mentioned and now must retreat to more noisy commons areas. I understand how some students may prefer this set-up, but must all study rooms have locking doors, an individual capacity, and a curfew? It just feels like finding a quiet place to study is becoming very difficult. I suggest mabey removing the doors from some rooms and restoring the older tradition of free study! I am a mature student without the need for restrictions on how and where I can study, especially in the library.</p>

                              <p>We're sorry that you've been inconvenienced by the new service we've added, allowing students to check out individual study rooms. We added this service directly in response to repeated requests from students. The guideline that is set for them to be individual rooms had a very mundane source: the walls in those rooms are thin, and people complain of noise.<br>
                                  <br>
            If you explore Hayden Library, you will find nooks and crannies (one student call them "secret spots") where you can spread out and work in peace. There are a couple of rooms on Level 2 (203) and 3 (332) that have unlocked doors, where several people can work together. If you are looking for more quiet areas specifically we can recommend areas in the back of the Periodicals, Videos and Microforms section on the lower level, in the open area on Level 1 (near the former front doors of Hayden) and around the atrium on Level 2.<br>
                                        <br>
            The library staff are actively evaluating all of our rooms and spaces in the Hayden Library to free up small rooms where groups (two or more students) can study together without the distractions of working in a large open environment. We are  confident we will be able to make progress on that very soon.<br>
                                        <br>
            We truly appreciate your feedback, and encourage you to continue to let us know how we can adapt to better meet your needs.</p>

It's so uncomfortable having to go to the bathroom out in the open like that, and to have to go all the way upstairs to use a private stall is very inconvenient.... I have to either leave all my stuff down there and hope it doesn't get stolen or I have to take everything with me upstairs and into the bathroom. <br>

                              <p>Many of you have asked about why a large percentage of the men's room doors have been removed from the stalls. While we know that this removal causes discomfort for some, it was a step the libraries felt was necessary.<br>
                                  <br>
            The bathrooms at Hayden library became synonymous with inappropriate behaviors. Despite the increased police presence in the building at various times during the day, calls made by staff to report activities of a unwelcome nature taking place in the bathrooms rose precipitously until we were forced to take action.<br>
                                        <br>
            Removing the doors in the bathroom on the Lower Level was a sad step, but it has proven to be an effective deterrent against unwarranted conduct in the libraries. We understand and apologize for the inconvenience, but we also hope you can appreciate the difficulties of the situation and the need to put the safety of library customers ahead of personal comforts. <br>
            Please feel free to contact Library Administration at 965-3417 if you have further questions.<br>

It seems to me that since we come ther so late that proves we're serious students, and that since they make you show ID and have cops roaming around it's safer than it is during the day. Please, can we check out study rooms after midnight? Thanks! </p>

                              <p>We are so glad to know that students are finding those individual study rooms valuable. We created the opportunities for them to be checked out in response to suggestions from students who are members of the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/stuadvis">Libraries Student Advisory Committee</a>.<br>
                                  <br>
            Unfortunately, we must at this time continue to not allow the individual rooms to be checked out overnight. It's understandable that you may find it inconvenient to have to relocate if you are studying in one prior to midnight, or would like to have a secure place to leave your belongings if you need a break in the middle of the night. But truly we feel that it would be difficult for our overnight staff to ensure the security of the areas. Our security staff has a major task to monitor the various nooks and crannies that are found throughout Hayden Library. We are strongly committed to providing the ASU community a safe place to work overnight.<br>
                                        <br>
            There should be many areas in the rest of Hayden Library that would offer quiet study space during the overnight hours. If you would like some assistance identifying an alternative work space, please talk to one of our overnight staff. They are very knowledgeable about the building and may have some ideas for where you could work that you hadn't thought of before.<br>

                              <p>Thanks for expressing your concerns regarding the journals in this subject area. We have checked with the library subject specialist in this area, Deborah Abston, and she is aware of the desire to increase online access to gay and lesbian studies academic journals. Unfortunately, licensing agreements have to be negotiated between the university and the publisher before journals from this publisher are available online. In the meantime, we do have many available in print in the Hayden Library and at Fletcher Library on the West campus. <br>

Ever since the computers got fully function this year, people spend Lots of time on them doing things fully unrelated to the library; it's become a secondary Computing Commons. Which is fine -- it's just that when I have to grab a book between classes, and don't know the call number, it's frustrating waiting three minutes for some guy to finish browsing Facebook.</p>

                              <p>Our computers have become popular, haven't they? It presents us with a challenge of balancing the desire to offer the most computing options possible, with the needs of people like you who need to look something up quickly and obtain your materials in the library. One option you may try, is to use one of the "public" computers (identified by maroon log in screens) that don't require an ASURITE to sign in, and are limited to the internet. These can be found by the Circulation/Check Out desk in both the Hayden and Noble Libraries; near the reference desk on the Lower Concourse of Hayden Library; against the left hand wall on the Upper Concourse of Hayden Library; and on the 3rd Floor of Hayden near Government Documents.Another option is to stop by the Reference/Information desk and ask them to look up the call number for you. They'd be happy to help you with that.<br>

                              <p>There is a problem with SFX not sending complete citations to Refworks. For journal articles, only the staring page number shows up, not the entire page range. The entire page range is absolutely essential to a full bibliographic citation.<br>
                                  <br>
            What this means is that its probably still easier for me to copy citation information by hand into my Endnote file than to download into Refworks, edit by hand to add the end page number, and then export to a file and then import to Endnote.<br>
                                        <br>
            Below is an email I got when I asked Refworks help about this problem.<br>
                                        <br>
            The Get IT option is ASU's Open URL provider SFX. What this means is that SFX is not sending the Entire page range to RefWorks. Until they add this to what they are sending it will not be included in the reference. You can mention this to your Library as they will have to discuss this problem with SFX directly. Until they add this to what is sent you will have to edit your references in RefWorks manually and add the information.</p>

                              <p>Thank you for giving us your feedback about this issue. We agree that having the incomplete citation information is a major problem. Our Systems department is working on a resolution to the issue, short of removing the option of exporting citations from SFX to RefWorks. But it does not appear to be something that will be able to be fixed immediately.<br>
                                  <br>
            In the meantime, however, it is generally recommended that citations be exported directly from the database itself, either using a built in direct export option, or by downloading a text file and then importing it into RefWorks. That option appears to be easier than either editing all individual records, or copying the information into EndNote. There is <a href="http://eastlib.east.asu.edu/research/refworks/index.php">information online</a> with instruction on how to get citation information into RefWorks for many of our databases. If you don't find the database you use in this list, please let us know.</p>

                                  <br>
            Recently, the publisher has added volumes from 1959-1995 to be accessable via an electornic form (i.e., available for download).<br>
                                        <br>
            Does the library plan to subscribe to the back issues electronically?<br>

                              <p>Thank you for your suggestion and recommendation to obtain additional years of "Psychopharmacology" in electronic format. Your request was sent to the subject specialist for this area (Sheila Hofstetter). We are appreciative of your time and valuable feedback about resources that you find useful and important to your projects. <br>
                                  <br>
            Sheila is going to explore your suggestion further by researching costs, and its role in supporting curriculum compared to other recommended titles that we will be considering for future additions. She will get back to you directly and let you know if the additional years of the journal will be added during 2006-2007. <br>
                                        <br>
