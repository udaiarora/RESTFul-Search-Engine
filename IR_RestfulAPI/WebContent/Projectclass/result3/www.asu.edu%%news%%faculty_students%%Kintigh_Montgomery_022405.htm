          <h2>Kintigh, Montgomery garner teaching honors</h2>
          <p>ASU professors Keith Kintigh and Douglas Montgomery have been named ASU Outstanding Doctoral Mentors for 2004 in recognition of their commitment to the learning, preparation, and intellectual and professional growth of their students. </p>
          <p> Kintigh, a professor of anthropology, and Montgomery, a professor of industrial engineering, were presented with the award by the Division of Graduate Studies and the ASU Foundation at a reception on Feb. 10. They are the 21st and 22nd recipients of the award, which includes a $5,000 cash prize. </p>
          <p> Both professors have demonstrated stellar records of chairing doctoral committees and student success, as measured by external grant funding, publications, conference presentations, and career placement, says Maria T. Allison, vice provost and dean of graduate studies. Many of their graduates now enjoy productive professional careers in academia as well as industry. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Dr. Kintigh and Dr. Montgomery are distinguished scholars and researchers in their fields, and have also garnered a reputation by peers and students alike as consummate mentors,&rdquo; Allison says. &ldquo;They have played a critical role in the success of their doctoral students, from their graduate career, to degree completion, to beyond.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Dr. Kintigh and Dr. Montgomery demonstrate every day one of ASU&rsquo;s most important missions &ndash; that of teaching,&rdquo; adds Ira A. Jackson, president and chief executive officer of the ASU Foundation. &ldquo;They create an invigorating learning environment that is inspirational for their students to achieve their dreams. The ASU Foundation is proud to salute these distinguished leaders with the Outstanding Doctoral Mentor Award.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> <img src="facstudents_images/Keith-Kintigh.jpg" alt="Keith Kintigh" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">Kintigh joined ASU as a professor of anthropology in 1987. His mentoring formula combines socializing students into the profession; helping them develop strong research skills while seeking research opportunities; and providing professional support, personal motivation and confidence. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;It is my fortune to have worked with so many superb graduate students at ASU,&rdquo; Kintigh says. &ldquo;To be recognized for that activity, which has already brought me so much satisfaction, is a great honor, one for which I am most grateful.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> <img src="facstudents_images/D_Montgomery.jpg" alt="Douglas Montgomery" width="144" height="202" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="left">Montgomery&rsquo;s career as a professor of industrial engineer at ASU also spans nearly two decades. His mentoring philosophy is founded on the belief that effective mentoring begins with effective teaching. However, a good mentor also must be a role model &ndash; one with a commitment to scholarship and professional service. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Dr. Montgomery is the quintessential role model,&rdquo; writes James Simpson, one of Montgomery &rsquo;s former students and now an associate professor, in his nomination letter. &ldquo;He has earned an international reputation as one of the finest scholars in applied statistics, has graduated nearly 50 Ph.D.s, served as director of our most prestigious journals, and is a fellow of all four of our professional societies. Most strikingly, though, he clearly loves being a professor and a mentor, an affection we find contagious.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Coronado, with the Division of Graduate Studies, can be reached at (480) 965&ndash;5995.</p>
