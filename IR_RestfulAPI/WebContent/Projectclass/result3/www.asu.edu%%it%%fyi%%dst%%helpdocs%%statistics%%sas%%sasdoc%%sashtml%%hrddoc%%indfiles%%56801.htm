This book is designed as a tutorial to help you quickly learn to use the   primary features of the SAS ADX Interface included in SAS/QC software.
The SAS ADX Interface provides a solution for engineers and researchers    who require a point-and-click interface for designing and analyzing
standard experimental designs. You will quickly learn how the SAS ADX      Interface supports the experimentation process through various designs
that offer powerful and reliable model-fitting techniques, interactive     graphics for exploration and optimization, intuitive and flexible
interface text, and HTML formatted reports. Not intended as                comprehensive documentation or an experimental design text, it does
include a glossary of terms and an extensive reference list.
