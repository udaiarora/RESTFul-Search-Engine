  <h2>ECUADOR: The Amazon and the Andes Field School</h2>
  <h3>FAQ: Preparing for the program</h3>
	<a name="passport" id="passport"></a>  
	<p><strong>Do I need a passport?</strong></p>
	 <p>According to the U.S. Department of State, you will need a passport to travel to Ecuador. If you do not already have one, please apply for one as early in advance of the program as possible. For more information about obtaining a U.S. passport, (including downloadable passport forms) please go to the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/passport/passport_1738.html">U.S. Department of State's Website</a> (http://travel.state.gov/passport_services.html).
      </p>
	  <p><strong>ASU Students:</strong> There is a Passport Office on campus in the International Programs Office located at 951 S. Mill Avenue in the Tempe Center at the corner of Mill and University, call 480-965-0877 for more information. For other Passport Office locations and hours in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, please go to <a href="http://clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov/pp_loc.asp">Maricopa County Online</a> (http://www.maricopa.gov/clkcourt/pp_loc.asp).</p>
	<p><strong>All Participants:</strong> Please bring a photocopy of the identification page of your passport with you when traveling abroad. While a copy of your passport cannot replace the original for official purposes, it can facilitate the replacement of your passport if it is lost or stolen. Keep one copy at home and another with you, but separate from your passport, while you travel. Some veteran travelers even suggest taking an extra set of passport photos, too.</p>
	 <hr>
	 <a name="visa" id="visa"></a>
	<p>Will I need a Visa?</p>
	
	<p>According to the U.S. Department of State, Visas are not required for stays of up to 90 days in Ecuador.</p>
	<hr>
	<a name="health" id="health"></a>
	<p><strong>What are the health concerns for traveling to Ecuador and more specifically to the Amazon area?</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State and the Centers for Disease Control recommend that travelers receive the following vaccines prior to travel to tropical South America:</p>
<p>See your doctor at least 4 to 6 weeks before your trip to allow time for immunizations to take effect.</p>
	<ul>
    <li>Hepatitis A or immune globulin (IG).</li>
	<li>Hepatitis B, if you might be exposed to blood (for example, health care workers), have sexual contact with the local population, stay  more than 6 months in the region, or be exposed through medical treatment. </li>
    <li>Rabies, if you might be exposed to wild or domestic animals through your work or recreation.</li>
	<li>Typhoid, particularly if you are visiting developing countries in this region.</li>
	<li>Yellow fever vaccination, if you will be traveling outside urban areas. </li>
	<li>As needed, booster doses for tetanus-diptheria and measles.</li>
	<li>Hepatitis B vaccine is now recommended for all infants and for children ages 11-12 years who did not complete the series as infants. </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
<p>Malaria is not currently active in the area of the upper Napo where the group will be staying. The Program Director, Professor Tod Swanson, resides with his family in this community during the summer months and has never taken malaria medications or experienced problems. Students can make their own decisions in regard to proceeding with malarial treatments and immunizations.</p>
<p>For more information about medical travel safety tips, please consult the following web pages:</p>
	<ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/travel/tropsam.htm">Health Information for Travelers to Tropical South America</a><br /> (http://www.cdc.gov/travel/tropsam.htm) - which includes information on &quot;To Stay Healthy, Do...&quot;, &quot;To Avoid Getting Sick&quot;, and &quot;What You Need to Bring with You&quot; as well as lots of links about the specific diseases and their preventative vaccines.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/travel/foodwater.htm">Food and Water Precautions and Travelers' Diarrhea</a><br />
(http://www.cdc.gov/travel/foodwater.htm)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/travel/regionalmalaria/tropsam.htm">Tropical South America: Malaria Risk and Prevention</a><br />
(http://www.cdc.gov/travel/regionalmalaria/tropsam.htm) - which includes information on anti malarial medication types and how to prevent insect bites.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Students, please consult your home university's or college's student health clinic; they will usually have a travel clinic that will provide these vaccinations for free or a low price if you have student health insurance. (There is such a clinic at ASU's Student Health and they can be reached at 480-965-3349.) If you are insured through your parents' insurance or your own (other than student health), please consult with your HMO/primary care physician in this regard.</p>

	  <p>Dr. Tod Swanson has compiled this list of suggested readings in order to help students prepare for the Field School. These books are not required reading for the program, but rather they are items which will help you to prepare yourself mentally for the trip. Each of these items is available in the Hayden Library on the Arizona State University main campus. For those of you who are not local to ASU, check at your home university or college library. Chances are if they do not have these books, they can interlibrary loan them for you.</p>

	<p>You will probably want to bring one medium size suitcase and a day pack, at max; packing light means that you will have fewer things to lug around and worry about. Also, as a general rule of thumb--if you cannot afford to replace it or would be heartbroken if it was lost or stolen, then don't bring it. So, please leave your nice jewelry and your 100+ CD collection at home. (This is not to say that you cannot bring any CDs--just be moderate in your selection).</p> 
	  <hr>
	  <a name="money" id="money"></a>
	  <p><strong>How much spending money do I need to bring?</strong></p> 
	  
	  <p>All meals, lodgings, and internal transportation within Ecuador are covered by the program fees. There is a $25.00 airport tax that students must pay upon their departure from the Quito Airport. Otherwise, no spending money is required. However, it is a good idea to have an extra $200.00 (about $10.00 per day) for discretionary spending. However, you will probably find that you want to have more money available. This spending money is for extras such as snacks, personal items, phone calls home, gifts to take home, and optional evening entertainment in the cities (for example, during last summer's program, some students went salsa dancing on their own one Friday night in Quito). There are beautiful native weavings and ceramics which you may wish to purchase as gifts or souvenir keepsakes to commemorate your trip. In past years, many students wished that they had brought more money to buy indigenous crafts. Nevertheless, other than the $25.00 airport tax, no spending money is required.</p> 
	  <hr>
	   <a name="checks" id="checks"></a>
	  <p><strong>Should I bring travelers checks?</strong></p> 
	 
	  <p>In the past, we have encouraged students to bring travelers checks. Now, however, we are recommending that participants carry cash (and use a money belt or pouch) for several reasons: 1) Ecuador's economy has been dollarized, meaning that they now use the U.S. dollar as their currency, and 2) for the majority of the program, you will be traveling to and living in rural communities where access to a bank or money exchange office is not guaranteed. During the short amounts of time when the group is in Quito, you will have access to banks and money exchanges.</p>
	  <hr>
	   <a name="telephone" id="telephone"></a>
	  <p><strong>Should I bring a long distance telephone calling card? Will I be able to call home?</strong></p> 
	 
	  <p>When you are in Quito or in the town of Ba&ntilde;os, calling the U.S. is possible. You should bring a long distance calling card. However, during the course of this trip there will be substantial periods of time (thirteen days in the Amazon, for example) when you will not have access to a telephone or e-mail. Even in the Andean communities where there are phones, it is not always possible to call the U.S. As a result, there may be times when you are homesick and cannot call home. If emergencies should occur, however, the faculty members leading the group will find phone as quickly as possible to help you call the U.S. or will make the call for you.</p>
