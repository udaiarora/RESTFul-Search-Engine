      <h2>Studying motor control deficits in elderly helps identify potential
        aids</h2>
      <p>        Through their life spans, people face many changes due to the aging
          process. Whether it's sensory, perceptual or motor performance, the
            changes can often affect a person's ability to operate in the world. </p>
      <p>ASU Professor
          George Stelmach is trying to gain a better understanding of one of
        these major declines by systematically studying motor control
          deficits in the elderly. The main issue for Stelmach, and his colleague
          Natalia Dounskaia, is to determine why movements typically become slower
          and more variable in older adults. </p>
      <p>Through a four-year, $1.3 million
          grant from the National Institute on Aging, the researchers will use
          high-speed motion recorders to analyze
          reaching and aiming movements. </p>
      <p>"It is clear that the population of aging
          adults 65 or older in the United States is entering a period of rapid
          growth, as baby boomers and life
          expectancy increases," says Stelmach. "My overall goal is to use scientific
          technology to identify the mechanisms that underlie movement deficits.
          Over the long term, we hope to better understand these mechanisms so
          targeted interventions to aid the elderly will be successful in the
        future." </p>
      <p>Stelmach says when a person performs a task such as reaching out for
          an object, the movement has two distinct phases. First, the arm moves
          out toward the object, generally following a specific "motion trajectory."
          Then, as the arm nears the object, there is a slight modification of
          the movement, a sort of fine-tuning to better target the object. This
          second movement is done in a split second and goes unseen by the eye,
        but can be spotted using the high-speed data capture.</p>
      <p>For many older people,
          however, Stelmach says the trajectory is often less than that of someone
          younger. He also has found that an older person
          will begin making adjustments much earlier and more frequently. These
          findings suggest that the movement structure of an elderly person's
        movement is very different from those of the young.</p>
      <p>Stelmach says the cause for
          this decline is currently unknown. He does theorize that it could be
          due to some form of motor planning or even
        a slight loss of feeling in the extremities. </p>
      <p>He believes finding the
          root cause of these seemingly subtle changes could have long-term quality
          of life implications. Given the importance
          and high costs of health care for elderly adults, technology that could
          improve health maintenance and health care, or reduce the associated
        costs, would be especially valuable.</p>
      <p>"I think this could be an important
          breakthrough," he says. "The better we understand these declines, the
          better we can account for them and
        improve people's lives."</p>
      <p>Stelmach's work with high-speed motion capture
          continues similar research in the Motor Control Laboratory in the ASU
          Kinesiology Department. Stelmach
          is currently working on several other research projects supported by
          the National Institutes of Neurological Diseases and Stroke and is
        the principal investigator for grants totaling more than $7 million.</p>
