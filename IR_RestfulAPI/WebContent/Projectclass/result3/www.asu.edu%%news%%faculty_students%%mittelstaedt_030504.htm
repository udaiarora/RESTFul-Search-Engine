      <h2><strong>Wharton Top Executive Named Business Dean at Arizona State University </strong></h2>
      <p align="center"><img src="facstudents_images/Mittelstaedt_030504.jpg" alt="Robert E. Mittelstaedt, Jr." width="216" height="324" align="right">Wharton School Vice Dean and Director of the Aresty Institute of Executive Education Robert E. Mittelstaedt, Jr., has been named the new dean of the W. P. Carey School of Business at ASU, effective June 30. The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania consistently ranks at or near the top in all major national business school rankings. </p>
      <p>Mittelstaedt has held various academic and administrative positions at Wharton since 1973. Currently, he is responsible for Wharton's $43 million executive education business, with more than 220 programs serving some 8,000 executives and senior managers worldwide each year at the program's 103-room hotel and conference center. </p>
      <p>"Bob Mittelstaedt fundamentally understands, from his work at Wharton and his personality, how to build a business school that is totally engaged in business, in education, in business research - he gets the whole picture," says Crow. "He brings an energy, excitement, and entrepreneurial spirit that will lift the school to even greater national prominence." </p>
      <p>The Carey School last year received a $50 million gift from Wm. Polk Carey, chairman of W. P. Carey &amp; Co. LLC, a New York City-based investment firm, on behalf of the W. P. Carey Foundation, to endow the ASU Business School. </p>
      <p>"I'm honored to accept the deanship of the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University," says Mittelstaedt. "The name alone signals significant strength, ethics and superior quality, and the people and programs back that up with a high degree of professionalism and expertise. I'm very impressed with the exceptional faculty, staff and student body, and I'm looking forward to working with everyone at the W. P. Carey School and across ASU as we push further into what I believe will be an exciting future." </p>
      <p>At Wharton, Mittelstaedt was instrumental in developing a number of unique programs for specific audiences, including an innovative program for corporate directors that has run since 1993 in the United States and the United Kingdom, and is being extended to Canada and Spain. He also co-created a number of company-sponsored research forums, including the Wharton Electronic Commerce Forum, and oversaw the development of <em>knowledge@wharton </em>, a respected online business magazine and research resource with 310,000 subscribers worldwide. </p>
      <p>Mittelstaedt said he looks forward to advancing the work already under way to position the school of business nationally and globally as a premier undergraduate, graduate, executive and specialty business education leader. </p>
      <p>The undergraduate program at the W. P. Carey School of Business is ranked 21st in the nation by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report </em>, and the MBA program is ranked 17th in the nation among public programs. </p>
      <p>Mittelstaedt's strong fund-raising background will be a significant asset as ASU positions itself for its next major fund-raising campaign. While maintaining the executive education division at Wharton, he took on the added responsibility of being associate dean for external affairs in the first three years of a $350 million campaign, which was successfully completed last year with a total of $425 million raised. </p>
      <p>Mittelstaedt also has corporate experience, having co-founded and served as chairman and CEO of Intellego, Inc., a firm specializing in medical office/outpatient data and billing systems. He currently serves on three boards of directors: Laboratory Corporation of America (NYSE: LH), a $3 billion laboratory testing business; HIP Foundation, the holding company for a one-million member HMO in New York; and Innovative Solutions &amp; Support (NASDQ: ISSC), a rapidly growing aviation instrumentation company. </p>
      <p>From 1965 to 1970, Mittelstaedt served as a U.S. Naval officer in the nuclear submarine program. He received the Vietnam Service Medal and Meritorious Unit Commendation. </p>
      <p>Mittelstaedt received a B.S. in mechanical engineering from Tulane University, and an M.B.A. from the Wharton School in operations management. He is married and has three grown children. </p>
      <p>Mittelstaedt replaces former W. P. Carey School Dean Larry E. Penley, who last year was named president of Colorado State University. </p>
