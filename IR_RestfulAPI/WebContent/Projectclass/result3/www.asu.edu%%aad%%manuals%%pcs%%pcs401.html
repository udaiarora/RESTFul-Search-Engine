If capital equipment is not tagged or identified within two weeks of processing a receiver document online, the department receiving the equipment should contact Property Control. Sometimes delays in tagging may be due to locked doors and professors not being available.<p>The ASU PC&#035; is applied to the capital equipment unless the size or nature makes it impractical.  The ASU PC&#035; is affixed to the front, or near the front, to be seen easily and to aid in the inventory process.  Most capital equipment is permanently identified by scribing the ASU PC&#035; next to the serial number.<p>If government furnished property is being received, appropriate government tags will be placed on the equipment. Please refer to <a href="pcs403.html">PCS 403</a>, &#147;Receiving Government-Furnished Equipment.&#148;<p><b>Retagging Capital Equipment</b><p>Capital equipment remains identified as university- or sponsor-owned equipment as long as it is in the custody, possession, or control of the university.  Such marking and identification are removed or obliterated from the equipment only when sold, disposed of, or scrapped. Should the ASU PC&#035; accidentally or mistakenly be obliterated, defaced, or removed, the equipment is retagged using the identical ASU PC&#035;.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Tagging Noncapital Equipment</b></font><p>Property Control does not identify or <a href="pcs004.html#tag" target="new">tag</a> equipment with an acquisition cost of less than &#036;5,000.  If the department has an interest in identifying, tagging, and tracking equipment costing less than &#036;5,000, the department may use identification labels available from ASU Property Control. Also, the department may use Property Control&#146;s Web site to add noncapital property to the database. For more information, e-mail Property Control at <a href="mailto:property-q@asu.edu">property-q@asu.edu</a>. <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Insurance Coverage for Equipment</b></font><p>Equipment that has not been properly identified and tagged with an ASU PC&#035; may not be covered for insurance by ASU Insurance Services. Therefore, the department should contact Property Control if the capital <a href="pcs004.html#asset" target="new">asset</a> has not been tagged within two weeks of being received.<p><img src="pcshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Procedure</b></font><a href="pcs401table.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">D</font></a></center><img src="pcshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p><hr noshade><table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1><tr><th>Responsibility<hr></th><th>Action<hr></th></tr><tr valign=TOP><td>Department receiving equipment</td><td><ol><li>Verify that the equipment is as specified and in good condition.</li></ol></td></tr><tr valign=TOP><td></td><td><ol start="2"><li>Notify Purchasing and Business Services and Payables and Reimbursements immediately of any discrepancy in equipment received.</li></ol></td></tr><p><tr valign=TOP><td></td><td><ol start="3"><li>Enter a receiver document (RC) online for the equipment.</li></ol></td></tr><p><tr><td></td><td>If the department does not have online capability:</td></tr><tr valign=TOP><td></td><td><ol start="4"><li>Send a memo to Payables and Reimbursements.
