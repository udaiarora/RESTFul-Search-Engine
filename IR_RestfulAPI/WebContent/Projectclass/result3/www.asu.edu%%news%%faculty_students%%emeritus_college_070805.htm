          <h2>Emeritus College taps into wealth of ASU expertise </h2>
          <p>When Taki Atsumi retired from the ASU music faculty in 2000, he didn&rsquo;t put his cello in the closet or sell it at the pawn shop. </p>
          <p> Instead, Atsumi has continued a full schedule of playing and teaching &ndash; and will perform at the opening convocation for ASU&rsquo;s new Emeritus College at 2 p.m., July 8, at Old Main. </p>
          <p> The college, in which emeriti faculty will serve pro bono, will enrich the community, university, students &ndash; and retirees themselves, says Richard Jacob, professor emeritus of physics and founding dean of the college. </p>
          <p> Instead of letting their years of expertise go to waste, these professors will be available to mentor junior faculty, advise students and serve as substitute teachers. </p>
          <p> The college also will be a community resource, with lists of scholars, artists and musicians who are available for lectures, exhibits and concerts. </p>
          <p> The emeriti faculty will have opportunities to explore, in a university setting, areas they have felt drawn to but had little time to pursue. </p>
          <p> Mark Reader, for example, a professor of political science, took up painting after a 50-year hiatus. He will exhibit his watercolors at the convocation. Also showing artwork &ndash; acrylic on canvas paintings &ndash; will be John Aguilar, a professor of anthropology. </p>
          <p> While most universities &ndash; including ASU &ndash; have organizations for retired faculty, these typically focus on benefits coverage and other issues, Jacob says. ASU&rsquo;s new Emeritus College, however, is unique in its setup &ndash; and unique in Arizona. It will focus on research, teaching, community service and intellectual engagement, drawing faculty out of retirement and engaging professors as they finish their teaching careers. </p>
          <p> The college is focused around six interest centers: </p>
          <p> &bull; Center for Issues in K-12 Education. </p>
          <p> &bull; Center for Innovations in Instruction. </p>
          <p> &bull; Center for Mentoring. </p>
          <p> &bull; Center for ASU History and Tradition. </p>
          <p> &bull; Center for Fine Arts. </p>
          <p> &bull; Emeritus Center for Writing. </p>
          <p> These centers may come and go as interests change, and there also are several non-center-related activities. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Each center is designed to attract faculty who have that expertise,&rdquo; Jacob says. </p>
          <p> The centers have no set form and can take whatever direction the participants wish. </p>
          <p> The idea for the Emeritus College began to take shape in the spring of 2003. Jacob, who reluctantly takes credit for the college&rsquo;s birth, says he had been &ldquo;thinking about a lot of issues involving retirement.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> He studied retiree organizations at other colleges but concluded that &ldquo;they weren&rsquo;t doing a lot.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> &ldquo;I sent an e-mail to ASU President Michael Crow suggesting that we form an emeritus college, and he sent a note back saying it was a good idea. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;He wanted an emeritus college that would set ASU apart and distinguish us.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Jacob began meeting with members of ASU&rsquo;s faculty emeriti association, and in June 2004 the steering committee submitted a plan for the college to Crow and Milton Glick, ASU&rsquo;s executive vice president and provost. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Our primary focus is continued engagement for the retired faculty, both with their university and their intellectual and artistic fields,&rdquo; Jacobs says. </p>
          <p> Invitations have been extended to ASU&rsquo;s emeritus faculty, to emeriti faculty from other universities who live in the Phoenix area and to faculty who retired from ASU but did not achieve emeritus status. Jacob hopes to have 200 faculty on board by Sept. 1. </p>
          <p> The new college&rsquo;s faculty are enthusiastic and ready to go, including Loretta Bardewyck, the founding dean of the College of Nursing, who was one of the first to sign up &ndash; even though she&rsquo;s in her late 80s. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Although retiring faculty often claim to be happy to get away from exams and homework,&rdquo; Jacob said, &ldquo;most will admit that the prospect of no longer teaching in the classroom is bittersweet at best, because they have come to rely on teaching to maintain their own intellectual keenness &ndash; and they miss the contact with bright young minds.&rdquo; </p>
          <p>Smith, with Marketing &amp; Strategic Communications, can be reached at (480) 965-4821 or (jps@asu.edu).</p>
