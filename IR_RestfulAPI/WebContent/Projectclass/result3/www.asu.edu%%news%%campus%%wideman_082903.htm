      <h2>John Edgar Wideman to be first ASU distinguished visiting writer </h2>
      <p>This
          fall more than ever, Arizona State University is offering the Arizona
            community a host of public opportunities for intellectual engagement.</p>
      <p>This September, ASU's new Center for Creative Writing is unveiling a
        series of public lectures, the Distinguished Visiting Writers Series.
        Presented in collaboration with the Scottsdale Center for the Arts and
        aimed at broadening the public reach of ASU's exceptional creative writing
        program, the series will bring visiting writers of the highest caliber
        to the Phoenix area. </p>
      <p>The series begins September 18 with a reading by award-winning novelist
        and renowned memoirist John Edgar Wideman,. </p>
      <p>Wideman, whose first book was completed at the prestigious University
        of Iowa Writers' Workshop and published in 1967, is the author of more
        than a dozen books. </p>
      <p>The winner of numerous awards and honors, Wideman was the second African
        American winner of the famous Rhodes Scholarship, and is the only writer
        yet to twice win the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. Wideman's many other
        awards include the American Book Award for Fiction, the Lannan Literary
        Fellowship for Fiction and the MacArthur Award. Wideman has also had
        the honor of serving as editor for the annual anthology, The Best American
        Short Stories.</p>
      <p>        Wideman has contributed frequently to such magazines as The New Yorker,
          Vogue, Esquire and The New York Times Magazine. Wideman is currently
          a Distinguished Professor of English at the University of Massachusetts
          at Amherst.</p>
      <p>Wideman was born in Washington, DC to a working-class black family in
        1941. Before his first birthday, Wideman's family moved from Washington
        to Homewood, an African-American community in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
        Homewood has served as the backdrop of many of Wideman's novels. A basketball
        star in addition to a classroom wiz kid as a boy, Wideman attended the
        University of Pennsylvania on a Benjamin Franklin scholarship. At U Penn,
        Wideman won a creative writing prize and admission to the Phi Beta Kappa
        honors fraternity. His stellar performance at U Penn, on the court and
        in the classroom, and his garnering of the prestigious Rhodes upon graduation
        in 1963, made Wideman the subject of a Look Magazine article, "The Astonishing
        John Wideman."</p>
      <p>Wideman achieved his boyhood dream of becoming a great novelist and
        scholar, but not by leaving behind his background. Wideman's brother
        Robby was convicted and sentenced to life for a murder to which he was
        allegedly an accomplice in 1976. This became the subject of his memoir,
        Brothers and Keepers, a book that received international attention. In
        this and other writing, Wideman portrays from first-hand experience the
        complex and sometimes inescapable problems and animosities facing African-Americans
        today and in the past. </p>
      <p>His fiction has echoed his racial concerns. In one of his most recent
        novels, The Cattle Killings, Wideman tells the story of a black preacher
        and his followers who nurse patients during Philadelphia's 1793 yellow
        fever epidemic only to be killed later, blamed for having caused the
        plague.</p>
      <p>According to The New York Times, Wideman is one of America's premier
        writers of fiction. Laura Miller of Salon writes that while in his memoirs,
        "John Edgar Wideman's life is as dramatic as any of his brooding, Faulknerian
        novels" his fictional writing is also a "potent, lyrical voice [that]
        picks up strands of Shakespeare and Poe, as well as more ancient storytelling
        traditions."</p>
      <p>Wideman's lecture will be held on Thursday, September 18, 2003 at 7:30
        p.m. at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts. Admission is $10. For more
        information on this and other lectures in the series, email <a href="mailto:clasevents@asu.edu">clasevents@asu.edu</a>  or
        call 480-965-0051.</p>
      <p>Future visiting writers in the inaugural 2003 series will include the
        US Poet Laureate Billy Collins on Friday, October 3 and the novelist
        and Arizona native Janet Burroway on Thursday, October 16. Locations
        and ticket prices will vary.</p>
