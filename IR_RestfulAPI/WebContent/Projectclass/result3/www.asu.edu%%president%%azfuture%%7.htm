        2002: Auburn University will receive a <strong>$20 million match</strong> 
        from the state for <strong>$20 million</strong> in Federal money for construction 
        of the <strong>194,000 square foot center for transportation technology</strong> 
        on campus. The center will house researchers developing analytical approaches 
        to highway design and construction, traffic modeling and vehicle safety. 
      </p>
      <p>2001: Gov. Don Siegelman agreed to provide <strong>$35 million</strong> 
        from a state economic development fund to boost a <strong>$90 million 
        biomedical research facility at UAB</strong>. He also announced formation 
        of the <strong>Alabama Research Alliance</strong>, a state, business and 
        research university partnership designed to boost the state's research 
        investment.</p>
      <p> <strong><a name="ca"></a>California </strong><br>
        2002: Proposition 47 (approved by voters November 2002) will provide <strong>$13.05 
        billion</strong> in bonds, issued and repaid by the state of California 
        for the construction and modernization of elementary, secondary and higher 
        education facilities. $1.65 billion is reserved for college campuses. 
        The governor and Legislature will select the projects to be paid for by 
        the bond dollars and some this funding will likely go toward the completion 
        of a <strong>new science building at Cal State Long Beach</strong> that 
        will contain state-of-the-art teaching and research laboratories for chemists, 
        biochemists and biologists.</p>
      <p>2001-2002: <strong>UC Davis</strong> constructed a <strong>$39.6 million 
        Plant and Environmental Sciences Building</strong> with half the funding 
        provided by state bonds and the other half through campus funds. UC Davis 
        is also set to open a <strong>$95 million Genome and Biomedical Center</strong> 
        in 2004 funded in part by the Whitaker Foundation with the remaining funding 
        from the Garamendi legislation (the Garamendi law allows the university 
        to take out a construction loan and then pay it off using the overhead 
        charges to research grants that would otherwise be funneled to the state). 
      </p>
      <p>December 2000: California Gov. Gray Davis announced establishment of 
        the California Institutes for Science and Innovation, which will be underwritten 
        by <strong>$300 million in state funds over four years and more than twice 
        that amount from corporate sponsors</strong>. There will be <strong>three 
        major research institutions dedicated to nanotechnology, biotechnology 
        and telecommunications and computing</strong>. </p>
      <p>The institutions, comprising joint ventures among campuses in the University 
        of California system, are intended to increase the competitiveness of 
        the state's economy by focusing on technology challenges from transportation 
        to agriculture. </p>
      <p>They will include these components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong> The California Nanosystems Institute, at the University of 
          California at Los Angeles in collaboration with the University of California 
          at Santa Barbara</strong>, which will focus on the development of extremely 
          miniaturized technologies. </li>
        <li><strong>The California Institute for Bioengineering, Biotechnology 
          and Quantitative Biomedicine, at the University of California at San 
          Francisco</strong> in collaboration with the University of California 
          at Berkeley and the University of California at Santa Cruz. </li>
        <li><strong>The California Institute for Telecommunications and Information 
          Technology</strong>, at the University of California at San Diego in 
          collaboration with the University of California at Irvine, whose work 
          will include development of a more powerful, wireless Internet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><a name="fl"></a>Florida</strong><br>
        October 2002: A new <strong>$180-million addition</strong> to the H. Lee 
        Moffitt Center, the Vincent A. Stabile Research Building, which is to 
        be completed in April 2003, will add <strong>350,000 square feet of research 
        space</strong> that can be used as a recruitment tool and help USF gain 
        national recognition as a Research I university. The new research center 
        will have three floors of research laboratories and will provide Moffitt 
        with research and clinical areas as well as a conference center and auditorium. 
        The project's approved budget is $122 million and is expected to reach 
        $180 million when the multi-phased project is completed in the next few 
        years. </p>
      <p>In June, Vincent A. Stabile, local philanthropist and retired businessman, 
        donated $15 million to the Moffitt Center. The money is the largest private 
        donation ever made to the Moffitt Center, which opened in 1986. The Stabile 
        building will be one of many additions made to the Moffitt Center over 
        the next few years. </p>
      <p>The tower project is funded by multiple sources, including the majority 
        financed by the James L. Stevens Act as part of the tobacco settlement 
        that was passed in May 2002. The Stevens Act provides that a portion of 
        the cigarette tax be paid monthly to the Board of Directors of the Moffitt 
        Center to finance cancer research at USF. Moneys transferred to the Board 
        of Directors of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute 
        will be used to secure financing to pay costs related to constructing, 
        furnishing, and equipping the cancer research facility. Financing for 
        the Moffitt Center will come in the form of tax exempt bonds by a local 
        authority, municipality, or county. </p>

        Since 1990 the State has invested <strong>$200 million</strong> in the 
        Georgia Research Alliance, matched by <strong>$50 million</strong> from 
        the private sector. This has resulted in an additional <strong>$500 million</strong> 
        from the federal government in increased grants and contracts awarded 
        competitively based on the increased merit and achievement of the research 
        enterprise built at the six research universities.</p>
      <p>The enterprise has doubled since 1990, from $400 million annually to 
        over <strong>$800 million</strong>. Venture capital has tripled, patents 
        awarded have tripled and industry relationships with university researchers 
        have more than quadrupled.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="id"></a>Idaho</strong><br>
        2002: Governor Dirk Kempthorne approved the use by <strong>Idaho State 
        University</strong> of about <strong>$1 million</strong> in funds to build 
        an <strong>expansion of the Idaho Accelerator Center in Pocatello</strong>. 
        Despite poor state tax revenues, Kempthorne says school President Richard 
        Bowen's responsible fiscal management and planning helped him feel comfortable 
        authorizing the construction. </p>
      <p> <strong><a name="il"></a>Illinois</strong><br>
        October 7, 2002: Gov. George Ryan&#8217;s VentureTech program will provide 
        <strong>$123 million to the University of Illinois</strong> so it can 
        develop three high-tech research facilities on its Urbana-Champaign campus. 
        The money is separate from the state&#8217;s higher education budget and 
        will be included in the state budget for the current fiscal year, approved 
        in June. The disbursement includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> $67.5 million for the Post Genomic Institute<strong><br>
          </strong>The 110,000-square-foot building will include laboratories 
          and facilities for scientists from several disciplines to study plant 
          genomics and conduct cutting-edge biotechnology research. The institute 
          will focus on the development of new technologies and capitalize on 
          the biology/engineering interface, growth in the field of biotechnology 
          and expansion into commercialization. A few of the research examples 
          include new varieties of corn and pest-resistant soybeans, improvements 
          in animal sciences, biofarming, and farmaceuticals &#8211; the production 
          of pharmaceuticals through the modification of animals&#8217; genetic 
          material.<br>
          The Post Genomic Institute was put on hold by Ryan last fall to help 
          cover a budget shortfall, but money for the project was reinstated in 
          his budget recommendation after the first of the year.</li>
        <li> <strong>$27 million for a new National Center for Supercomputing 
          Applications building</strong><br>
          A new 127,000-square-foot building will house the NCSA offices and research 
          labs. Staff and equipment for NCSA are now spread among seven buildings 
          on campus.</li>
        <li> <strong>$18 million to expand the Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory</strong><br>
          The Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory provides space for research 
          in microelectronics and optoelectronics. Plans to expand the lab will 
          add 45,000 square feet to support new research and promote economic 
          development activities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Construction of the buildings, which will occupy a total of nearly <strong>230,000 
        square feet</strong>, will begin this year. There is no official timeline 
        for the project, but all three buildings are expected to be completed 
        within the next two years. Gov. Ryan&#8217;s office estimates the project 
        will create 1,500 construction jobs. </p>
      <p>Gov. Ryan&#8217;s VentureTech program is a $2 billion, five-year program 
        Gov. Ryan launched in 2000 to invest state resources in technology. The 
        program is funding projects like the construction of research facilities 
        at Northwestern University's Chicago campus and the University of Illinois 
        at Chicago. VentureTech has also funded the following &#8220;bricks and

      <p> <strong><a name="ks"></a>Kansas </strong><br>
        September 2002: <strong>Kansas State University</strong> officials broke 
        ground on the new <strong>$7 million Bioprocessing and Industrial Value-Added 
        Program facility, an agriculture research building</strong>. A project 
        of KSU's grain science and industry department, the facility will provide 
        space for an existing extrusion laboratory plus a new fermentation laboratory. 
        When completed in about two years, the BIVAP building will enable entrepreneurs 
        to work with KSU faculty members to develop value-added products using 
        Kansas' grain production as a way of stimulating commercial demand for 
        the state's annual crop bounty. The BIVAP facility also will provide pilot 
        space for private industry interests to test such processes as plastic 
        molding and thermal processing of grains. Funding for the facility has 
        been provided by a <strong>$3 million appropriation from the Legislature 
        and a $4 million state loan</strong>. The BIVAP facility is planned as 
        the <strong>first in a new five-building complex</strong> that will provide 
        a new home on the campus' north side for the teaching and research programs 
        sponsored by the grain science and industry department. Construction of 
        the next two structures on the site is expected to be underway within 
        the next 12 months, including a flour mill and the international grains 
        program conference center. A state-of-the-art feed mill, followed by the 
        final element of the complex, a proposed combination classroom and administrative 
        center, will complete the complex, perhaps as early as 2010. The cost 
        of the overall project is estimated at $60 million, to be substantially 
        funded by non-public sources. </p>
      <p> <strong><a name="mi"></a>Michigan</strong><br>
        1999-2002: In May 1999 the University of Michigan committed <strong>$200 
        million</strong> for the establishment of a <strong>life sciences</strong> 
        institute and by 2002 the University of Michigan is spending <strong>about 
        $700 million on new life sciences research facilities including a Life 
        Sciences Institute Building</strong>, a <strong>236,000 gross square foot</strong> 
        state-of-the-art research laboratory building. Construction costs are 
        estimated at $96 million with construction scheduled to be completed summer 
        2003. University of Michigan is also investing in roughly <strong>$220 
        million</strong> for a new <strong>Biomedical Science Research Building</strong>. 
        The state has set aside $1 billion to develop its Michigan Life Sciences 
        Corridor over the next 20 years.</p>
      <p> <strong><a name="mn"></a>Minnesota </strong><br>
        October 1999: University of Minnesota broke ground for its new <strong>$79 
        million Molecular and Cellular Biology building</strong> expected to be 
        completed in 2002. Governor Ventura&#8217;s capital budget recommends 
        major asset preservation improvements including $35 million to complete 
        the Molecular and Cellular Biology building at the University of Minnesota, 
        and $10 million to match an equal amount of private funds for construction 
        of a <strong>Microbial and Plant Genomics building</strong>. </p>
      <p><strong><a name="mo"></a>Missouri<br>
        </strong>September 2002: Gov. Bob Holden pledged to provide <strong>$31 
        million in state funds</strong> for a <strong>life sciences building</strong> 
        that business leaders hope will boost Kansas City into the top ranks of 
        bioresearch centers in the nation. The building would house the university's 
        schools of Pharmacy and Nursing and cutting-edge laboratory and research 
        facilities, university officials said. Holden said he would release $1.7 
        million immediately, which will allow the university to begin seeking 
        an architect to design the project. Even in tough economic times, he said, 
        the state must make investments that will make Missouri a leader in research 
        and development of new products.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="ne"></a>Nebraska</strong><br>
        2002: <strong>Creighton University Medical Center</strong> is squeezing 
        a six-story science center between buildings. It also is renovating existing 
        space into a neuroscience lab that can be used only by NIH-funded scientists. 
        Creighton currently has tax-exempt financing in place and has received 
        oral commitments to substantially cover the costs of the new building. 
      </p>
      <p>2001: In December, the board approved the renovation of approximately 
        33,000 gross square feet to help support UNMC&#8217;s growing research 
        enterprise. In light of budget constraints, UNMC has reconsidered plans 
        to complete the project prior to occupancy of its new Research Center 
        of Excellence, a 10-level research building which is expected to open 
        in September 2003.</p>
      <p> <strong><a name="nj"></a>New Jersey</strong><br>
        September 2002: <strong>University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey</strong> 
        has embarked on a $518 million building program to house new research, 
        classroom and clinical space. Four years ago the university began a major 
        push to improve its research capabilities, including programs in cancer, 
        cardiovascular disease, neuroscience and injury caused by trauma.</p>
      <p>The university has already completed the <strong>International Center 
        for Public Health</strong>, a <strong>$78 million building</strong> in 
        Newark, with the help of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority 
        (EDA). The EDA financing and real estate capabilities are both being used 
        for the project. The State of New Jersey provided an $18 million appropriation 
        to the EDA for site acquisition, relocation, design and improvement costs. 
        The EDA sold <strong>$46 million in low-interest, long-term bonds</strong> 
        for the project, and the balance is being funded through various grants 
        and loans obtained by UMDNJ and University Heights Science Park. A new 
        <strong>$37 million behavioral health science building</strong> is set 
        to open in Newark next spring, and UMDNJ is building a new <strong>$45 
        million research tower for molecular biology</strong> in Piscataway. </p>
      <p><strong>Rutgers</strong> has plans for two new medical research buildings 
        - A <strong>$28 million complex</strong> that will house Dr. Tischfield's 
        <strong>genetics programs and biomaterials research</strong>, and a <strong>$23.8 
        million center for biomedical engineering</strong>. Both buildings, financed 
        by state higher education funds, a bond offering and Rutgers's own capital 
        campaign, are to open in 2004.</p>
      <p>Summer 2002: <strong>University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey</strong> 
        broke ground on a <strong>$100 million, seven-story cancer center</strong> 
        in Newark that will include a hospital complex along with cancer research 
        labs. It is also tripling the size of its cancer <strong>facility in New 
        Brunswick with a $71 million, 150,000-square foot building</strong>. In 
        addition, the university's <strong>Cancer Institute of New Jersey will 
        receive $20 million in financing from the state's tobacco settlement fund.</strong>The 
        buildings are to be financed through <strong>$95 million in state bonding</strong> 
        authorized by the Whitman administration and an additional $280 million 
        in bonds underwritten by the university alone. The university will finance 
        the rest of the construction with gifts to the university and other internal 
        funds.</p>
      <p> <strong><a name="nm"></a>New Mexico</strong><br>
        2002: Voters passed Bond Measure B, which allows the state to issue general-obligation 
        bonds in an amount not to exceed $93.4 million to pay for facilities at 
        public schools and colleges.</p>
      <p> <strong><a name="ny"></a>New York</strong><br>
        In 2001, the New York State Legislature approved <strong>Gen*NY*sis</strong>, 
        a $225 million fund created to promote the biotechnology industry. <strong>Gen*NY*sis</strong>&#8217; 
        budget includes $225 million during the next three years and is part of 
        a $1.2 billion capital program to expand businesses and create new high-tech 
        and biotech businesses in the state. </p>
      <p>2002: During September 2002 Gov. Pataki announced three major Gen*NY*sis 
        investments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> September 2002: The<strong> University at Albany</strong> will build 
          a <strong>$45 million, 125,000-square-foot Center for Excellence in 
          Cancer Genomics</strong> at its East Campus, the hub of the school's 
          biotechnology efforts. Much of the work at the new center will be devoted 
          to understanding metastasis, or the spread of cancerous cells. But researchers 
          also plan to test ways of treating cancer as well. UAlbany&#8217;s East 
          Campus works on a &quot;co-location&quot; model, where academic research 
          is conducted in the same buildings (and even laboratories). Besides 
          university scientists, researchers from the Stratton Veterans Affairs 
          Medical Center Hospital in Albany and Taconic Biotechnology, which now 
          operates at the East Campus, will also be included in the project. Other 
          companies, including Swiss drug-discovery firm Smart Gene and Tarrytown 
          drug maker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., both of which already have 
          facilities at the East Campus, would likely take space in the new building. 
          Other, smaller companies are also being sought as tenants. The state's 
          $225 million <strong>Gen*NY*sis</strong> science fund will kick in <strong>$22.5 
          millio</strong>n. The university, along with private business, will 
          add the rest. The state's outlay will include $19 million for the building, 
          $2.5 million for equipment and $1 million to match federal grants. The 
          exact amounts of private-sector funding haven&#8217;t been determined. 
          When it opens, the project is expected to create 230 jobs. Construction 
          will start in the spring and last 18 months. Gov. George Pataki said 
          the announcement, coupled with a plan to open a <strong>$403 million 
          microchip research and development facility called International Sematech 
          North at UAlbany</strong> this fall, will make the region &quot;a worldwide 
          leader in high-tech and biotech research and economic development.&quot; 
        </li>
        <li>September 2002: The state will provide <strong>$48 million</strong> 
          to support a <strong>$71.5 million partnership between industry and 
          university groups</strong> on Long Island to bolster biotechnology and 
          educational and research programs, according to Gov. George Pataki's 
          office. Included in the Long Island project is $35 million for the Bioinformatics 
          Research Center at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and a $20 million incubator 
          at the state University at Farmingdale's bioscience park. Funding for 
          the project is being provided through state economic development programs, 
          including Gen*NY*sis. </li>
        <li>September 2002: <strong>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</strong> 
          will receive <strong>$22.5 million</strong> from the state to create 
          a <strong>Center for Bioengineering and Medicine</strong>. The research 
          center will be housed in RPI's Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary 
          Studies, an $80 million, 218,000-square-foot facility currently being 
          built on RPI's Troy, N.Y. campus. The state grant will pay for infrastructure 
          support, laboratory equipment, and facilities. Research will be conducted 
          in drug synthesis, biosensors and monitoring, and tissue repair and 
          replacement. About 290 people will work at the center and the construction 
          phase of the project will generate 250 jobs. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to Gen*NY*sis funds, during September 2002 Governor Pataki 
        announced the following investments in research space:</p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li> September 2002: The $30 million pledged to the <strong>University 
          of Rochester Medical Center</strong> by Gov. Pataki will mean new tenants 
          for Rochester Technology Park and seed money for start-up biotechnology 
          companies. Part of the long-awaited grant -- <strong>about $20 million 
          -- also will pay for completing construction and equipment purchases 
          at the medical center&#8217;s new research buildings</strong>, which 
          UR officials described as essential for the recruitment of scientists 
          and technicians. UR officials estimate the $30 million -- the largest 
          single contribution to the medical center&#8217;s research efforts -- 
          will create 3,500 jobs at the medical center, related vendors and spin-off 
          companies and in construction. It is also projected to help produce 
          $45 million in venture capital and royalties. UR will use about $5 million 
          to support a partnership with Rochester Technology Park in Gates. The 
          venture, University Technology Partners Inc., will help commercialize 
          UR research discoveries. About $5 million will be used to lease tech 
          park space for start-ups created from UR biomedical research, said Mark 
          Scheuerman, president and chief executive of UTP. </li>
        <li>September 2002: Governor Pataki announced that state taxpayers will 
          supply <strong>$20 million of the $35 million</strong> needed to build 
          the first phase of a proposed <strong>240,000 square-foot Central New 
          York Biotechnology Research Center</strong>. The biotech center, jointly 
          run by S<strong>UNY Upstate Medical University and the SUNY College 
          of Environmental Science and Forestry</strong>, will eventually grow 
          to encompass <strong>three buildings</strong> and cost <strong>$80 million</strong>. 
          The first phase will be 80,000 square feet on less than an acre leased 
          from the Syracuse Veterans Affairs Medical Center and will cost $35 
          million. To complete that phase, center officials plan to seek $10 million 
          from the federal government and raise the remaining $5 million from 
          other sources. Grants from federal agencies such as the National Institutes 
          of Health are expected to pay for equipment for the center. The second 
          and third phases are expected to cost about $22.5 million each. Each 
          building will be about 80,000 square feet. Researchers will study plants 
          and animals in hopes of finding solutions to medical and environmental 
          issues. The $20 million state contribution is $5 million more than the 
          colleges expected to receive to get the project started. Officials touted 
          the center as a boon for the local economy, initially generating 250 
          jobs with the possibility that it will create 1,000 jobs once all three 
          phases of the complex are complete. Groundbreaking for the first phase 
          is anticipated to take place in about 18 months. </li>
        <li>September 2002: The Mohawk Valley will be home to the <strong>Griffiss 
          Institute for Information Assurance</strong>, due to <strong>$4.5 million 
          in state funding</strong>. The facility will be a research/training 
          center that will build on cyber security and information assurance -- 
          two key components of the Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome. The 
          Institute will support a collaboration between corporate, academic and 
          government entities to create a research lab and spinoff information 
          companies. Under the plan, Gov. Pataki's office will provide $1.5 million 
          in capital support to the Griffiss Institute and the Senate and Assembly 
          will each provide $1 million and $500,0000 in start-up operating aid 
          that Sen. Raymond A. Meier, R-Western, and Assemblywoman RoAnn M. Destito, 
          D-Rome, secured. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong><a name="nc"></a>North Carolina</strong><br>
        2001: The Legislature of North Carolina voted for <strong>$5.1 billion 
        in bond</strong>s with <strong>$4.5 billion </strong>going to UNC for 
        new buildings and renovations. The measure passed in every county of the 
        state with an overall 73% positive vote. The vote came after an intensive 
        consultant's study of need, much lobbying, and a lot of support from the 
        NC Citizens for Business and Industry who raised the money for a campaign. 
      </p>
      <p>September 2002: Several major projects have bid successfully for funding, 
        including <strong>the B.B Dougherty Renovation at Appalachian State ($1.3 
        million), Film Archives Building at the North Carolina School of the Arts 
        ($2.2 million), Central Utilities Plant at North Carolina State University 
        ($15.9 million), and Health Sciences Library Renovation at UNC-Chapel 
        Hill ($12 million). </strong></p>
      <p>In addition to the continuing pace of work coming under award, the number 
        of projects moving to completion is increasing. Projects <strong>completed</strong> 
        since the last report include <strong>Bryan Center Upgrades at the North 
        Carolina School of Science and Math and Undergraduate Science Teaching 
        Labs &#8211; Phase 1 Greenhouses at North Carolina State University</strong>. 
        The first formal ribbon-cutting ceremony for a bond project was held on 
        August 19 at UNC-Chapel Hill to celebrate the completion of the <strong>R.B. 
        House Library Renovations</strong>. Currently, more than 62 percent of 
        bond projects are underway with a <strong>commitment of bond funds totaling 
        more than $567 million</strong>. An additional 6.9 percent of projects 
        equaling $40 million is committed to construction or land acquisitions 
        already completed. Together, these commitments mean that the bond program 
        has engaged approximately 24 percent of the program&#8217;s total dollar 
        value and nearly 70 percent of all projects. </p>
      <p>NC State University&#8217;s Centennial Campus in Raleigh will soon break 
        ground for a <strong>new building devoted entirely to nanotechnology R&amp;D</strong>. 
        The building will be <strong>80,000 square feet</strong> and will cost 
        <strong>$24 million</strong>. It is set to open July 2004. </p>
      <p> <strong><a name="ok"></a>Oklahoma</strong><br>
        March 2002: Governor Frank Keating signed legislation which appropriated 
        <strong>$38 million</strong> to establish a <strong>national weather center</strong> 
        at the University of Oklahoma in Norman and <strong>state-of-the art bioterrorism 
        research facilities</strong> at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater. 
        <strong>The federal government has set aside funds to match the state's 
        investment including $19 million</strong> for the OU weather center. OSU 
        is expected to receive a sizable portion of the $20 billion the Bush Administration 
        and Congress are expected to allocate for bioterrorism research. </p>
      <p>&quot;This legislation will pay enormous long term benefits to the state 
        of Oklahoma,&quot; Governor Keating said. &quot;Establishing these facilities 
        at our two comprehensive universities will enable Oklahoma to establish 
        itself as the premier center in the United States for weather and bioterrorism 
        related research. These projects will provide students with an educational 
        environment second to none and will have a tremendous impact on both the 
        public and private sector.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong><a name="sc"></a>South Carolina</strong><br>
        September 2002: BMW announced a <strong>$10 million endowment for Clemson 
        University</strong> to create a graduate engineering education center 
        in Greenville. The gift is the largest cash donation in Clemson's history. 
        BMW's $10 million pledge will endow the academic programs, and S.C. Governor 
        Jim Hodges has said that the <strong>state will give $25 million</strong> 
        to build and equip a state-of-the-art research facility. The recently 
        conceived graduate center for automotive research is expected to attract 
        at least 50 initial students. The center would provide both the academic 
        and research support needed by BMW, its suppliers and the state's rapidly 
        growing automotive industry. </p>
      <p> <strong><a name="tn"></a>Tennessee</strong><br>
        2002: Memphis hopes to build a <strong>$40 million, 160,000-square-foot 
        lab building</strong> that will represent phase one of the <strong>UT-Baptist 
        Research Park</strong>. When complete, the UT-Baptist Research Park will 
        consist of 1.2 million square feet of research space, including an incubator, 
        teaching and high-tech job creation. The Tennessee Department of Economic 
        and Community Development announced a grant of $750,000 to the City of 
        Memphis, to begin the infrastructure work necessary to build the biotech 
        research park in Midtown. Tennessee Industrial Infrastructure Program 
        (TIIP) funds are to be used for infrastructure improvements or for job-specific 
        workforce training for Tennessee industry. The current goal is to raise 
        $32 million from public and private sources over the next two years, says 
        JR 'Pitt' Hyde, president of the Hyde Family Foundation, which launched 
        the Biotech Foundation last year. </p>
      <p>In Nashville, officials hope to break ground in October on a <strong>$74 
        million, 134,000-square-foot biomedical research center</strong>, located 
        on 9.1 acres on Nichol Mill Lane in Cool Springs. Plans there call for 
        an initial <strong>research campus of three buildings</strong>; the first 
        two buildings, each roughly 32,000 square feet, will be designed for offices, 
        wet lab and clean room space. A third proposed building would be <strong>64,000 
        square feet</strong> with the capabilities for expansion up to 84,000 
        square feet. Tenants for the center are Dr. Sam Lynch-led BioMimetic Pharmaceuticals 
        Inc., Virtual Drug Development Inc., New Hope Pharmaceuticals and <strong>Vanderbilt 
        University</strong>. Tony Grande, State Commissioner of the State Department 
        of Economic and Community Development, formally announced a $464,218 Tennessee 
        Industrial Infrastructure Program (TIIP) grant to the City of Franklin 
        in support of the planned Cool Springs Life Sciences Center. This grant 
        is a departure from the traditional manufacturing grants awarded by the 
        state. Even more significant is the fact that this is the first time this 
        grant has been designated for the Life Sciences industry.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="va"></a>Virginia</strong><br>
        2002: In November voters approved a law, endorsed by the General Assembly 
        and by Gov. Mark R. Warner, that allows the Commonwealth to sell bonds 
        to pay for capital projects at public colleges, museums, and other educational 
        facilities. The total amount of bonds the commonwealth can issue will 
        be no more than <strong>$900.5 million</strong>. UVa will get $68.3 million 
        in projects from passage of the bond referendum, including more than $24 
        million toward a 183,000-square-foot medical research building that would 
        provide lab space for research in cancer, infectious diseases, allergies 
        and immunology. Another $7 million would help UVa build a 100,000-square-foot 
        research facility for the engineering school's material science engineering
