                  University Archives, in cooperation with ASU Surplus Property, ASU Facilities Management and the Arizona Department of Library Archives and Public Records, has been charged with coordinating the ASU Records Management Program for the Tempe campus since 1987. Archives assists offices in creation and approval of Records Retention and Disposition Schedules (RRDS), which serve as the legal authorization to destroy public records. Facilities Management provides moving services for transporting university records to Surplus Property warehouses, where records may be temporarily stored or destroyed in accordance with the approved RRDS form. <br>

                  <p>In order to temporarily store records off-site or to send records for destruction, any campus office must have an approved RRDS that addresses the specific kinds of records to be stored or destroyed. Since most offices produce very similar kinds of records (e.g. correspondence files or general administrative files like Absence Reports) two kinds of "generic" RRDS have already been approved for use by any campus office. One generic RRDS addresses common <A href="admrecs.htm">administrative records</A>, the second generic RRDS addresses common <A href="sturecs.htm">student records</A>.                   </p>
                  <P>                    <P>Some offices produce records that are unique (e.g. Registrar's Office produces the permanent student record files), and in order to store these records off-site or send them for destruction a special or "customized" RRDS must be drafted for the unique records of your office. That draft RRDS must then be approved by the University Archivist, the University Librarian and the Arizona Department of Library Archives and Public Records. <A 
href="mailto:Rob.Spindler@asu.edu">Archives staff</A> can help you draft an RRDS and send it through the approval process. Approval of a draft RRDS generally takes 6-8 weeks.

                  <p>Permanent storage of university records is only available from University Archives for materials deemed archival by the University Archivist. If you have materials that might be considered historic or archival, please <A 
href="mailto:Rob.Spindler@asu.edu">contact the University Archivist</A> for help identifying and preserving those historic materials.                   </p>
                  <P>                    <P>Temporary off-site storage for non-archival records is only available at Surplus Property, and an approved "custom" RRDS is required for accessing temporary records storage at Surplus. Once you have an RRDS approved with a records center retention period in the "R.C." column see the Property Control Systems Policy Manual section PCS-703 <FUTURE link site web to>for procedures on how to send materials for temporary storage. A brief <A

                  <h3>Q. Are all records actually considered public records? </h3>
                  <p><strong>A.</strong> Although the laws of the State of Arizona include a very broad definition of public records (A.R.S. 41-1350), there are a number of kinds of documents that are not public records. Duplicate copies of virtually any document produced in the course of your work are not public records, unless you have marked them or performed an official duty using them that changed their content (e.g. your signature on a signature line). Your personal copy of any ASU publication produced by another office is not a public record; however, the <B>first</B> copy of a publication produced in your office would be considered the "official" copy or "copy of record" and would be a public record. University Archives keeps a comprehensive set of university publications and you may send one "copy of record" of each of your publications to Archives to satisfy retention requirements for ASU publications. Remember that the phrase "public record" in records management refers to public or governmental ownership of a document rather than issues relating to access to records. Virtually all public records are open for inspection by any citizen, although there are certain classes of records that are specifically deemed confidential and can only be made public under special and limited circumstances (e.g. student medical records). </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h3>Q. What is an RRDS? </h3>
                  <P><strong>A.</strong> RRDS, or Records Retention and Disposition Schedules, are documents that contain descriptions of the record series, or kinds of records produced in your office, and how long those records must be kept in your office or kept in a records center off-site, before they can be legally destroyed. An RRDS serves as the official authorization to destroy records on an ongoing basis, and must bear the signature of the Director of the Department of Library Archives and Public Records to be valid. RRDS may be revised and updated as necessary but each revision must be approved by the state before it can be used to authorize destruction of records.                   
                  <P>                    
                  <h3>Q. Where can I get an RRDS? </h3>
                  <P><strong>A.</strong> <A 
href="mailto:Rob.Spindler@asu.edu">University Archives staff</A> have the forms and can help you draft an RRDS and get it approved by the state. Any draft RRDS must be approved by the University Archivist before it may be submitted to the state for approval.                   
                  <P>                    <h3>Q. When should I pack files for storage?
                  </h3>
                  <P><strong>A.</strong> We recommend packing records at the end of each fiscal year (every July) so that records produced during a single year are kept together.                   
                  <P>                    <h3>Q. When should I destroy records?
                  </h3>
                  <P><strong>A.</strong> You should always destroy records immediately after the end of the required retention period UNLESS there is a pending university appeal or pending litigation related to the records. In thoseinstances you are required to retain the materials until the appeal or litigation is completed.                   
                  <P>                    <h3>Q. Where can I get records boxes?
                  </h3>
                  <P><strong>A.</strong> Record Boxes can be ordered from the Corporate Express Catalog. Archives recommends Fellowes #789.                   
                  <P>                    <h3>Q. Where can I get Report of Records Destruction Forms?
                  </h3>
                  <P><strong>A.</strong> Report of Records Destruction Forms are available for download from <A href="http://www.lib.az.us/records/forms.htm">the State Records Management Division.</A> Remember you must have a completed RRDS that authorizes destruction before completing the Records Destruction form. The official state form is required and so ASU cannot produce and distribute its own forms.                   
                  <P>                    <h3>Q. Where can I get Records Storage Forms?
                  </h3>
                  <P><strong>A.</strong> Records Storage Forms are available from ASU Stores Item# FM 780000.                   
                  <P>                    <h3>Q. Who can retrieve materials that I've already sent to Surplus Property for temporary storage?
                  </h3>
                  <P><strong>A.</strong> Contact ASU Surplus Property (x7640) for information about retrieving records that have already been sent there for temporary storage. If you have sent archival materials to University Archives, <A href="mailto:archives@mainex1.asu.edu">contact Archives staff</A> for assistance at x4932.                   
                  <P>                    <h3>Q. How do I handle electronic records?
                  </h3>
                  <P><strong>A.</strong> Electronic records are required to be maintained for exactly the same length of time as paper records performing the same function or bearing the same record series title, unless your custom RRDS identifies separate retention periods for each medium. For example, if you have a "custom" RRDS in force that requires hardcopy student residency applications to be kept for three years and you convert this process to an electronic database, the database files containing the residency applications must be maintained for three years and must be accessible and useable. If your process was converted so that a hardcopy data entry form was produced and the data is kept in a database, you might want to contact the University Archivist to draft a new RRDS with a two month retention period for the hardcopy data entry forms and the three year retention for the electronic (record) copy of the form. If you have electronic data that must be retained for periods beyond five years, <A 
href="mailto:Rob.Spindler@asu.edu">contact the University Archivist</A> for information about retaining electronic records as special steps should be taken to insure the survival of the data.                   
                  <P>                    <h3>Q. Why do I have to do all this paperwork?
                  </h3>
                  <P><strong>A.</strong> The simple answer is that because you are a state employee, you have an obligation to make the records of your work available to the citizens of Arizona. Records management programs provide a system for managing records that balances the need for public access against the need for efficient office management. Records management saves taxpayer dollars by insuring that expensive office space is not filled with obsolete records, and it also guarantees that a record of the public business is available for inspection for a reasonable period of time.                   
                  <P>                    <P>In addition, A.R.S. 41-1346 requires that all state agencies establish and maintain a records management program and comply with the regulations, standards and procedures established by the Arizona Department of Library Archives and Public Records. The procedures published in the Property Control Systems Policy Manual Chapter PCS-703 are in full compliance with the procedures mandated by the state. A.R.S. 38-421 establishes unauthorized destruction of public records by a public officer as a class 4 felony.</P>
