The ASU at Tempe campus Class Fee Sunset Review Committee systematically reviews fees for fit with ABOR criteria. If the established fee conforms with criteria and does not require modification, the committee sends written notification of continuation to unit, college, and associate vice president for Finance and treasurer. If the established fee conforms with criteria and requires modification, the committee sends written notification of the modification to unit, college, and associate vice president for Finance and treasurer. </p>

<p> 
If an established fee does not conform with criteria, the committee sends written notification to the unit and determines whether continuation of the fee is desired. If continuation is desired, a member of the academic department submits a new fee request by standard process (see above) and sends written notification to review committee and dean. The review committee sends written notification of elimination to unit, dean, and associate vice president for Finance and treasurer.</p>
