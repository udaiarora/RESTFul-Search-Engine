            we got too far ahead of ourselves, welcome to ASU.&nbsp; We
            hope you are excited about what lies ahead and we look forward to
            meeting you when you arrive on campus.</font>
            <p><font size="2">We expect all of our new students to attend an orientation
            program, but understand that's not always possible.&nbsp;
            Out-of-state students will be advised by phone; in-state students
            will sign up for an Advising workshop.&nbsp; However, not everything
            covered in a day-long orientation program can be covered in an
            hour-long phone appointment or a two-hour group workshop.&nbsp; That's why
            this website was created.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2"> The information presented here will show you how
            to select your classes and build your first
            schedule.&nbsp; However, the term 'orientation' implies learning and getting
            acquainted to ASU's campus.&nbsp; To do this through cyberspace
            requires <i>more</i> effort on
            your part.&nbsp; Our on-campus programs last all day long, so our
            request that you spend 45 minutes on this website is quite
            reasonable.&nbsp; We expect you to take this assignment seriously
            and complete all exercises completely.&nbsp; You will have to speak with an advisor before you
            register, but that won't happen until you've completed this homework
            to our satisfaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">So, grab your paper and lucky pencil and let's get
            started.&nbsp; When
            you are finished, your &quot;homework&quot; will be submitted
            electronically and you will be given instructions on how to schedule
            a phone advising appointment (for out-of-state students), or an
            Advising Workshop (for in-state students).</font></p>
