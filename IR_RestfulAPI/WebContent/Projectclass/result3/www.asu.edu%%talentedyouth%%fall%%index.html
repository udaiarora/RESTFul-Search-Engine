                  <h3>Exploring Your Creative POWER : PowerPoint Basics <B><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2></FONT></I></B></h3>
                  <p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>This course is for talented 3rd grade students. </strong> Exploring Your Creative POWER: PowerPoint Basics provides a fun and challenging way for students to learn PowerPoint Basics. PowerPoint is a great tool for students of all ages to explore their creativity. The days of overheads and picture slides is coming to an end, and are now rolled into one computer-based program. While exploring their minds and sharing their favorite things with their classmates, students will learn basic computer use and PowerPoint skills such as developing slides, adding text, pictures and backgrounds. In addition, students will learn how to save a presentation, use the internet to gather ideas and graphics, understand the importance of color selection, explore their inner creativity, and gain or enhance their public speaking skills. By the end of the course, students will be able to create a basic PowerPoint presentation.

                   <h3>Creative Writing <B><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2></FONT></I></B></h3>
                  <p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>This course is for talented 4th and 5th grade students</strong>. This course provides students with the opportunity to work with a practicing writer in a high-expectation, small-group setting in order to create vivid and compelling creative writing. The students will explore the genres of poetry, the prose poem, and flash fiction through a series of guided writing exercises, discussions and workshops. In order to develop and enhance key dimensions of their projects, students will study the work of published authors, read and respond to (both written and verbally) the work of their peers, submit their own work for peer review, complete writing exercises designed to reinforce key concepts introduced in class, and revise their work for publication. Above all, this course values original narrative-based creative writing, and all activities, exercises, discussions, and critiques are designed to achieve that end. </p>

                  <h3>Mathematics As Number Systems </h3>
                  <p><strong> </strong><strong>This course is for talented 4th and 5th grade students</strong>. In American classrooms, mathematics is considered the study of relationships among quantities, magnitudes, properties, and logical operations using the base-10 (or decimal) system. In this course, students will step into new mathematical paradigms to study four number systems. They will investigate the base-2 (or binary) system which is prominently used in today&rsquo;s computer technology. In the base-10 system of the Egyptians students will discover the unique properties and characteristics of the decimal system. Through the study of the base-20 (or vigesimal) system of the Mayans students will discover new methods for performing the basic arithmetic operations, as well as the invention and evolution of number systems. Students will extend their knowledge of positional value, the additive, and subtractive properties of numbers, and the significance of zero within number systems, including those of the Greeks. Students will develop the ability to move between the different systems and to explore the common and unique properties of the various systems. Using skills of analysis and synthesis, students will develop, present, and defend their own unique number systems. The format of the course will include group activities, discussions and challenging homework. </p>

Key concepts to be covered include developing three-dimensional characters, writing believable dialogue, controlling narrative point of view, and revising for publication. Students will study the work of published authors, read and respond to (both written and verbally) the work of their peers, submit their own work for peer review, complete writing exercises designed to reinforce key concepts introduced in class, and revise their work for publication.
