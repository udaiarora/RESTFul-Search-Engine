      <h2><strong>ASU plays a major role in the invasion of Mars </strong></h2>
      <p>Science is always risky because it means probing into the unknown. Though everyone doesn't see it this way, anytime an experiment is conducted, a scientist embarks on an adventure. </p>
      <p>Of course, some science adventures are bigger and riskier than others. Take the current Mars Exploration Rover missions for example:&nbsp; costing a total of $820 million and with only a one-in-three chance (based on past history) of surviving a 300-million-mile trip through the radiation and cold of space and,&nbsp; at a distance of 9.5 light-minutes, executing a complex, 12-step landing procedure robotically on an unknown surface, the Rover experiments seem pretty adventurous even before they are started. </p>
      <p>But then consider the logistics involved in actually doing the science once there has been a successful landing, as has already happened with the Spirit Rover.&nbsp; There are two rovers that will be operating simultaneously in locations on nearly opposite sides of Mars, each with seven sophisticated instruments on board, each of which needs its own team of scientists to operate. And the twin rovers are not alone - there are three <em> other </em> spacecraft orbiting Mars (Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the European Union's Mars Express), each of which is relaying the Rover's signals back to earth and coordinating the operation of their own instruments with those of the Rovers. More than a simple experiment, humankind currently has a <em> fleet </em> of experiments taking place on the Red Planet, and the operation looks more like a major military campaign than a research study. </p>
      <p>"This is the most elaborate, complicated operation we have ever done," said ASU Regents' Professor of Geological Sciences Ronald Greeley, who has been involved in NASA missions since before Apollo visited the moon. "It will be extremely exciting and also challenging to carry out successfully." Even the <em>New York Times </em>, which is not easily impressed or awed by events in science or elsewhere, has recently noted&nbsp; that "many scientists consider this the ultimate adventure." </p>
      <p>The MER mission involves a&nbsp; large, international team of scientists, directed by Cornell University geologist Steve Squyres. Though another university is running the mission,&nbsp; ASU has been deeply involved, both in planning the mission and, now, in carrying it out. </p>
      <p>Greeley and ASU astrobiologist Jack Farmer were involved in picking the landing sites for the rovers, and a discovery by Christensen of hematite (a mineral that usually forms in the presence of water) led to the selection of a place known as Terra Meridiani for the second landing . In fact, Christensen's findings through TES on Mars Global Surveyor and THEMIS on Mars Odyssey are responsible for giving us a large part of what we currently know about Mars. </p>
      <p>The contributions of ASU will continue, as Christensen and his team will be operating an unprecedented four instruments simultaneously during the MER campaign - TES, THEMIS and the two Mini-TES instruments. In addition, three other ASU faculty members, Greeley, Farmer and ASU research scientist James Rice are members of the MER science team.&nbsp; Greeley and Farmer are both chairs of important decision-making committees, which means that ASU has three scientists who are playing "mission-critical" roles on the rovers' three-month-long odysseys. </p>
      <p>"Between the four of us and our associates, ASU has a higher representation on the Rover teams than any other institution, including Cornell," said Greeley, who also points out that ASU is making unique use of the mission to enhance teaching as well. </p>
      <p>"Jack, Phil and I are doing an undergraduate and graduate course here at ASU that is centered on the MER rover operations and this is providing an opportunity for students to be directly involved in the project through the ASU curriculum," he said. "I don't think anyone else in the country is doing this." </p>
      <p>Though the faculty will be necessarily spending most of their time at the Jet Propulsion Lab, the class will be taught either by one of the three during brief visits to Tempe, or by videoconferencing from the site. Students will have the opportunity to study the most recent data being collected by the rovers and be witness to the complex scientific decisions that the science teams will be making during the course of operations. </p>
      <p>The students will also have an opportunity to see science history in the making, as the mission will be a science experiment unlike any that has ever been performed. Daily, nearly a dozen teams of scientists will manage the instruments, sending commands and downloading data, and separately examine science issues involving the Mars' atmosphere, geology, mineralogy, and surface properties. Once the analysis is done, the teams will argue among themselves about which of the current science opportunities are the most important, and about where the rover should be going and what it should be doing. </p>
      <p>"It's like running an army," said Greeley. "It's about people and organization and staying goal-oriented. It will be really exciting." </p>
      <p>Spirit, the first of the two rovers, landed successfully at Gusev Crater on January 3. Opportunity, the second, is scheduled to touchdown at Terra Meridiani on the evening of January 24. Both missions are expected to continue for approximately three months -- perhaps longer, if conditions are favorable.</p>
