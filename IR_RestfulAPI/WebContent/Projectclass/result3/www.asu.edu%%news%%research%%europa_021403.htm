      <h2>Europa surface missions necessary step in extraterrestrial search</h2>
      <p> Scientists have long considered Europa, the smallest of the four Galilean 
        moons orbiting Jupiter, as a prime candidate for life outside Earth because 
        it is one of the few places in the solar system where liquid water may 
        be found. Any future Europa exploration should focus on the identification 
        of sites where signs of past or present life can be found and studied, 
        says Ron Greeley, an ASU geology professor. </p>
      <p>Greeley, who heads up the Europa Astrobiology research at ASU, is co-author 
        of an abstract paper on potential Europa habitats presented at the 2003 
        NASA Astrobiology Institute General Meeting held Feb. 10 - 12 at ASU. 
        The meeting brought more than 500 researchers from throughout the United 
        States to discuss the latest developments in astrobiology. The NASA Astrobiology 
        Institute includes a multitude of diverse disciplines including chemistry, 
        biology, geology, microscopy and astronomy.</p>
      <p>Greeley said assuming life arises quickly under appropriate formative 
        conditions, life could be present wherever there is liquid water, a source 
        of energy and essential elements. Europa is roughly the size of the moon, 
        and is believed to have a rocky interior and an outer shell of ice - and 
        possibly liquid water - about 60 to 100 miles thick. Scientists say mounting 
        evidence for the existence of a salty liquid ocean beneath Europa's icy 
        crust is exciting because that is just the environment that could provide 
        favorable conditions for present life, or where signs of past life may 
        be preserved. </p>
      <p>Europa has been studied for years by examining data collected by the 
        unmanned Galileo spacecraft's onboard science instruments, but Greeley 
        and his NASA colleagues believe future studies of Europa will need to 
        focus on surface units, particularly in areas where geologic processes 
        have caused the satellite's icy crust to melt, and where organisms would 
        be protected from radiation and provided with an adequate food supply.</p>
      <p>"Now that the Galileo mission is nearly completed, it is time for researchers 
        to sift through the images to shape the current state-of-knowledge about 
        the satellite and pose scientific questions to be addressed by future 
        missions," said ASU researcher Patricio Figueredo, Greeley's colleague, 
        and first author of the Europa habitat paper. <br>
        Although it is not clear to researchers how far a liquid ocean is from 
        the surface, Figueredo says scientists must now piece together the visible 
        evolution history of Europa and determine how different pathways of energy, 
        materials and nutrient interactions would affect possible ecosystems in 
        the satellite.</p>
      <p>A second paper presented at the conference starts from the idea that 
        a liquid ocean is present on Europa to offer one explanation as to why 
        sulfate is found on the surface of the satellite. Sulfate has been readily 
        observed on Europa's surface by a stereoscopic instrument aboard Galileo. 
        If the sulfate is from a liquid ocean, it is likely to have been formed 
        by high-temperature fluids released at the oceanic floor from the satellite's 
        silicate mantle. </p>
      <p>When these high-temperature fluids are cooled quickly, it would provide 
        the right conditions to support life, says ASU's Mikhail Zolotov and Everett 
        Shock, geology researchers who presented the paper, "Autotrophic Sulfate 
        Reduction in a Hydrothermally Formed Ocean on Europa."</p>
      <p>The differentiated internal structure of Europa implies that high temperature 
        interaction of water and rocks occurred at least once in the satellite's 
        history. It is plausible some volcanic activity is also occurring on present 
        day Europa, driven by tidal forces. The authors believe high-temperature 
        fluids from the satellite's rocky core flow into the icy-cold ocean above. 
      </p>
      <p>Similarly, this phenomenon occurs on Earth, under the ocean floor within 
        mid-ocean ridge volcanoes. These deep-sea hydrothermal vents - known more 
        commonly as black smokers - force sulfur-rich, high-temperature water 
        (about 350-degrees Celsius) out onto the ocean floor through chimney-like, 
        volcanic rock structures. As the hot, mineral-rich water rushes out of 
        the chimney and mixes with cold ocean bottom water, it precipitates a 
        variety of minerals as tiny particles that, in turn, provide energy to 
        marine life. When sulfate from seawater mixes with the vent fluid, it 
        can be a source of energy for life through a process called autotrophic 
        sulfate reduction.</p>
      <p>"On Earth, sulfates can be reduced through biologic activity in oxygen-free 
        sedimentary basins or in organic-rich oceanic sediments," said Shock. 
        "Although the amount of energy on Europa could be insufficient to allow 
        these biologic organisms to persist throughout the ocean's history, a 
        periodic supply of organic compounds or other environmental factors introduced 
        into the ocean could maintain life over time. If this process is detected 
        in the chemical composition of Europa's oceanic water, it would be highly 
        suggestive of the involvement of ancient life." </p>
