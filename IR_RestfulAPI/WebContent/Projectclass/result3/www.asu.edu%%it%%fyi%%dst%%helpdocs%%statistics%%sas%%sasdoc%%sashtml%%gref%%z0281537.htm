<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><B>Generate a plot with filled areas.</B> The
plot requests are ordered to draw the lowest plot first. Area 1 occupies the
space between the lowest (first) plot line and the horizontal axis, and area
2 is below the highest (second) plot line. This arrangement prevents the pattern
for area 1 from overlaying the pattern for area 2. AREAS=2 fills all the areas
below the second plot line.
