      <h2>Southwest Borderlands Initiative brings new talent to Valley</h2>
      <p>        So far eight faculty members have been recruited to share their innovative
          and global insights with ASU's academic community as part of the Southwest
          Borderlands Initiative. ASU announced the initiative in 2001 as a long-term
          faculty appointment plan with two primary objectives: strengthening
          existing ASU scholarly and instructional resources on the Southwest
          with emphasis on the region along the United States-Mexico border,
          and enhancing institutional recruitment and retention efforts toward
          building a faculty fully reflective of the Southwest Borderlands' diversity.        </p>
      <p>Designed with broad-based campus input as a major ASU faculty-hiring
          plan, the continuing initiative seeks to integrate current ASU strengths
          in borderlands research with bold innovation in faculty recruitment.</p>
      <p>Ramon
          Rivera-Servera, assistant professor in the Theater Department of the
          Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts, hopes to increase awareness
          and knowledge of the wealth of Latino arts in the United States through
          his projects."One of the main projects I am currently developing for
          the ASU community is the 'Performance in the Borderlands' lecture series,"
          he says. "It will bring nationally recognized scholars, critics and
        artists to the ASU campus for lectures, performances and workshops about
        the
          arts along the U.S.-Mexico border."<br>
        For Rivera-Servera, expression through the arts is one of the best
          forms of communication.</p>
      <p>"I see the arts as an important site of futurity; a
          hopeful realm where identities, desires, and hopes are articulated,
        shared, and contested,"
          says Rivera-Servera, who was an adjunct professor in the dance program
          at the University of Rochester 2002 - 03. "I think this quality artistic
          practice has been especially key to groups who often find themselves
          at the fringes of U.S. official culture."</p>
      <p>ASU currently has a variety
          of programs that focus on different aspects of the Hispanic culture,
          which include Hispanic Research Center, Bilingual
          Review Press, Chicana/o Studies Department, Hispanic Mother-Daughter
          Program, Minority Engineering Program, Latin American Studies and ASU's
          Spanish department.<br>
        Cordelia Candelaria, chairwoman of ASU's Chicano/a Studies Department,
          says faculty participants in the SWB Initiative will help existing
          programs "flourish" and continue to serve the community.</p>
      <p>"I think these people
          are going to enhance the wonderful foundation that we have in place
        and they will help us take it even farther," Candelaria
          says. "Latino faculty members as scholars are prized commodities. It's
          important to continue strong recruitment of Latino faculty and students
          in order to maintain and enhance this global studies perspective."</p>
      <p>Another
        new hire, John Jota Lea&ntilde;os, serves as an assistant professor
        in the Chicano/a Studies Department in the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences.
        While obtaining his masters in fine arts (photography), Lea&ntilde;os
        concentrated on developing public art through computer-generated Digital
        Murals and through performance and art installation.</p>
      <p>He plans to share
          some of this knowledge with the ASU community.</p>
      <p>"I work
        with people to critically engage technology rather than passively accept
        its inevitability in our lives," says Lea&ntilde;os, whose work
        has been displayed in The Whitney Museum in New York and the San Francisco
        Arts Commission Gallery. "I see no better way to do this than through
        the production of art and culture. I hope to bring to students and the
        intellectual community a sense of urgency to be active in one's educational
        formation, pedagogical goals and political consciousness. This sense
        of urgency is desperately needed here."</p>
      <p>In addition Rivera-Servera and
        Lea&ntilde;os, faculty members hired through
        the Southwest Borderlands Initiative include:</p>
      <p>. Yolanda Lopez, served
        as a visiting artist/lecturer in the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences
        Department of Chicano/a Studies in the spring 2003.<br>
        . Sarah Amira de la Garza, hired 2003-04, serves as an associate professor
        of communication/theater in the College of Public Programs.<br>
        . Miguel Astor Aguilera, hired 2003-04, serves as an assistant professor
        in the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences Department of Religious
        Studies.<br>
        . Seline Szkupinski Quiroga, hired 2003-04, serves as an assistant professor
        in the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences Department of Chicano/a
        Studies.<br>
        . Daniel Ramirez, hired 2003-04, serves as assistant professor in the
        College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences Department of Religious Studies.<br>
        . Alfredo Artiles will serve as a professor of curriculum and instruction
        in the College of Education for the 2004-05 academic year. </p>
