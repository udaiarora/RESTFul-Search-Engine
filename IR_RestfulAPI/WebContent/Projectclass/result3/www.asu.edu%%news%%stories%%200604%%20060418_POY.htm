<p>Andrew T. Smith, a conservation biology professor whose talent as a teacher and mentor of students is matched by his research and the respect of his peers, has stepped into the spotlight as ASU's 2006 Professor of the Year. He collected the top honor April 17 from the ASU Parents Association at a special ceremony that kept the winner's identity secret until the end. </p>
<p>A capacity crowd in the Carson Ballroom applauded the 25 nominees for the award, all top professors from across the university who model excellence and touch students in a profound way. Smith inspires boundless enthusiasm in his students, ties his teaching to contemporary examples and opens them to a world of possibilities. </p>
<p>Even more amazing, he does so at 7:40 a.m. </p>
<p>"I never missed a single class because I valued each one so much," says Julee Risinger, a senior who was juggling a full-time job when she walked into that first early morning class. "I would not have wanted to miss one of his stirring stories about pikas or pandas that bounce when they fall out of trees. </p>
<p>"My first impressions of Dr. Smith were that he was very knowledgeable about the material, as well as enthusiastic about it. He makes the material come alive. He seems to know the answer to any question related to conservation biology one could dream up." </p>
<p>Smith will receive a $20,000 cash stipend, half of which will fund an undergraduate student assistant for two years. He also will become a fellow in the ASU Distinguished Teaching Academy and will have the lifelong designation as Parents Association Professor. </p>
<p> The association honored all 25 outstanding faculty nominees at a Celebration of Teaching and Learning Excellence sponsored by TIAA CREF.</p>
<p>While teaching at ASU for the past 28 years, Smith has become known as a first-rate scholar, publishing widely on the behavior of small mammals and working toward the conservation of endangered rabbits and pikas around the world. </p>
<p>Yet he still takes undergraduates on field trips every semester, insists that every student meet with him face-to-face, requires term papers geared to the students' interests and creates demanding examinations. Many students say he's the most difficult professor they've ever had. </p>
<p>"I came to ASU searching for a reason to be passionate, searching for something to get me excited about spending my savings and living off ramen noodles for the next four years, looking for motivation to stay the course and get the education I needed," says Lena Corbisier, an ASU senior. "I found more than I bargained for when enrolling in Dr. Smith's conservation biology course. </p>
<p>"He always had true-to-life examples illustrating conservation biology in action. I remember extensive discussions with classmates in the hallway as we recalled shocking statistics, hilarious anecdotes and goals we all hoped to achieve. His exams forced me to think about practical applications of conservation, and to remember information by understanding the concepts and real-life examples." </p>
<p>Ben Minteer, an associate professor of life sciences, says Smith is a deeply caring individual who devotes an enormous amount of time and energy to helping students get internships and employment with conservation agencies, and who helps them prepare for graduate school. </p>
<p>His love of teaching is evident. Smith reworks each one of his lectures every year, integrating topical issues. He begins his 7:40 a.m. lectures with a story from that day's newspaper pertaining directly to the scheduled lesson. Longer classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays get a "Species of the Day" account, with a lively history of a species and how its population has changed over time. </p>
<p> Also receiving special recognition at the event and a $1,000 stipend were Allan DeSerpa, economics, and Amy Ostrom, marketing, both in the W.P. Carey School of Business; Ileana Orlich, languages and literatures, and Bertram Jacobs, School of Life Sciences, both in the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences; and Jos&eacute; N&aacute;nez, Sr., Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, New College of Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Sciences. </p>
<p>The Parents Association Professorship was created 12 years ago to reward faculty who have a passion for education and who excel not only in undergraduate teaching, but in their area of research or creative activity. Ten professors, including Smith, have received the honor since that time. </p>
<p>Nominations come from across campus, with the selection made by a committee of faculty, students and Parents Association board members. </p>
