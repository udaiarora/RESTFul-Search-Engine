      <h2><strong>Melnyk Will Join ASU as Dean of the College of Nursing </strong></h2>
      <p>TEMPE, Ariz. - Bernadette Mazurek Melnyk, associate dean for research and director of the Center for Research and Evidence-Based Practice at the University of Rochester, has been named dean of Arizona State University's College of Nursing. Melnyk, who specializes in nursing care of children and is a pediatric nurse practitioner and psychiatric health nurse practitioner, replaces Barbara Durand who retired June 30. </p>
      <p>Melnyk will begin her new duties in January 2005. Karen Sousa, associate dean of the College of Nursing, will serve as interim dean beginning July 1. </p>
      <p>"Bernadette Melnyk will bring strong leadership skills and organizational experience to the nursing dean position," said Milton Glick, ASU's executive vice president and provost . "She has an exciting vision for the college and for Arizona State that fits in nicely with the overall goals and direction of ASU. She is the right dean at the right time and will accelerate the positive momentum of the college." </p>
      <p>"Barbara Durand has built a very strong foundation for the ASU College of Nursing," Melnyk said. "I'm ready to move it to the next level. I believe the education component of the College is very strong and we will build on that foundation in creating new innovative programs. </p>
      <p>"Research will be a very high priority," she added. "I will focus on bolstering the research enterprise of the college and bringing national and international visibility through a new Center for the Advancement of Evidence-Based Practice, which will also improve nursing practice and the quality of care in the community." </p>
      <p>While at Rochester, Melnyk founded and led the Center for Research and Evidence-Based Practice, which focuses on research and implementation of research to best nursing practices. Melnyk, an expert in this field, published the book," Evidence-Based Practice in Nursing and Healthcare. A Guide in Best Practices," in June. </p>
      <p>"The medical profession has been implementing evidence-based practice for years, but nursing has lagged behind," Melnyk added. "I am very passionate about the translation of research into practice to improve patient care." </p>
      <p>Melnyk said she also plans to have the nursing college partner with several of the Valley medical centers to form an Arizona consortium for evidence-based practice. This fits in well with ASU's recent efforts to collaborate with other Valley organizations, including the recent ASU-Mayo Clinic announcement to develop joint nursing programs. </p>
      <p>Melnyk has been at the University of Rochester since 1992. She is the associate editor of the journal Worldviews on Evidence Based Nursing, president of the Association of Faculties of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, as well as founder and chair of the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners' KySS (keep your children/yourself safe and secure) campaign, a national mental health promotion campaign for children and teens. </p>
      <p>Melnyk has won several awards for her work in nursing, including the 2003 Audrey Hepburn Award from Sigma Theta Tau International for substantial contributions to improving the healthcare of children globally; the 2003 President's Award from the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners; and the 2000 Distinguished Nurse Researcher Award from the Foundation of the New York State Nurses. </p>
      <p>Melnyk is a Fellow in the American Academy of Nursing and a distinguished practitioner in the National Academies of Practice. </p>
