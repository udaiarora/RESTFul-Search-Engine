Numerous step-by-step examples show you - the economist, business          forecaster, student, or researcher - how to use the SAS System to
generate forecasts for a variety of business and economic data.            Examples are based on both time series models and econometric models.
You'll learn how to use the SAS System to forecast time series data        using Box-Jenkins ARIMA methodology; develop and forecast transfer
functions and intervention models; fit and forecast regression models      with autocorrelated, heteroskedastic, and ARCH-GARCH error terms;
estimate nonlinear regression models, create forecast confidence limits    using Monte Carlo simulation, and more! The main focus of the book is on
the code-based procedures in SAS/ETS software, but this book also          provides an introduction to the interactive Time Series Forecasting
System, and it shows how to plot data and forecasts with SAS/GRAPH         software.
