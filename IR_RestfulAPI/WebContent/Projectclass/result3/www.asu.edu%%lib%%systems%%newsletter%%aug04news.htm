            LIST's Newsletter<br>
            August, 2004 </p>
          <div align="left"> 
            <p>After our brief hiatus in July, &#8220;We&#8217;re LISTening&#8221; 
              has lots to report. Read on to find out about improvements to the 
              public workstations and printing system, progress on the library 
              caf&eacute;, new databases, and another option for spam relief.</p>
            <h3><br>
              Public Printing System Update</h3>
            <p> As some of you may have noticed, Copy Services has installed new 
              printers at both Hayden and Noble in order to speed up our public 
              printing process. During this installation, LIST noted that there 
              was some confusion and frustration as to where print jobs can be 
              released. In order to relieve this, all the print queues have been 
              tied together. This means that no matter which public workstation 
              a patron prints from, they have the ability to release the job at 
              the Pharos station of their choice. The result is less confusion, 
              and more places to print from if a certain Pharos station is congested. 
              LIST will be updating the printing information sheets to include 
              this information.<br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <h3> Workstation Improvements</h3>
            <p> &middot; The Google toolbar has been added to all the public workstations 
              by request. <br>
              &middot; The games filter is up and running for the upper concourse 
              this week, and will be launched globally next week. The filter employs 
              a proxy server to screen out URLs that have no legitimate research 
              use, such as games, online chat, etc. If you see a patron accessing 
              content that should be filtered, please get the workstation number 
              and notify Jeremy (5-1902) right away so that he can access the 
              machine remotely to see what site they are visiting and add it to 
              the filter list.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Charlie&#8217;s Caf&eacute; Biblioteca Coming Soon; Will Have 
              Wireless</h3>
            <p> Construction is expected to be completed on the library coffee 
              shop/caf&eacute; by September 23rd, and Charlie hopes to be open 
              for business by the following week. Hayden&#8217;s patrons and staff 
              can look forward to enjoying wireless internet access along with 
              Charlie&#8217;s selection of coffees, pastries, and light lunches.

          <p align="left"><strong>Q. <em>&quot;I&#8217;ve tried Spam Inspector; 
            I&#8217;ve tried the Outlook rules wizard. Is there anything else 
            that can help me deal with spam?&quot;</em></strong></p>
          <div align="left"> 
            <p><strong>A.</strong> While no method of spam detection is perfect, 
              there is something else you can try: spam filtering using IT's EMMA 
              service. IT provides an FAQ page - <a href="http://www.asu.edu/mailbox/faq/sf.htm">http://www.asu.edu/mailbox/faq/sf.htm</a> 
              - that explains how the filtering service works. To access this 
              service, log on using your ASURITE at <a href="http://my.asu.edu">http://my.asu.edu</a>, 
              then select EMMA, then Spam Filtering. </p>
            <p> It's important to note that this filtering service blacklists 
              everything by default &#8211; in other words, until you add addresses 
              to your &#8220;white list,&#8221; ALL of your email will go into 
              the spam quarantine on EMMA. Fortunately, you can easily set it 
              to receive email from anyone at ASU by adding &#8220;@asu.edu&#8221; 
              to your white list. You can also manually add non-ASU email addresses 
              to your white list, but it may be easier to simply let the non-ASU 
              emails gather in the quarantine, then check the box next to the 
              ones you want and click &#8220;deliver selected&#8221; to send them 
              to your Outlook mailbox. Whenever you choose to deliver an email 
              from your spam quarantine, future emails from that sender will automatically 
              be delivered to your Outlook mailbox rather than to the spam folder. 
            </p>
            <p>You need to check the spam quarantine often &#8211; at least daily 
              &#8211; at first, to find and deliver legitimate emails that get 
              directed there. But after a few weeks you&#8217;ll find that legitimate 
              messages rarely show up in the quarantine, and you can check the 
              folder less and less often. LIST staff who&#8217;ve tried the EMMA 
              spam filter find that when used as directed, it&#8217;s somewhat 
              more effective and less time-consuming in the long run than the 
              other options mentioned above. </p>
            <p>Your spam filter can be even more effective if you first check 
              the Electronic Post Office (&#8220;EPO Update&#8221; in the links 
              on the left side of the EMMA screen) to see all your email addresses 
              and aliases. A Google search on each of your addresses/aliases will 
              reveal if any of them is listed online &#8211; for example, in the 
              archives of a listserv. If you find that one or more of your aliases 
              does appear online, this is a likely source of spam. Setting your 
              spam filtering options on that address will catch the bulk of your 
              unwanted email and direct it to the spam quarantine, where it&#8217;s 
              easy to delete en masse. </p>
            <p>For complete details about setting up this service, please request 
              Jeremy Kurtz&#8217;s handy illustrated guide, available either from 
              Jeremy or from Heather Knowles via Outlook.<br>
