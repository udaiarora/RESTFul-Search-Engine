The Web directory also lists the student&#146;s ASU e-mail address, including the directory number. To avoid the release of directory information in the printed directory, the appropriate form must be submitted to any of the registrar locations (the Records Information counter at the Tempe campus or Registration Services at the Polytechnic or West campus) before the end of the third week of the fall semester. <p>Students may limit the release of directory information on the Web or in response to general inquiries at any time by submitting the appropriate form to the University Registrar&#146;s Office.<p>ASU has a policy that regulates the sale of enrolled student directory information through the University Registrar&#146;s Office.

Grades may not be challenged under this act; only the improper recording of a grade may be challenged under this act.<p><b>Informal Request</b><p>The student who believes that information contained in his or her education records is misleading or inaccurate, or violates the privacy or other rights of the student, may request that ASU amend such records. A request to amend a student&#146;s education record(s) should be made at the level closest to the source of the information. Informal meetings and discussions with the instructor or the university official responsible for the record should be utilized to satisfy a particular inquiry. The disposition of this request should be made within a reasonable period of time.<p><b>Formal Request and Right to a Hearing</b><p>The student must be advised by the university of the right to a formal appeals hearing if the university instructor or other official fails to amend the education records of the student in accordance with the informal request. An appeal must be made in writing through the university official responsible for the record. The hearing will be conducted in accordance with the following:<p><ol><li>The hearing will be held within a 30-day time period after the receipt of the request. A student must be given reasonable advance notice of the date, place, and time of the hearing.</li><p><li>The hearing will be conducted by the university registrar or his or her designee, who will serve as chair, two members of the faculty or staff, and two students. The president will appoint committee members who do not have a direct interest in the outcome of the hearing.</li><p><li>The committee is an administrative aid and not a judicial body and, therefore, does not follow formal rules of court procedure.</li><p><li>The student may retain counsel (not necessarily legal counsel) at his or her own expense and the respondent may also be advised by counsel. Counsel may be present, if requested, during all testimony, but may only advise the complainant or respondent.</li><p><li>The student must be afforded an opportunity to present evidence relevant to any alleged misleading or inaccurate information contained in the record.</li><p><li>The committee will present its findings, in the form of a recommendation, to the university president.</li><p><li>The committee must present its recommendation in writing to the president within 30 calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing. The recommendation will be based solely on the evidence presented at the hearing and will include a summary of the evidence and the reasons for the recommendation.</li><p><li>The president&#146;s decision is not subject to appeal within the university system.</li></ol><p>If, as a result of the hearing, the university decides that the record is misleading, inaccurate, or otherwise in violation of the privacy or other rights of the student, it will correct the education records of the student accordingly and inform the student in writing. This will be done usually within 45 days of the original request by the student. However, if the university decides that the information is not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privacy or other rights of the student, it will inform the student of the right to place in the education records a statement commenting upon the information in the education records, setting forth any reasons for disagreeing with the decision of the institution.<p>Any explanation placed in the education record of the student will be maintained by the university as part of the education record of the student as long as the record is maintained. If the education record of the student or the contested portion of the record is disclosed by the university to any party, the explanation will also be disclosed to that party.<p>Complaints that cannot be resolved within the university may be filed with:<p>Family Policy Compliance Office<br>U.S. Department of Education<br>400 Maryland Avenue S.W.<br>Washington, D.C. 20202-4605<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Enforcement</b></font><p>The secretary of education is required by the act to establish or designate an office and review board. The office will investigate the complaint and report its findings and the basis for such findings in writing to the complainant and the university.<p>The office will follow the procedure outlined below.<p><ol><li>The office will give notice to the university of the alleged violation and its substance.</li><p><li>If a lack of compliance is found on the part of the university, specific steps necessary for voluntary compliance, within a reasonable time, will be stated.</li><p><li>If the university does not comply within the time period set by the office, the matter will be referred to a federal review board for a hearing.</li><p><li>The federal review board chairman will designate a hearing panel or hearing officer to take evidence and decide the case.</li><p><li>The panel will submit its decision to the secretary of education, who will modify, reverse, or acceptthe decision.</li><p><li>If the secretary of education finds a lack of compliance with the act or regulations and determines that voluntary compliance cannot be secured, all or part of any federal funds under any federal programs referenced under Section 438 of the act may be terminated, until there is no longer any failure to comply.</li></ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Limitation on Destruction of Education Records</b></font><p>No education record may be destroyed if there is an outstanding request to inspect and review it.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Location of Records</b></font><p>The custodian of academic transcript records at ASU is the university registrar. The university registrar also maintains a directory that lists custodian and contact information for other student education records maintained by ASU.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Copying Fee</b></font><p>A reasonable fee will be charged for copies of education records.
