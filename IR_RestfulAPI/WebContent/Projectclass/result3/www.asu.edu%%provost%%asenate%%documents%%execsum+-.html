<blockquote>
  <p><font size="4">On January 27, 2003, it is anticipated that the Academic Senate 
    will take up the issue of whether ASU should adopt a plus/minus grading system. 
    That meeting should involve little more than introducing the resolution(s) 
    that raise the issue. A final discussion and vote on plus/minus should come 
    at the February 27 meeting. In the mean time, the ASU community is encouraged 
    to inform itself on the issues surrounding plus/minus and participate in the 
    debate.</font></p>

<h3 align="center">Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Plus/Minus Grades</h3>
<h3 align="center">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>In its 1992 Resolution 23 the Academic Senate approved a plus/minus grading 
  system for ASU. However, University President Lattie Coor delayed its authorization, 
  pending a report from Information Technology (IT) that such a system was feasible. 
  That feasibility was not established until the Fall, 2001, semester, prompting 
  Senate President Morton Munk to appoint an Ad Hoc Committee to review the issues 
  surrounding the adoption of a plus/minus grading system. </p>
<p>The Committee identified eight different grading systems in use at institutional 
  peers and other selected universities around the nation, noting even some minor 
  variations within those eight (see <a href="table1%2B-.pdf" target="_blank">Table 
  1</a> in the full report). Studies from MIT, North Carolina State University, 
  and Wake Forest were supplemented with testimony from a number of individuals 
  involved with student grading policies and practices at ASU to produce a set 
  of pros and cons for each of the eight grading systems. </p>
<p>The major argument in favor of plus/minus grading is that it provides faculty 
  with a finer grading mechanism that more accurately reflects the level of student 
  performance. This argument has been persuasive in the adoption of plus/minus 
  systems among all other schools in the PAC-10, except the University of Arizona, 
  as well as the vast majority of ASUís institutional peers. This widespread adoption 
  is, in itself, used to argue its adoption here. Proponents view plus/minus as 
  a more rigorous system that toughens standards at the highest grade levels while 
  encouraging students to perform better because the next higher grade level is 
  more easily within reach than in a system without pluses and minuses. </p>
<p>Opponents of plus/minus are less likely to believe that grades can be so finely 
  determined. Even granting that, however, it seems clear that fewer students 
  will be able to maintain a GPA at the highest level of summa cum laude (3.8 
  and higher), raising the question of whether plus/minus will hamper recruitment 
  of the very best students if ASU is the only university in the state to have 
  plus/minus. Even more serious is the problem at the grade level of C&#8211;, 
  which translates to a 1.67 grade point. If a grade of C is retained as the minimum 
  required for ìsuccessî in oneís major and many other upper division courses, 
  then plus/minus raises that standard. For example, grades of 70, 71, and 72, 
  which are typically good for a C grade now, would suddenly be a C&#8211;, no 
  longer acceptable as a passing grade. On the other hand, if C&#8211; is accepted 
  as passing, it raises the distinct possibility that one could pass all classes 
  and yet have less than a 2.0 GPA, which is less than successful academic standing 
  for athletes and others and for graduation. </p>
<p>A majority of the Committee recommends that ASU retain a grading system without 
  plus/minus options. However, if one is adopted, the Committee believes it should 
  be the one currently in use at MIT and the University of Maryland. Faculty may 
  assign +/&#8211; grades at the A, B, C, and D levels and those grades appear 
  on a studentís transcript. However, for purposes of GPA calculation, the plus/minus 
  assignations do not affect the GPA. Thus, grades of A+, A, and A&#8211; all 
  count 4.0; B+, B, and B&#8211; are all 3.0, and so on. The Committee sees this 
  as combining the strengths of both sides of the issue, permitting the finer 
  grading as a matter of record while diminishing the negative consequences of 
  plus/minus. </head> <body> </p>
