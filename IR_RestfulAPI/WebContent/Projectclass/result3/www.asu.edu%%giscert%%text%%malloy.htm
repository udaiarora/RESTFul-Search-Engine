        for Biodiversity in Southern China:&nbsp; Developing<br>
        Sustainable Alternatives for the Rural Mountain People</font></strong></p>

        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>ABSTRACT</u></b></font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The South China province of Guizhou is a remote, mountainous region dominated by conical karst limestone formations. This mountainous region is one of the poorest in China and has a large proportion of ethnic minority groups, most notably the Miao, Buyi, Dong and Gelao groups. This area is also an area of important biodiversity of plant resources from which many important Chinese traditional medicines are derived. Recently, the Chinese government has identified the medicinal plant industry as a means of development in this impoverished region. At this time, there is strong interest to attract interest from the World Bank and other development and conservation organizations to develop a sustained management project that would lead to the protection of the biodiversity and help the rural communities flourish.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through collaborative efforts, I have entered into a partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences to conduct a pilot project in biodiversity planning for a critical area in this mountainous region of southern China. This research proposal will conduct a pilot study in the Zunyi district in the province of Guizhou that will aid in developing an effective community-based plan to support the regional goals of  the emerging  bio-pharmaceutical industry. The result of this plan would be targeted towards the rural communities throughout the Guizhou province to strengthen alternatives for land use that would prevent further exploitation of the forest resources and provide meaningful income for the developing population in this mountain region. Currently, the rate of destruction of the native forests is rapidly changing the fragile landscape in climate and stability of the land due to the loss of vegetation and soil.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Research methods that will be incorporated in this plan development will include GIS analysis of the affected region for the generation of maps on soils, geology, plant communities and public infrastructure. Remote sensed images will be obtained to conduct detailed land cover analysis in GIS.  Terrain analysis will also be conducted to generate maps of the suitable land areas capable of conservation efforts and those experiencing various degrees of degradation.  The synthesis of this data will provide powerful tools for developing a plan for the conservation of the biological resources of the province and move towards providing alternatives for the rural communities that are now at the forefront in the areas of degraded forest land of critical importance.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This project represents my thesis topic to complete my Master of Science degree at Arizona State University. I expect to begin active field research in the summer of 2006, with completion of this project by December. My hope is the outcome of this project will result in a proposal that would secure funding for the Chinese government and resources needed on a national or international level that will ensure that this effort in conservation is carried out across the province in an effective manner.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
