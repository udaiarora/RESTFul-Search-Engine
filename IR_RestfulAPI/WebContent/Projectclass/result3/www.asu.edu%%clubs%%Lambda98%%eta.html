                        </strong></em><em><strong>Why Become a Brother of Lambda 
                        Theta Phi?</strong></em> 
                        <p>This 
                          is a hard question to answer, not because I don?t have 
                          any reasons, but because I have too many of them. I 
                          embarked onto this journey not knowing what to expect, 
                          but I did, however, bring with me goals that I want 
                          to accomplish. First of all, I want to be part of this 
                          group that through the unity of brotherhood, believe 
                          in the support, advancement, and preservation of the 
                          Latino cultures. For years, many of us have established 
                          ourselves in a land that promises a lot, but has yet 
                          to keep those promises. Being a part of this brotherhood 
                          would give me the opportunity, through collective action, 
                          to make a difference in our community, our city, our 
                          state, and someday our countries.<br>
                          <br>
                          As a Lambda, I hope to build upon my leadership skills 
                          in order to be able to lead and represent our people 
                          someday in Congress. The unity that Lambda Theta Phi 
                          Latin Fraternity Inc. offers is like no other. An organization 
                          that is much more than a student club; it is an institution 
                          that brings men from all different types of backgrounds 
                          and teaches them the real importance of unity, respect, 
                          and the commitment that we must make for our peoples. 
                          It is here that I feel most comfortable, with other 
                          guys who really want to make a difference and that have 
                          the same goals and ambitions that I do.<br>
                          <br>
                          The Latino people are no longer a minority here in the 
                          United States, and it?s about time that we are given 
                          our rightful and much overdue place in American society. 
                          Lambda Theta Phi has been around for how long now?, 
                          twenty-eight years without any failures--- that should 
                          tell the American people something. We have been together 
                          for that long and they better believe that it?s never 
                          going to stop. I believe that being a Lambda would allow 
                          me to learn more about other Latino cultures and get 
                          to know what their needs are so that I too can make 
                          those my own. The only way we can put a stop to suppression 
                          is by working together and trying to push one agenda. 
                          I have come to find that the Lambda brothers do not 
                          know the meaning of selfishness; if one of the brother?s 
                          country faces the issue of poverty then so does the 
                          countries of the other brothers. This is exactly the 
                          environment I want to be part of.<br>
                          <br>
                          On a more personal level, I want to let you guys now 
                          that I am totally stoked about the whole concept of 
                          brotherhood. I grew up with three sisters and absolutely 
                          no brothers. I want to say that I found my male role 
                          model in my father, but he left us when I was merely 
                          a child and he was never around; in fact one of the 
                          very few times that I remember what he looked like was 
                          when he was in the hospital, on his deathbed. Thus far, 
                          all of you brothers have taught me many things and I 
                          hope that this learning experience persists way beyond 
                          pledging. You are part of a group of very few men that 
                          I know who are truly genuine and kind to each other 
                          at all times, and I am almost certain that any of you 
                          would drop whatever you were doing if another brother 
                          was in dire need of help.<br>
                          <br>
                          Finally, I think that community service/service learning 
                          is what works as the adhesive to keep this unity together. 
                          It is in this sector that you learn how to humble yourself 
                          and put your needs aside to realize that there are others 
                          who need your helping hand. There are so many things 
                          that Lambda offers and if given the privilege to become 
                          one, I hope that I can build upon the foundation of 
                          unity, trust, care, and knowledge set by the forefathers 
                          and brothers.<br>

                        Theta Phi?</strong></em> 
                        <p>I want to become a Lambda for several reasons, one 
                          of those reasons that drove me to pledge was that I 
                          wanted to have brothers that gone through the similar 
                          struggles as me. Also, I wanted brothers who knew how 
                          to appreciate my culture and the things that were important 
                          to me. LAMBDA THETA PHI, LATIN FRATERNITY INC. is the 
                          organization that will help me in my endeavors and would 
                          stand for everything that I believe to be true. After 
                          getting to know all of the brothers with time, or the 
                          fraternity in general I realized that this organization 
                          has a lot to offer along the lines of brotherhood, respect 
                          for culture, and Latin unity. Slowly but surely, I gained 
                          more knowledge regarding Lambda Theta Phi history, ideals 
                          and accomplishments. All of which needless to say I 
                          closely identify with. I?ve done my own research on 
                          Lambda Theta Phi, and I was very impress on the outcome 
                          and feed back from the community and organizations they 
                          have helped throughout their community service around 
                          campus and elsewhere. I know for a fact that these brothers 
                          will be there for me as much as I will. One way that 
                          I would benefit from this fraternity is knowing that 
                          I will always have brothers for life, and I wouldn?t 
                          have to worry about feeling lonely or lost. It will 
                          make me very proud that I?ve earned my letters and I 
                          can finally walk around campus or walk pass other fraternities 
                          with a proud feeling that I?ve pledge for the first 
                          Latin Fraternity in the nation. I?m most grateful to 
                          the brothers of Alpha Sigma Chapter, especially big 
                          brother Erick I. Guevara of Omicron Chapter for introducing 
                          me to a fraternity that promotes respect for all generosity, 
                          service to the ?weak? and puts on a fight to protect 
                          the truth. Also, for getting me involved in this fraternity 
                          that will help me become a much better person and will 
                          offer me an opportunity in life to explore my horizons 
                          in every way possible.</p>
