Accessit. . .uocum difficilium & obscurarum passim in hoc opere
 ocurrentium explicatio.   Basileae: In officina Isingriniana,
 anno Christi 1542.  First edition.--Cf. Hunt 48.  Names of plants
 in Latin, Greek, and German.  With ports. of the author, the
 designers, and the engraver.  Probably the first book which
 contains not only the names, but also the portraits of its
 illustrators.  Cf. Klebs no. 72,  Includes index.  References:
  Hunt 48; Johnston, S. H. Cleveland coll. 59.
 Seven preliminary leaves wanting.

This work is one of the most beautiful books
 printed with full-page illustrations. Special Collections has a
 three-inch "first field guide" based on this work (See PAT-43).
 Important in the history of botanical illustration,
 this is the first early illustrated book to recognize not only
 the author for his contributions to the project, but also the painter,
 the transfer draftsman, and the block cutter.  One of the best
 artists in Basel was solicited to prepare the botanical illustrations
 which even today are respected for their clarity and style.
  The author, Leonhart Fuchs, deplored the terrible state of
 medical practice during his lifetime, recognizing that a majority
 of the practicing physicians did not know their medicines.
  Most of them relied for information on illiterate apothecaries,
 who were, in turn, depending upon the peasants who gathered roots
 and herbs for them.  Fuchs realized that patients could easily be
 poisoned rather than cured because of improper identification of
 plants.  Therefore he compiled this herbal to improve the German
 pharmacopoeia for the "common man" who was literate but unable
 to read Latin.  While drawing upon the works of Dioscorides, Pliny,
 and Galen, Fuchs added to his work at least 100 plants not mentioned
 in earlier herbals.  He included many that had been introduced into
 16th century Germany from elsewhere, and he tried to ensure that
 all plants in his work were portrayed accurately.  He wanted
 no mistakes made in their identification.  The genus Fuchia
 was named in his honor.  A particularly interesting entry is
 the first representation of maize (corn), where the text
 mistakenly refers to the grain as Turkish in origin, rather
 than American.
