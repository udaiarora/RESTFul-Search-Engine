The college enrolls students in programs leading to both professional and research-oriented advanced degrees. The M.A., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees are awarded to students completing programs that culminate in research and creative endeavors. The Ph.D. degree is the highest university award, conferred on candidates who have proven their ability as scholars and original researchers.</p><p>Professional graduate programs emphasize training that leads to professional practice. In these degree programs, students develop a mastery of a comprehensive body of knowledge and the ability to organize and carry out significant investigations in their professional field. Professional degrees usually are named Master of (Professional Field) and Doctor of (Professional Field), although some Master of Arts and Master of Science degree programs have professional tracks. The professional doctoral degree is the highest university award to candidates completing academic preparation for professional practice. The following professional degrees are offered through the Graduate College:</p><p></p><div style="margin: 0em 2em">Master of Accountancy and Information Systems (M.A.I.S.)<br />Master of Architecture (M.Arch.)<br />Master of Arts (M.A.)<br />Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.)<br />Master of Computer Science (M.C.S.)<br />Master of Counseling (M.C.)<br />Master of Education (M.Ed.)<br />Master of Engineering (M.E.)<br />Master of Environmental Planning (M.E.P.)<br />Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.)<br />Master of Health Services Administration (M.H.S.A.)<br />Master of Mass Communication (M.M.C.)<br />Master of Music (M.M.)<br />Master of Natural Science (M.N.S.)<br />Master of Physical Education (M.P.E.)<br />Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.)<br />Master of Public Health (M.P.H.)<br />Master of Science (M.S.)<br />Master of Science in Design (M.S.D.)<br />Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E.)<br />Master of Science in Technology (M.S.Tech.)<br />Master of Social Work (M.S.W.)<br />Master of Taxation (M.Tax.)<br />Master of Teaching English as a Second Language (M.TESL)<br />Doctor of Education (Ed.D.)<br />Doctor of Musical Arts (D.M.A.)<br />Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)</div><p></p><p>Faculty members offering a specific graduate degree program may be members of a single academic unit (such as a department, school, or college), or they may form an interdisciplinary committee consisting of faculty from various academic units. The Graduate College awards degrees upon the recommendation of the faculty offering the graduate degree programs.</p><p><a name="interdisciplinary-study"></a></p><h3>Interdisciplinary Study - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Although most graduate programs are administered by academic units, a diverse group of interdisciplinary programs falls directly under the supervision of the Graduate College. Many majors are in fields that are still emerging as recognized academic disciplines and, therefore, do not customarily form the academic basis for departments. Other fields of study are inherently interdisciplinary and do not fit well with conventional disciplines around which departments are formed. Curricula must reflect intrinsically broad disciplinary affinities, and faculty must be drawn from more than one department.</p><p>The Graduate College oversees nine interdisciplinary programs and has joint responsibility with the College of Education for another; several others are planned. Existing interdisciplinary programs are as follows:</p><p></p><div style="margin: 0em 2em">Creative Writing (M.F.A.)<br />Curriculum and Instruction (Ph.D.) (jointly administered with the College of Education)<br />Exercise Science (Ph.D.)<br />Gerontology Program (Certificate in Gerontology)<br />Justice Studies (Ph.D.)<br />Science and Engineering of Materials (Ph.D.)<br />Speech and Hearing Science (Ph.D.)<br />Statistics (M.S.)<br />Transportation Systems (Certificate in Transportation Systems)</div><p></p><p>Other interdisciplinary programs include Communication (Ph.D.), administered by the College of Public Programs; History and Theory of Art (Ph.D.), jointly offered with the University of Arizona, administered by the School of Art; Humanities (M.A.), administered by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; and Molecular and Cellular Biology (M.S., Ph.D.), administered by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.</p><p>Each of these programs uses resources and faculty from several disciplines. The programs promote cooperative research and instruction among faculty who share common interests but are housed in different academic units. Interdisciplinary programs allow students to pursue degrees that are intellectually coherent while bringing together diverse strengths of the university.</p><p><a name="certificate-programs"></a></p><h3>Certificate Programs - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>A number of certificate programs are offered by various academic units or programs on campus. For more information, see &#8220;<!--<a href="asu-certificates.html#asu-graduate-certificates">-->ASU Graduate Certificates<!--</a>-->&#8221; table. - <a href="#top"><font size="-1">Back to Top</font></a></p><p><a name="admission-to-the-graduate-college"></a></p><h2>ADMISSION TO THE GRADUATE COLLEGE - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h2><p><a name="eligibility"></a></p><h3>Eligibility - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>To apply for admission, an applicant must hold a U.S. bachelor&#8217;s degree (or the equivalent) from a regionally accredited institution. A bachelor&#8217;s degree in the United States is a four-year degree that follows 12 years of primary and secondary school work.</p><p>Anyone who holds a bachelor&#8217;s (or the equivalent) or graduate degree from a college or university of recognized standing is eligible to apply for admission to the Graduate College. Remedies for undergraduate deficiencies may be assigned if the undergraduate degree is based on credits not accepted by ASU, such as life experience or noncredit workshops and seminars.</p><p><a name="graduate-college-requirements"></a></p><h3>Graduate College Requirements - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Generally, an applicant must have a GPA of 3.00 (scale is 4.00 = A), or the equivalent, in the last two years of work leading to the bachelor&#8217;s degree. A student who enters a graduate degree program is expected to have undergraduate educational experiences, including general education studies, that are similar to those required for the baccalaureate degree at ASU.</p><p><a name="requirements-of-the-academic-unit"></a></p><h3>Requirements of the Academic Unit - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Academic units, departments, or colleges, may have admission requirements in addition to those of the Graduate College. Many graduate programs require scores from a national admissions test such as the Graduate Record Examination, Graduate Management Admission Test, or the Miller Analogies Test. Some programs require a portfolio, letters of recommendation, or a statement of goals. Applicants should contact the academic unit regarding specific requirements.</p><p><a name="submission-of-an-application"></a></p><h3>Submission of an Application - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>For admission information and procedures, access the Web site at  <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions">www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions</a>, or refer to the  <i>Application for Graduate Admission</i>  booklet. Students may apply via the Web, by mail, or by fax.</p><p><a name="application-fee"></a></p><h3>Application Fee - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Each application for entry to ASU graduate programs must be accompanied by a nonrefundable application processing fee. The fee is $45 to apply for admission to a degree program and $15 to apply for nondegree studies. For admission information and procedures, access the Web site at  <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions">www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions</a>, or refer to the  <i>Application for Graduate Admission</i>  booklet. </p><p> <i>Note: </i> Applications are not processed until the fee is received.</p><p><a name="international-applicants"></a></p><h3>International Applicants - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Applicants who will attend the university while holding F-1 or J-1 visas must meet the regulations of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in addition to the requirements of the Graduate College and the academic units to which they apply.</p><p>International applicants must meet the requirements of the Graduate College as well as those of the degree programs to which they apply. Applicants from outside the United States are also required to submit additional materials and should follow the procedures described in the  <i>Application for Graduate Admission</i>  booklet or on the Web at  <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions">www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions</a>. International applicants should read this information carefully to become familiar with all requirements, consulting it often for instructions regarding materials. The  <i>Graduate Catalog </i> provides essential information about ASU and its graduate programs, but applicants can also consult the ASU listings in  <i>Peterson&#8217;s Graduate Education Directory</i>  and in the  <i>Directory of Graduate Programs</i>  (published by the Educational Testing Service).</p><p><a name="toefl-requirement"></a></p><p><b>TOEFL Requirement.</b> Among the additional materials required of international students are scores from English language examinations. All applicants whose native language is not English must submit a score from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The TOEFL can be waived for students who have graduated from a college or university in a country whose native language is English, or for a student who has had immigrant status (permanent residency) in the United States for at least 18 months. For a complete list of TOEFL requirements, see page 7 of the  <i>Graduate Admissions</i>  booklet, or refer to the Web site at  <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions/international.html">www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions/international.html</a>.</p><p>All international applicants who do not speak English as a primary language and who wish to apply for teaching assistantships must pass an examination that certifies their skill in speaking English&#8212;either the Test of Spoken English (TSE), which may be taken in the student&#8217;s home country, or the Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit (SPEAK) test, which is administered at ASU. Some degree programs also require TSE or SPEAK scores of applicants whose native language is not English. For specific information about TSE requirements, contact the head of the academic unit.</p><p>As required by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, international applicants must also verify that they have the financial resources to cover their expenses during graduate study at ASU. The Financial Guarantee form is available in the  <i>Application for Graduate Admission</i>  booklet. It can also be accessed through the Graduate College Web site at  <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions">www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions</a>. The I-20 or the IAP66 (documents needed to obtain a student visa) are issued only after the completed, properly verified Financial Guarantee form and support document have arrived. International students may enroll at ASU only if they have been admitted to a degree program, a certificate program, or the postbaccalaureate teacher education program. They must meet all appropriate immigration standards and requirements.</p><p>Applications are processed when they are received. However, international applicants should submit all materials in December or January in order to begin study the following fall semester and in August or September in order to begin study the following spring semester. An application fee of $45 (in U.S. funds) must accompany each formal degree program application.</p><p>All F-1 or J-1 visa students must have insurance coverage against illness and accident before being permitted to register. Insurance must be maintained throughout the student&#8217;s enrollment in the university and may be obtained at the time of registration.</p><p>Upon arrival on campus, students must report to an advisor in the International Student Office.</p><p><a name="additional-information"></a></p><h3>Additional Information - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>The Graduate College does not have deadlines. Applications are processed as they are received. However, many academic units have specific and early deadlines; many units review applications once a year, usually in January or February for fall admission. Applicants are urged to contact the academic units regarding deadlines.</p><p>Academic units, which must indicate their willingness to admit applicants, frequently set higher standards than those established by the Graduate College. Many qualified applicants are denied because of limits on the number of students admitted each year.</p><p><a name="notice-of-admission-decisions"></a></p><h3>Notice of Admission Decisions - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Only the dean of the Graduate College can make formal offers of admission. The Graduate College notifies all applicants in writing of the admission decision.</p><p>All academic credentials and supporting materials received by the university in connection with an application for admission become the property of ASU. If the applicant does not enroll in the university within one year, the admission documents may be destroyed.</p><p>The date (month/day/year) on the Graduate College dean&#8217;s letter of admission is the actual date of admission. If the student is enrolled in courses on the admission date, those courses&#8212;if applicable&#8212;may be considered part of a program of study. Courses taken the semester before this date are considered nondegree hours.</p><p><a name="admission-classifications"></a></p><h3>Admission Classifications - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p><a name="regular-admission"></a></p><p><b>Regular Admission.</b> Applicants who fulfill all requirements for admission and are academically acceptable to both the academic unit and the Graduate College are granted regular admission.</p><p><a name="regular-admission-with-deficiencies"></a></p><p><b>Regular Admission with Deficiencies.</b> A student whose grades and test scores are at an acceptable level but who does not have the undergraduate background expected by the academic unit and the university may be required to complete courses to remedy deficiencies. In such cases, the letter of admission specifies the deficiencies that must be completed before the student is awarded a graduate degree. Deficiency courses may not be applied toward the minimum hours required for the degree program.</p><p><a name="provisional-admission"></a></p><p><b>Provisional Admission.</b> A student who does not meet minimum academic standards but has counterbalancing evidence to suggest the potential for success may be admitted on a provisional basis. Provisional admission provides an academic unit with more evidence on which to base its decision. Normally the academic unit reviews the student&#8217;s status following completion of 12 semester hours of approved graduate study. At that time, the academic unit recommends to the Graduate College a change in status to either regular admission or withdrawal from the program. When students have completed their provisional requirements, they should check with their advisors to make sure that the change of status has been recommended. A provisional student may also be assigned deficiencies.</p><p><a name="nondegree-admission"></a></p><p><b>Nondegree Admission.</b> A student not interested in earning a degree or not ready to apply to a particular degree program may enroll as a nondegree student. The application process is streamlined and does not require submission of transcripts or test scores. For nondegree admission information and procedures, access the Web site at  <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions">www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions</a> or refer to the  <i>Application for Graduate Admission</i>  booklet. Students may apply electronically. A maximum of nine hours taken at ASU while in this category may be applied toward a master&#8217;s degree if appropriate for the student&#8217;s program of study.</p><p>The six-year maximum time limit applies to nondegree semester hours appearing on a master&#8217;s program of study. In addition, because of limited class size and resources, certain academic units may limit the enrollment of nondegree students.</p><p><a name="recognition-of-a-degree"></a></p><h3>Recognition of a Degree - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Recognition of a degree is acknowledgment that the program leading to the degree is equivalent to a program offered by ASU or is an acceptable program for the proposed graduate major at ASU. A student who enters a graduate degree program at ASU is expected to have undergraduate educational experiences, including general education studies, that are appropriate for the program.</p><p><a name="definition-of-a-unit-of-credit"></a></p><h3>Definition of a Unit of Credit - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>The Arizona Board of Regents has defined (May 26, 1979) a unit of credit for the institutions under its jurisdiction. A minimum of 45 hours of work by each student is required for each unit of credit. An hour of work is the equivalent of 50 minutes of class time (often called a &#8220;contact hour&#8221;) or 60 minutes of independent study work. For lecture-discussion courses, this requirement equates to at least 15 contact hours and a minimum of 30 hours of work outside of the classroom for each unit of credit. Even though the values of 15 and 30 may vary for different modes of instruction, the minimum total of 45 hours of work for each unit of credit is a constant. Since the unit of credit as defined by the Arizona Board of Regents is the cornerstone of academic degree programs at ASU, degrees granted by other institutions that are recognized by ASU should be based on a similar unit of credit.</p><p><a name="graduate-college-procedures"></a></p><h2>GRADUATE COLLEGE PROCEDURES - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h2><p><a name="change-in-graduate-degree-program"></a></p><h3>Change in Graduate Degree Program - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>A change from one graduate degree program to another requires a new application to the Graduate College. The usual admission procedures are followed. For details on matters relating to the application fee, see Fees, Deposits, and Other Charges, &#8220;<a href="gc-fees.html#admission-application">Admission Application</a>.&#8221;</p><p><a name="readmission-to-the-graduate-college"></a></p><h3>Readmission to the Graduate College - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Any graduate student who has not been in attendance at the university for one or more semesters must submit an application for readmission to the Graduate College. The application should be submitted at least one month before the beginning of the semester in which the student plans to reenter. For details on readmission and other matters relating to the application fee, access the Web site at  <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions">www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions</a>, or refer to the  <i>Application for Graduate Admission</i>  booklet.</p><p><a name="determination-of-catalog-requirements"></a></p><h3>Determination of Catalog Requirements - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>The  <i>Graduate Catalog</i>  is published annually. Requirements for an academic unit or college, campus, or the university as a whole, may change and are often upgraded.</p><p>A student graduates under the curriculum, course requirements, and regulations for graduation in effect at the time of admission to a graduate degree program at ASU. A student may also choose to graduate under any subsequent catalog issued.  <i>In determining graduation requirements, a student may use only one catalog.</i></p><p>Some changes in policies and procedures affect all students regardless of the catalog used by the student. These policies and procedures may appear in the catalog or in other university publications.</p><p><a name="registration"></a></p><h3>Registration - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Graduate students, like all university students, register during the intervals indicated in the  <i>Schedule of Classes</i>  issued by the Office of the Registrar. Details regarding registration and course drop-add procedures are also provided in the  <i>Schedule of Classes.</i> Day and evening graduate classes, offered on or off campus, during the two regular semesters and the summer sessions, are considered part of the regular program.</p><p>SunDial, the ASU touch-tone telephone system for registration and fee payment, and the online registration system, accessed at any registrar site, ease the enrollment process.</p><p><a name="audit-enrollment"></a></p><h3>Audit Enrollment - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Graduate students may register as auditors in one or more courses with the approval of the supervisory committee chair and the consent of the instructor involved. The student must be registered properly and pay the fees for the course. An audited course is counted in the student&#8217;s maximum course load. It does not count for students who must take a minimum number of credits, e.g., graduate assistants or students receiving financial assistance. The mark of &#8220;X&#8221; is recorded for completion of an audited course, unless the instructor determines that the student&#8217;s participation or attendance has been inadequate, in which case a &#8220;W&#8221; may be recorded.</p><p><a name="withdrawal-policies-and-procedures"></a></p><h3>Withdrawal Policies and Procedures - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Students who find it necessary to withdraw from the university should obtain and complete an official withdrawal form from any registrar site. Until officially withdrawn, the student is registered in all courses and, at the end of the semester, receives grades appropriate for the performance in each course. A student who officially withdraws from the university during the first four weeks of a semester receives the mark of &#8220;W&#8221; in all courses registered. A student who officially withdraws from the university later than the fourth week receives a mark of &#8220;W&#8221; or &#8220;E,&#8221; depending upon the quality of work at the time of official withdrawal. No student is permitted to withdraw during or after the last two weeks of the semester (the last week of classes and final examination week).</p><p>Failure to withdraw officially from a course results in a grade of &#8220;E,&#8221; which is used in the computation of the GPA. The  <i>Schedule of Classes</i>  lists the procedures for withdrawal.</p><p>An instructor may withdraw a student from a class with a mark of &#8220;W&#8221; or a grade of &#8220;E&#8221; only if the student&#8217;s continued presence in the course is disruptive to the instructor&#8217;s ability to teach the course. A student may appeal an instructor-initiated withdrawal within 10 days of being withdrawn to the standards committee of the college in which the course is offered. The decision of the committee is final.</p><p>A graduate student who does not enroll for three calendar years is considered withdrawn and must submit a new application for admission to a degree program.</p><p><a name="unrestricted-withdrawal"></a></p><p><b>Unrestricted Withdrawal.</b> During the first four weeks of a semester or the first six days of a summer session, a student may withdraw from any course with a mark of &#8220;W.&#8221; See the  <i>Schedule of Classes</i>  or the  <i>Summer Sessions Bulletin</i>  for the dates of the unrestricted withdrawal period.</p><p><a name="restricted-withdrawal"></a></p><p><b>Restricted Withdrawal.</b> From the fifth week to the end of the 10th week of a semester and from the seventh day to the end of the third week of a summer session, students may withdraw with a mark of &#8220;W&#8221; from courses only in which the instructor certifies that they are passing at the time of the withdrawal. See the  <i>Schedule of Classes</i>  or the  <i>Summer Sessions Bulletin</i> for dates of the restricted withdrawal period.</p><p><a name="medical-withdrawal"></a></p><p><b>Medical Withdrawal.</b> Normally, a medical withdrawal request is made in cases where serious illness or injury prevents a student from completing course work or finishing incompletes or when other arrangements with the instructor are not possible. Consideration is usually given for complete withdrawal. An application for less than a complete withdrawal must be well documented to justify the selective nature of the medical withdrawal request. This policy applies both to cases involving physical health problems and those involving mental or emotional difficulties.</p><p>To receive permission for a medical withdrawal from courses, a student must present a Request for Documented Medical Withdrawal form and proper documentation (usually a letter from a physician) of the medical condition to the medical withdrawal designee of the college of the student&#8217;s major. For complete procedural information, contact the appropriate medical withdrawal designee.</p><p><a name="course-load"></a></p><h3>Course Load - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>The course load is determined by the supervisory committee but is not to exceed 15 semester hours of credit during each of the two semesters. Refer to the latest  <i>Summer Sessions Bulletin</i>  for course load limits for five-week and eight-week sessions. An audited course is counted in the student&#8217;s maximum load.</p><p>All teaching and research assistants and associates must enroll for a minimum of six semester hours during each semester (fall and spring) of their appointment.

Grades on transfer work or ASU law credit are not included in computing GPAs.</p><p>There are two graduate GPA calculations, the cumulative GPA of graduate-level (i.e., 500-level and above) course work on the transcript, and the GPA calculation on the program of study. A student receiving a grade of &#8220;D&#8221; or &#8220;E&#8221; must repeat the course in a regularly scheduled (not an individualized instruction) class, and obtain a grade of &#8220;C&#8221; or higher, <i> if the student chooses to include it on the program of study.</i> When a course is repeated and the new grade is listed on the program of study, both the new grade and the initial &#8220;D&#8221; or &#8220;E&#8221; are averaged in computing the cumulative GPA of graduate-level course work on the transcript. If a student chooses not to repeat the course after receiving a &#8220;D&#8221; or &#8220;E,&#8221; the &#8220;D&#8221; or &#8220;E&#8221; is still reflected in the cumulative GPA calculation of graduate-level course work on the transcript. To graduate, all graduate students must have a minimum 3.0 GPA calculation both on the program of study, and in the cumulative GPA of graduate-level course work listed on the transcript.</p><p>Graduate course work (500-, 600-, and 700-level courses) reported as an &#8220;I&#8221; (incomplete) must be completed within one calendar year. At the time the &#8220;I&#8221; grade is given, the student must complete a &#8220;Request for Grade of Incomplete&#8221; form. The form first serves as a record of the &#8220;I&#8221; grade and the work required to complete it. When the student has completed the work, the form then serves as a change-of-grade authorization.</p><p>If the work specified on the form is not completed within one calendar year, the &#8220;I&#8221; grade (500-, 600-, and 700-level courses) becomes part of the student&#8217;s permanent transcript. The student is not allowed to complete the course work as specified on the &#8220;Incomplete&#8221; form. The student may, however, repeat the course after the &#8220;I&#8221; has become permanent, by reregistering, paying fees, and fulfilling all course requirements. The grade for the repeated course appears on the transcript but does not replace the permanent &#8220;I.&#8221;</p><p><a name="grades-table"></a></p><p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><font size="+1"><b>Grades</b></font></div><hr /><div style="text-align: center;"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5"><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Grade<hr /></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Definition<hr /></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Value<hr /></th></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td valign="top">Excellent</td><td valign="top">4.00</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">B</td><td valign="top">Good</td><td valign="top">3.00</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C</td><td valign="top">Passing</td><td valign="top">2.00</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">D</td><td valign="top">No graduate credit</td><td valign="top">1.00</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">E</td><td valign="top">Failure</td><td valign="top">0.00</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">I</td><td valign="top">Incomplete</td><td valign="top">&#8212;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">W</td><td valign="top">Withdrawal<sup>1</sup></td><td valign="top">&#8212;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">X</td><td valign="top">Audit</td><td valign="top">&#8212;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Y</td><td valign="top">Satisfactory</td><td valign="top">&#8212;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Z</td><td valign="top">Course in progress<sup>2</sup></td><td valign="top">&#8212;</td></tr></table></div><hr /><table><tr><td valign="top"><sup>1</sup></td><td valign="top">This grade is given whenever a student officially withdraws.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><sup>2</sup></td><td valign="top">This grade is usually given pending completion of courses.</td></tr></table><p><a name="repeating-asu-courses"></a></p><p><b>Repeating ASU Courses.</b> Graduate students (degree or nondegree) may retake any courses at any level at ASU, but all grades remain on the student transcript and within the cumulative GPA calculation of the transcript.</p><p><a name="university-policy-for-student-appeal-procedures-on-grades"></a></p><h3>University Policy for Student Appeal Procedures on Grades - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p><a name="informal"></a></p><p><b>Informal.</b> The steps outlined below, beginning with step A, must be followed by any student seeking to appeal a grade. Student grade appeals must be processed in the regular semester immediately following the issuance of the grade in dispute (by commencement for fall or spring), regardless of whether the student is enrolled at the university. It is university policy that students filing grievances and those who are witnesses will be protected from retaliation.

The first GPA is based on all courses numbered 500 or higher that appear on the transcript. (Courses noted as deficiencies in the original letter of admission are not included.) The second GPA is based on all courses that appear on the program of study.</p><p>Graduate students (degree or nondegree) may retake any courses at any level at ASU, but all grades remain on the student transcript as well as on the cumulative GPA calculation of the transcript.</p><p>Academic excellence is expected of students doing graduate work. Upon recommendation from the head of the academic unit, the dean of the Graduate College can withdraw a student who is not progressing satisfactorily.</p><p>The designation of honors (<i>summa cum laude, magna cum laude,</i>  and  <i>cum laude</i>) is reserved for undergraduates.

Courses at the 400 level apply to graduate degree requirements when appearing on an approved program of study. However, 400-level courses are not graduate courses by definition and cannot be certified as such for purposes of employment or transferring to other institutions.</p><p><a name="reserving-of-course-credit-by-undergraduates"></a></p><p><b>Reserving of Course Credit by Undergraduates.</b> Seniors at ASU within 12 semester hours of graduation may enroll in a 400-level or graduate course and reserve the credit for possible use in a future graduate program. The course cannot be used to meet a baccalaureate graduation requirement. Before registration in the class, the student must submit a Graduate College Petition form requesting credit reservation; the form must be signed by the student&#8217;s advisor, the head of the academic unit offering the class, and the dean of the Graduate College.</p><p>Permission to reserve a course does not guarantee admission to a graduate degree program or that the course may be used toward graduate degree requirements. A maximum of nine hours of credit may be reserved, and only courses with an &#8220;A&#8221; or &#8220;B&#8221; grade are applicable. Reserved credit earned before admission to a graduate degree program is classified as nondegree credit. The maximum course load for a student enrolled in a reserved course is 15 semester hours during a regular semester and six hours during a summer session.</p><p><a name="transfer-credit"></a></p><p><b>Transfer Credit.</b>  Transfer of credit is the acceptance of credit from another institution for inclusion in a program of study leading to a degree awarded by ASU. The number of hours transferred from other institutions may not exceed 20 percent of the total minimum semester hours required for a master&#8217;s degree unless stated otherwise for a specific degree program.</p><p>Transfer credit taken before admission to a graduate degree program at ASU Main or East is nondegree credit. Nondegree credit taken at ASU Main or East combined with nondegree credit taken at another institution may not exceed nine hours on the master&#8217;s program of study. The nine-hour limit does not apply to doctoral programs.</p><p>The date (month/day/year) on the Graduate College dean&#8217;s letter of admission is the actual date of admission. If the student is enrolled in courses on the admission date, those courses&#8212;if applicable&#8212;may be considered part of a program of study. Courses taken the semester before this date are nondegree hours. Courses taken at ASU West are considered transferred credit.</p><p>Transfer credits must be acceptable toward graduate degrees at the institution where the courses were completed. Certain types of graduate credits cannot be transferred to ASU, including the following:</p><ol><li>credits awarded by postsecondary institutions in the United States that lack candidate status or accreditation by a regional accrediting association;<br />&nbsp;</li><li>credits awarded by postsecondary institutions for life experience;<br />&nbsp;</li><li>credits awarded by postsecondary institutions for courses taken at noncollegiate institutions (e.g., government agencies, corporations, and industrial firms);<br />&nbsp;</li><li>credits awarded by postsecondary institutions for noncredit courses, workshops, and seminars offered by other postsecondary institutions as part of continuing education programs; and<br />&nbsp;</li><li>credits given for extension courses.<br />&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Acceptable academic credits earned at other institutions that are based on a different unit of credit than the ones prescribed by the Arizona Board of Regents are subject to conversion before being transferred to ASU.</p><p>Only resident graduate courses with an &#8220;A&#8221; or &#8220;B&#8221; grade may be transferred. A course with the grade of pass, credit, or satisfactory may not be transferred.</p><p>Official transcripts of any transfer credit to be used on a program of study must be sent directly to the Graduate Admissions Office from the Office of the Registrar at the institution where the credit was earned.</p><p><a name="graduate-supervisory-committees"></a></p><h3>Graduate Supervisory Committees - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>When the program of study is filed, upon the recommendation of the head of the academic unit, the dean of the Graduate College appoints a graduate student&#8217;s supervisory committee, consisting of a chair and other resident faculty members. The number of members serving on this committee depends on the degree program.</p><p>Academic professionals (e.g., research scientists, research engineers), nontenure-track faculty (e.g., adjunct professors, research professors), and individuals granted affiliated faculty status through established university procedures may serve as cochairs, members, or extra members of thesis and dissertation committees upon approval by the Graduate College. Individuals who are recommended by an academic unit as eligible to serve as a cochair must meet the criteria established by the academic unit and be approved by the Graduate College.</p><p>Upon the recommendation of the committee chair and head of the academic unit, ASU West tenured (or tenure-track) faculty may serve on master&#8217;s and doctoral committees at ASU Main. ASU West tenured (or tenure-track) faculty may serve as cochairs for theses and dissertations at ASU Main upon the recommendation of the head of the academic unit and approval of the dean of the Graduate College. Cochairs must meet the academic unit&#8217;s criteria for chairing theses and dissertations.</p><p>Qualified individuals outside the university, upon the recommendation of the head of the academic unit and approval of the Graduate College, may serve as members of thesis and dissertation committees; however, such individuals may not serve as chairs or cochairs (unless they have affiliated faculty status). With the approval of the academic unit and the dean of the Graduate College, former ASU faculty with students completing their degrees may continue to serve as cochairs. At least 50 percent of the committee must be faculty from ASU Main.</p><p>Once a student has an approved program of study on file and the committee is in place, it is the student&#8217;s responsibility to file a Graduate Supervisory Committee Appointment form in the event of a committee change. The Graduate Supervisory Committee Appointment form for committee changes is accessible from the Graduate College in Wilson Hall or the Web site at  <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/forms">www.asu.edu/graduate/forms</a>.</p><p><a name="gc-foreign-language-requirements"></a><a name="foreign-language-requirements"></a></p><h3>Foreign Language Requirements - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>A graduate degree program may require proficiency in a foreign language. If a foreign language is required, students must demonstrate at least a reading knowledge in the area of study required by the supervisory committee and consistent with the requirements for the graduate degree program. Normally, the language is selected from French, German, Russian, or Spanish, although other languages may be recommended when there is adequate justification.</p><p>Students who are required to demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language must pass a foreign language examination specific to their particular graduate program. The examinations are administered three times each year by the Department of Languages and Literatures, which certifies language competency. Students planning to take the examination must register with the Department of Languages and Literatures at least one month in advance of the examination date. The chair of the student&#8217;s supervisory committee is responsible for providing the Department of Languages and Literatures with materials from which the examination is then prepared. The chair should submit or recommend relevant books or journals of approximately 200 pages in length in the desired foreign language.</p><p>A student may petition the Graduate College for a reexamination but must pass the examination in no more than three attempts.</p><p><a name="theses-and-dissertations"></a></p><h3>Theses and Dissertations - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>The master&#8217;s thesis or equivalent is an introduction to research writing. All doctoral degree candidates must submit a dissertation, with the exception of the Doctor of Musical Arts degree in Music (concentrations in choral conducting and solo performance), which requires three recitals and a research paper. The Ph.D. dissertation should be a valuable educational experience that demonstrates the candidate&#8217;s mastery of research methods, theory, and tools of the discipline. It should demonstrate the candidate&#8217;s ability to address a major intellectual problem and to propose meaningful questions and hypotheses. The dissertation should be a contribution to knowledge that is worthy of publication by an established press as a book or monograph or as one or more articles in a reputable journal.</p><p>For format, the Graduate College must review the final copy of the master&#8217;s thesis, doctoral dissertation, and other final documents that are required to be placed in the library. Copies of the  <i>Format Manual</i> are available on the Web at  <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/resources/student/formatinfo">www.asu.edu/graduate/resources/student/formatinfo</a> and in the Graduate College. The student is required to submit appropriate signed forms and a complete copy of the thesis or dissertation for format review at least 10 working days (two weeks if there are no holidays during the time period) before the oral defense. Doctoral students must also submit a completed Survey of Earned Doctorates Awarded in the United States, conducted by the National Research Council.</p><p>Graduate students and their supervisory committee chairs jointly select a style guide or journal format representative of the field of study. The Graduate College allows certain flexibility in the format of the manuscript, but Graduate College and library guidelines must be followed.</p><p>The student must submit two final copies of a thesis or dissertation to the ASU Bookstore for binding. The student is responsible for the binding fees. Bound copies are placed in the Hayden Library and Archives. Doctoral students must submit one copy of the title page, approval page, and abstract (which must not exceed 350 words); the original signature of the doctoral student must appear on the University Microfilms International (UMI) Dissertation Agreement Form. The student is responsible for the UMI microfilming fee, which covers the expense of having the document sent to UMI, where it is microfilmed and catalogued.

Before filing an appeal, the graduate student should discuss the situation with the associate dean of the Graduate College to explore resolution of the matter at the unit or college level.</p><p><a name="gcab"></a></p><p><b>GCAB.</b> The purpose of the board is to review written appeals of graduate students. (On occasion a faculty member may be appealing the decision about a graduate student made by a program, an academic unit, the Graduate College, or another college.) Such appeals concern</p><ol><li>retention in graduate programs;<br />&nbsp;</li><li>other academic issues (except grade appeals, which are handled in academic colleges); and<br />&nbsp;</li><li>procedural matters in graduate student programs (e.g., programs of study, thesis/dissertation, exams).<br />&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The GCAB consists of three or more members of the Graduate Council appointed by the dean of the Graduate College at the beginning of each academic year. In specific cases the GCAB may ask for additional members from the faculty or one or more graduate students to be appointed by the dean of the Graduate College. The GCAB is chaired by one of the members as designated by the dean or associate dean. The GCAB is assisted by the assistant dean, who oversees the hearing but does not serve as a member of the GCAB. Membership is on an annual basis, but members of the Graduate Council may serve for a maximum of three consecutive years. To the extent possible, GCAB membership does not change during a student appeal. A member continues to serve on the GCAB into the next academic year if an appeal is continued during that time.</p><p><a name="meetings"></a></p><p><b>Meetings.</b> The board meets when notified by the assistant dean that an appeal is pending. The GCAB requires two-thirds of the committee present for a quorum. A GCAB member must disqualify herself or himself if a case involves a student in her or his academic unit or the member has some direct tie to the student who is appealing. The dean of the Graduate College replaces the individual with a current or past Graduate Council member. A recording secretary is selected before each appeal. This person keeps notes of the hearing. Secretarial support for typing notes is provided by the assistant dean. A tape is made of the hearing.</p><p><a name="jurisdiction"></a></p><p><b>Jurisdiction.</b> The GCAB has the authority to receive written appeals from graduate students on the review of any action or decision by any university faculty member, staff member, or administrator. However, any appeal must first be reviewed at the level of the academic unit from which the graduate student is making an appeal.</p><p>The GCAB has the right to decide not to hear an appeal. In this case, the decision of the academic unit is final. The GCAB may hear appeals on program dismissal, other academic issues, or procedural issues. In addition, the GCAB hears any appeal referred to it by the dean of the Graduate College.</p><p>The GCAB does not review</p><ol><li>appeals of course grades, including omnibus courses such as independent research, thesis, or dissertation, which are handled through the academic colleges;<br />&nbsp;</li><li>appeals concerning academic dishonesty, which are handled by the academic unit with appeals to the University Hearing Board;<br />&nbsp;</li><li>appeals concerning scientific misconduct, which are handled by the academic unit with appeals to the Council of Research and Creative Activity through the Office of the Vice Provost for Research;<br />&nbsp;</li><li>appeals for which the graduate student has not fully used all other appeal and review processes (e.g., the academic unit);<br />&nbsp;</li><li>appeals filed more than 30 calendar days after receiving notification of the action taken at an appeal by the academic unit (or, if appropriate, another university committee);<br />&nbsp;</li><li>allegations of discrimination; and<br />&nbsp;</li><li>other appeals or grievances under the jurisdiction of other university boards and committees.<br />&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Appeals are not heard during the summer. The calendar stops on the last day of exams for the spring semester and begins on the first day of classes for the fall semester.</p><p><a name="mediation"></a></p><p><b>Mediation.</b> Mediation between the graduate student and any university official is always a preferred option to a hearing. If mediation appears beneficial when the initial appeal is filed with the GCAB, the GCAB may recommend that mediation occur and select a mediator. If mediation is successful and both parties agree to the decision, a written record of the outcome is filed by the mediator with the GCAB, all parties involved, and the dean of the Graduate College. If mediation is not successful, the graduate student has 30 days from the end of the mediation process to request in writing a formal appeal hearing.</p><p><a name="authority"></a></p><p><b>Authority.</b> The GCAB may affirm or reverse the original decision being appealed and make such recommendations for further actions as appropriate. In the course of any hearing, the GCAB is authorized to request additional evidence or testimony by any student, faculty or staff member, administrator, other university employee, or other individual as a witness. The GCAB has final authority in procedural matters. The decision of the GCAB is final. The chair of the GCAB notifies all parties of the decision.</p><p><a name="filing-an-appeal"></a></p><p><b>Filing an Appeal.</b> Before an appeal comes to the GCAB, the normal channels for resolving disputes must have been consulted. The appellant should consult with the major professor to resolve the issue at that level. If the issue cannot be resolved with the major professor, the appellant should seek out the department chair or designated individual for resolution. In some cases, if the major professor and department chair have not been able to resolve the issue or the outcome still needs to be pursued, it may be appropriate to pursue the issue with the academic college dean. If the issue has not been resolved at one of these levels, an appeal to the GCAB may be pursued.</p><p>Before initiating an appeal, the graduate student should speak to the associate dean of the Graduate College to see if the issue can be resolved informally. Should negotiation, through the associate dean of the Graduate College, not succeed, the graduate student may submit a written appeal.</p><p>All appeals must be submitted in writing to the associate or assistant dean of the Graduate College. Witnesses and any other pertinent evidence must be listed in the appeal. The written appeal must specify the grounds for the appeal as listed in the document &#8220;Guidelines for Appeals,&#8221; available in the Graduate College. Only documents that follow the guidelines are considered, although university regulations pertinent to the case may be used as supporting grounds. It is incumbent upon the student to demonstrate to the GCAB that grounds for the appeal exist. The written appeal may not exceed 10 pages.</p><p>The associate or assistant dean notifies the appellee and requests, in writing, information from the appellee related to the case. The initial written response by the appellee is submitted within 15 days of receiving notice of the appeal.</p><p><a name="masters-degrees"></a></p><h1>Master&#8217;s Degrees - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h1><p>Faculty at ASU offer programs leading to the Master of Arts (M.A.) degree, the Master of Science (M.S.) degree, and various professional master&#8217;s degrees.

The committee is composed of a minimum of three members, including a chair, for students writing a thesis or equivalent.</p><p><a name="program-of-study"></a></p><p><b>Program of Study.</b> After regular status has been granted, it is in the student&#8217;s best interest to have an official program of study filed with the Graduate College at the earliest possible date. When the program of study is filed, a supervisory committee is appointed by the dean of the Graduate College upon the recommendation of the head of the academic unit (verified by the signature on the program of study). Changes in the planned program may be made by the student&#8217;s supervisory committee, with the approval of the head of the academic unit and the dean of the Graduate College. Forms for the submission of the program of study are available in the Graduate College, in the Graduation section of the Office of the Registrar (located in the Student Services Building), or on the Web at  <a href="http://www.asu.edu/registrar/forms/pos.html">www.asu.edu/registrar/forms/pos.html</a>.

The date (month/day/year) on the Graduate College dean&#8217;s letter of admission is the actual date of admission. If the student is enrolled in courses on the admission date, those courses&#8212;if applicable&#8212;may be considered part of a program of study. Courses taken the semester before this date are nondegree hours. Individual academic units may have a policy of accepting fewer than nine semester hours attained before admission. For details, refer to the specific degree program.</p><p>Graduate credit earned at another institution before admission to a graduate degree program at ASU is nondegree credit. Nondegree credit earned at ASU Main and East combined with nondegree credit earned at another institution may not exceed nine semester hours in the program of study. For example, if six semester hours earned before admission to ASU are transferred from another institution, only three nondegree semester hours may be from ASU Main or East for a master&#8217;s degree program. (See &#8220;<a href="#transfer-credit">Transfer Credit</a>.&#8221;)</p><p>The six-year maximum time limit applies to nondegree/transferred semester hours appearing on a program of study.

The student should refer to the specific degree program.</p><p><a name="college-of-law-credit"></a></p><p><b>College of Law Credit.</b> The Graduate College accepts a numerical grade of 70 or above for courses taken in the College of Law at ASU as part of an approved program of study for a master&#8217;s degree program. These grades are not used in the two GPAs calculated for graduation: the courses on the program of study and all courses numbered 500 and above.</p><p>A maximum of six semester hours taken in the College of Law may be included in a 30-hour program of study for a master&#8217;s degree. For a 36- to 45-hour program, the number of hours is limited to a maximum of nine semester hours of course work in the College of Law.</p><p><a name="foreign-language-requirements"></a></p><p><b>Foreign Language Requirements.</b> A graduate degree program may have a foreign language requirement. This requirement must be fulfilled before the student is eligible to apply for the final written comprehensive examination or the defense of the thesis or equivalent. For certification of proficiency, see &#8220;<a href="#gc-foreign-language-requirements">Foreign Language Requirements</a>.&#8221;</p><p><a name="comprehensive-examinations"></a></p><p><b>Comprehensive Examinations.</b> A comprehensive examination, written, oral, or both, administered by the academic unit, is required in all professional master&#8217;s programs that do not have a thesis or equivalent requirement. A comprehensive examination is optional in other programs. Students are not eligible to apply for the comprehensives or for the oral defense of the thesis or equivalent until they have been regularly admitted, have filed an approved program of study, removed any deficiencies, and fulfilled any foreign language requirements. Students are required to register for at least one semester hour of credit that appears on the program of study or one hour of appropriate graduate-level credit (such as 595, 695, and 795 Continuing Registration) during the semester or summer session in which they take their comprehensive examinations. Failure in the comprehensive examination is considered final unless the supervisory committee and the head of the academic unit recommend, and the dean of the Graduate College approves, a reexamination. Only one reexamination is permitted. A reexamination may be administered no sooner than three months and no later than one year from the date of the original examination.</p><p><a name="thesis-or-equivalent-requirements"></a></p><p><b>Thesis or Equivalent Requirements.</b> To satisfy the research requirement for most M.A. or M.S. degrees, a student is expected to present a thesis or equivalent, which is defended in an oral examination. Some professional master&#8217;s programs may also require a thesis, research project, performance, or exhibition. The requirement varies with each major. Each student writing a thesis or equivalent must register for a minimum of six semester hours of thesis or for a combination of research and thesis totaling six hours, which are directed toward a common research problem.</p><p>Credit taken to fulfill the thesis or equivalent enrollment requirement must appear on the program of study.</p><p>A student writing a thesis must include on the program of study six hours of 592 Research and 599 Thesis, at least three of which must be 599 Thesis. Although additional 592 Research hours may be included on a program of study, a maximum of six hours of 599 Thesis may be used.</p><p>A thesis or equivalent should be of high quality, giving evidence that the program provided an introduction to research. Format evaluation of the thesis or equivalent, described under &#8220;<a href="#theses-and-dissertations">Theses and Dissertations</a>,&#8221;  must be obtained before its submission to the Graduate College for the oral defense.

Accordingly, it is presumed that the results should be published in scholarly journals, books, or other appropriate forms, either before or following completion of the doctoral degree. The research on which the dissertation is based should have been conducted during the time of the student&#8217;s doctoral studies at ASU, under guidance of ASU faculty, and in accord with Graduate College policies and procedures.</p><p>The pedagogical function of the dissertation is twofold. On the one hand, students learn to conduct a major, independent research project and to present the results, all under the guidance of an experienced doctoral mentor. On the other hand, the dissertation is a demonstration of the student&#8217;s ability to conduct a major research project at the highest level of professional competence. The research experience culminates in a final oral exam, commonly known as the &#8220;dissertation defense.&#8221; At ASU, defenses are public; students and faculty from the candidate&#8217;s unit especially are encouraged to attend. In the successful dissertation defense, doctoral study culminates in a public affirmation of the student&#8217;s scholarly competence and of his or her new status in the community of scholars.</p><p>The doctoral student must submit two final copies of the dissertation or research paper (research papers are for certain D.M.A. concentrations only) to the ASU Bookstore for binding.

The recommendation for the program committee is reviewed simultaneously with the program of study.</p><p><a name="comprehensive-examination-committee"></a></p><p><b>Comprehensive Examination Committee.</b> Ph.D. comprehensive examinations are administered by a committee consisting of three to five members, depending on the requirements of the academic unit.</p><p><a name="dissertation-committee"></a></p><p><b>Dissertation Committee.</b> Upon the recommendation of the head of the academic unit, the dean of the Graduate College appoints the student&#8217;s dissertation committee, consisting of a chair and at least two other members. This committee must approve the subject and title of the dissertation. The members of the dissertation committee have the necessary knowledge and skills to advise the student during the formulation of the research topic and during the completion of the research and the dissertation. The chair of the program committee may serve as the chair of the dissertation committee. In some cases, the same members serve on both committees. However, the two different committees may have memberships with overlapping functions.</p><p>If the head of the academic unit recommends changes in membership for either committee after the committee has been appointed, the student must submit a change of committee form to the Graduate College and receive the approval of the dean of the Graduate College.</p><p><a name="program-of-study"></a></p><p><b>Program of Study.</b> The program of study should be submitted as early as possible and must have the approval of the student&#8217;s supervisory committee, head of the academic unit, and the dean of the Graduate College. The program of study is reviewed simultaneously with the recommendation for the program committee. In general, Ph.D. degree students should expect to devote to the program of study the equivalent of at least three academic years (84 semester hours) beyond the bachelor&#8217;s degree. A minimum of 84 semester hours is required; 24 of these hours must be a combination of 792 Research and 799 Dissertation. Of the 84 semester hours, at least 30 hours (which may include research credit) of the approved Ph.D. program and 24 research and dissertation hours must be completed  <i>after admission</i>  to a Ph.D. program at ASU. A maximum of 24 dissertation hours is permitted on the program of study. In addition, on the Ph.D. program of study, a student may use up to six hours (maximum) of thesis credit from the completed master&#8217;s degree. The master&#8217;s thesis must have been defended and the hours must have been used as part of a completed master&#8217;s program.</p><p><a name="continuous-enrollment"></a></p><p><b>Continuous Enrollment.</b> Once admitted to a Ph.D. degree program, the student is expected to be enrolled continuously, excluding summer sessions, until all requirements for the degree have been fulfilled. Continuous enrollment promotes steady progress toward the completion of the degree and an ongoing relationship between the student and faculty offering the program. If additional credit is not required toward the Ph.D. degree, the student may enroll for 595, 695, or 795 Continuing Registration. Continuing Registration does not carry credit; no grade is given. If a program of study must be interrupted for one or more semesters, the student may apply for leave status, not to exceed one calendar year. A student on leave is not required to pay fees, but is not permitted to place any demands on university faculty or use any university facilities. A student who interrupts a program without obtaining leave status may be removed automatically by the Graduate College, under the assumption that the student has decided to discontinue the program. A student removed by the Graduate College for this reason may reapply for admission; the application is considered along with all other new applications to the degree program.</p><p>An application for leave status, endorsed by the members of the student&#8217;s supervisory committee and the head of the academic unit, must be approved by the dean of the Graduate College. This request must be filed and approved no later than the last day of registration in the semester of anticipated absence.</p><p><a name="residency"></a></p><p><b>Residency.</b> In general, Ph.D. degree students should expect to devote to their program of study the equivalent of at least three academic years (84 semester hours) beyond the bachelor&#8217;s degree. At least two consecutive semesters subsequent to admission to the Ph.D. program must be spent in full-time residence at ASU. At least 30 hours of the approved Ph.D. program in which they are enrolled, in addition to the 24 semester hours of research and dissertation credit, must be completed after admission to the Ph.D. program at ASU. These courses must appear on an approved program of study.</p><p>It is expected that, during the period spent in residence, full time (nine semester hours minimum or six semester hours for research assistants or teaching assistants) is devoted to graduate studies. This period is designed to provide an opportunity for students to avail themselves of university resources and to interact fully with faculty and fellow graduate students. This time represents total involvement in the academic major of the program in which they are enrolled.</p><p><a name="foreign-language-requirements"></a></p><p><b>Foreign Language Requirements.</b> Language requirements are determined by the academic unit concerned. For information concerning certification of proficiency, see &#8220;<a href="#gc-foreign-language-requirements">Foreign Language Requirements</a>.&#8221;</p><p><a name="comprehensive-examinations"></a></p><p><b>Comprehensive Examinations.</b> When students have essentially completed the course work in an approved program of study, they should request permission to take the comprehensive examinations. Some academic units may require that the foreign language requirements be fulfilled before taking the comprehensive examinations. These written and oral examinations are designed to test the student&#8217;s mastery of the field of specialization. Ph.D. comprehensive examinations are administered by a committee consisting of three to five members, depending on the requirements of the academic unit. Failure in the comprehensive examinations is considered final unless the supervisory committee and the head of the academic unit recommend, and the dean of the Graduate College approves, a reexamination. A reexamination may be administered no sooner than three months and no later than one year from the date of the original examination. Only one reexamination is permitted.</p><p><a name="candidacy"></a></p><p><b>Candidacy.</b> Ph.D. students will achieve candidacy status in a letter from the Graduate College dean upon:</p><ol><li>passing the foreign language examination, if applicable;<br />&nbsp;</li><li>passing the comprehensive examinations; and<br />&nbsp;</li><li>successfully defending the dissertation prospectus.<br />&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Students must enroll for a minimum of 12 semester hours of 792 Research and 799 Dissertation credit (combined) in subsequent semesters, following the semester in which they are advanced to candidacy. </p><p> <i>Note: </i> The 12 semester hours come  <i>after</i>  advancing to candidacy.</p><p><a name="research-and-dissertation-requirements"></a></p><p><b>Research and Dissertation Requirements.</b> Each candidate must register for a combined total of 24 semester hours of credit for 792 Research and 799 Dissertation. No more than 24 hours of 799 Dissertation may be included on the 84-hour program of study. Courses or semester hours taken beyond the listed requirements should not be included on the program of study. The final copy of the dissertation must be reviewed by the supervisory committee and the Graduate College at least three weeks before the degree conferral date. Copies of the  <i>Format Manual </i> are available in the Graduate College and on the Web at  <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/formatmanual">www.asu.edu/graduate/formatmanual</a>.</p><p><a name="final-examinations"></a></p><p><b>Final Examinations.</b> The final oral examination in defense of the dissertation is mandatory and must be held on the main campus. The oral defense is scheduled by the supervisory committee with the approval of the dean of the Graduate College.</p><p><a name="graduation"></a></p><p><b>Graduation.</b> The student is eligible for graduation when the Graduate College scholarship requirements have been met, the final oral examination has been passed, and the dissertation has been approved by the supervisory committee and accepted by the head of the academic unit and the dean of the Graduate College.</p><p><a name="maximum-time-limit"></a></p><p><b>Maximum Time Limit.</b> The candidate must take the final oral examination in defense of the dissertation within five years after passing the comprehensive examinations. Any exception must be approved by the supervisory committee and the dean of the Graduate College and ordinarily involves repetition of the comprehensive examinations.</p><p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="index.html"><i>2002&#8211;2003 Graduate Catalog</i> Table of Contents</a></div><p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate">Graduate College home page</a></div><p><img src="maroonhr.gif" width="100%" height="2" alt="maroon horizontal rule" /></p><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><font face="helvetica, arial, ms sans serif, sans-serif" size="-1">Page Last Updated:June 10, 2003 | Visits to this page:  <img src="/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?pad=0|dd=E|ft=0|tr=T|trgb=ffffff|df=ickim-gc-2002-2003graduate-studies-html.dat" alt="page counter" /> | <a href="mailto:aad@asu.edu">Web Site Feedback</a> | <a href="http://www.asu.edu/copyright/">Copyright</a> &copy; Arizona Board of Regents</font></td></tr></table><table><tr><td align="center"><a href="http://validator.w3.org/check/referer"><img        src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10"        alt="Valid XHTML 1.0!" height="31" width="88" border="0"/></a> </td></tr></table></body></html>
