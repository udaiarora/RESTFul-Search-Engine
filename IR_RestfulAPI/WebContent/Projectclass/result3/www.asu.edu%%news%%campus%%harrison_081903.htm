      <h2>Harrison reorganizes unit, names Cole to deputy executive vice president
        post</h2>
      <p>        Mernoy Harrison, executive vice president for Administration and Finance,
          is reorganizing his area to more effectively implement President Michael
          Crow's design imperatives for a New American University. Harrison is
          reallocating resources and making personnel changes to better meet
      the university's needs during a time of tremendous growth.</p>
      <p>Among the
            major changes:</p>
      <p>. V. Scott Cole, assistant vice president for
          Physical Planning and director of Facilities Management, has been named
          to the new position of deputy
        executive vice president for University Services.</p>
      <p>. Ron McCoy, professor
          and director of the School of Architecture, has taken on the additional
          role of University Architect.</p>
      <p>The reorganization
          was necessitated by ASU's current growth, Harrison said.</p>
      <p>"We're about to embark on a tremendous amount of effort in capital
          expenditure and construction across all three campuses, around the
        ASU Downtown Center
          and possibly at other sites in the Valley. With so many initiatives
        underway, as well as the responsibility for ASU's financial planning,
        I want to
          make sure my area is in the best possible shape to support the president. </p>
      <p>"Scott will be in charge of the day-to-day planning and capital activities,
          and this new position empowers him to get things done expeditiously.
          He will be on point to make all of the construction and capital expenditures
          happen."</p>
      <p>Cole will work closely with the other senior officers of the
          university "to ensure that the most ambitious building program in recent
          ASU history
          is carried out to maximum effect."</p>
      <p>Cole, who earned his bachelor's degree
          in business from ASU, said he is honored to serve in his new position.</p>
      <p>"It's a great opportunity. We
          have an awesome challenge ahead of us in developing the four campuses
          to meet our growth needs and to follow the
          direction that President Crow wants us to move in. As an ASU alumnus,
        I find it challenging, exciting and exhilarating."</p>
      <p>The University Architect
          position was created, Harrison said, because "it's imperative we have
          someone focused on architectural and planning
        issues across the university." </p>
      <p>Among projects on the drawing board or
          under construction that the newly reorganized department is responsible
          for are the development of a new
          campus master plan; redevelopment of Tempe Center; research infrastructure;
          residential life expansion; new ASU Foundation headquarters; parking
          facilities; light rail; enhanced telecommunications infrastructure;
        and the continuing development of ASU East, West and Downtown.</p>
      <p>"We're moving
          more toward being one university with locations throughout the Valley,
          and operating in a single-university mode," said Harrison.
          "The intent is to create a visually coherent identity for each location,
        and Ron is an excellent architecture professional to lead this effort."</p>
