      <h2>Support strong for ASU in tough budget year</h2>
      <p> It's going to be a challenging year for Arizona's 46th Legislature. 
        Sworn into office on Monday, Jan. 13, the representatives, including 38 
        who are new to office, must tackle a $300 million budget deficit between 
        now and June 30, and then face an $800 million to $1.5 billion deficit 
        beginning July 1.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Arizona's new governor, Janet Napolitano, said in her recent 
        State of the State address, "It is time to stop viewing our universities 
        and community colleges as easy marks to balance the budget. Instead, we 
        must recognize them as epicenters of economic development."</p>
      <p>ASU's hope is that the Legislature heeds the Governor's message. <br>
        Not leaving anything to chance, ASU President Michael Crow has spent a 
        considerable amount of time meeting members of the Legislature one-on-one 
        and in groups to share his vision for the university, and the state of 
        Arizona.<br>
        "I'm very impressed with the level of understanding our elected officials 
        have about the value of higher education," said Crow. "They have responded 
        with enthusiasm to our vision, but temper that enthusiasm with the reality 
        of the state's fiscal situation."</p>
      <p>Doing its fair share to help the state through the fiscal crisis, ASU 
        cut $16 million in state funding from its budget last summer, and another 
        $18 million later in the year, for a total of $34 million in cuts in one 
        year. </p>
      <p>In October, Crow presented the Arizona Board of Regents with an investment-oriented 
        FY04 budget request to reflect the state economic climate.<br>
        The budget is focused on the university's highest priorities - protecting 
        the base budget, enrollment growth funding and lease purchase financing 
        for research infrastructure that will draw new revenue streams. Crow's 
        goal is to decrease the university's dependence on state funding.</p>
      <p>The budget request includes $21.4 million for university-wide enrollment 
        growth; $2.6 million for unfunded employee health/dental premium adjustments; 
        $3.7 million for operations and maintenance support for new facilities; 
        and $14 million for lease purchase payments, which will permit the university 
        to undertake $185 million in research facility construction.</p>
      <p>ASU's budget request has been met with support by numerous key constituencies. 
        The Phoenix and Tempe City Councils have voted resolutions of support. 
        The Tempe Chamber of Commerce has expressed willingness to help carry 
        ASU's message, and business, industry and labor groups also have indicated 
        a willingness to help.<br>
        The value of such support is immeasurable. Virgil Renzulli, vice president 
        for Public Affairs; Steve Miller, deputy vice president of Public Affairs; 
        and Blake Anderson, director of State Relations, who meet regularly with 
        members of the legislature, say it's imperative that supporters carry 
        the ASU message to elected officials.</p>
      <p>To further bolster ASU's lobbying efforts, the university was advised 
        by officials from across the political spectrum to retain the services 
        of former United States Congressman and State Legislator Matt Salmon as 
        a lobbyist. Salmon, who was the Republican candidate for governor in the 
        close race that resulted in Napolitano's election, is an ASU alumnus and 
        a strong cheerleader for the university and higher education.</p>
      <p>With Salmon on board, and with the ongoing lobbying efforts, ASU hopes 
        to avoid further budget cuts that will cause irreparable harm to the university. 
        Additional cuts, which could impact academic programs, would erode the 
        quality that has been attained through much hard work and dedication from 
        employees and the community.</p>
      <p>Crow is scheduling meetings with ASU faculty and staff to discuss the 
        budget outlook and seek input for how the university might respond if 
        additional cuts are included in the Legislature's budget proposal.</p>
