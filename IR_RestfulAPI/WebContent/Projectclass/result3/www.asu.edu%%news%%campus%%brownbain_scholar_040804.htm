      <h2>Brown &amp; Bain establishes $300,000 ASU law scholarship </h2>
      <p>Brown &amp; Bain, P.A., one of Phoenix's leading law firms, is establishing the C. Randall Bain Scholarship at the ASU College of Law. </p>
      <p>The gift honors Randy Bain on the occasion of his 70th birthday. The firm has set a $300,000 goal for the scholarship and its current partners have contributed over half of the amount and pledged to raise the balance. The scholarship will be awarded on the basis of academic accomplishment and need. </p>
      <p>Joseph Mais, managing director of Brown &amp; Bain, says the firm's gift is focused on academic scholarship because "Randy has always excelled as a scholar, a teacher and a mentor. I can think of no better way to recognize his contributions to the firm and to the legal community than this scholarship fund at the College of Law." </p>
      <p>Paul Eckstein, chairman of Brown &amp; Bain, adds, "In establishing this scholarship fund, Randy's partners are not only able to pay tribute to a great lawyer, but also to enable others to get started in this noble profession." </p>
      <p>College of Law Dean Patricia White praises the firm for its generosity and leadership. </p>
      <p>"Brown &amp; Bain is setting the standard for all members of our profession by providing financial incentives for academic and intellectual excellence for the next generation of lawyers," she says. "We are honored to have Randy Bain's name permanently associated with the ASU College of Law." </p>
      <p>Bain earned his undergraduate degree from Yale University and his law degree from Yale Law School. He began his professional association with Jack Brown in 1960. Now in his 44th year of practice, Bain has concentrated his career on intellectual property litigation at both the trial and appellate levels with emphasis on patent and trade secret litigation principally for companies in the semiconductor and computer software industries. In 1998, he argued a patent law case of first impression before the Supreme Court of the United States. </p>
      <p>Bain has also been active in many law-related and community organizations. He served as an adjunct professor at the College of Law, is a member of the Arizona, Maricopa and American Bar Associations, the American Bar Foundation, and has been a member of the American Law Institute since 1991. </p>
      <p>"I have been so lucky in being able to work with the quality of people who have comprised Brown &amp; Bain over the years," says Bain. "The idea for this scholarship, and the quick generosity of the firm and its members in funding the scholarship, typify that quality. As a former scholarship student, I'm very pleased to have my name associated with this means of helping students at a law school that I very much respect and admire." </p>
