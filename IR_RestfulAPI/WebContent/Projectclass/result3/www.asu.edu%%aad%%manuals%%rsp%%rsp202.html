<img src="rsphr.gif"  alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2">

<p>
All faculty, principal investigators, and other personnel from within and external to ASU involved with the use and care of live vertebrate animals in research, teaching, and biological testing

<p>
<img src="rsphr.gif"  alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2">
<center><font size=+2><b>Policy</b></font></center>
<img src="rsphr.gif"  alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2">

<p>
ASU, its administration, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), faculty, research investigators, and <a href="rsp004.html#principalinvestigator">principal investigators (PIs)</a> are responsible to the public and to governmental agencies for animal care and use in all research, teaching, and testing activities.  All projects for animal care and use on campus must meet federal laws as stated in the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) policy on care and use of animals, Animal Welfare Act (as amended), and including standards as required by the <i>Guide</i> and the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC), as well as state and local laws and university policies.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Responsibilities</b></font>

<p>
To assure compliance with these laws and policies, all research or teaching activities involving the use of live vertebrate animals, whether funded or not, must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to the use of the animals.  The IACUC is responsible for protecting the welfare of all animals used and the consideration of alternatives to the species and to animal use (not applicable for procurement of wild species).  All animals must be procured through the ASU Animal Care Program.  No animal may be procured or accepted unless approved by the IACUC.  In addition, the IACUC requires that all personnel involved with live vertebrate animals must be educated and certified before teaching, research, or testing may commence.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Faculty and IACUC Staff Responsibilities</b></font>

<p>
Faculty and PIs who use animals in research, teaching, or testing are responsible for implementing proper research procedures and maintaining all federal, state, and ASU compliance guidelines after the IACUC approves the project.  Faculty and PIs must be familiar with PHS policy, AWA, the <i>Guide,</i> and the duties and responsibilities of the IACUC, and must be certified by the ASU IACUC.  Faculty and PIs are responsible for evaluating and justifying the necessity of animal use, investigating alternatives to animal use, avoiding unnecessary duplicative animal use, assuring proper use and care, and keeping adequate records on animal use and care.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Fees for Animal Sales, Services, and Per Diem</b></font>

<p>
All projects involving laboratory animals are subject to fees for animal sales, services, and per diem.  A schedule of laboratory animal charges is available from the Office for Research and Sponsored Projects Administration or the Department of Animal Care Technology.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Protocols</b></font>

<p>
All vertebrate animals used in research, teaching, or biological testing, and all animals housed at ASU facilities must be covered by an IACUC-approved protocol.  Protocols are approved for no longer than three years and require annual reporting.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Protocol Renewals or Modifications</b></font>

<p>
Projects renewing beyond the three years approval period require a new protocol. Any changes to an approved study require the submission of a  completed Request for Modification, which must be approved by the IACUC prior to initiation of any new procedures.
