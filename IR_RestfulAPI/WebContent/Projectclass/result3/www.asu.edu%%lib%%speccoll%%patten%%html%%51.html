<P>This is an early book on agriculture with information on tilling the
land, tending gardens and orchards, feeding and breeding "cattell," and
information about "poultrie, fowle, fish and bees."&nbsp; The author provides
an alphabetical table listing all of the subjects covered as well as a
listing of all the sources he has used.&nbsp; Each of the four books is
written in the form of a conversation between Cono, Rigo, Metella, and
Hermes.&nbsp; The second book about Gardens, Orchards, and Woods details
a conversation between Thrasybulus, Marius, and Julia.&nbsp; Hipoconus,
Euphorbus, Hedio, and Eumaeus art the participants in the third book's
conversation on Feeding, Breeding, and Curing of Cattell.&nbsp; Finally,
Pullarius, Mellisseus, Chenoboscus, and Piscinarius discuss Poultrie, Fowle,
Fish, and Bees in the fourth book.&nbsp; This authorial technique is quite
effective.&nbsp; Marginal notes are also available to enable the reader
to access the information more easily.&nbsp; The work concludes with a
listing of the Old English Rules for Purchasing Land.
