      <h2>Lifetime Achievement Award honors Craft's career </h2>
      <p align="left">Director of ASU Distance Learning and Technology Elizabeth Craft was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the National ITFS (Instructional Television Fixed Service) Association. The award recognizes outstanding service. </p>
      <p align="left">Craft was presented the award at a small gathering in her home where several colleagues from ASU attended, along with Betty's husband John and daughter Jennifer. </p>
      <p align="left">"This is the first and only Lifetime Achievement Award from the association, and it is most well deserved by Betty. She has been a stalwart...She's been committed to education and a strong supporter of the association," says Patrick Gossman, chair of the association and director of Academic Technologies and Customer Services, Computing and Information Technology at Wayne State University. </p>
      <p align="left">ITFS is a band of 20 television channels available to be licensed by the FCC to local credit-granting educational institutions. ASU holds licenses for 48 MHz in the ITFS band and delivers approximately 20 courses each semester through ITFS and ASUtv (Cox Digital Channel 116). </p>
      <p align="left">"This national honor recognizes Betty's dedication, which has resulted in phenomenal growth in distance learning enrollments and programs. During Betty's tenure as director of Distance Learning and Technology, televised and Web-delivered enrollments have grown to more than 16,000 per year. She has increased access to quality education by building a portfolio of technology-delivered courses and degree programs that offer quality, convenience and innovation," says Bette DeGraw, dean of the College of Extended Education. </p>
      <p align="left">After more than 30 years of service, Craft will retire in June. She has been part of the ASU fabric since the 1970s when she joined the faculty in the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication. </p>
      <p align="left">She has worked in distance learning since 1982 and became director of Distance Learning and Technology in 1990. She is recognized as an industry expert and an accomplished author who has published a variety of articles in national and international publications. </p>
      <p align="left">Craft served ASU with distinction as a senator and university affairs chairwoman for seven years, on the Academic Senate University Continuing Appointment and Promotion Review Committee for 13 years, and as chairwoman of the Senate Ad Hoc Committee on Intellectual Property Rights in Online Works. She is secretary of the National ITFS Association and serves on the National University Telecommunications Network board of directors. </p>
      <p align="left">Recently, she chaired committees for the University Continuing Education Association and participated in the Association for Educational Communication and Technology. In addition to the ITFS award, Craft's presentations and technology-delivered programs have been recognized by the City of Phoenix, Rio Salado Community College, the Town of Gilbert and the University Continuing Education Association. </p>
