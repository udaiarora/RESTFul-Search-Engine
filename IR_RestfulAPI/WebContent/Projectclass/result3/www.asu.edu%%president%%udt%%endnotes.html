The core of the historic        Tempe campus was a twenty-acre cow pasture in the late nineteenth century,        donated by leading citizens who sought an institution to train public        school teachers, and provide instruction to their sons and daughters        in agriculture and the mechanical arts.&nbsp; The name of the institution        changed three times during its first fifteen years, becoming the Normal        School of Arizona in 1901.&nbsp; Subsequent changes were associated with        expansions of the curriculum and degrees offered.&nbsp; In rapid succession        Tempe State Teachers College became Arizona State Teachers College, and,        in 1945, Arizona State College.&nbsp; By 1958 the college performed all        the functions of a university, and received authorization by an act of        the governor to become Arizona State University.&nbsp; Basic and applied        research preceded attainment of university status in 1958, but the development        of new academic programs and library holdings, and the conferral of doctoral        degrees in the 1960s led the Carnegie Foundation to grant ASU Research        I status in 1994. </li>        <li><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8"></a> Some of the institutions          formative in the development of the American research university are          private, such as Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, Princeton, and Yale; others,          state and land grant universities, such as the University of Michigan,          the University of Wisconsin, the University of Illinois, and the University          of California; still others, new universities made possible by private          bequests, such as Stanford, Caltech, MIT, and the University of Chicago.&nbsp; These          institutions have produced the vast majority of Ph.D.&rsquo;s in the          nation for the past one hundred years.</li>        <li><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9"></a>Lombardi Program on Measuring          University Performance, <em>The Top American Research Universities </em>(University          of Florida, 2001), 46-47 &nbsp;[http://thecenter.ufl.edu/publications.html]</li>        <li><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10"></a>&ldquo;A New American University:&nbsp;
