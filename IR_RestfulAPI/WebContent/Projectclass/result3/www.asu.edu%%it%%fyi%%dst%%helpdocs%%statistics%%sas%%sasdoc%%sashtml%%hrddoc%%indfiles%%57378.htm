SAS/IML User's Guide, Version 8
</H1><P>
Experienced programmers and data analysts will find this comprehensive,    easy-to-read guide an invaluable, task-oriented resource for learning
IML, the Interactive Matrix Programming Language. If you have basic        familiarity with SAS System concepts, you will be able to refer to
examples as guides for developing programs that implement a number of      different techniques in statistics, numerical analysis, and linear
algebra.  Results may be displayed as text or graphs. You save time with   the Language Reference section, which summarizes the many functions,
subroutines, and language keywords.
