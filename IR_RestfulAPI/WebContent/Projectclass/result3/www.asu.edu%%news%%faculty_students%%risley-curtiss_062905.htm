          <h2>Risley-Curtiss explores significance of human, animal bond </h2>
          <p><img src="../images/video-icon_whitebgd.jpg" width="18" height="13"> Video: <a href="mms://msmedia.asu.edu/Media_Relations_&_Public_Infor/keithj/Curtiss.wmv">Windows Media Player</a> | <a href="../video/hints/Curtiss.mov">Quicktime</a></p>
          <p> Picture this scenario: A woman has an abusive husband &ndash; and a dog she loves very much. </p>
          <p> Given her situation, there are no good choices. Should she stay with the husband for the sake of the dog, or leave, knowing the dog could suffer? </p>
          <p> Christina Risley-Curtiss, an associate professor of social work at ASU, would like to see these types of situations eliminated forever. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;My mission is to get the animal-human bond into social work research, education and practice,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not there now, for the most part. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Animals are part of the ecology of people&rsquo;s lives. As social workers, we operate from an ecological perspective.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Social work education so far has focused mostly on animal-assisted therapy, Risley-Curtiss says, but she takes a broader view of the animal-human bond. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;I see our relationship on a continuum,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Animals are sentient creatures. They help us build resiliency. I don&rsquo;t preach animal rights. I do hope that people come to respect what animals give us.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Risley-Curtiss, who recently won the Humane Society of the United States Annual New Course Award for the class she developed at ASU, &ldquo;Animal-Human Connections,&rdquo; says part of her research focuses on helping clients keep their animals. </p>
          <p> For example, older foster children who are &ldquo;aging out of the system&rdquo; often get pets when they move out on their own. But sometimes they need help learning the basics of animal care or finding the resources to take care of them, Risley-Curtiss says. </p>
          <p> She would like to see kennels built at domestic violence shelters so abused women and their children could bring their dogs and cats with them. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Some of the dogs have been rocks for the children,&rdquo; she says. </p>
          <p> Also, elderly and disabled people might need help buying food, cleaning litter boxes or taking dogs for walks. </p>
          <p> In addition to providing company, animals act as a social catalyst for physically challenged people, Risley-Curtiss says. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;People will stop and talk to someone in a wheelchair with a service dog, for example,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll ask if they can pet the dog.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Risley-Curtiss also is breaking ground with new research on how people of color relate to their animals. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Given that the School of Social Work here is focused on populations of the Southwest, I need to teach students about the cultural differences in human-animal bonding,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But almost no research had been done. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;As social workers, we want to know what roles the animals have in the family. I don&rsquo;t want animals to be seen as property.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> For Risley-Curtiss, who grew up on a farm, and whose father was a veterinarian, her pets are her friends. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;They sleep in my bed, and my house is designed around them,&rdquo; she says. </p>
          <p> Her &ldquo;family&rdquo; includes eight cats, one horse, one goat, and one greyhound, plus the 9 stray and feral cats she feeds outside. </p>
          <p> Risley-Curtiss believes that the profession of social work is ready for the study of the human-animal bond, and she is ready to lead the way. </p>
          <p> She has had an article tentatively accepted by a social work journal, and has received a grant from The William and Charlotte Parks Foundation for Animal Welfare to survey 5,012 randomly selected social workers about their knowledge of the human-animal bond and whether they are including animals in their assessments of clients. </p>
          <p> In January, she presented a paper at the Society for Social Work and Research&rsquo;s Annual Conference in Miami , titled &ldquo;Exploring the Animal-Human Bond: The Relative Importance of Select Demographic Factors.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> &ldquo;It was the first time anyone has ever presented on the human-animal bond,&rdquo; she says. </p>
