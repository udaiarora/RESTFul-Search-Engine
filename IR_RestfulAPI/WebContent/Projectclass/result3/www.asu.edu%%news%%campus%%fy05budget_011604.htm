      <h2>Governor proposes increase in ASU's FY05 Budget</h2>
      <p>Governor
        Janet Napolitano's FY05 state budget proposal includes &nbsp; $13.5 million
        in increased core funding for ASU and another $10 million in additional
        salary funding, for a net increase of approximately $23.5 million for
        the university. </p>
      <p>We are very thankful that the governor's proposed FY05 budget includes
        increased funding for ASU as, indeed, we are very appreciative of the
        investment the State of Arizona makes in our university each and every
        year. With this increase and careful management, ASU will be able
        to bridge the 2005 fiscal year, maintaining its academic quality and
        accommodating its anticipated enrollment growth for next year. We
        are especially excited about the governor's commitment to full core funding
        for ASU in FY06 and beyond. ASU has not received full core funding
        in 20 years, and it is only with full core funding that ASU will be able
        to expand to meet future student demand for admission, and to evolve
        into the world-class university that metropolitan Phoenix and the state
        of Arizona need. </p>
      <p>A healthy university system is vital to the future of the State of Arizona.
        Universities train our business and civic leaders, our teachers and nurses. University
        research leads to new treatments for disease and new technologies to
        spur economic development. </p>
      <p>The Arizona economy
        has suffered in recent years because it is less diverse and far less
        high-tech than the economies of neighboring states. The state's
        economy also suffered because Arizona produces, proportionately, fewer
        college graduates than other western regions. An educated workforce
        is critical to building a new more diverse economy and will help attract
        new industries. And college graduates contribute more to consumer
        spending and the tax base because on average they will earn almost $1
        million more than high school graduates during the course of their work
        lives. </p>
      <p>Arizona has a burgeoning college age population. The Governor's
        Task Force on Higher Education estimates that by the year 2020, more
        than 200,000 students will be in Arizona community colleges and almost
        150,000 in the state's three public universities. </p>
      <p>Arizona State University
        has experienced an enormous increase in enrollment during the last few
        deacdes. In 1975 ASU enrolled 35,000 students. Today it has 57,500 students
        or more than the University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University
        combined. This student enrollment increase was accomplished with no decrease
        in the academic quality of the students entering the university. In
        fact, in recent years ASU has enrolled its best freshman classes. For
        example, the number of National Merit Scholars rocketed from 24 in 1992
        to 105 in 2002 and to 173 in 2003 to rank ASU nationally among the top
        colleges and universities. </p>
      <p>Although the university has been very entrepreneurial in its efforts
        to develop other revenue sources, ASU, as a public institution, still
        requires its major investor, the State of Arizona, to fund its core operating
        expenses. Therefore, the proposed $23.5 million in increased funding
        for FY05 is vitally important as is the governor's commitment to full
        core funding in FY06 and beyond so that the university can continue to
        provide a quality education to all qualified state students. </p>
      <p>It is critical at this moment in history with the state population growing
        and minority groups gaining access to college that the state's public
        university system continues to provide access and quality. </p>
