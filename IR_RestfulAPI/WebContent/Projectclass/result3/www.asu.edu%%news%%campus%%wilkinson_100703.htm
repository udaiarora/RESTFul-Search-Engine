      <h2>College gains resident diplomat to guide students</h2>
      <p>Though students hope
          a university education will lead them to interesting and fulfilling
        jobs, few imagine it might open the door to something
        as exotic and exciting as a career in international affairs.</p>
      <p>This year,
          thanks to a program sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, ASU
        students will have access to Ambassador Sharon P. Wilkinson who will
          share her experiences as a career diplomat and give guidance to anyone
        interested in a life in the foreign service.</p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/Wilkinson4.jpg" alt="Ambassador Sharon P. Wilkinson" width="180" height="276" align="right">Wilkinson, who was U.S. Ambassador
          to Burkina Faso and Mozambique during the Clinton and Bush administrations,
          will be in official residence at
          ASU's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences during the 2003 - 04 academic
          year. She will be counseling and recruiting students for a wide variety
          of career opportunities in the State Department as well as guest lecturing
          in a variety of departments. She will also be available to speak to
        interested groups in the community about foreign service life.</p>
      <p>"I am delighted to
          be here as the first diplomat in residence at ASU. The foreign service
          is an exciting, challenging, dynamic career option
          whose members come from all over the United States and from a surprising
          array of backgrounds, disciplines and special skill areas. ASU promises
          to be a rich source of candidates, and I am very much looking forward
          to meeting the students and professors who will work with me to make
        that happen." </p>
      <p>"We had to work really hard to get her assigned here,"
          said Academic Associate Barbara Colby, who is coordinating the residency.
          "The Department
          of State only assigns 16 Diplomats in Residence nationally, and she's
          one of the top placements. We got her here because we really think
        the Department of State has much to offer Liberal Arts and Sciences students,
        and we have quality candidates to offer them."</p>
      <p>Wilkinson was educated
          at Brown University and the University of Chicago. She speaks Portuguese,
          Spanish and French and is a Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service,
        Class of Minister Counselor and has held numerous foreign posts. </p>
      <p>She
          began her career as vice consul in Sao Paulo, Brazil and later was
        assigned as consul in Accra, Ghana. Returning to Washington, she served
          as program officer for Africa in the Bureau of Cultural Affairs, staff
          assistant to the assistant secretary for Inter-American Affairs, desk
          officer for Portugal, and management analyst for the Office of Management
        Operations. </p>
      <p>She also spent one year as director of the Face-To-Face Program
          at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Next, she was assigned
          as
          deputy principal officer in Tijuana, Mexico. She returned to Washington
          to direct the Office of Diplomatic and Public Liaison in the Bureau
        of Consular Affairs, followed by an assignment as consul general in Curacao.
          She participated as a member of the 35th Senior Seminar Class before
          departing for Lisbon, where she served as charge d'affairs before completing
          her tour as deputy chief of mission. In 1995, President Bill Clinton
          nominated her as the U.S. ambassador to Burkina Faso. In 2000, he nominated
        her as ambassador to the Republic of Mozambique. </p>
      <p>"Ambassador Wilkinson's
          extensive experiences in foreign affairs and her history of serving
        all over the globe will be a major asset for our
          students to take advantage of," says Dan Bivona, associate dean of
        the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The State Department is looking
          for bright and talented individuals interested in representing our
        country
          abroad and in other kinds of service, and her presence here will open
          a real door to those careers."<br>
        Wilkinson can be reached at (480) 965-8089.</p>
      <p>Hathaway, with the College
        of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, can be reached
        at (480) 965-6375 or (hathaway@asu.edu).<br>
