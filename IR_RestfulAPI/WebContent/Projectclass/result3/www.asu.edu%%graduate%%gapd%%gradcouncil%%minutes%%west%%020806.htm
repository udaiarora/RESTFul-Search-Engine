        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        DECISION ITEMS

        <br>
        <br>
        The first item on the agenda for consideration was the Curriculum Action Form from the College of Teacher Education and Leadership regarding the addition of a generalist track in Special Education.  Dr. Malian, Chair of the Department of Special Education, discussed their proposal.  The proposed track is designed to allow students from any discipline to obtain an initial special education teaching certificate and a master?s degree in special education.  Currently the M.Ed. in Special Education emphasizes infants and young children; and, the program would like to extend their curriculum to meet the needs of students who are seeking to teach in the grades K-12.  It is anticipated that students will complete the proposed program in approximately two years or less if they attend full-time.  

        <br>
        <br>
        The proposed new courses submitted with the curriculum change request 1) SPE 532 Systems, Policies, and Program Practices; 2) SPE 533 Issues in Special Education; 3) SPE 534 Assessment and Evaluation; and 4) SPE 535 Curricula, Methods, Technology and Adaptations are similar to the courses in the Infants and Young Children track except they have been adjusted to meet the needs of students in an older age group (grades K ? 12).  In addition to the courses listed SPE 578 Student Teaching in Special Education is included.  The ?578? number is the most efficient way to track students who are in the M.Ed. with certification program; and, keep the statistics separate from the undergraduate students registered for student teaching.  The new proposed courses and curriculum changes meet Arizona state requirements for teacher certification in special education.  

        <br>
        <br>
        The Curriculum Action Proposal for the M.Ed. Special Education and new courses were unanimously passed as a package. 

        <br>
        <br>
        The Proposal for Course action for the following courses:  1) SPE 579 Apprentice Teaching in Special Education, 2) EED 579 Apprentice Teaching in the Elementary School, and 3) SED 579 Apprentice Teaching in Secondary School are specifically for the individuals who hold an Arizona Teaching Intern Certificate in their respective areas.  Many individuals were given emergency teaching certificates and are currently in the school districts teaching.  This program is the result of a partnership among CTEL, the Arizona Department of Education, and local school districts.  This course must be taken four times for a total of 12 credit hours for special education and 9 credit hours for either elementary or secondary education.  The reason that the credit hours is higher for special education teachers is because their certificate ranges from K-12; and, students must have experience teaching in both the lower level grades and the upper level grades.  To be eligible for this special program, students must provide a copy of their teaching contract.   

        <br>
        <br>
        The three new course proposals passed unanimously.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        DISCUSSION ITEMS

        <br>
        <br>
        Dr. Brett announced to the members of the Graduate Council at the West campus that approximately 400 prospective students attended the Masters Open House that was held on Wednesday, February 1.  We almost doubled the number of attendees from last year?s event while spending $20,000.00 less.  Our Public Affairs Office was able to reserve time with the area radio stations at a reduced rate for advertising the event, which was the main reason for the lower expense.  This year we had a wider distribution of postcards.  Kathryn Herbert, Administrative Assistant in the Office of Graduate Studies and Academic Programs, delivered postcards to community colleges, community centers, and regional post offices.  We have planted the seeds of graduate school; unfortunately, we may not see the fruit of our labor for a year or two.  

        <br>
        <br>
        Dr. Brett also asked the members of the Graduate Council what we may do differently next year, if we are able to host the event next year.  One suggestion was to have ?break-out? sessions focusing on specific topics; and, another suggestion was to focus the event on current undergraduates and then one for the returning student.

        <br>
        <br>
        Dr. Brett requested suggestions to keep the recruiting effort moving forward.  Some of the suggestions were:  1) develop a brochure or postcard to send to the attendees; 2) offer information sessions on ?how to apply to graduate school;? 3) put a short narrative and pictures about the past event on our website; and, 4) think about the feasibility of holding the event in both the fall and spring semesters.

        <br>
        <br>
        The discussion was then opened to ways we can encourage and mentor our undergraduate students.  Since most of our undergraduate students are first generation college students, they may not be award of the possibilities of graduate study.  One suggestion was to host an informal event between faculty and students beginning at the freshman level.  Each faculty member would talk with 2 or 3 undergraduate students.  The event should be marketed at a level of prestige that a student would seek an invitation.  There was some concern regarding faculty involvement, especially with all of the current constraints place on their time.  

        <br>
        <br>
        Another idea was too formalize a mentoring partnership between a faculty member and an undergraduate student.  It was suggested that a faculty member may be able to mentor a student for two or three years. This would be a way of grooming a student for graduate study and has the possibility of increasing the graduate program by the number of faculty members each year.  An additional suggestion was to develop a marketing campaign focusing on the parents of our younger students; get the parents involved in their child?s academic development.  Dr. Brett asked the council members to think of ways such programs may be supported.  The Trio program, McNair Program, or a grant, these are ideas that will be discussed in follow-up sessions.

        <br>
        <br>
        Dr. Brett reminded the directors of graduate programs at the West campus that the scholarships, for the 2006-2007 academic year, are to be used for recruiting students to their graduate program.  The scholarships may be awarded anytime between now and April 1, if it is possible, please do not wait until April 1 to make your decisions.  

        <br>
        <br>
        The general assessment of the gPortal program used for admission processing is good; however, transcripts scanned in the WebXtender data base are sometimes difficult to read.  Dr. Brett stated that we have a very good working relationship with the Division of Graduate Studies at the Tempe campus; therefore, we will share our concerns with them.  It was suggested that a Q and A session with Michael Dickson, Assistant Dean Division of Graduate Studies, be held sometime during the end of April or the first of May.  This session will cover what has worked and what has not worked for our graduate programs.

        <br>
        <br>
        Dr. Brett announced that there are approximately six new graduate level degrees in various stages of development at the West campus.  There is a push to have more programs available to our students; therefore, the colleges are encouraged to keep the momentum going.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ROUNDTABLE ITEMS

        <br>
        <br>
        The last semester for admitting students to the MBA program in the School of Global Management and Leadership will be fall 2006.  The college is developing a Master of Accountancy and Leadership program and anticipates moving it forward soon.

        <br>
        <br>
        Some members of the council expressed their concern regarding the end of our MBA program and wondered if it was possible that the same could happen to other programs at the West campus.  Dr. Brett stated that the MBA program was a unique situation and the university decided to focus its resources on one fully accredited (both regionally and professionally) MBA program.  

        <br>
        <br>
        The meeting adjourned at 11:40 a.m.<br>
