      <h2>Potter to serve as new wellness director </h2>
      <p>After an extensive national search, Phillip Potter has been hired as director of Employee Assistance, Wellness and Work Life Programs effective April 12. </p>
      <p>Potter, an ASU alumnus, will assume the leadership of a newly combined department consisting of the Employee Assistance and Wellness offices. </p>
      <p>David Butler, associate vice president for Human Resources, says this collaboration places ASU in the leading edge nationally in terms of work life programs. </p>
      <p>"We are extremely fortunate to have recruited a professional with Dr. Potter's credentials," Butler says. "His demonstrated leadership experience in employee assistance, wellness and organization consulting will be invaluable as we continue to build a world- class work life department at ASU." </p>
      <p>Potter says he hopes to play a supportive role in ASU's metamorphosis into a world-class institution. </p>
      <p>"ASU is developing at an amazing pace, and the community deserves for its EAP, wellness and work life programs to keep pace with that growth," he says. </p>
      <p>Potter says EAP, wellness and work life programs absolutely make ASU a better place to work and study. </p>
      <p>"Having these programs available is simply the right thing to do," he says. "People put a lot into their work, and at some point they will experience problems either at work or in their personal lives. As a community and employer who care, it is our duty to minimize or eliminate that negative impact." </p>
      <p>Potter says he is thrilled to be contributing back to ASU, an institution that has given him so much. </p>
      <p>"Being an ASU alumnus absolutely makes this position more meaningful for me," Potter says. "I attribute a great deal of my personal and professional development to the facilities, services, and people of ASU. In fact, my experiences at ASU prepared me extraordinarily well for this type of position." </p>
      <p>Potter says he took advantage of the psychology department's health psychology specialization to learn ways to promote health and wellness on a large-scale. </p>
      <p>"It's funny, but these were the exact skill sets required for the position," he says. "I find it both ironic and exciting to be able to put my training to work to assist the university community that provided me with that original training." </p>
      <p>Before joining ASU, Potter served as a flight commander with the United States Air Force where he directed EAP, work life, consultation, outreach and strategic human resources functions for 9,500 military and civilian personnel. </p>
      <p>Potter received his B.S. degree in psychology from Ohio State University. He obtained his M.A. degree in psychology and his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from ASU. He is licensed to practice clinical psychology and is a member of the American Psychological Society, Employee Assistance Professionals Association, and the American Society for Training and Development. </p>
