      <h2>ASU East agribusiness program encourages food trade for peace</h2>
      <p>        Trade between Arizona and one of the world's most war-torn regions is
        bearing fruit because of the work of researchers in ASU East's Morrison
        School of Agribusiness and Resource Management. </p>
      <p>Clifford J. Shultz, the
          Marley Foundation Professor of Agribusiness, is leading an ASU team
        trying to increase trade and decrease international
          tensions in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and other Balkan nations. Shultz
          is working with an international collaboration championing mutually
        beneficial trade between Arizona, the Balkans and the Black Sea Region,
        particularly
          trade in grain and processed food.</p>
      <p>"Peace and prosperity through food
          marketing," he said. "It makes sense for us to promote economic development
          and constructive engagement in
          the Balkans rather than military intervention. They don't have to like
          each other in order to co-exist and co-prosper." </p>
      <p>The effort isn't just
          altruistic, either. Shultz points out that the Balkans and Black Sea
          Region represent emerging economies with a potential
          market of more than 100 million consumers.</p>
      <p>"These countries have a generally
          western orientation toward trade and commerce," Shultz said. "We are
          working to enhance understanding of disparate
          cultures and systems at the same time we encourage regional cooperation
          and export development."</p>
      <p>The current focus of the ASU East/Morrison School
          of Agribusiness and Resource Management project is on establishing
        new links and strengthening
          existing ones between educational institutions, trade associations
        and business interests in the Balkans and the United States, particularly
          Arizona.</p>
      <p>Shultz and his team are mapping Balkan region channels for food
          marketing and export development, as well as evaluating the market
        potential for
          food products and trade there. First phase work was done in collaboration
          with Croatia, a principal market hub for the region. </p>
      <p>The researchers
          are currently in the process of expanding their study to include Bosnia-Herzegovina,
          Greece and Slovenia and soon will begin
          work in Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro and Albania. They are spreading
          the results of their research through publications, international business
          and academic exchanges between the Balkans and the United States, university
          curriculum development and cooperative learning programs. </p>
      <p>"Most academics
          and businesspersons simply are not well aware of the region," Shultz
          said. "They do not yet understand the business potential
          and the win-win possibilities in regional understanding, peaceful coexistence
          and future cost savings resulting from economic development and constructive
          engagement rather than military intervention."</p>
      <p>Over the past couple of
          years, teams of ASU East researchers and local agribusiness leaders
        have frequently visited Croatia to strengthen relationships
          and conduct market and industry assessments. </p>
      <p>Currently, Shultz and his
          research team are administering a survey to measure Croatian and other
          European consumers' attitudes and intentions
          to buy American, particularly Arizona-grown, wheat-based products.</p>
      <p>Support
          for the ASU East work comes from the U.S. Department of Education,
        the Croatian Ministry of Science and Technology, the U.S. State Department,
          the Desert Wheat Growers Cooperative, the Arizona Grain Research and
          Promotions Council, the University of Zagreb, the University of Rijeka,
          the University of Sarajevo, the University of Ljubljana, the University
          of Tuzla, the American Farm School - Thessaloniki and the University
          of Split.</p>
