      <h2>Rose builds English law history library for ASU</h2>
      <p>As an English legal
          history scholar, ASU Law Professor Jonathan Rose faced a simple decision
          in using his stipend as the Willard H. Pedrick
          Distinguished Research Scholar. He took the opportunity and began assembling
          an English Legal History Library at the College of Law, filled with
        rare legal volumes. </p>
      <p>In 2002, Rose, along with assistance from Associate Dean
          Victoria Trotta and her staff, acquired six folio volumes called the
          "Vulgate Edition
          of the Yearbooks," published in 1679 - 80 and including cases from
        the late 13th century to the early 16th century. The yearbooks compile
        cases
          from the royal courts, initially and primarily the Court of Common
        Pleas and could be thought of as the law reports of their day. The books
        focus
          on lawyers' arguments and the judge's questions, responses and other
          statements and inform the reader of legal procedure and the art of
        pleading and may have been compiled as a teaching tool for new lawyers.
        Thus,
          the yearbooks preserve the intellectual aspects of litigation rather
          than the specific facts of any one case.</p>
      <p>Rose has sought these books for
          many years but was hampered by a lack of funding and the inability
        to find a complete set. Last fall six folio
          volumes were found at a San Francisco book dealer.</p>
      <p>The second purchase
          for the collection was made a few months ago through another fortuitous
          circumstance. Rose's legal history endeavors had brought
          him a friendship with Victor Tunkel of the Faculty of Laws at Queen
        Mary and Westerfield College in London, England and the Secretary of
        the Selden
          Society, a leading association of English legal scholars. Tunkel is
        also an avid collector of legal history books but was moving to a new
        home
          with less library space and needed to reduce his holdings. Rose acquired
          about 75 volumes from Tunkel. </p>
      <p>The selections include many books that
          could not be found elsewhere and range from a 1637 edition of "Cowell's
          Interpreter," an early law dictionary,
          and an 1807 century edition of "Bacon's Abridgement," a seven volume
          set covering cases from the 17th century through 19th Century, to "Legal
          Records and the Historian," another published in 1975, but no longer
          available from almost any source. </p>
      <p>The latter volume was written by John
          H. Baker, Downing Professor of the Laws of England at St. Catharine's
          College at Cambridge University.
          Baker is considered the "Dean" of English legal scholars and presented
          a paper at the Second ASU College of Law Conference on Current Issues
          in Legal History held in conjunction with Professor Rose's Investiture
          as a Pedrick Scholar, last September.</p>
      <p>"Professor Rose's generosity has
          brought a number of very significant titles to the library," she says.
          "We couldn't have purchased such books
          with our budget limitations. Moreover, some of the titles acquired
        with Rose's stipend are unique to the ASU Libraries' collections, so
        this
          collection has enhanced the university collection as a whole."</p>
      <p>Both Rose
          and Trotta hope to continue building the collection and eventually
        establish an English Legal History Room in the Ross-Blakely Law Library. </p>
