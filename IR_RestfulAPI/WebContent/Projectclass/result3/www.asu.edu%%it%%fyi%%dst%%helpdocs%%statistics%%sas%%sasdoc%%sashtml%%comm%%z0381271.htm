<P>Various errors may occur when you initially
try to establish a connection over a network with the NetBIOS access method.
 Many of these problems are related to the network.  SAS/CONNECT attempts
to present an error message that indicates the cause of the error.  The following
list explains the most common problems in establishing NetBIOS communications.
 



<PRE>ERROR:  Network Request Failed rc=38. 
Requested resource(s) not available.</PRE>
<P>There are not enough system resources available to satisfy either the
VQMLINKS= or the VQMCONVS= request. This error can be caused by either of
the following situations: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>The default value of either VQMLINKS= or VQMCONVS= requests
more resources than are available. The default value for both options is 0,
which implies 16 NetBIOS sessions and 16 commands with most implementations.<P>

<LI>You have specified a value for either VQMLINKS= or VQMCONVS=,
and there are not enough resources to satisfy the request.<P>
</UL>

<P>To correct this error, specify a new value for either VQMLINKS= or VQMCONVS=
on either the local or the remote session, as appropriate.  



<PRE>ERROR:  Network Request Failed rc=22. 
Too many commands outstanding.</PRE>
<P>The number of simultaneous sessions that are requested is greater than
the allocated commands allow, and the request has failed. You are using too
many resources.
<P>To correct this problem, either increase the number of sessions that
are allowed or decrease the number of simultaneous sessions. To increase the
number of sessions that are allowed, increase the value of the VQMCONVS= option
on either the local or remote session, as appropriate. This assumes that sufficient
system resources are available. In general, one session is required for each
concurrent SAS/CONNECT session as well as for each remote libname.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed 
(rc 0x14) - Cannot find name called.</PRE>
<P>The SAS/CONNECT spawner program cannot be found.  Verify the following: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>you have the proper network selected<P>

<LI>you have specified the
correct name for the spawner program<P>

<LI>the spawner program is started.<P>
</UL>
  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed
(rc 0xA7) - Unknown NETBIOS return code.</PRE>
<P>NetBIOS is not set up to run in the Windows environment.  



<PRE>ERROR: File not found loading 
\sas\core\sasexe\sasvnnet.dll;
File contributing to error: ACSNETB 
ERROR: File not found loading \sas\core\sasexe\sasvnmne.dll;
File contributing to error: NETAPI</PRE>
<P>The NetBIOS or the MNetBIOS access method was loaded but the supporting
vendor software was not found. You must specify the correct path location
in the LIBPATH statement for one of
the following: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>ACSNETB.DLL, for IBM NetBIOS 3.0 compatible interfaces<P>

<LI>NETAPI.DLL, for LAN Manager 1.0 NetBIOS Submit compatible
interfaces.<P>
</UL>
  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x05) - Command timed out.</PRE>
<P>During a NetBIOS SIGNON, SAS.EXE could not be executed from the directory
that the spawner program is executing from. To resolve this problem, add the
SAS Release 6.08 or later directory to the OS/2 PATH= statement in the OS/2
CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>Ensure that SAS.EXE is located in either the OS/2 PATH variable or in
the spawner's current directory.

<P>SAS/SHARE users and administrators can communicate with a server on
the same system or on a different system by using the NetBIOS access methods.
<P>If you have IBM Extended Services, specify COMAMID=NETBIOS to
use the IBM NetBIOS 3.0 Interface access method.
<P>If you have Novell NetWare Requestor for OS/2 2.0, specify COMAMID=MNETBIOS
to use the NetBIOS Submit Interface access method.
<P>The NetBIOS access methods that are used by SAS/SHARE sometimes
issue generalized messages to identify problems.  All of these messages are
produced by the IBM NetBIOS 3.0 Interface and the NetBIOS Submit Interface
access methods.  



<PRE>Network request failed (rc 0x30) - name defined by another environment.</PRE>
<P>Another server that has the same name is already running on the network,
or another NetBIOS application is using the name. Choose another name.  



<PRE>Network request failed 
(rc 0x38) - requested resource(s) not available.</PRE>
<P>Insufficient resources are available.  Either use the VQMLINKS and VQMCONVS
variables to cause SAS to ask for less resources, or reconfigure NetBIOS so
that there are more resources available to NetBIOS applications. Reconfiguring
NetBIOS is system and vendor specific. 



<PRE>Network request failed 
(rc 0x14) - cannot find name called.</PRE>
<P>The server that is specified by the SERVER= option cannot be located
on the network.
