This book is the perfect guide for users who have little or no             experience with the SAS System under MVS. This task-oriented
introduction covers basic concepts such as interactive processing versus   batch processing, data set organization, SAS files versus external
files, file management, the windowing environment, and tips for using      JCL. Using the code examples in this book, you will learn how to
customize your SAS session, create files, write to and read from files,    concatenate files, route your SAS log and SAS procedure output, and
print your SAS log and SAS procedure output. Discover how quickly you      can get up and running with the SAS System under MVS.
