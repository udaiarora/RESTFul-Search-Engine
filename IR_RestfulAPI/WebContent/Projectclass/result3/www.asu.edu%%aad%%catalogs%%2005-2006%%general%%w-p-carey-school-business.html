Purpose</b>
<a id="a16683"></a></h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The mission of the 
W. P. Carey School of Business
 reflects a commitment to expand knowledge and educate future business leaders in a world-class learning environment that values thought leadership, real-world applications, technology, global perspective, ethics, and community. These programs address issues of importance to future managers in a world characterized by demands for continuous improvements in quality; growing sophistication of information technology; globalized markets; racial, cultural, and gender diversity in the workforce; and a demand for managers with practical, realistic skills.</p>
<p>
Students have many opportunities to supplement their academic experiences. The school offers an honors program for academically talented students, an international component to provide a variety of international opportunities, an internship program that provides related practical experience, and more than 25 cocurricular organizations to increase student interaction and learning.</p>
<p>
The school is a member of AACSB International&#8212;The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, the official accrediting organization in the field of business. The undergraduate and graduate programs and the School of Accountancy are also accredited by this organization.</p>
<p>
The school is host to a chapter of Beta Gamma Sigma, a national society that recognizes high academic achievement in AACSB International-accredited schools. Selection to Beta Gamma Sigma is the highest scholastic honor a student in business can earn. Students in the top seven percent of the junior class and the top ten percent of the senior class are invited for membership every spring. For more information about Beta Gamma Sigma, access the Web site at 
<a href="http://www.betagammasigma.org">betagammasigma.org</a>, or stop by BA 150.</p>
<p>
In addition to the regular degree curricula, other programs of study in the school are designed to meet special needs. Selected majors are available in the evening, and continuing education courses are conducted for qualified persons who are regularly employed and who otherwise would be unable to enroll in college courses. Short courses and institutes on a noncredit basis are organized in cooperation with various business groups for the furtherance of in-service training of employed personnel.</p>
<p>
The school works in partnership with the business community, and the board of the Dean&#8217;s Council of 100 serves as a primary source of advice and counsel for the school. Through the various divisions of the L. William Seidman Research Institute, the school reaches out to the business community through research and executive education. For more information, access the school&#8217;s Web site at 
<a href="http://wpcarey.asu.edu">wpcarey.asu.edu</a>.</p></div>

<b>
Transfer Credit.</b> 
Credit from other institutions is accepted subject to the following guidelines. Students planning to take their first two years of work at a community college or another four-year college should take only those courses in business and economics that are offered as freshman- or sophomore-level courses at any of the state-supported Arizona universities. These lower-division courses are numbered 100 through 299. <i>
A maximum of 30 hours of business and economics courses from community colleges are accepted toward a bachelor&#8217;s degree in business.</i>
</p>
<p>
Students may transfer a maximum of nine semester hours of approved upper-division business course work required for the business degree to the Tempe campus. Professional business courses taught in the junior or senior year in the state universities may not be completed at a two-year college for transfer credit in the business core or major. The introductory course in the legal, ethical, and regulatory issues in business is accepted as an exception to this policy, but only lower-division credit is granted. Such courses may be utilized in the free elective category subject to the 30-hour limitation. Courses taught as vocational or career classes at the community colleges that are not taught in the schools of business at any one of the state universities are not accepted for credit toward a bachelor&#8217;s degree. Courses taught in the upper-division business core at the state universities must be completed at the degree-granting institution unless transferred from an accredited four-year school. Normally, upper-division transfer credits are accepted only from AACSB International-accredited schools. To be accepted for credit as part of the professional program in business, all courses transferred from other institutions must carry prerequisites similar to those of the courses they are replacing at ASU.</p>
<p>
An Associate in Transfer Partnership degree is available to Maricopa community college students who wish to complete their first two years of course work at a Maricopa community college and transfer to the 
W. P. Carey School of Business
 without loss of credit. An Associate of Business degree is available to students who wish to complete their first two years of course work at an Arizona community college and transfer to the 
W. P. Carey School of Business
 without loss of credit. Students should consult with an academic advisor in Undergraduate Programs to plan curriculum requirements and/or access Business Transfer Guides for optimal course selection at

Rodel Community Scholars.</b> 
With the establishment of the Rodel Community Scholars Program, the ASU 
W. P. Carey School of Business
 greatly expands its effort to produce civic-minded business leaders for the Phoenix metropolitan area and Arizona. The program focuses the energy and intellect of talented ASU business students and their business faculty advisors on a substantial challenge: developing and implementing strategies to assist high-potential, at-risk students in targeted Valley high schools to graduate from ASU.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Internships.</b> 
The school encourages students to complement their academic program with career-related work. This practical experience gives students a distinct advantage in the job market when seeking their first full-time professional positions. Additional benefits include industry contacts, a deeper understanding of career options, and monetary compensation that helps students finance their education.</p>
<p>
Formal internships and co-ops offer professional work experience and experiential learning opportunities that enrich the student&#8217;s academic preparation. Students may undertake internships in the summer or part-time during semesters. Co-op positions are full-time and require a one-semester or longer break in school attendance. The school provides guidelines to companies and encourages them to sponsor internship and co-op positions that benefit the firm and the student. Both benefit because positions are built around projects and challenging responsibilities that enable students to apply learning acquired in advanced business classes.</p>
<p>
ASU Career Services and the 
W. P. Carey School of Business
 work cooperatively to help students identify and obtain career-related work. The process of obtaining internships and co-ops is a learning opportunity. Students use the same job-search skills and resources used to obtain permanent career positions. Informational materials, workshops, and required class activities help students learn job-search and career-exploration skills and locate internship and co-op opportunities.</p>
<p>
Some academic units within the school offer internship courses. Work assignments for these courses must be approved in advance by a designated faculty member, and all internship courses include an academic component. Limited numbers of international internship opportunities are available through the school&#8217;s foreign partner institutions. Eligibility for these internships may require the student to participate in an exchange with the partner institutions or to pay additional fees.</p>

Prelaw Studies.</b> 
Prelaw students may pursue a program of study in the 
W. P. Carey School of Business. Courses in accounting, economics, finance, insurance, labor relations, and statistics are recommended for any student planning to enter the legal profession.</p>
<p>
The admission requirements of colleges of law differ considerably. The student should communicate with the admissions office of the law school the student hopes to attend and should plan a program to meet the requirements of that school. Most law schools, including the ASU College of Law, require a baccalaureate degree and completion of the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) for admission.</p>
<p>
Students who plan to complete a bachelor&#8217;s degree before entering law school may follow any field of specialization in the 
W. P. Carey School of Business. Within the 
W. P. Carey School of Business
 are faculty members who are lawyers and who serve as advisors for students desiring a prelaw background. In addition to a student&#8217;s assigned advisor, a prelaw advisor is available in the undergraduate office. More information is available on the prelaw Web site at
