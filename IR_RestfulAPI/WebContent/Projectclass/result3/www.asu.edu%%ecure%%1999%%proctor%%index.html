What is Circular A-110?</b></p><p>Circular A-110 (&#8220;A-110&#8221;) is the primary set of administrative guidelines issued by the Federal Office of Management and Budget (&#8220;OMB&#8221;) with respect to federal grants and agreements with universities, hospitals and other non-profit research entities.  In general, A-110 governs the administrative, auditing, and intellectual property issues arising from grants or contracts for federally-funded research, and tells us how to spend federal money.</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>2. What does that have to do with electronic records or privacy?</b>  </p><p>Many federal documents are subject to public disclosure pursuant to the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and an issue arises as to whether documents created as a result of federally-funded projects should be subject to FOIA.  Moreover, many state public records statutes allow disclosure of most documents maintained by state agencies or their officers.  To the extent that these state statutes rely on federal law in interpreting various exceptions to state public records statutes, the impact of FOIA on federally-funded research information is critical.  In short, many argue that FOIA should extend to information created, gathered and held by non-federal entities such as hospitals and universities as a result of federally-funded research efforts, even if that information, including raw data, is never released to the funding agency.</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>3. Is this a new issue?</b>  </p><p>Not exactly.  A-110 has always mandated that</p><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><i>The federal government has the right to (1) obtain, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data first produced under an award and (2) authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes.</i>   OMB Circular A-11O, Section <u>__</u>.36(C), Intangible Property.</p><p>Note that under <u>Forsham v. Harris</u>, 445 U.S. 169, 179-180 (1980), data in a funding recipient&#8217;s files but not in the funding agency&#8217;s files are not available under FOIA.  Federal granting agencies were also generally able to protect the premature disclosure of information on the basis of personal privacy or trade secrets exceptions to FOIA.  This temporary restriction of incomplete, uninterpreted, proprietary or personal information was critical to allow for subject confidentiality, appropriate reduction of data, or attainment of copyright or patent in the resulting intellectual property, and accordingly to provide an incentive to researchers producing original work.</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>4. Why the excitement?</b>  </p><p>The rules have changed.  In fact, they are changing as we speak.</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>5. Why the change?</b> </p><p>Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama requested research data produced by Harvard with regard to the relationship between air quality and health.  The EPA had cited the Harvard data when it modified air pollution standards.  Harvard failed to provide the data to Senator Shelby to his satisfaction, so Senator Shelby tagged an amendment on the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 requiring the OMB to amend A-110</p><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><i>&#8220;[T]o ensure that all data produced under an award will be made available to the public through the procedures established under the Freedom of Information Act.&#8221;</i> See Public Law 105-277.</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>6. Does that mean what it says it means?</b>  </p><p>That depends what &#8220;all data&#8221; means.  Taken literally, all data, raw or ready, personal or empirical, published or private, may be subject to public disclosure.  If this includes raw data, it could arguably include all raw data, including data which has not yet been interpreted or reduced to practice, data which is otherwise patentable and which through public disclosure may lose its patentability, and confidential information such as patient identification in human subjects research.</p><p>Moreover, the statute may be read to reach information maintained by institutions receiving federal funding, even if that information was never made available to the funding agency (note that the law says &#8220;data produced&#8221; rather than &#8220;finding&#8221;).  Finally, as with all unfunded mandates, the act did not provide guidance as to who would bear the costs of assembling and copying such information.</p><p>As stated in Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Washington Highlights, February 5, 1999, &#8220;the AAMC, the National Academy of Sciences, and many other organizations have voiced strong concerns regarding the potentially hazardous consequences this legislation could have on research.  It appears that OMB is considering and carefully weighing these concerns, as well as concerns raised by other members of Congress, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Institutes of Health.&#8221;</p><p>In the words of funded scientists, the statute and its potential ramifications creatednothing less than a Big Bang.</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>7. Has the OMB responded?</b> </p> <p>Yes, twice, with a third response in the works.  Other than some constructive criticism offered by concerned entities along the way, I have included only the most recent promulgation in your materials.</p><p>The OMB first promulgated draft regulations for comment on February 4, 1999.The specific text of that initial promulgation is available in the Federal Register at 64 F.R. 5684.  The text is also available at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website at <a href="http://www.grants.nih.gov/grants/newsarchive_1999.htm">www.grants.nih.gov/grants/newsarchive_1999.htm</a> along with a substantial amount of analysis, under the article entitled &#8220;February 5, 1999 - Proposed Revision of Circular A-110 Regarding Access to Data Developed Under Federal Grants.&#8221;  This website is a tremendous resource for issues surrounding the 1999 evolution of A-110.</p><p>Articles discussing the changes have also appeared in the Chronicle of Higher Education, the AAMC Washington Highlights, and the Wall Street Journal (March 1, 1999, <i>Scientists Challenge Provision Opening Access to Data</i>).</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>8. What did OMB say that created so much attention?</b>  </p><p>The OMB initially attempted a moderate approach with respect to Senator Shelby&#8217;s mandate.  In particular, the OMB modified the pre-existing A-110 language set forth in paragraph 3 above to include the following <i>italicized</i> language:</p><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">The federal government has the right to (1) obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award, and (2) authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes.<i>In addition, in response to a freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for data relating to published research findings produced under an award that were used by the Federal Government in developing policy or rules, the Federal awarding agency shall, within a reasonable time, obtain the requested data so that they can be made available to the public through the procedures established under the FOIA.  If the Federal awarding agency obtains the data solely in response to a FOIA request, the agency may charge the requester a reasonable fee equaling the full incremental cost of obtaining the data.  This fee should reflect costs incurred by the agency, the recipient, and applicable subrecipients.</i></p><p>The promulgation allayed some fears regarding statutory impact through the significant interpretations reviewed below.  But for each remedy, some concerns were left unresolved.</p><ol type="a"><li>The FOIA requests only reach data related to <i>published</i> research findings.  Accordingly, if the research findings were not yet published, the existing FOIA exemptions for privacy and trade secrets would apply to related data at least until the findings were published.  Unfortunately, much of the underlying data continues to be sensitive and perhaps deserving of protection even after publication of the research results (obvious examples include patient questionnaires and multipurpose data).  Accordingly, questions continued as to the basic definition of &#8220;data,&#8221; as to whether OMB and Congress actually intend to expand FOIA to information which currently protected against FOIA access, and whether FOIA reaches data of any sort not provided to the agency (contrary to <u>Forsham</u>).</li><li>The privacy and trade secret issues are addressed somewhat by the OMB&#8217;s use of  the language &#8220;available to the public <i>through the procedures established</i> under the FOIA.&#8221;  As stated by OMB in the Federal Register release, OMB intended by its use of this language to require the funding agency to apply FOIA&#8217;s procedural and substantive requirements, thus preserving confidentiality and trade secretprotection.  These protections were not, however, expressly preserved in thelanguage itself, and any agency faced with an FOIA request would have to researchthe promulgating language to clarify the ambiguity.</li><li>The clarification also applies the change only to published data <i>used by the government in developing policy or rules.</i>  This significantly narrows the breadth of the rule, as not all research is used in the formulation of policy.  Although the OMB relied on expressed congressional intent (in the February 1999 promulgation, OMB cites congressional floor statements by Senator Lott in support of the provision), and the progenesis of the statute in narrowing application, the same &#8220;data&#8221; definition problems that exist with respect to trade secrets and patient confidentiality still exist with respect to much of the research utilized in policy formulation.  For example, does the FOIA now allow release of confidential clinical trial information for every research project upon which the FDA relies in making regulatory decisions?</li><li>Although the funding agency is responsible for arranging production of documents, the fact that they are obligated to <i>obtain</i> for production the documents requested implies that documents maintained by recipient agencies, who have never been subject to FOIA, must now comply at least indirectly with disclosure requests.</li><li>OMB requires the requester to cover costs, but the computation of &#8220;reasonable fees equaling the full incremental costs&#8221; is difficult.  Further, the inclusion of costs &#8220;incurred by the recipient&#8221; confirms OMB&#8217;s intention to force educational institutions to produce data which has not been supplied to the federal government.</li></ol><p>The OMB release and the resulting commentary identified a number of additional and significant issues.  Many of these issues are identified in the materials included with this presentation, and are most succinctly identified in comment correspondence and implications assessments produced by the National Institutes of Health, the Council on Governmental Relations and, of course, the office of Senator Shelby.</p><p>In a nutshell, the reaction began well in advance of OMB&#8217;s promulgation, so the arguments were well honed by the time the proposed regulations were published.  As stated in the AAMC&#8217;s Washington Highlights of February 5, 1999,</p><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><i>The proposed language in the OMB notice would apparently restrict the revision to research data relating to federal rules and policy: however, this language does not assuage concerns in the research community about the ambiguity and administrative burden engendered by the revision.  There remains the more general concern that the FOIA, which has historically served to provide public access to federal procedures, actions, and operations, is too blunt an instrument to enforce the important public policy objective of data sharing by the research community.</i></p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>9. What about OMB&#8217;s second response?</b>  </p><p>The OMB allowed comment through April 5, 1999, and received in excess of 9000 comments in that two month period.  In response, OMB issued a set of Clarifying Changes on August 11, 1999, and provided an additional thirty-day comment period.  The Clarifying Changes responded to four key definitional principles alluded to above:</p><ol type="1"><li>What is meant by &#8220;data&#8221;?</li><li>When is something &#8220;published&#8221;?</li><li>How broadly does &#8220;used by the government in developing policy or rules&#8221; reach?</li><li>What are &#8220;reasonable fees&#8221;?</li></ol><p>The specific changes are available in the August 11 edition of the Federal Register, at 64F.R. 43786-43791.  In short, OMB:</p><ol type="a"><li>Proposed to define &#8220;research data&#8221; as &#8220;the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate researching findings, but not any of the following: preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues.&#8221; The definition further excludes physical objects (like lab specimens),&#8220; trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be held confidential by a researcher until publication of their results in a peer-reviewed journal, or information which may be copyrighted or patented; and personnel or medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, such as information that could be used to identify a particular person in a research study.&#8221;</li><li>Proposed to define &#8220;published&#8221; as when &#8220;findings are published in a peer-reviewed scientific or technical journal; or a federal agency publicly and officially cites to the research findings in support of a regulation.&#8221;</li><li>Proposed to define &#8220;used by the government in developing a regulation&#8221; as occurring when the government officially cites the research &#8220;in support of aregulation (for which notice and comment is required under 5 U.S.C. 553).&#8221;</li><li>As to reasonable costs, OMB asked for additional comment as to the mechanism for cost reimbursement, in particular as to whether costs should be charged to awards as &#8220;direct&#8221; or &#8220;indirect&#8221; costs or by contract, and suggested than it would consider these comments in revisiting OMB Circular A-21, an entirely  separate ball of wax addressing &#8220;Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.&#8221;  In short, OMB took no action at that time to address cost concerns, other than to assure that they would find a way for costs to be covered, and to confirm that, at least at some level, fund recipients would bear additional assembly and accounting burdens.</li></ol><p>The specific  language is also available at the NIH website above,  under the article &#8220;August 17, 1999 - Problems Remain Even After Major Improvements in Modifications to A-110.&#8221;</p><p>Although generally supportive of the changes, the NIH expressed continuingconcern in the areas of &#8220;entity privacy&#8221; as opposed to individual privacy, the possibility of different treatment commensurate with funding level distinctions, the impact of conditions set forth in informed consent documents, adjudication of redaction and timeliness disputes, and incremental costs.  The Chronicle of Higher Education, however, trumpeted the changes as &#8220;a key victory&#8221; for scientists.  See &#8220;Clarification of Proposed Rules Would Let Scientists Keep Certain Data Private,&#8221; August 12, 1999.</p><p>Even with the NIH&#8217;s continuing discomfort, perhaps the most pointed commentary on the improvements came in the form of a September 10, 1999, letter from Senator Shelby to OMB:</p><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><i>While we appreciate your efforts to move expeditiously to finalize the proposed revision, the August 11th proposal represents a significant retreat from OMB&#8217;s original February 4th proposal as to render the provision potentially meaningless in its ability to improve the public&#8217;s access to federally funded research data.  The severe limitations included in the clarifying changes to the proposal are contrary to the plain meaning of the statute and Congress&#8217;s intent in passing the law.</i></p><p>Clearly, OMB has found it difficult to satisfy everyone.</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>10. Where are we today?</b>  </p><p>We now have the OMB's third and &#8220;final&#8221; pronouncement on the issue.  The OMB forwarded Final Revisions on September 30, 1999, having received an additional 3000 comments since August 10.  As of October 7, 1999, the Revisions have not yet been published in the Federal Register.  An advance copy of the Revisions is included in your course materials, but the Revisions will not be effective until 30 days after publication in the Register.  Once published, additional copies of all three pronouncements will be available at OMB&#8217;s home page (<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB">http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB</a>) under the heading &#8220;Grants Management.&#8221;</p><p>The most significant changes in the September 30 Revisions include a modification to the &#8220;data&#8221; definition.  No longer will the definition exclude all work &#8220;which may be copyrighted or patented,&#8221; but will merely extend to &#8220;similar information [information which must be held confidentially until publication] which is protected under law.&#8221; Regardless what this means with respect to information which <i>may</i> be but is not yet subject to protection via copyright or patent, many university lawyers will be scratching their heads trying to figure out whether &#8220;protected under law&#8221; includes protection pursuant to state public records exceptions.</p><p>The OMB also modified, and unfortunately rendered intractably more ambiguous, the definition of &#8220;published.&#8221;  Rather than counting as published all studies &#8220;cited in support of regulations,&#8221; OMB revised its definition to reach all used &#8220;in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law.&#8221; Does this include administrative hearings?  In other words, does a draft set of findings or raw data become &#8220;published&#8221; once it is cited in an administrative hearing?</p><p>OMB then revised its overall application of the type of studies to which the regulation applies to reach, consistent with the revised definition of &#8220;published,&#8221; only those studies publicly and officially cited in support of agency actions that have the force and effect of law.</p><p>Finally, OMB deferred the cost issues to a subsequent discussion of A-21.</p></div><div class="slide"><p><b>11. So, bottom line, what&#8217;s it all mean?</b>  </p><p>Seven things, really.</p><ol type="a"><li>	Much of the raw data which we never thought would be of interest to anyone other than fellow scientists will now be public knowledge.</li><li>Much of that data which would normally be protected from disclosure as a result of patient confidentiality or trade secrets will remain protected.</li><li>Although the federal agency is responsible for gathering, assessing and producing the related data, this exercise implies that FOIA now reaches information in our files.</li><li>We may have to fight over exceptions we never had to fight over in the past, and we will constantly struggle with whether the agency relied on our data in making a decision which &#8220;has the force and effect of law.&#8221;</li><li>We still don&#8217;t know who pays for it, but researchers will undoubtedly bear an additional administrative burden.</li><li>If you are generating data that you know in advance will support agency decision making, be aware what you&#8217;re in for (and keep in mind that you never really know when anything will be cited, so you never know what you're in for).</li><li>And finally, if you receive a public records or FOIA request for research data, callyour lawyer.</li></ol><p>All of which goes to prove the old adage: &#8220;There is no free FOIA gras.&#8221; Or at least no FIOA-free green.</p></div><!-- footer --><p class="nav">[ <a href="../../"><acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym> Home</a> |<a href="../../archives.html">Archives</a> |<a href="../">1999 Presentations</a> ]</p><div class="footer">    <p class="postdate">&copy;&nbsp;1999    Proctor &nbsp;&#8212;    Last Modified		Wednesday 11 February 2004		<br />Visits to this page: <img src="/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?pad=0|dd=E|ft=0|tr=T|trgb=ffffff|df=ickim-ecure-speaker-presentation-proctor-html.dat" alt="Number of visits to this page" />	</p></div></body></html>
