<P>
Faculty have a duty to share the responsibilities and obligations of governance and administration of the university as provided for by the Board of Regents in the <A HREF="acd501.html"><I>Conditions of Faculty Service</I></A> and other policy statements.  These responsibilities include making recommendations regarding:

<P>
<OL>
<LI>approval of course content and manner of instruction</LI>

<P>
<LI>establishment of requirements for matriculation and degrees

<P>
In particular, the faculty recommends the requirements for the degrees offered, advises when the requirements have been met, and recommends that the <A HREF="acd002.html#president" TARGET="New">president</A> and the board grant the degrees thus achieved.</LI>

<P>
<LI><A HREF="acd002.html#Appointment">appointment</A> and promotion of faculty

<P>
Recommending faculty status and related matters is a responsibility of faculty in each <A HREF="acd002.html#academicunit" TARGET="New">academic unit</A>: these recommendations include appointments, reappointments, decisions not to reappoint, promotions, granting of <A HREF="acd002.html#tenure" TARGET="New">tenure</A>, and dismissal. The responsibility of the faculty in such matters is based on the fact that its judgment is central to general educational policy.  Furthermore, scholars in a particular field or activity have the chief competence for judging the work of their colleagues; in such competence it is implicit that responsibility exists to make both adverse and favorable recommendations.</LI>

<P>
<LI>selection of chairs of <A HREF="acd002.html#department" TARGET="New">departments</A> and certain academic administrators

<P>
Recommendations in these matters should originate with the appropriate faculty through established procedures and be reviewed by the president with the concurrence of the board.</LI>

<P>
<LI>discipline of members of the faculty and the formulation of <A HREF="acd002.html#rule" TARGET="New">rules</A> and procedures for the discipline of <A HREF="acd002.html#student" TARGET="New">students</A></LI>

<P>
<LI>establishment of norms for teaching responsibilities and for evaluation of both faculty and student achievement</LI>

<P>
<LI>policies and procedures governing salary increases

<P>
and</LI>

<P>
<LI>the forms of faculty governance at the department, college, and university levels.</LI>
