<img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2">

<p>
Misuse of university assets is a violation of policies of the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR), the <i>Academic Affairs Policies and Procedures Manual</i> (ACD), the <i>Staff Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual</i> (SPP), the <i>Student Code of Conduct</i>, and other policies of the university (collectively &#147;board and university policies&#148;). Therefore, this policy is in addition to, but does not substitute for other laws and policies governing employees and students at the university, whether currently in effect or whether established after the adoption of this policy. Employees and students are required to be familiar with all policies governing the appropriate use of university assets. 

<p>
Disciplinary action against employees or students for misuse of university assets will be pursued under one or more of those policies, using the procedure applicable to that category of employees or students in connection with those policies.

<p>
Unless otherwise stated, language in this policy is to be given its ordinary meaning consistent with the remedial purpose of this policy. Examples are given by way of illustration only, and specially defined terms are not limited to the examples given. As used in this policy:<br>

<p>
<ol>
<li>&#147;Employee&#148; means an individual who is employed by the Arizona Board of Regents under the classifications  <a href="acd002.html#facultymember" target="New">Faculty</a>, <a href="acd002.html#academicprofessional" target="New">Academic Professional</a>, <a href="acd002.html#classified staff" target="New">Classified Staff</a>, <a href="acd002.html#service pro" target="New">Service Professional</a>, and <a href="acd002.html#administrator" target="New">Administrator</a> as those terms are defined in board and university policies, student employees, graduate students with research or teaching responsibilities, including instructors, whether the individual is paid or unpaid, or any individual who represents or acts on behalf of the university and whose actions may bind the university. For purposes of this policy, &#147;employee&#148; shall include all agents of the university.</li><br>

<p>
<li>&#147;University assets&#148; are items of tangible or intangible property owned by, leased to, licensed to, or in the possession of ASU. Examples include name, money, land, buildings, improvements, inventory, equipment, accounts receivable, supplies, library volumes, museum pieces, art objects, furniture, materials, intellectual property, confidential or proprietary information, campus electronic information resources or internet domain (asu.edu), software, tools, vehicles, and paid employee time. University assets also include items that should have rightfully become an asset of the university but did not due to misuse by an employee. An example is a patent that should have been assigned by an employee but was not.</li><br>

<p>
<li>&#147;Misuse&#148; includes the illegal use of university assets and uses that are prohibited under this or another university or board policy that result in loss, damage, or financial liability to the university or gain to the individual or a third party and no benefit to the university. Examples include but are not limited to using university assets for personal or non-ASU purposes; fraud, theft, or embezzlement, which violate provisions of criminal law of the state of Arizona; acts (such as disclosure of confidential, proprietary, or privileged information) that reduce the value of university assets or expose the university to legal or financial penalties, or are conflicts of interest that benefit the employee or a third party and have not been expressly authorized by ASU.</li><br>

<p>
<li>&#147;Corrective Action Plan&#148; (CAP) means a written plan developed by the management of the affected unit following a determination of misuse (or risk of misuse) of university assets in order to correct and protect the university from future losses or potential losses.</li></ol>

<ol>
<li>Employees and students may not misuse university assets.</li><br>

<p>
<li>Employees and students have a responsibility to report activities or significant incidents that appear to be misuse of university assets.<br>
<br>
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Employees may report such suspected misuse to any manager or supervisor in the chain of authority (director, department/unit head, dean, or appropriate vice president) or may make a report directly to the chief financial officer.</li><br>

 <p>
<li>Employees need not report misuse to their direct supervisors if they make a report of alleged misuse to any supervisor, vice president, or the chief financial officer.</li><br>

<p>
<li>Good faith reports of misuse of university assets are subject to the protection of the ABOR policy against whistleblowing as outlined in <a href="http://www.abor.asu.edu/1_the_regents/policymanual/chap6/chap6_part2.htm#6-914">ABOR 6-914</a>.</li><br> 

<p>
<li>Reporters of violations of this policy should be aware that some misuses of university assets are <i>de minimus</i>, and do not rise to the level to which a university administrator, auditor, or the ASU Police Department (ASU DPS) would consider the use a violation of this policy or of criminal law. However, if, combined with other incidents of reported misuse, the incident is not <i>de minimus</i>, the university supervisor, auditor, or ASU DPS may consider the incident a significant misuse of university assets, warranting an investigation.</li></ol></li></ol>

<p>
<ol start="3">
<li> Supervisors receiving reports of suspected misuse may take action to satisfy themselves that there is a reasonable basis to suspect that misuse has occurred prior to reporting to their immediate superior or supervisor in the chain of authority. However, before doing so, supervisors should consult with a representative from the Human Resources Department, the ASU chief of police, the director of Internal Audit & Management Services, or the Office of the General Counsel, whose expertise in these matters may provide helpful insights to confirm the appropriateness of a preliminary evaluation or indicate the need for additional assistance.  

<p>
No department or individual should investigate a misappropriation on their own or enter into any kind of discussion regarding settlement or restitution without prior written approval from the Office of General Counsel.</li>

<p>
<li>Employees and students involved in any aspect of a preliminary evaluation by the administrator, supervisor or manager, or an investigation under this policy, are responsible for keeping all information regarding the alleged misuse confidential.</li></ol>

<li>General. As set forth in paragraph 2 of the section &#147;<a href="#responsibilitiesemployees">Responsibilities of All Employees and Students</a>,&#148; above, employees and students are expected to report incidents involving significant misuse of university assets.</li><br>

 <p>
<li>Confidentiality. Subject to applicable Arizona law, matters pertaining to reports and investigations of misuse of university assets shall be treated by ABOR and ASU as confidential pending the completion of any audit or investigation. University employees responsible for conducting any phase of a confidential investigation shall inform individuals contacted that their identities and the information they provide will remain confidential to the extent permitted by law.</li><br>

 <p>
<li>Investigation.<br>

<br>
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The Office of Internal Audit & Management Services may conduct an investigation of the available evidence and related circumstances to determine whether a thorough or more extensive audit is necessary. If a more thorough or extensive audit is deemed necessary, the chief financial officer or his/her designee will determine who should conduct that audit. </li><br>

 <p>
<li>If, after consulting with general counsel, it appears to the relevant vice president or the Office of Internal Audit & Management Services that the matter may involve criminal misconduct, she or he shall request an investigation by ASU DPS.</li><br>

 <p>
<li>The chief financial officer, ASU DPS, the Office of Internal Audit & Management Services, deans, directors, and department heads have authority to take immediate action, as they determine necessary, to secure and protect university assets and any pertinent accounting and administrative records from misuse, destruction, or alteration.</li><br>

 <p>
<li>An individual who is accused of misuse or misappropriation of university assets may, at his or her expense, employ and be accompanied by legal counsel during any interviews or meetings with ASU DPS, internal auditors or others charged by the university to investigate this matter. Should disciplinary action be initiated upon a finding of wrongdoing, the individual shall be entitled to the protections provided under applicable personnel rules of the university and ABOR policies.</li><br>

 <p>
<li> If permitted by applicable policies and procedures of the ASU, an individual who is subject to an investigation for misuse of university assets may be placed on administrative leave with pay while an investigation into wrongdoing is pending. Administrative leave with pay, if appropriate, may be imposed by any supervisor in the chain of authority, and shall be imposed in accordance with applicable university and ABOR policies, following consultation with the Human Resources Department, the provost and executive vice president, and the chief financial officer.

 <p>
and</li>

<p>
<li>All investigations and every step thereof shall be conducted consistent with the constitutional rights of those persons being investigated.</li></ol></li></ol>
 

<p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Post-Investigation Actions.<br>

<br>
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The officials conducting the investigation shall make a written report to the chief financial officer, subject to their right to expand the scope of their investigation to determine the extent of the misuse, to identify individuals responsible for the improprieties, or to include a review of internal controls of the area in which the misuse occurred.</li><br>

 <p>
<li>If the individuals or offices conducting the investigation determine that no further investigation is required, then they shall complete their report to the chief financial officer.</li><br>

 <p>
<li> If, after consultation with the general counsel, it appears from the investigation that the individual under investigation has committed a criminal act in violation of state or federal law, the chief financial officer shall advise ASU DPS of this conclusion if ASU DPS previously did not investigate the matter as a violation of criminal law, and thereafter, ASU DPS shall notify and coordinate further actions with the relevant prosecuting agency.</li></ol></li></ol>
 

<p>
<ol start="5">
<li>After receipt of a written final investigative report, the chief financial officer will inform the relevant vice president, the general counsel, and the president of the final disposition of the investigation.</li><br>

 <p>
<li>The relevant vice president shall inform appropriate subordinate supervisors, within their respective areas of responsibility, of the investigative results that affect their units, and direct, if appropriate, that they initiate disciplinary action, as set forth below in section on Disciplinary Actions.</li></ol>

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b><a name="disciplinaryactions">Disciplinary Actions</a></b></font>

<p>
If the investigator(s) conclude that an employee or student is responsible for misuse of university assets, the administration or the dean of students shall initiate appropriate disciplinary action, in accordance with existing ABOR and university policies including any applicable provision regarding due process. 

<p>
All other rules, regulations, and statutes governing university business operations shall also apply to disciplinary action taken against an employee for violation of this policy. 

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b><a name="findingsdonotsupport">Actions When Findings Do Not Support Claim of Misuse</a></b></font>

<p>
At the conclusion of the evaluation or investigation, if either the supervisor conducting the evaluation of the allegation of misuse or the chief financial officer finds insufficient evidence upon which to determine that misuse occurred, or if she or he disagrees with the investigator&#146;s findings and recommendations, the university, including the chief financial officer, a department head, director, dean or supervisor, will undertake diligent efforts to restore the reputations of persons alleged to have engaged in misuse under this policy. They also will make diligent efforts to protect the positions and reputations of those persons who, in good faith, made those allegations.
