      <h2>ASU research plays role in securing presidential debate</a></h2>
      <p align="left"> As part of the planning effort for the presidential debate at ASU, countless hours went into security logistics for the event. In addition to the standard use of manpower, ASU&rsquo;s security plan included a small but significant piece of technology being developed on campus by university researchers. </p>
      <p align="left"> Supported by ASU DPS and led by Talbot Brooks, an assistant research professional in geography, a team unveiled a new integrated Geographic Information System/Science System designed for public safety use. The system gives officers new tools, ranging from maps to crime-pattern analysis, that can be used instantly in the field. </p>
      <p align="left"> &ldquo;This technology is really a perfect fit for public safety,&rdquo; says Brooks, who first was exposed to GIS when he was a firefighter. &ldquo;The result is an improvement in safety without having to reallocate resources.&rdquo; </p>
      <p align="left"> GIS uses spatial data (physical characteristics as well as geographical locations among others) to understand, analyze and view characteristics of the world around us. The computer-based tool can isolate single items such as fire hydrant locations or analyze larger chunks of data, such as the entire campus. </p>
      <p align="left"> During the debate, DPS and several other public safety agencies had direct, instant access to GIS maps of campus and Tempe Beach park, along with three-dimensional imaging tools that enabled officers to see the actual line of sight from building to building. </p>
      <p align="left"> There were specific systems in the Incident Command Post, the main security command post, for all police activity during the debate, and the Emergency Operations Center , a secondary post that was available for use if the main command post was taken offline. </p>
      <p align="left"> In the command centers, Brooks and several students on his team charted every police radio call on a map of the area. The team members were able to pinpoint where specific groups of people were headed and provide the officers with a perspective on where each incident was occurring. </p>
      <p align="left"> The 3-D maps enabled officers to get an accurate view of physical dimensions of the buildings and the line of sight from one to the next. There also was the capability to pull up an electronic blueprint of a building instantly, instead of having to find an actual blueprint of a specific site. </p>
      <p align="left"> Brooks says seven handheld devices &ndash; inspired by those created for the GPS-driven campus tours created by University Undergraduate Initiatives and OnPoint Systems &ndash; were used by officers in the field, giving them access to the same data as that in the command centers. These units were in the hands of bomb squad and hazardous materials handlers that would have needed to respond quickly to an incident. </p>
      <p align="left"> &ldquo;I know in several cases our team was asked to show maps or to determine what could be seen from a specific location,&rdquo; Brooks says. </p>
      <p align="left"> The data for the units were compiled by Brooks&rsquo; team, with major assistance from ASU facilities management officials. </p>
      <p align="left"> Brooks says other agencies, such as the Phoenix Fire Department, use GIS systems for mapping in connection with its dispatch, but no one else has such a complete system for mapping and analysis. </p>
      <p align="left"> &ldquo;Different people around have bits and pieces of what we have,&rdquo; Brooks says. &ldquo;But nobody has it as an integrated working system that has it all together.&rdquo; </p>
      <p align="left"> Brooks&rsquo; system has been in development for several months specifically for ASU DPS. The department is in the process of buying a new, computer-based dispatch system that will integrate with the GIS system.</p>
      <p align="left"> The ASU GIS lab, led by Brooks, includes graduate and undergraduate students and explores new applications for GIS technology. Other projects include several programs with ASU&rsquo;s Office of University Initiatives, local municipalities such as Queen Creek and Phoenix , and the private sector. </p>
