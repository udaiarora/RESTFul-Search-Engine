<B><CENTER>The Inspirational Angel</CENTER></B>
<p>
I still remember the day she shared a sad life story, her life
story... She shared with us the pain of her polio. Her hands are no bigger
than that of a five-year old. She drags her left foot and has no feeling
in right arm from the elbow down. She stands at 5 feet 7 inches and her
name is Paula Sturgeon. She tells sad stories about her childhood that
will depress me and fill me with sadness and hatred, although there isn't
anyone to be mad at.<p>
She shows a great amount of faith. Paula is a role model to me and about
twenty other kids at our church. Paula doesn't only teach us about the
pain of paralysis, she teaches about faith and what kind of faith she has
and the amount of faith she has as well.<p>
Sometimes she has to swallow her pride and sit in a wheelchair and get
done what needs to be done. Her inspiration to me is great. She shows me
even if your down on your luck, you shouldn't give up.  She taught me to
be positive and look on the bright side I have never heard her say
&quot; What If&#133;&quot; or &quot; If it were...&#148; She never took
back what she has said or done in her life.<p>
She has helped with everything and shows me how to act without hatred in
my life. She never looks back and wonders about herself, she only looks to
the future and to us kids, which is what makes Paula Sturgeon a true
inspiration and a heavenly angel.<p>
