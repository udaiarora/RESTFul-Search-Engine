        </ul>
        <p>In designing the interview questions, we started with the concerns that surfaced in the survey results. The top concern on each campus was unsolicited email. Following closely behind SPAM issues were such things as confidentiality and security, the time spent on email, the management of email, how to deal with the volume of email, what to keep and how long to keep it, lack of training, and so on. We looked at these concerns and we generated every possible question we could think of (probably phrased in as many inappropriate ways as possible) and we pooled our results. Then we refined the questions and put everything in laymen's terms Â? we avoided the use of archival terms like appraisal, retention and authenticity.</p>
