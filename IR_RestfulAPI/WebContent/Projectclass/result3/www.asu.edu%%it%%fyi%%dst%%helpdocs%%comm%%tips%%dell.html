Should I buy a Dell OptiPlex or a Dimension?
</center></h2>
<P>
<h3>
Question:
</h3>
The ASU Computer Store sells only the Optiplex line, however the
Dimension line looks like it has a much better price/performance
ratio.
<p>
<h3>
Response:
</h3> 
I asked a Dell representative about the difference between the
OptiPlex and Dimension lines.  Most of the major differences can
be placed in two categories: certification and engineering.
<p>
<h4> 
Certification:
</h4> 
The Dimension is more leading edge technology, whereas OptiPlex
is more conservative "tried-and-true".  The OptiPlex line with
its various components are certified to work for a variety of
operating environments whereas the Dimension line is not. For
example, the following descriptions are for Dell's OptiPlex GXa
and Dimension XPS.
<pre> 
OptiPlex GXa                        Dimension XPS
------------                        -------------
Factory Installed                   Factory Installed
  Operating Systems                   Operating Systems
- Windows 95                        - Windows 95
- Windows NT 4.0                    - Windows NT 4.0
 
Certified
  Operating Systems
- Windows NT 4.0
- Windows 95
- Novell Netware Client 32 for
    DOS/Windows and Client for
    Windows 95
- IBM OS/2 Warp 4.x
- SCO UNIX 5.0.2
- Sunsoft Solaris 2.5.1
- Banyan 7.0
</pre><p> 
Note the lack of a certification list for the Dimension,
including no mention of certification for 95 or NT. This is not
an oversight.  It means the Dimension is expected to work in the
95 and NT environments but has not been through the certification
process that the OptiPlex line has undergone. (If the components
were all certified, considering the elapsed time required and the
cost of certification, then the system wouldn't be leading edge
and it wouldn't be as price attractive as it is.)
 <p>
No mention of the "other" operating systems for the Dimension
line doesn't mean they won't work on Dimension, but you may be
stuck with back level drivers or have other struggles getting
everything up and running the way you want it.
 <p>
<h4>
Engineering:</h4>
If you've ever upgraded a PC, inserted/removed memory, drives,
cards, or otherwise worked around inside a PC, you've probably
had a few scraped knuckles and had plenty of use for that tool
kit (and wished you had a better one).  Dell has done a lot on
engineering on the OptiPlex line which is not available on the
Dimension line.  You push a button here, a button there, and
everything opens up real nice for convenient working inside the
PC.
 <p>
Bottom line is that you pay for that comfort and security of the
certification process and for the extra engineering that went
into the OptiPlex.
