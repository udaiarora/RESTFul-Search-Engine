        Music that will be included in a recruitment CD for the Herberger College
        School of Music. The Herberger String Quartet is supported, in part,
        by funds from the Katherine K. Herberger Great Communities Endowment.</p>

        Contemporary Chamber Players and the Saint Louis Brass Quintet. He teaches
        each summer at the Banff (Canada) Centre for the Arts and the Korean
        Brass Festival. A noted clinician and author, Hickman has published 15
        music texts and written more than 40 articles and editions of music for
        the trumpet. He has released a dozen solo albums plus more than 20 albums
        as a member of the Saint Louis Brass Quintet, Baroque Consort, Summit

      <p>Caio Pagano is an internationally recognized concert pianist teacher
        and scholar, and an Arizona Regents' Professor of Music at ASU. Prior

        Music. He also created the Centre for Studies in the Arts in Portugal
