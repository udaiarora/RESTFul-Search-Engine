<p style="text-align: right">4</p>

</div>



<div class="slide">

<!-- Slide 5 -->

<h1 class="first">What is an <font color="#FF0000">Education Record</font>?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Any record, with certain exceptions, maintained by an institution that is directly related to a student or students.  This record can contain a student&#8217;s name, or students&#8217; names or information from which an individual student, or students, can be <font color="#FF0000">personally (individually) identified</font></li>

<li>These records include: files, documents, and materials in whatever medium (handwriting, print, tapes, disks, film, microfilm, microfiche) which contain information directly related to students and from which students can be <font color="#FF0000">personally (individually) identified</font>.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right">5</p>

</div>



<div class="slide">

<!-- Slide 9 -->

<h1 class="first">What an Education Record is Not!!</h1>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Sole possession&#8221; notes</li>

<li>Law enforcement unit records</li>

<li>Records maintained exclusively for individuals in the their capacity as employees

<ul>
<li>Records of individuals who are employed as a result of their status as students  (work study)  are education records.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Doctor-patient privilege records</li>

<li>Alumni records</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right">9</p>

</div>



<div class="slide">

<!-- Slide 10 -->

<h1 class="first">&#8220;Sole Possession Notes&#8221;</h1>

<p>Are made by one person as an individual observation or recollection, are kept in the possession of the maker, and are only shared with a temporary substitute.</p>

<ul>
<li>This term has always been narrowly defined.</li>

<li>Notes taken in conjunction with any other person are not  sole possession notes (counselor's notes, interview notes).</li>

<li>Sharing these notes with another person, or placing them  in an area where they can be viewed by others makes them  &#8220;education records&#8221; and subject to ferpa.</li>

<li>Best advice: if you don&#8217;t want it reviewed, don&#8217;t write it down.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right">10</p>

</div>



<div class="slide">

<!-- Slide 11 -->

<h1 class="first">What is an Education Record?  (Summary)</h1>

<p>If you have a record which is:</p>

<li>Not one of the excluded categories of records&#8230;</li>
