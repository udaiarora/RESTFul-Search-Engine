<!-- ASU Public Affairs/Media Relations Crisis Plan -->
			
			<h4 class="bodyleft">Executive Summary</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				The Office of Public Affairs and the Office Media Relations and Public Information 
				play a critical role in any crisis that affects the campuses and operations of Arizona 
				State University.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				As the primary offices responsible for communicating to both campus community and the 
				general public, PA/MR is involved in all levels of crisis communication at the 
				university.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				In addition, the Vice President of Public Affairs is a key part of the university crisis 
				team, providing advice and support to the Office of the President during an emergency.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				While the entire staff of Public Affairs and especially the MR will likely be involved in 
				any major crisis, there are five positions that are critical to successfully 
				communicating with the public during a time of crisis.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				The five positions are
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>the vice president of Public Affairs</li>
				<li>the assistant vice president of Public Affairs,</li> 
				<li>the on-scene coordinator (assistant director, media relations),</li> 
				<li>the media coordinator (designated back up to on-scene coordinator) and</li>
				<li>the office coordinator (assistant director media relations).</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="body">
				This plan is predicated on a team effort from the five people listed above and the media 
				relations staff. During an emergency, any member of the media relations staff may be 
				asked to fill one of the critical positions.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				Consistent with the University Emergency Operations plan, there are three main levels of 
				response and one additional early level of response for the Public Affairs and MEDIA 
				RELATIONS staff that is different from the university-wide plan.  Campus emergency 
				operation will be managed from one of the models depending upon the situation.  At any 
				given time, the selected model of operation can be upgraded or downgraded as needed.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				Levels of response include:  Level 1, decentralized coordination and direction (low level 
				emergencies/crime responses); Level 2, Issues management (The special Public Affairs 
				procedure - Mid to high level message/response issues); Level 3, Centralized Coordination 
				and Decentralized Direction (University wide impact - emergency manager activated); and 
				Level 4, Centralized Coordination and Direction (University wide Major Incident - 
				Emergency Operations Center opened).
			</p>
			
			<h4 class="bodyleft">Introduction</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				The Office of Public Affairs and the Office Media Relations and Public Information play a 
				critical role in any crisis that affects the campuses and operations of Arizona State 
				University.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				As the primary offices responsible for communicating to both campus community and the 
				general public, PA/MR is involved in all levels of crisis communication at the 
				university.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				In addition, the Vice President of Public Affairs is a key part of the university crisis 
				team, providing advice and support to the Office of the President during an emergency.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				This plan is designed to integrate with the university wide emergency operations plan, 
				as required by university policy and by law.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				Specific responsibilities of the offices and the Vice President are listed in the 
				university EOP and include:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Developing a specific and concise operation plan that outlines emergency procedures 
				for all functions under PA/MR control.</li>
				<li>Providing the Emergency Manager with a copy of the operational plan and any 
				subsequent revisions.</li>
				<li>Designating at least two alternates for the position of public information advisor 
				(PIA).  These are the assistant vice president of public affairs and the assistant 
				director of media relations responsible for police coverage, as outlined below.</li>
				<li>Compile university policies and procedures, department manuals, sample media releases 
				and supporting documents that could provide information in an emergency.</li>
				<li>Conduct training exercises with staff.</li>
				<li>Prepare general survival and self-help information news releases.</li>
				<li>Create and maintain a file of hazard specific news release for use during an 
				emergency.</li>
				<li>Coordinate with Human Resources and Student Services departments in developing a 
				plan for deal with inquiries from relatives and friends concerning university personnel 
				utilizing the American Red Cross DWI (Disaster Welfare Information System), as 
				appropriate.</li>
				<li>Develop and implement a training program to ensure that all media relations staff 
				members understand the plant and their responsibilities and assignments.</li>
				<li>Be prepared to respond to emergency training exercises.</li>
				<li>Identify other media/public information issues.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="body">
				The operation of the plan requires that all media relations staff members be familiar 
				with the responsibilities of the office during different levels of emergency.
			</p>
			
			<h4 class="bodyleft">Staffing and Organization</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				While the entire staff of Public Affairs and especially the MR will likely be involved 
				in any major crisis, there are five positions that are critical to successfully 
				communicating with the public during a time of crisis.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				The five positions are
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>the vice president of Public Affairs  (Virgil Renzulli)</li>
				<li>the assistant vice president of Public Affairs, (Nancy Neff)</li>
				<li>the on-scene coordinator (Keith Jennings), </li>
				<li>the media coordinator (In Zajac) and</li>
				<li>the office coordinator (Sarah Auffret).</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="body">
				This plan is predicated on a team effort from the five people listed above and the media 
				relations staff. During an emergency, any member of the media relations staff may be 
				asked to fill one of the critical positions.  The determination of who will assume which 
				role is dependent upon who is available to respond at any given time and is outlined 
				below.
			</p>
			
			<h4 class="bodyleft">Vice President of Public Affairs</h4>
			
			<p class="body">The vice president holds a key position as a member of the university wide 
			Emergency Policy and Organizations Group (EPOG).  The group consists of two subcommittees: 
			the Emergency Policy Group (EPG), which the vice President of Public Affairs belongs to, and 
			the Emergency Operations Group (EOG).</p>

			<p class="body">The EPG is the group that will provide coordination and direction during any 
			emergency at the university and the group reports directly to the president of the university
			or his designee. </p>

			<p class="body">In addition to the Vice President of Public Affairs, the EPG includes the 
			directors of the Department of Public Safety, the University General Council and the 
			Comptroller.</p>

			<p class="body">As part of the EPG, the vice president develops all official public 
			statements, proclamations and resolutions regarding the emergency.  The vice president is 
			also responsible for coordination of all media coverage with the MR staff via the assistant
			vice president.</p>

			<p class="body">If the Vice President of Public Affairs is unavailable or has not yet reached 
			the EOC, the assistant vice president will serve on the EPG.  In the event both the vice 
			president and the assistant vice president are unavailable, the On-scene coordinator will 
			serve on the EPG until the arrival of either individual.</p>

			<h4 class="bodyleft">The Assistant Vice President</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				The assistant vice president is responsible for the overall coordination of the MR team 
				and serves as liaison with the Vice President of Public Affairs and the EPG.  Those 
				responsibilities include:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Sending the On-scene coordinator to the location of an incident, if not already 
				present at the scene and if appropriate.</li>
				<li>Identifying spokespeople for the university as appropriate.  The assistant vice 
				president can act as the spokesperson, designate either the On-scene or Media 
				coordinators as spokespeople or designate others as needed.</li>				
				<li>Coordinate statements and fact sheets with the EPG and MR Staff.</li>				
				<li>Instruct On-scene and Media coordinators on what may or may not be released.</li>				
				<li>Conduct Issues Management sessions as needed.</li>	
				<li>Assign additional responsibilities to MR staff as necessary.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="body">
				In the event the assistant vice president of MR is unavailable or unable to 
				respond, the on-scene coordinator (assistant director) will assume the duties of the 
				assistant vice president until such time as the assistant vice president arrives at the 
				emergency operations center. 
			</p>

 			<p class="body">
				If both the assistant vice president and the on-scene coordinator (assistant 
				director) are unavailable or unable to respond, the media coordinator will assume the 
				duties of the assistant vice president until either the assistant vice president or 
				on-scene coordinator arrives.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				In the event that the assistant vice president, the on-scene and media coordinators are 
				unavailable or unable to respond, the most senior member of the media relations staff 
				available will assume the duties of the assistant vice president until such time as 
				either the assistant vice president or one of the coordinators arrives.
			</p>

			<h4 class="bodyleft">On-Scene Coordinator</h4>

			<p class="body">
				The On-scene coordinator is typically the media relations staff member who is assigned 
				to the ASU Campus Police Beat  (assistant director).
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				The On-scene coordinator will go to the site of an incident to assist with the media.  
				The request for the presence of the On-scene coordinator can come from either ASU Police 
				or the Vice President of Public Affairs or his representative.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				Once present at the incident, the On-scene coordinator should
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Report to the ASU Police Officer who is in charge at the scene and get the details of 
				the situation.</li>
				<li>Determine if the situation requires a higher level of response, and if so, notify the 
				assistant vice president or vice president.</li>
				<li>Identify and make contact with all media present at the scene.</li>
				<li>Give no information to the media except that approved by the officer in charge or by 
				the assistant vice president of MR.  The coordinator may exhibit flexibility to deal with 
				the situation at hand.</li>
				<li>Report as soon as possible to the assistant Vice President of Public Affairs the facts of 
				the situation and the media response.  Notifications should also be made further up the 
				chain of command as necessary.  Dissemination of information is key to the performance of 
				the university during an emergency. The On-scene coordinator may recommend to the Vice 
				President of Public Affairs that the response to the situation be upgraded or downgraded 
				in response levels. </li>
				<li>Maintain contact as needed with the assistant vice president and the vice president 
				as the situation and circumstances change.</li>
				<li>Remain on-scene for the duration of the incident, unless directed by the officer in 
				charge or the assistant vice president to leave the scene.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="body">
				If requested by the officer in charge, the Director of Public Safety, the chief of the 
				ASU Police, the vice president of public affairs or the assistant vice president, the 
				On-scene coordinator will draft a news release for dissemination to the media about the 
				incident and see to the distribution of the release.  
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				In many cases, the release will only be issued if a media outlet inquires about the event 
				or incident.  The release will only be generally distributed when several media outlets 
				inquire and a competitive situation may develop unless the release is issued.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				The On-scene coordinator also will perform any duties necessary, as assigned by the vice 
				president, the assistant vice president or the EPG or EOG.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				The On-scene coordinator serves as back up to the vice president and the assistant vice, 
				and in the event that the vice president or assistant vice president are not available or 
				are unable to respond, and assumes the duties of either the vice president or the 
				assistant vice president for the purposes of this emergency plan, until their arrival.  
				In the event the On-scene coordinator must assume the duties of either the vice president 
				or the assistant vice president, it is the responsibility of the on-scene coordinator to 
				inform the management staff of Public Affairs about the incident and to coordinate 
				activities with members of the management staff of Public Affairs.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				If the designated On-scene coordinator is not available or is unable to respond, his 
				designated back up or the Media Coordinator should assume the duties of the On-scene 
				coordinator.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				In the event that the vice president, the assistant vice president, the on-scene and 
				media coordinators are unavailable or unable to respond, the most senior member of the 
				media relations staff available will assume the duties listed in this document until such 
				time as either the vice president, the assistant vice president or one of the 
				coordinators arrives.
			</p>

			<h4 class="bodyleft">
				Media Coordinator
			</h4>

			<p class="body">
				The Media coordinator is responsible for coordination within the office.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				Responsibilities include:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Maintaining contact with the assistant vice president and the On-scene coordinator.
				</li><li>At the direction of the assistant vice president, notify all print and broadcast 
				media, including wire services.</li>
				<li>Assist in Issues Management sessions if needed.</li>
				<li>Oversee the press room or press area if one is established.  Ensure that a member of 
				the MR staff is present in the area at all times.  Maintain a list of media present and 
				distribute news releases and statements as necessary.</li>
				<li>Help prepare any needed news releases or statements.</li>
				<li>Work with the office coordinator to ensure quick and accurate duplication of news 
				releases and statements.</li>
				<li>Assist the vice president and assistant vice president as needed.</li>
				<li>Coordinate any support needed in the field by the On-scene coordinator.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="body">
				The Media coordinator serves as the second back up to the vice president, the assistant 
				vice president, and in the event that the assistant vice president and the On-scene
				 coordinator are not available or are unable to respond, assumes the duties listed in 
				 this document for the purposes of this emergency plan.  In the event the Media 
				 coordinator must assume the duties of another member of the team, it is the 
				 responsibility of the Media coordinator to coordinate activities with members of the 
				 management staff of Public Affairs.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				The Media Coordinator may also be assigned field duties as necessary and directed by the
				EPG, the vice president of public affairs, the assistant vice president or the On-scene 
				coordinator if help is needed at the scene of the incident.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				If the designated On-scene coordinator is not available or is unable to respond, the 
				Media Coordinator should assume the duties of the On-scene coordinator.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				In the event that media coordinator is unavailable or unable to respond, the most senior 
				member of the media relations staff available will assume the duties of the media 
				coordinator until such time as the coordinator arrives.
			</p>

			<h4 class="bodyleft">Office Coordinator</h4>

			<p class="body">
				The office coordinator is a support position that helps the media coordinator function 
				effectively and provides supervision to the general MR Staff..
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				The office coordinator also assumes the in-house duties of the media coordinator in the 
				event the media coordinator must be deployed to the field for any reason.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				The office coordinator serves as the initial contact point of incoming calls, directing 
				to the appropriate staff member as directed by the media coordinator.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				The office coordinator also helps oversee the preparation, duplication and distribution 
				of news releases and statements as directed by the media coordinator.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				The office coordinator may also be called upon to help staff a media room or area, 
				depending on the situation and at the director of the media coordinator.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Levels of Response</h4>

			<p class="body">
				Consistent with the University Emergency Operations plan, there are three main levels of 
				response and one additional early level of response for the Public Affairs and MR staff 
				that is different from the university-wide plan.  Campus emergency operation will be 
				managed from one of the models depending upon the situation.  At any given time, the 
				selected model of operation can be upgraded or downgraded as needed.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				Levels include:  Level 1, decentralized coordination and direction (low level 
				emergencies/crime responses); Level 2, Issues management (The special Public Affairs 
				procedure (Mid to high level message/response issues); Level 3, Centralized Coordination 
				and Decentralized Direction (University wide impact); and Level 4, Centralized 
				Coordination and Direction (University Wide Major Incident).
			</p>
			
			<h4 class="bodyleft">Level 1 - Decentralized Coordination and Direction (University Wide)</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				This is the first level of response and the most common activation of the plan. 
				Under this model, routine emergency procedures, resource and response will be 
				coordinated through the ASU Police Department Dispatch Center.  Examples of Level 1 
				emergencies include, but are not limited to:		
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Structure fires</li>
				<li>Minor civil disturbances or demonstrations</li>
				<li>Major traffic accidents either on campus or involving university vehicles and/or 
				student/faculty groups.</li>
				<li>Hazardous materials incidents</li>
				<li>Major crimes against the university or university community members</li>
				<li>Any police or safety related event which may attract attention from local media</li>
			</ul>
		
			<p class="body">
				These types of events will typically only involve the On-scene coordinator, who works in 
				consultation with the vice president and assistant vice president as appropriate.  
				Mobilization of staff is not usually required at this level.  The On-scene coordinator 
				is responsible for evaluating the situation and recommending if additional response 
				levels are needed, particularly Level 2.
			</p>
			
			<h4 class="bodyleft">Level 2 - Issues Management (Public Affairs Procedure)</h4>

			<p class="body">
				This type of situation requires coordination of message beyond the Public Affairs and  
				staff levels, typically involving other vice presidential level offices.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				An issues management meeting should be held to coordinate response to the situation, 
				involving staff from other offices as needed.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				Examples would include:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Faculty/Staff Misconduct/Arrest/Indictment</li>
				<li>Issues involving university policy or political stands</li>
				<li>Major structure fires involving evacuations, or relocations </li>
				<li>Closure of campus or campus areas.</li>
				<li>Other issues as deemed necessary.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="body">
				The issues management committee will designate an appropriate spokesman to answer media 
				inquiries about the situation.  All media calls should be routed to this designated
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				These types of events will typically only involve the On-scene coordinator, who works in 
				consultation with the vice president and assistant vice president as appropriate and 
				other university staff needed to deal with the situation at the issues management meeting.
				General mobilization of staff is not usually required at this level.
			</p>

			<h4>Level 3 - Centralized Coordination and Decentralized Direction (University Wide)</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				This second university level of response is outlined in the emergency plan and will 
				require major involvement from several campus departments.  The Emergency Manager (EM) 
				will coordinate emergency activity, and may or may not activate the Emergency Operations 
				Center (EOC).  If the EOC is opened, the EM may only summon those members directly 
				affected by the activation.  Examples of level 2 emergencies include, but are not limited 
				to:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Multi-structure fire(s)</li>
				<li>Fires with casualties</li>
				<li>Major hazardous materials incidents</li>
				<li>Severe storm warning or damage</li>
				<li>Major civil disturbances or demonstrations</li>
				<li>Flood damage or warning of imminent minor flooding</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="body">
				This level of response requires some mobilization of MR staff.  The Vice President of 
				Public Affairs typically will be called either to the EOC or may work from the office.  
				The On-Scene coordinator will likely be working in the field, but may also be in the 
				office, depending on the situation.  The Media and Office coordinators should be in the 
				office and ready to respond.  Other staff should be called in as needed.
			</p>

			<h4 class="bodyleft">Level 4 - Centralized Coordination and Direction (University Wide Major Incident)</h4>

			<p class="body">
				This is the highest level of response and indicates a major disaster has occurred or is 
				imminent, and is beyond the capability of the campus to effectively function in either 
				of the first two levels.  The EOC will be activated and coordinated by the EM.  All EPOG 
				members will be summoned to the EOC.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				This level of response requires full mobilization of the MR staff.  The Vice President 
				of Public Affairs will report as soon as possible to the EOC. The Assistant Vice 
				President of Public Affairs will respond to the MR or the EOC as appropriate. The 
				On-scene coordinator will either report to the EOC or the location of the incident, 
				whichever is most appropriate to the situation.  The Media and Office Coordinators 
				should report as soon as possible to the Media Relations Office as should all members of 
				the MR staff.  It may also be necessary to draw upon staff from the Office of Public 
				Relations and the Office of Institutional Advancement.
