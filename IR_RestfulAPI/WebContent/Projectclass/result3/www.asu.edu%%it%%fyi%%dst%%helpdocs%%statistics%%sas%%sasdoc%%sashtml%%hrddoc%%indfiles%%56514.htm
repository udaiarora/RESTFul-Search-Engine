Even advanced SAS users can learn from the numerous tips and techniques    presented in this complete guide to producing tables from SAS data using
the TABULATE procedure, although the step-by-step tutorial approach that   the book uses is designed primarily for beginning and intermediate SAS
users. More than 300 examples showing code and output start with the       basics of table production and build to customized, complex formats.
Using this authoritative reference, you can also learn how to generate     tables using macros, how to create tables using SAS/ASSIST software, and
how to export PROC TABULATE output to other applications.
