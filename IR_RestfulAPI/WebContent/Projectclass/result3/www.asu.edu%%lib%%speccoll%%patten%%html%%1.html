<br>and <b><font size=+2>Thomas Mawe</font></b>
<p><i><font size=+1>Every Man His Own Gardener: Being a New and Much More
Complete Gardener's Calendar and General Directory Than Any One Hitherto
Published. . .</font></i>
<p>The seventeenth edition, corrected and greatly enlarged, with many considerable
new additions. London: Printed for J. Johnson [and 14 others]: Printed
by Mssrs. Bye and Law. . . J Bryar . . . and T. Davison, 1803. Includes
index.
<p>First printed in 1767, this popular gardening book went through more
than 25 editions. Thomas Mawe, then gardener to the Duke of Leeds, was
originally listed as the author of this book by the real author, Abercrombie,
who hoped Mawe's name would boost sales, which it did. Abercrombie, at
the time, was in the seed and nursery business. He went on to be gardener
at Kew.
<p>This work consists of a very detailed, month by month description of
all activities necessary for the maintenance of a garden. It also includes
an alphabetical listing of kitchen-garden plants, fruit trees, ornamental
shrubs, and perennials and biennial flower plants. The author provides
very practical approaches to the various problems associated with the maintenance
of a garden, including such advice as how to preserve the cherries from
the birds.
