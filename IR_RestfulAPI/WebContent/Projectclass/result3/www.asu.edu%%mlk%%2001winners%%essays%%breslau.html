His bones are composed of courage.  Compassion is the shine in his eyes.   A smile hides on his face waiting to be discovered.  It doesn't hide for long.  He uses his hands to give and help<p>
My Grandpa Sam was born in 1913 in Russia. When he was an infant, his family immigrated to America.  Sam came from humble beginnings, but he knew he was going to make a good life.  Not a second was to be wasted.  There were tasks to accomplish and goals to achieve.<p>
Sam began his adult life as a farmer, quickly falling in love with his work. Later, he started the career of selling insurance, but his compassion for farming didn't fade, it just grew. Sam also planned gardens for his neighbors.  When harvest season came, he harvested the gardens and donated the produce to food banks. This was the beginning of his charity work.<p>
A heart attack forced Sam to retire from insurance work at age 62.  But a heart attack never stopped my grandpa. He devoted his time to charity after he recovered. Dedicating time towards Meals on Wheels, an organization that brings meals to homebound people, was one of the acts of charity he performed. Though he was already well into his seventies, Sam took seniors grocery shopping.<p>
My grandpa has showed me that kindness has no limit.  He touched many lives. Although he only changed a small portion of the world, every act of kindness counts.
