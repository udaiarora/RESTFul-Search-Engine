            <p> There are a number of ways you can still get access to our online employment site: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>One of the PCs located in the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/hr/">Human Resources Department's</a> main Lobby (located in the USB University Services Building) at 1551 S.

  How does the online application process work?</strong></p>
            <p> Applicants may complete a general application and apply it to specific positions at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/hr/jobs">www.asu.edu/hr/jobs.com</a> from any computer with Internet access. All applications to open positions will be screened by the hiring supervisor. Those applicants who are to be interviewed will be contacted. Applicants may check the progress of their application to positions at any time by logging back on to their account and viewing the Status message under &quot;Recent Positions Applied To&quot;. </p>

  What are the advantages of using the online employment site?</strong></p>
            <p> There are a number of advantages to using the new online employment site. Some of these include: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The ability to save your application form online for re-use on future job openings </li>
              <li>The ability to update your online application with specific skills and experience related to the posting </li>
              <li>The ability to access and review the job requirements while completing the application </li>
              <li>The ability to submit your application immediately and directly to the hiring department, minimizing the risk of missing a deadline or loss of the application </li>
              <li>The online application saves time when you want to apply for multiple jobs at one time, or apply for several positions throughout the year </li>
              <li>The ability to keep track of the status of your application and the recruitment process </li>
              <li>The ability to learn about job openings and apply for positions at any time and from any computer with access to the web </li>
            </ul>
            <p><a name="15"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  Who will see my application if I use the online employment site?</strong></p>
            <p> Your application is on a secure web server and will be available to the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/hr">Human Resources Department</a> and the interviewer(s) for the specific job opening for which you apply. Arizona State University does not share its database with other companies or localities. </p>
            <p><strong> Creating an Application</strong></p>
            <p><a name="21"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  Where can I complete an application?</strong></p>
            <p> Applications are accepted via our <a href="https://www.jobsatasu.com">online employment site</a>. Completed applications may be applied for any of the open positions listed on the Search Positions page--simply click on &quot;apply for this position,&quot; attach a cover letter/resume (optional), and answer any Position Specific Questions (if applicable). </p>
            <p><a name="22"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  Can someone help me complete the online application?</strong></p>
            <p> HR staff members are available to help applicants get started and to answer questions. <a href="mailto:askhr@asu.edu">E-mail</a> the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/hr">Human Resources Department</a> or call (480) 965-2701. </p>
            <p><a name="23"></a><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  How long does it take to complete the online application?</strong></p>
            <p> The time it takes depends on several factors including the amount of work experience and education you have to enter, how fast you can type, etc. You should <strong>allow 20-30 minutes</strong> for the total process. However, you can speed up the process by collecting important information about previous work experience, education, certifications, etc. before you start creating your application. If you find you are missing a piece of information requested on the application, you may be able to skip the field and go back later to complete it. If you decide to do this, it is important that you return and complete the missing information <strong>BEFORE</strong> you apply for a specific job opening. The information on your application form when you apply will be used to evaluate your qualifications for the job opening for which you apply--make sure it is accurate and contains all information requested. </p>
            <p><a name="24"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  Can I save my application before I finish completing it?</strong></p>
            <p> You must click the &quot;SAVE APPLICATION&quot; button on the final page of the application to save the information you have entered. If you exit the online employment site, close your Internet browser, or lose your Internet connection <strong>before</strong> clicking &quot;SAVE APPLICATION,&quot; your data <strong>will not be saved</strong> and you will have to start over. If you cannot finish the entire application in one session, you may find it helpful to complete just the required fields (indicated by a red asterisk) and proceed to &quot;SAVE APPLICATION&quot;. You are then able to log back in at any time to complete and/or edit the application. </p>
            <p> Please note that your online session will time out after 60 minutes of inactivity. To be active, you must be communicating with the web server (clicking buttons, tabs, etc.). Typing on a page is NOT a communicating activity. If your session times out, your information will be lost if you have not saved it. </p>
            <p><a name="25"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  Will I be able to attach my resume or cover letter?</strong></p>
            <p> Yes. After completing the online application and selecting the position for which you would like to apply, you will come to an &quot;Attach Document(s)&quot; screen that includes directions prompting you to do one of two things: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Attach resume, cover letter and references </li>
              <li>Copy and paste or type in resume, cover letter and references </li>
            </ol>
            <p><a name="26"></a><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  Do I have to fill out the &quot;Work Experience&quot;, &quot;Education&quot; and &quot;Reference&quot; pages if I plan on attaching my resume at the end of the process?</strong></p>
            <p> No. None of these 3 pages are &quot;required&quot;. Only the fields which are marked with a red asterisk throughout the online application are &quot;required&quot; fields. You can always type &quot;see resume&quot; in the first field on any of those pages. It might, however, benefit you to fill out these pages completely, as some Hiring Supervisors may initially screen through their candidates based on a review of applications alone. </p>
            <p><a name="27"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  When/how can I make changes to my application?</strong></p>
            <p> Changes can be made to your general application at any time. However, once you submit an application for a particular position, you cannot go back and make changes to the submitted application. Any changes you do make to your application will be included for any new position for which you apply. If you update your application with the intention that the edits you make update a position for which you have already applied - you must then contact the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/hr">Human Resources Department</a>: (480) 965-2701 in order for those changes to be applied. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Using the <a href="https://www.jobsatasu.com">online employment site</a>, login using your username and password </li>
              <li>Looking at the menu bar on the left side of the computer screen, click on &quot;Manage Application(s)&quot; and then choose the application you wish to edit </li>
              <li>Make the desired changes to your application and save. Your original application is replaced with the new version. </li>
              <li>The next time you apply for a position, your revised application will be submitted. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> Note</strong> : If you find that you do need to make a correction or provide additional information after you have submitted your application for a job opening, you should contact the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/hr/">Human Resources Department</a>: (480) 965-2701. </p>
            <p><a name="28"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  Why would I have to make changes to my application?</strong></p>
            <p> Any time your contact information changes (address, phone number, email address, etc.), you will need to edit your application to reflect the change. Another reason that you may wish to edit your application is if you have acquired additional skills, experience and education since you created your original application. </p>

            <p><strong> Applying For an Open Position</strong></p>
            <p><a name="31"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  How do I apply for a job?</strong></p>
            <p> The application process has three steps: </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Creating a login user name and password</strong>. Be sure to remember these or make note of them as they will enable you to come back and access your application, to make changes or apply for additional positions, and to check on the status of a position. </li>
              <li><strong>Creating your online application</strong> - this can be done at any time. You may also search open positions before creating the online application. </li>
              <li>Applying your online application to a <strong>specific job</strong> opening prior to the closing date (if applicable). </li>
            </ol>
            <p> Throughout the process, <strong>it's important that you read and follow all instructions carefully.</strong></p>
            <p><a name="32"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  Do I need to apply online if I am only interested in temporary positions?</strong></p>
            <p> Yes, applicants must apply online for temporary positions. Temporary positions are listed on the <a href="https://www.jobsatasu.com">online employment site</a>. </p>
            <p><a name="33"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  How soon will I hear something?</strong></p>
            <p> For some positions, you will be prompted to answer specific job-related questions. Based upon your answers to these questions, you will receive an immediate response letting you know if your application is being referred to the hiring department for evaluation. Hiring departments will contact applicants they wish to interview. </p>
            <p><a name="34"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  Can I apply for more than one job at a time?</strong></p>
            <p> Yes. Once you have completed your application you may apply to any open position(s). Logging back on to the <a href="https://www.jobsatasu.com">online employment site</a> will allow you to access your application and update and/or submit it for other job openings. </p>
            <p><a name="35"></a><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  Can I attach a resume or cover letter?</strong></p>
            <p> Yes. You may attach a resume and cover letter as you apply for each position. Electronic documents (must be Word or PDF format) can be attached. After completing the online application and selecting the position for which you would like to apply, you will come to an &quot;Attach Document(s)&quot; screen that includes directions prompting you to do one of two things: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Attach resume, cover letter and references </li>
              <li>Copy and paste or type in resume, cover letter and references </li>
            </ol>
            <p><a name="36"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  What if I don't have my document attachments in an electronic format? What do I do?</strong></p>
            <p> We understand that you may NOT have all of your documents available in an electronic format. After having applied for a position, you may either hand deliver or send the documents via mail to the attention of the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/hr">Office of Human Resources</a>. Please be sure that your name, the Position Title, and Position # you would like the documents applied to are clearly printed on the document. <strong>NOTE</strong>: All submitted materials will become the property of the <a href="http://www.asu.edu">Arizona State University</a> , and will not be returned to the applicant. </p>
            <p><a name="37"></a><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  How long is my application valid?</strong></p>
            <p> If you do not apply for any open positions for one full year, you will have to re-enter your application before you can apply again. You will be able to make changes to your saved application prior to applying for a specific job opening. </p>
            <p><a name="38"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  How Do I Print My Application?</strong></p>
            <p> Before submitting your application, you will have the option to view it. When your application opens in a new browser window, using the tool bar at the top of your computer screen, click on <strong>File</strong><strong>|</strong><strong>Print</strong> and follow the prompts on the screen to print your application. </p>
            <p><a name="39"></a><strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>

  Can I apply by sending my resume via e-mail?</strong></p>
            <p> For jobs that require applicants to apply electronically, applications should be completed using the <a href="https://www.jobsatasu.com">online employment site</a>. Paper applications will not be accepted by fax, e-mail or postal mail. If you do not have the ability to &quot;attach&quot; a resume or cover letter to a position you apply for online, you may contact <a href="http://www.asu.edu/hr">Human Resources</a> at: (480) 965-2701 and they can &quot;attach&quot; those documents to that position for you. </p>
            <p><a name="3+10"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  How can I check the status of my application?</strong></p>
            <p> Using the online employment site, you can login using your user name and password. Looking at the left side menu bar, click on &quot;Positions for Which I Have Applied.&quot; You will see one of two status notes next to each position for which you applied: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>In Process - Position is still open and based on your skills/qualifications, you may or may not be contacted for an interview; </li>
              <li>No Longer Under Consideration - You are not being hired for the position - position may still be open but you didn't meet the minimum qualifications; another candidate may have been hired; etc. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><a name="3+11"></a><strong><a href="#top">top</a><br>
  I liked the old way better, why did you change to the online system?</strong></p>
            <p> The benefits of the online process to applicants, hiring departments and <a href="http://www.asu.edu/hr">ASU Human Resources</a> far outweigh the advantages of staying with our manual application process. </p>
            <p> The online system provides more information to applicants, including the status of the position(s) for which they have applied, daily updates to job postings and the ability to update their application online. The system can be accessed 24-hours-a day, 7-days-a-week from any Internet connection. Applicants can do a search for openings based on department, title, or category and can track the hiring process. </p>
            <p> The online process reduces the process time from when a job is listed to when applications are received thus reducing the time it takes to fill a position. It also reduces the redundant work of processing, printing, copying and distributing paper applications/resumes. It provides more consistent applicant tracking information and the ability to search and utilize applications on file. </p>
