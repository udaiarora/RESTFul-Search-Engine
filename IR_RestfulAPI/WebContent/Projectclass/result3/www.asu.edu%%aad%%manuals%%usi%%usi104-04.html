When students experience sexual assault and relationship violence, their sense of safety and trust is violated. This can significantly interfere with their lives, including their educational goals. Developed in consultation with various university departments, this policy has been created in a proactive posture in the hope of creating a campus environment in which incidents of sexual assault and relationship violence can be effectively responded to without further victimization.<p><img src="usihr.gif" width=100% height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Policy</b></font></center><img src="usihr.gif" width=100% height="2"><p>ASU is committed to providing assistance to students harmed by sexual or relationship violence and does so through a variety of services. Students are sometimes reluctant to access these services and may need additional support in following up on a referral. Staff may consider making a call on a student&#146;s behalf or escorting him or her to a particular office to help smooth the transition. A student does not, to the extent permitted by law, have to commit to taking any kind of action, but should be advised that the university may need to independently investigate situations that may pose a risk to the university community. The decisions of the student harmed as to whether to seek assistance, and from whom, should always be respected.<p>The following procedure has been developed to guide the actions of those providing assistance and support to students harmed by sexual assault and relationship violence.<p><img src="usihr.gif" width=100% height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Procedure</b></font></center><img src="usihr.gif" width=100% height="2"><p>To assist a student victim harmed by sexual assault and/or relationship violence:<p><ol><li>Make certain that the student and others are safe. If the assailant is an immediate threat to the student or others, call 911.</li><p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>The staff of the ASU Home Safe Violence Prevention and Advocacy Center on the Tempe campus are available to talk with student victims to explain options for reporting, medical, counseling, advocacy, and legal assistance. The Home Safe Helpline is available 24 hours a day at 480/727&#150;HOME, and walk-ins are assisted during business hours (call 480/965&#150;4721 for more information).</td></tr></table><p><li>Encourage the student reporting party to contact ASU police (if the incident occurred on campus) or the local police (if the incident occurred off-campus). This can be done by calling 911. The student reporting party can be interviewed by the police without having to file a complaint. If the student reporting party is interviewed soon after the incident and decides at some later point to file a complaint, the police already will have much of the information they need to investigate the case. The student reporting party should be made aware that a police report is a matter of public record. <p>As part of the police investigation, the student may be offered a forensic examination (including a pelvic and/or rectal examination) to collect evidence for the police report. The forensic examination is performed at a specialty center in the Phoenix area, must be requested by the police, and becomes a part of the police report. The best results from a forensic examination are collected within 120 hours of the assault. Hospitals do not perform forensic examinations but can treat the student&#146;s injuries and contact the police if the student wishes.</li><p><li>Encourage the student to seek medical attention to assess and treat injuries. If pregnancy is possible, the student can obtain medical advice and a prescription to prevent pregnancy.  A follow-up medical examination should be performed four to six weeks after the assault. This examination should include testing for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. A second examination may be recommended. The student can obtain medical care at Campus Health Service.</li><p><li>Encourage the student to seek psychological support. Seeking psychological support soon after the trauma can help modulate the emotional aftermath, but it is never too late to talk with a counselor. Assure the student that speaking with a counselor is confidential. For assistance during the day (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.), contact Counseling and Consultation (C&#038;C), 480/965&#150;6146, at the Tempe campus; Career and Personal Counseling, 602/543&#150;8214, at the West campus; Student Counseling Services, 480/727&#150;1255, at the Polytechnic campus; or EMPACT, 480/921&#150;1006, at the Downtown Phoenix campus. For assistance after hours, off-campus students should call EMPACT, 480/921&#150;1006. The university contracts with EMPACT to provide after-hours services to off-campus students. Residence hall students should contact their resident assistant or hall director.</li><p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>If the assailant is an ASU student and the incident occurred on campus, the student victim may want to contact Student Judicial Affairs at the Tempe and West campuses, the Dean of Students Office at the Polytechnic campus, or the Office of Rights and Responsibilities at the Downtown Phoenix campus, 602/496&#150;4111. These offices adjudicate student conduct complaints. The student, or someone on the student&#146;s behalf, may file a student conduct complaint without having to file a police report.<P>Student reporting parties are encouraged to report incidents that occur on the ASU Downtown Phoenix campus to the Phoenix Police Department.</td></tr></table><p><li>Encourage the student to contact the Office of the Dean of Students (at the ASU Downtown Phoenix campus, students may contact the Department of Student and Campus Community Development). This office&#146;s staff provides assistance regarding absence letters, attendance/enrollment options, and information and referrals to campus and community resources.</li></ol><p>For related information, see the <a href="emergencyprocs.html">emergency procedures</a> posted on the ASU Department of Public Safety&#146;s Web site.<p><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">USI</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | USI&#160;manual&#160;<a href="usi001.html">contact</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
