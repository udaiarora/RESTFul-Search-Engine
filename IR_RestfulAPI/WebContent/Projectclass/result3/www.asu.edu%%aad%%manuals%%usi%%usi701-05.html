It is the responsibility of the DRC to determine student eligibility for accommodations, to recommend reasonable and appropriate accommodations for each class, and to facilitate approved accommodations in consultation with the student and faculty. It is the responsibility of faculty to determine the course standards and to design appropriate methods to measure student knowledge. It is the responsibility of the student to request accommodations in a timely manner, to ensure that DRC official testing forms are delivered to or received by faculty and inform them that certain individual accommodations may be necessary, and to communicate any changes to the DRC.<p>Students must provide required disability documentation to the Disability Resource Center (DRC) clearly supporting the need for testing accommodations. The assigned DRC disability access consultant will evaluate the documentation, determine eligibility for testing accommodations and meet with students on an individual basis to discuss reasonable and appropriate options.  The DRC arranges and implements testing accommodations for qualified students with disabilities, which may include:<p><ol><li>extended testing time<p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>The purpose of accommodation is equal access, not advantage. In making recommendations for extended testing time, the DRC disability access consultants consider both student need for a reasonable time extension and fairness to the other students in the class. For this reason, untimed testing is not considered a reasonable accommodation.</td></tr></table></li><p><li>use of a qualified reader, scribe, adapted equipment, interpreter, or alternative print format</li><p><li>a test instrument restructured by the faculty member<p>and</li><p><li>a quiet or private room.</li></ol><p>The DRC uses official forms to authorize testing, contact faculty, and confirm testing arrangements.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Test Administration Responsibility</b></font><p>Instructors may choose to administer their own tests, quizzes, and exams. They should consult with the DRC office on their campus regarding appropriate accommodations and test administration procedures.<p>The DRC administers academic examinations requiring private rooms, alternative print format, readers, interpreters, scribes, or adapted equipment. However, the DRC may not be able to provide scribes or readers in some technical fields (e.g., some foreign language, mathematics, science, and computer courses). Consequently, faculty may need to provide qualified personnel (e.g., graduate assistant, TA, or otherwise qualified student) to administer these examinations at the DRC or another approved site.<p>See the <a href="drs.html">DRC</a> Web site for detailed information and procedures for accessing services and accommodations available for qualified students at specific ASU campuses and sites.<p><img src="usihr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="usihr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>See also:<p><ol><li><a href="usi701-02.html">USI 701&#150;02</a>, &#147;Eligibility for Accommodations&#151;Required Disability Documentation&#148;</li><p><li><a href="usi701-07.html">USI 701&#150;07</a>, &#147;Alternative Format Services&#148;</li><p><li><a href="usi701-08.html">USI 701&#150;08</a>, &#147;Interpreter Services for Students Who are Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing&#148;<p>and</li><p><li><a href="usi701-12.html">USI 701&#150;12</a>, &#147;Laboratory Accommodations for Students with Disabilities.&#148;</li></ol><p><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">USI</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | USI&#160;manual&#160;<a href="usi001.html">contact</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
