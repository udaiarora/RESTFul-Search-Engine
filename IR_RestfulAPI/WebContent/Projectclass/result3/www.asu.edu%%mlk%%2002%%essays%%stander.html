      <p>
      What is a role model?  And can it be defined?<br>
      Is it one who goes beyond?  Who donates all their time?<br>
      Is it one who gives up money solely to do good deeds?<br>
      Is it one who sets a goal, only so they can exceed?
      <p>
      Do they help needy and poor?  Do they help the weak?<br>
      If so, what is their purpose?  What is it that they seek?<br>
      These questions may remain unanswered, standing an unbroken wall,<br>
      But if I had to choose a role model, it would be my father, Paul.
      <p>
      With short, tousled brown hair, and eyes of hazel-green,<br>
      He works with full contentment; concentrated and serene.<br>
      The most selfless, altruistic, warm-hearted man you'll find,<br>
      In my eye, he's the epitome of what is good and kind.
      <p>
      He wakes early every morning, regardless of his mood,<br>
      Regardless of his driving urge to just push on the "Snooze,"<br>
      Regardless of his condition, illness does not apply,<br>
      Weather does not matter, nothing can stop this guy.
      <p>
      Because after a day of seeing patients galore,<br>
      He goes to a care center for the elderly and poor.<br>
      He cares for these sick people, then comes home late at night,<br>
      And for this he receives nothing, but knowing that it's right.
      <p>
      He has done this job and this service for quite a few years now,<br>
      Even during the years when our spirits were down<br>
      Because we learned he had a tumor in his brain right by his ear,<br>
      That was endangering his life and ability to hear.
      <p>
      This scare was overcome, the tumor was benign,<br>
      But even during that event, he still donated time.<br>
      And although right now the tumor hasn't completely gone away,<br>
      He refuses to let it affect how he spends each of his days.
      <p>
      He is noble and is kind to an immeasurable degree,<br>
      As a person and father he always amazes me.<br>
      So while he may take different risks than famous others took,<br>
      He will forever be a role model in my history book.
