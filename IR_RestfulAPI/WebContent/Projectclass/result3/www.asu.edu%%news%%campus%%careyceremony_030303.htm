      <h2>Campus honors Carey during naming ceremony</h2>
      <p>        <img src="campus_images/carey_sign_022803.jpg" width="288" height="187" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">The W. P. Carey School of Business embarked on its renewed drive for
          excellence during a historic dedication ceremony Feb. 26 that drew
        more than 700 guests to honor benefactor Wm. Polk Carey.</p>
      <p>Sheltered from
            the wind under a tent on the Student Services lawn, ASU President
        Michael Crow and W. P. Carey School Dean Larry Penley talked
          about their expanded visions for the university and the school in the
          context of Carey's $50 million gift from the W. P. Carey Foundation.
          The gift is the largest single gift in the history of ASU. At the close
          of the ceremony, Crow, Penley and Carey unveiled the new school logo.</p>
      <p>"We
        have been incubating a good business school here in the last few years,
        and we are now moving forward with Mr. Carey's support to build
        a great business school," said Crow. "It's a process - not just to replicate
        the business schools on the east and west coast, but to embrace the values
        and creativity that William Polk Carey and W. P. Carey &amp; Co. represent.
        This is an exciting day - it is the beginning of the process."</p>
      <p>Crow also
          made special note that the school's students, faculty and staff all
        played an important role in getting the school to this point.</p>
      <p>Penley
          said Carey's gift affirms the hard work that has taken the school to
          its current level, and will enable the school to increase further
          its rate of improvement.</p>
      <p>"To William Polk Carey I offer you what I will
          not live to hear: thank you, from our children, our grandchildren and
          our great grandchildren,
            for all you gave in your generosity to higher education and especially
            to ASU." </p>
      <p>Carey is chairman of W. P. Carey &amp; Co. LLC (NYSE: WPC),
        a New York City-based investment firm. He is also the grandson of John
        Samuel Armstrong,
        who, 118 years ago on Feb. 26 filed the legislation that created the
        school that became ASU. His gift continues a personal and family tradition
        of supporting higher education that has benefited schools such as Johns
        Hopkins University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Princeton University
        as well as ASU's colleges of Law and Business. </p>
      <p>Carey recalled a close
          association with the university that began 30 years ago with the dedication
          of Armstrong Hall at the College of Law
          in honor of his grandfather - John Samuel Armstrong. He said he hopes
          ASU will adopt the motto of his company - doing good while doing well.</p>
      <p>"It's
          very possible to be the kind of business person who leaves the world
          a better place," he said. </p>
      <p>The W. P. Carey School is well positioned
          to produce that kind of graduate, he added. </p>
      <p>"We are blessed with a superb faculty," said Carey. "The school
          will become a source of economic growth, success and prosperity for
        Arizona."</p>
      <p>Crow underscored the importance of building an excellent business
          school to the success of both the university and the state. </p>
      <p>"Metropolitan Phoenix
          is the seed for the great city it could become, and part of the genetic
          code of a great city is a great business school,"
          Crow said. "Bill Carey is the kind of person I am certain was standing
          at the table when this country was being formed, asking what he could
          do to make it happen. With this gift, in this place, in this undone
        city, we are making history."</p>
      <p>During the ceremony, speakers were announced by
          representatives of the various components of the W. P. Carey community:
          Rodel Scholar and honors
          student Elizabeth Edwards; Professor Beth Walker, the State Farm Distinguished
          Scholar; and Andrew Stefl, president of the W. P. Carey Staff Development
        Group.</p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/carey2_022803.jpg" width="216" height="332" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">Athletic Director Eugene Smith presented an autographed ASU football
          helmet to a smiling Carey. Crow offered a bowl carved from an ironwood
          tree grown in Tempe, and Dean Penley presented a crystal sculpture
        engraved with the date of the renaming.</p>
