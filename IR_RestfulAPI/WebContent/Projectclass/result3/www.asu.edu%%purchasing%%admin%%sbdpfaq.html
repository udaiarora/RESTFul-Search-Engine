												<i>What is the Small Business &amp;&nbsp;Diversity Program?</i>
												<p>The Small Business &amp;&nbsp;Diversity Program encourages the participation of small, disadvantaged businesses in the University&#146;s procurement practices. The program provides small disadvantaged businesses with a fair opportunity to compete with large and national businesses to be service and product suppliers to the University.</p>
												<p>The Small Business &amp;&nbsp;Diversity Program informs the University community of the needs and capability of the small, disadvantaged business community. It provides opportunities for education and business skills development to the small, disadvantaged business entrepreneurs in our community. </p>
														<p><i>What businesses qualify as small or disadvantaged?</i></p>
														<p>A <i>small business</i> (Arizona definition, ARS 41-1001.8), including its affiliates, is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in its field, employs fewer than 100 full-time employees, or has grossed less than $4 million in its last fiscal year.</p>
														<p>A <i>small business</i> (Federal definition, PL 95-507) is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in its field, and employs fewer than 500 full-time employees.</p>
														<p>A <i>disadvantaged business</i> may be women-owned or minority-owned. A women-owned business qualifies if it is at least 51% owned by a woman or women, and whose management and daily operations are controlled by a woman or women.</p>
														<p>A <i>minority business </i>qualifies if it is at least 51% owned by a minority group including Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and Asian-Pacific Americans.</p>
														<p><i>Why is it important to support small and disadvantaged businesses?</i></p>
														<p>It is important because ASU, as a Research I university, receives certain grant funds which require that small, disadvantaged businesses be given the opportunity to participate in providing goods and services to the University. </p>
														<p><i>How does this program add value?</i></p>
														<p>The Small Business &amp;&nbsp;Diversity Program contributes to the community by providing the opportunity for adding sales dollars to local businesses, and by assisting to develop a diversified economic base within the community. </p>
														<p></p>
														<p><i>How can the University community participate in the Small Business Program?</i></p>
												<p>The Program includes annual University goals for purchasing from small businesses. The University community is encouraged to seek assistance from buyers in Purchasing to purchase from small, minority, and women-owned businesses. The Small Business &amp;&nbsp;Diversity Program Coordinator can provide further information about the program and businesses listed with ASU.
