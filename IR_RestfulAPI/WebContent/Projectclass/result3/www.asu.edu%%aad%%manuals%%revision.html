Revisions are posted by AAD on the Web only on the dates shown in the preceding table.<p><b>Posting of revisions submitted late may be delayed</b><p>Revisions submitted after the deadline will be processed in the next revision period, unless work on all previously submitted revisions is complete and sufficient time remains to complete the publication procedure for an earlier posting.  For example, if posted policy &#147;A&#148; is submitted for revision on March 20, it normally would be posted on November 1.  If, however, all work on policies submitted for revision by March 8 is completed early, the revised policy &#147;A&#148; might be posted on July 1.<p><b>Delays sometimes occur with revisions submitted on time</b><p>Manual revisions submitted on time will be posted to the manual Web site according to schedule, although delays may occur on occasion. Common causes of delays include failing to return the review draft to AAD by its due date or making extensive changes to the review draft in a constricted time frame.<p><b>Manual coordinators should request revisions in timely fashion</b><p>The manual coordinator should notify department heads and other persons responsible for maintaining or revising policies no later than two months before each deadline. However, whenever a change in policy is foreseen, the manual coordinator is well advised to request the responsible departmental designee to begin writing the revision as soon as possible, so that departmental review and rewrites can occur before the submission deadline.</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><font face="VERDANA, HELVETICA, ARIAL" size=+1><b><a name="Procedure for Updating Manuals outside the Revision Cycle">Procedure for Updating Manuals outside the Revision Cycle</a></b></font> - <a href="#Top"><font size="-1">Back to top</font></a></td></tr><p><tr><td>In order to address those instances when it will be absolutely necessary to post new or changed policies and procedures or to delete policies and procedures outside the review cycle, the following policy and procedure has been approved by the senior vice president and provost.  It is intended for those issues that are of a magnitude that necessitate posting as soon as possible.  The vice president or vice provost responsible for the manual in which the change will occur will make the exception based on the following criteria:<p><b>Criteria</b><p><ol><li>The new or revised information has such an immediate and significant impact on university employees or students that it must be communicated in the manual as soon as possible.  If this revised information does not appear in the manual before normal submission would result in its publication, individuals or the university will be disadvantaged.</li><p><li>Absence of the new or revised policies or procedures will result in legal liabilities for the university, the employees, or the students.</li><p><li>The new or revised policies and procedures result from state or federal legislation, Board of Regents&#146; policy changes, or legal interpretation that has a direct and immediate impact on employees or students.</li><p><li>If a question arises concerning whether a change meets the above criteria, the determination will be made by the Office of General Counsel in consultation with the vice president/vice provost responsible for the affected manual.</li></ol><p><b>Process</b><p>The vice president or vice provost with authority for the manual in which the update is to be posted determines whether the policy change meets the above criteria.  If so, the manual owner must forward a hard copy of the policy text with changes indicated in red (including attachments if necessary) to the appropriate editor of manuals in Academic and Administrative Documents (AAD).  The manual owner must also send with the hard copy an electronic file in HTML format for interim posting on the official manual Web site.  The file will replace the existing information <b>as submitted</b>, and will not be edited for style, format, or links at that time.  When the manual&#146;s next regular revision cycle occurs, AAD will edit and reformat the file, add metatags (indexing code), and update any links. <p>AAD will provide a printed copy of the temporary file to University Archives in compliance with the records retention schedule established with the State of Arizona.  A printed copy of the edited, formatted file will be included when the next regular posting of a revision to the manual is archived</td></tr><p><tr><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><font face="VERDANA, HELVETICA, ARIAL" size=+1><b><a name="Document Preparation">Document Preparation</a></b></font> - <a href="#Top"><font size="-1">Back to top</font></a></td></tr><tr><td>The following directions for the preparation of revisions for new or revised policies and exhibits represent experience gained over years.

Every policy has an effective date, the date on which the first policy/procedure on this subject became effective,  and is not necessarily the posting date or publication date of the policy. Once a policy takes effect, this date never changes; it remains the same throughout the life of the policy, no matter how many revisions are made.<p>The revised date indicates the date on which the policy/procedure was most recently updated.  It is always different from the effective date, and is not necessarily the posting date or publication date of the policy.  Therefore, it may occur earlier than the posting date, but it is <b>never</b> earlier than the effective date.<p><hr><font face="VERDANA, HELVETICA, ARIAL"><b><a name="MRN">Developing the Manual Revision Notice (MRN)</a></b></font> - <a href="#Top"><font size="-1">Back to top</font></a><p>Each submission must be accompanied by a manual revision notice (MRN).

Exhibits are also useful to show how to complete a form by filling out a sample with hypothetical information.  All exhibits that are forms have the word &#147;Sample&#148; printed across them. <p>Exhibits are <b>not</b> blank forms intended for downloading. Forms for downloading should be accessed from a departmental Web site in formats available to a variety of platforms, such as MicrosoftWord, Portable Document Format (PDF), or WordPerfect.  By putting such forms on the department&#146;s Web site, the department can change the forms as necessary.  The manual coordinator should indicate where a link to the form should be inserted in the text.<p>We prefer receiving updated or new exhibits as Word or PowerPoint documents, which can be easily converted by our desktop publishing specialists.  <p>If exhibits are not available in electronic formats, provide a clean hard copy on white paper (give us an original, with no hole punches or staple holes). High quality originals produce better quality scans.<p>AAD will scan hard copies of exhibits, convert them to PDF format, and prepare review drafts of all new or revised exhibits. AAD distributes the review drafts of exhibits along with copies of revised or new policies to the manual coordinator and General Counsel.</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><font face="VERDANA, HELVETICA, ARIAL" size=+1><b><a name="Information">Need Additional Information?</a></b></font> - <a href="#Top"><font size="-1">Back to top</font></a></td></tr><tr><td>The staff of AAD are always willing to give advice and information regarding how to develop and revise policies and procedures for the manuals.
