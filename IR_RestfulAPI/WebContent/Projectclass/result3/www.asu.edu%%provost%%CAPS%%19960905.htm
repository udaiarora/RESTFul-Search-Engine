<h2>Minutes of Meeting</h2>
<b>September 5, 1996</b>
<P>
1. The minutes of the July 25 meeting were approved with 

     the following correction: Cristina Gonzalez.<P>

 

2. Christine West has been appointed Chair-Elect, 

     Patricia Etter will take over as Archivist.<P>

 

3. The committee continuted discussion of the status of the 

     revision of ACD 507-05.  Gary contacted former CAPS members      Sandra Bray, Michael
Douglas and John Wheatley and has 

     put together a history of the document∆s revision.  The     document was finished and
ready for final approval in 1993.       It was tabled at that time because the ABOR was working
on a      revision of the AP Conditions of Service which would have   superceded the ACD
document.  When the ABOR document was   tabled, apparently permanently, the ACD revision
was not   readdressed.  The committee has decided to send a letter to      Provost Glick,
copied to Vice-Provost Harris, outlining the      history of the ACD 507-5 revision, with copies of
previous  letters attached.  Provost Glick will be encouraged to bring     this issue to closure
and invited to attend a meeting with 

     the Vice-Provost and the two AP committees. <P>

 

4. Gary, as chair of CAPS, will call a meeting of PACAPS.  They  will be invited to attend the
October 3 CAPS meeting.  At this   meeting PACAPS will be encouraged to elect a chairperson
and  secretary in order to set to committee in motion.  We will  also outline an agenda for a
meeting between the two  committees and Provost Glick and Vice-Provost Harris.<P>

 

5. CAPS will also invite all university Academic Professionals to     attend our October 31
meeting to meet their representatives,  voice any concerns and work with the committee to
set an 

     agenda for the year.  The committee is considering making this   an annual event and
including it in the bylaws as such.<P>

 

6. Karl presented first draft revision of the CAPS bylaws.  After     general discussion it was
decided that we would all review the    document and discuss it again at the next
meeting.<P>

 

7. Academic Professionals as sole chair of graduate committees:       Michael Douglas has
encouraged the committee to continue    questioning the Graduate School policy of not
allowing  Academic Professionals to act as sole chairs for graduate   student supervisory
committees.  Even though he was told that    the Graduate Council would look into this, there has
been no 

     response since Mike contacted them September 1, 1995.<P>

 

8. Gary will revise last year's welcome letter to all campus APs;     it will be included in a mailer
with the invitation to the    open meeting.<P>
