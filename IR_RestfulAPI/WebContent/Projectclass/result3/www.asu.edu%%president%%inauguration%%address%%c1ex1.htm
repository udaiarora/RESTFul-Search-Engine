To think clearly about sustainability, we must         understand the relationships between all the variables involving human         interaction with natural systems&#8212;past, present, and future. Nowhere         is this more essential than in an area such as metropolitan Phoenix. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">         </font></p>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Arizona State         University is taking the lead in understanding the cultural, socioeconomic,         and physical setting in which we find ourselves by learning how to plan         ahead&#8212;in a 100 year time frame. An interdisciplinary team of ASU         scholars is addressing the issue of environmental sustainability for the         region by creating the first &#8220;atlas&#8221;&#8212;actually a series         of interactive multimedia atlases&#8212;that will provide researchers         and planners with a comprehensive look at all the factors that will determine         our impact on the regional environment 100 years in the future. </font></p>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <a href="http://www.gp2100.org/">Greater         Phoenix 2100 Project</a> is compiling, synthesizing, and analyzing data         on the past, present and future of cultural, economic, ecological, environmental,         geographic, natural, and social factors, analyzing the interaction between         the built environment and natural systems along multiple interconnected         dimensions. </font></p>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not only         will the Greater Phoenix 2100 Project bring precision and clarity to the         critical issues of sustainable growth, it will serve as a prototype for         scholars, analysts, and planners around the world. I am committed to making         this project a major initiative of the university, and hope that as many         as 100 faculty groups engage in this groundbreaking project. </font></p>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></p></td>    <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   </font> </p></body></html>
