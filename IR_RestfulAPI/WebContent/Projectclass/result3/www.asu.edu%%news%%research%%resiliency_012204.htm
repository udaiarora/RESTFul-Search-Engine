      <h2>Research effort explores traits of resiliency </h2>
      <p>Whenever a person faces a personal trauma, injury or deeply emotional experience, there is something inside of him that usually helps him bounce back physically and emotionally. </p>
      <p>Researchers are now focusing on this long ignored factor - resiliency - as a key to long-term physical and emotional well-being in both the individual and even the community as a whole. </p>
      <p>The concept is at the center of a new multidisciplinary research effort at ASU. The proposed "Resilience Solutions" draws together psychologists, sociologists, experts in public affairs and others to look at the important role resiliency plays individually and throughout a community. </p>
      <p>The effort is being funded in part through seed money from the ASU Vice President for Research and St. Luke's Health Initiatives. St. Luke's recently addressed the importance of resiliency through "Resilience, Health in a New Key," the fall 2003 issue Arizona's Health Futures. The publication, put together by Dr. Roger Hughes of St. Luke's, highlights resiliency and its positive effects, the work that needs to be done in building resiliency in the community and major untapped sources of community strength. </p>
      <p>"We see resilient people all around us, in all walks of life, at every economic scale," says Psychology Professor Alex Zautra, co-principal investigator of ASU's project. "People show us over and over how capable they are in bouncing back from misfortune to find a resilient solution to the difficulties that confront them." </p>
      <p>The researchers will approach the concept through observation of resiliency in individuals and the community. Beyond observation, the team will attempt to create indices of resilience, to determine what factors distinguish the most resilient people and communities in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The group will also help people learn ways to build their resiliency and establish community resiliency centers. </p>
      <p>On the individual level, Zautra says the key to the effort is to consider resiliency as a positive factor in health, as opposed to the traditional model of looking just at risk factors. He says the term "risk factors" focuses on negatives exclusively and ignores our capacity for positive renewal. </p>
      <p>For instance, the traditional model looks at the risk factor of blood pressure. If it is higher than the recommended level, something is potentially wrong. On the resiliency side, Zautra, author of the recent book "Emotions, Stress and Health," says heart rate variability should be considered. He says such measures show the heart's flexibility to respond in adaptive ways that match the beat of the heart to the specific challenges being confronted. </p>
      <p>ASU Public Affairs Professor John Hall, the other co-principal investigator for the work, says like an individual, a community during a crisis will fall back on things such as its economic resources, support within its neighborhoods, educational system and its personal or civic pride. </p>
      <p>"It's extremely important at a community level to think of elements of resilience just as we should think of personal resilience factors," he says. "Some communities are better prepared than others." </p>
      <p>Along with Hall and Zautra, the research team will include Professors Leona Aiken, Felipe Castro and John Reich; Associate Professor of Psychology Mary Davis; Assistant Professors Kathryn Lemery and Linda Luecken; and Faculty Research Associate Christina Van Puymbroeck from ASU's Psychology Department. </p>
