In addition to learning research methods, ethics, and philosophy, students are introduced to the practical side of research, including writing and reviewing proposals and papers, helping in various committee tasks, and in developing professional contacts.  The process includes the following phases:<br> <br> <strong>Initial contact.</strong>  Students are recruited through our reputation and through personal contact.  In the past half-dozen years, ASU has gained an international reputation in planetary geology and there has been a marked increase in graduate applications from institutions such as Cornell and Brown Universities.  Many students are former NASA summer interns who worked at our lab prior to entering graduate school. <br> <br> <strong>First year.</strong>  During their first year of graduate studies, candidates are encouraged to become familiar with the research activities in the department, initiate a preliminary program of study, and develop interests in a specific research area.  Through discussions, reading and conference sections, and research assistant duties, first-year students become acquainted with planetary research methods.  Each fall term, a weekly group reading and conference section is conducted for new students.  At about mid-term, the students begin to carry out original research on selected subjects.  These often lead to thesis topics, or short papers for publication.  By the summer of the first year, students are generally ready to begin their thesis research and are financially supported through grants.  <br> <br> <strong>Second and third years.</strong>  In this intense phase, candidates are engaged in a wide variety of activities in addition to courses and thesis research.  Activities include assisting in the preparation of grant progress reports and renewals, presentation of papers at scientific meetings, and helping in various national committee tasks.  These activities expose students to the leaders in planetary science and enable them to become acquainted with key issues facing the discipline.  Preliminary results from thesis research or class projects are often worthy of publication.  Often, this is the student's first venture in publication and is an excellent learning experience.  <br> <br> <strong>Fourth and fifth years.</strong>  In this phase, students have completed their research and are in the process of writing their dissertations.  Students at this stage meet me regularly to develop the dissertation outline and to initiate writing.  I review preliminary chapters early in the process and offer guidance about writing methods and style.  In general, non-dissertation activities (committee work, etc.) receive less emphasis in order to allow full attention to completing degree requirements.  However, students continue to present and publish papers, and they are encouraged and helped in seeking permanent posts or post-doctorate positions. <br> <br> <strong>Post-graduation.</strong>  In most cases, by the final phase of their work, Ph.D. candidates are more like colleagues than students.  After graduation, we often maintain contact personally and through publication activities.  In general, students find employment where  they continue planetary research and, in many cases, joint research projects continue or are initiated.<p align="center">   <strong>Master's Students</strong> <p>Many applicants to our program are better suited to the M.S. degree.  Master's candidates are expected to carry out a substantial research program and are afforded the same facilities and support as Ph.D. candidates.  Students can earn the M.S. as their terminal degree, go elsewhere to work toward the Ph.D., or return later in a Ph.D. program.     <p align="center"><strong>Support</strong>       <p>All students are fully supported (50% time during the academic year, 100% time during the summer) by research or teaching assistantships or fellowships.  All Ph.D. candidates, regardless of support, are required to gain some experience as teaching assistants.  Students have full access to research facilities and personnel, including computer operators and programmers, a photographic and darkroom technician, a staff engineer, and secretarial services, all of which are supported by sponsored projects.  Supplies, field expenses, and other materials are also obtained through sponsored projects.  Facilities include the image processing laboratory, space photography laboratory, and wind tunnels both at ASU and at our laboratory at the NASA-Ames Research Center, California.   <p align="center"><strong>Professional Growth</strong>           <p><strong>Scientific meetings.</strong>  Students are encouraged to attend relevant national meetings and present papers, and are aided in applying for various travel grants.  Generally, all students who wish to attend key meetings are provided support.  Meetings are important for learning the latest scientific results, meeting leaders in the field, establishing contacts, and, for some students, presenting the results of their research.               <br>     <br>     <strong>Grant preparation. </strong>Students are helped in writing grant proposals for stipends, including NASA fellowships, minority fellowships, and university fellowships.  As appropriate, some students help in preparing proposals to NSF and NASA, many of which are successful.  Students also review our program's proposals, using standard criteria adopted by the sponsoring agency, to gain experience in the proposal process.               <br>     <br>     <strong>Brown bag seminars.</strong>  Our research group meets weekly in an informal seminar session.  Students are encouraged to give one seminar each year to present their research progress.  In this informal setting, students receive a critical (but friendly) review of their research and gain experience in giving presentations.               <br>     <br>     <strong>Field trips.</strong>  At least once a year, the research group organizes field trips to geological areas of planetary interest.  This provides an opportunity for all students to gain geological field experience, even though it many not be directly related to their research.  In recent years, we have made trips to the four-corners area (led by an eminent planetary scientist from the U.S. Geological Survey), to the Pinacate volcanic field in Mexico, and to the active volcanic eruptions in Hawaii.  Travel for most trips is at least partly supported.               <br>     <br>     <strong>Planetary geology seminars.</strong>  During the academic year, prominent planetary scientists are brought to ASU to give specialized research seminars.  During their visits, graduate students may meet with the scientists individually to discuss areas of mutual interest.  Functions such as open houses or dinner parties are held in the evening to encourage social interaction.          <br>                                                <br>		                                                                                                                                    <a href="#top"><img src="../../images/redtop_arrow.gif"  width="19" height="21" border="0" alt="to top"></a><br>                  <br>                  <br>              <!-- #EndEditable -->
