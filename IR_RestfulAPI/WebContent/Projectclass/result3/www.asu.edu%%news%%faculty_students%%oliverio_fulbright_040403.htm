      <h2>ASU professor to study terrorism on Fulbright Research Grant</h2>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/oliverio_040403.jpg" alt="Annamarie Oliverio" width="144" height="200" align="right">        ASU's
        Annamarie Oliverio will soon be headed to Italy to continue her study
        of international terrorism after receiving a grant from the Fulbright
      Scholars Program.</p>
      <p>An adjunct faculty member with the School of Justice
          Studies, Oliverio
        is the author of "The State Of Terror," published in 1998 by SUNY Press.</p>
      <p>"While
          this book provides a broad theoretical framework for exploring the
        relationship between terrorism, states and social control, the research
          Fulbright will provide the means for a more detailed theory, a systematic
          and intensive examination of cases, and a more comprehensive data set,"
        she said.</p>
      <p>"It is research like this that may help the United States and
          the rest of the world understand the sources of terrorism and design
          appropriate
          responses to it," said Anne Schnieder, dean of the College of Public
          Programs. "We are very pleased that she has now received this Fulbright
        award to continue her research."</p>
      <p>Oliverio says her primary concerns have
          been the exploration of different ways in which nation-states define
          terrorism and the mechanisms devised
        for the ostensible resolution of terrorism.</p>
      <p>"An underlying tenet guiding
          much of this work suggests that the means of resolving terrorist incidents
          vary from state to state based on factors
          such as the socio-economic and political structure of a particular
        nation-state," she says. "My major objective has been to examine these
        variations, attempting
          to discover the logic and coherence of the patterns of responses to
        terrorism by nation-states as well as the relationship between these
        state responses
          and other social institutions, including the distribution of power,
        and structures of domination."</p>
      <p>Beginning in May, Oliverio will be located
          at the University of Lecce in Lecce, Italy. Lecce is located in southern
          Italy, in close proximity
        to Greece and Turkey. </p>
      <p>"These are uncertain times, and once again, Italy,
          in particular its southeastern area, is caught in the political and
        geographic crossfire,"
          she said. "Many of the best researchers on this topic are in Italy
        and all of my family lives around Calabria."</p>
      <p>The Fulbright Scholar Program
          is recognized as the U.S. government's flagship program in international
          educational exchange. The program sends
          800 scholars and professionals each year to more than 140 countries,
          where they lecture or conduct research in a wide variety of academic
          and professional fields. It is sponsored by the U.S. Department of
        State. Out of the 800 grants, fewer than 200 are awarded for research
        projects.</p>
      <p>The
          Fulbright Program was established in 1946 under legislation introduced
          by former Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas. Approximately 250,000
          "Fulbrighters," 94,000 from the United States and 155,600 from other
          countries, have participated in the Program since its inception more
        than 50 years ago. </p>
