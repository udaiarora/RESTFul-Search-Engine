<p>Herb Sendek, who has taken North Carolina State to five consecutive NCAA appearances, won more than 250 games in the past 13 seasons and has been a part of Final Four coaching staffs at two different schools, has been named the 13th men's basketball coach at Arizona State University, Vice President of Athletics Lisa Love announced Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very excited to have Coach Sendek taking the reigns of the Arizona State basketball program,&quot; said Love. &quot;His knowledge of the game and proven record of success made him the ideal candidate for us. His experiences as a head coach on the major conference level and in building winning programs is exceptional, as is his background as an assistant coach. He has been on the staff of two Final Four teams and worked at high-level programs. We look forward to helping Coach Sendek produce those same results at Arizona State.&quot;</p>
<p>Sendek, who is 253-158 (.647) in his 13 seasons as a head coach and was 191-132 (.591) at North Carolina State in 10 seasons, was the Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year in 2003-04 and has taken his team to the postseason a dozen times. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a real sense of appreciation in my heart for the opportunity that Lisa Love has given me together with Dr. Crow,&rdquo; says Sendek. &ldquo;We had dinner last night and I got goose bumps listening to them speak with such passion about ASU and the possibilities, the limitless ends, that this institution and community have open to them. When Dr. Crow identified his vision of excellence, inclusion, and impact, it really resonated with me that the timing right now is perhaps like no other time in this community or university's history to move forward and continue to do extraordinary things. It is with a very grateful heart that I sit here before you and together with you.&quot; </p>
<p>While competing in arguably the nation's most intense college basketball conference against some of the nation's most storied traditions, he has posted five 20-win seasons, including the past three. He also was named the Mid-American Conference Coach of the Year in 1994-95 after leading Miami (Ohio) to a 23-7 record, including a first-round NCAA Tournament win over 15th-ranked Arizona. And after taking over a program that had not been to the postseason in six years, he led NC State to postseason appearances in nine of 10 seasons.</p>
<p>His most recent Wolfpack squad went 22-10 (his third straight 20-win season), and topped California in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Prior to this year, his 2004-05 squad advanced to the regional semifinal led by Julius Hodge and beat defending NCAA champion UConn in the second round. </p>
<p>In 2003-04, the Wolfpack won 11 regular-season league games for the first time since 1974, including five on the road. NC State was in the top-20 for the final six weeks and defeated five ranked teams, including top-ranked Duke. Sendek was named the ACC's Coach of the Year and the NABC District 5 Coach of the Year.</p>
<p>In 2002-03, Sendek took his sixth Wolfpack squad to postseason play and became just the seventh coach in the storied history of the ACC to take three of his first seven teams to the ACC Tournament championship. For the second straight season and the third time in his seven years, his squad knocked off the tourney's top seeded team and a Wolfpack player was named to the All-ACC first-team (Anthony Grundy in 2002, Julius Hodge in 2003).</p>
<p>The 2002 season may have been Sendek's most challenging, yet most rewarding. He took a team with just two seniors and five freshmen and won 23 games (nine in the ACC) for the first time in over a decade. The Pack posted a third-place ACC finish (after being picked seventh) and advanced to the ACC Tournament finals and the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Sendek won his 100th game at NC State in 2002, was the NABC District 5 Coach of the Year and a finalist for the Naismith Coach of the Year Award. The Sporting News selected him as the ACC Coach of the Year.</p>
<p>In his first season (1996-97), the Pack won 17 games, the program's first winning record in six years, advanced to the championship of the ACC Tournament and earned a NIT berth, its first postseason appearance since 1991. The Wolfpack won eight of their final 11 games. The improbable ACC run had college basketball fans around the nation buzzing about the progress and potential of the Wolfpack. Sendek's team relied on just six players throughout the tournament, but pulled off upsets of top-seeded Duke (66-60), fifth-ranked Maryland (65-58) before falling to North Carolina.</p>
<p>The 43-year old Sendek's basketball pedigree runs beyond his years. Growing up in Pittsburgh, Pa., he constantly tagged along with his father, Herb, Sr., a teacher and coach at the high school and junior college levels. During his youth, Sendek was influenced by several coaches, including legendary junior college coach Bill Shay.</p>
<p>Sendek became a standout guard at Penn Hills High School, earning All-East Suburban notice as the team captain. He was also a leader in the classroom, graduating with a perfect 4.0 grade-point average. He has been named to the Penn Hills Hall of Fame and to the East Boros Chapter of the Pennsylvania Hall of Fame. From there, Sendek opted to attend Carnegie-Mellon University, earning a prestigious Carnegie Merit Scholarship and the opportunity to play for coach Dave Maloney.</p>
<p><img src="images/20060403_sendek2.jpg" width="275" height="283" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">One week into practice prior to his senior season, Sendek's playing career ended unexpectedly when a new coach cut him and two other players recruited by Maloney. What seemed like a disastrous event for Sendek, however, turned out to have a silver lining. Chuck Crummie, the head coach at Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, gave Sendek the opportunity to serve as a volunteer assistant coach.</p>
<p>After graduating from Carnegie-Mellon summa cum laude with a 3.95 GPA in 1985, Sendek launched his coaching career. He joined Rick Pitino's staff at Providence College that fall, serving as an assistant coach with the Friars until 1989.</p>
<p>Sendek rejoined Pitino, who has had numerous former assistant coaches advance to the head coaching ranks, in 1989 at the University of Kentucky. He served as an assistant (1989-91) and then associate head coach (1991-93) for the Wildcats, earning a national reputation as a standout recruiter. Sports Illustrated named him one of the nation's top 10 recruiters in its 1992-93 College Basketball Preview.</p>
<p>Sendek met his wife, the former Melanie Scheuer of Danville, Ky., in Lexington and the couple was married nearly two years later and has three daughters, Kristin (11), Catherine (9) and Kelly (7).</p>
<p>After 11 years as an assistant, including Final Four appearances in 1987 with Providence and 1993 with Kentucky, Sendek took over the program at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. There, in his first venture as a head coach, he led the Redskins to three consecutive postseason appearances and the 1985 Mid-American Conference regular-season championship. His three-year record at Miami was 63-26, giving him the highest winning percentage (.708) in school history. He is the only coach ever to lead Miami to postseason play in each of his first three seasons, and he reached 50 victories quicker than any other MU coach.</p>
<p>After winning the MAC regular-season title in 1995, Miami earned an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, where Sendek's 12th-seeded squad defeated fifth-seeded Arizona (ranked No. 15 in the national polls), 71-62, before losing to 13th-ranked and fourth-seeded Virginia in overtime, 60-54. Sendek was named the 1995 Mid-American Conference and Ohio Coach of the Year.</p>
<p>With the announcement of Sendek's hiring, the Athletic Ticket Office has announced that season tickets will go on sale beginning at 9 a.m. Monday, April 3. Prices for tickets to the 2006-07 season are $275 for the lower level, $150 for the upper level sides and $125 for the upper level ends. Tickets, as well as more information, can be obtained in person at the ticket office or by calling (480) 727-0000.</p>
