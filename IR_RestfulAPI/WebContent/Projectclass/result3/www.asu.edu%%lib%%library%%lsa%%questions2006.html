<h2>Questions Submitted by Library Staff<br>(Organized by General Topics)</h2>

<span class="embold">Communication / Merit / Career Progressions</span>
<ol>
 <li>I have worked here a long time and find communication between Admin personnel and staff to be at its worst. If we find out information, it is usually by chance or through the grapevine via rumors. A current example: HR has more information about salary increases than we have heard from Admin. How is merit affecting us? When do we see merit raises?<br><br>
And on a similar note: What is happening with career progressions? Does anyone in Admin care?
<br><br>
Even if information is meager, a simple e-mail to acknowledge information is pending and perhaps when we might hear more can sure boost morale!</li>
 <li>How do Crows standards for meritorious performance translate to staff and the performance review process?</li>
 <li>There are rumors going around and some from inside sources that other places have gotten their raises. It is also being said that Crow's people will be getting the blut of the raises and the rest of us will get very little if any at all.</li>
 <li>Recently, in the R2 report, and in the new "Moving Forward" messages, better communication between administration and other areas of the library, and between library departments and individuals has been encouraged.<br><br>
Considering the above, ASU Libraries' promotion of new technology and interest in things such as blogs, myspace, etc., and, given that the creation of a forum space (such as a blog) for all ASU Libraries staff (and professionals) has been suggested before as a method to increase communication, why has such a forum not yet been created?<br><br>
The emphasis here is on a method for individuals in the library to submit input, suggestions on a variety of topics in one centralized area.)</li>
 <li>How do the Libraries plan to address performance evaluations, in regards to President Crow's vision of continuous improvement and of rewarding merit only to those who are "highly meritorious"?  Are we going to use a different evaluation system next year?</li>
</ol>

<span class="embold">Salaries / Parking Fees</span>
<ol start=6>
<li>Since our salaries do not compare with same size universities out of state why is the administration raising the parking fees to such high level?</li>
</ol>

<span class="embold">Downtown</span>
<ol start=7>
<li>Please give an update on the progression of the Downtown Campus Library.  Thank you.</li>
<li>Please discuss the plans for the ASU library downtown.  What will be the focus of the collection?  What is the planned location?  How many staff and professional positions will this create?  When will staff be hired?</li>
</ol>

<span class="embold">Buildings / Hours / Access Services</span>
<ol start=9>
<li>There has been talk of following UofA's example of combining Circulation &amp; Reference, making Reserve and Holds shelves public accessible, and adding more than one self-checkout machine to each library.  Please comment.</li>
<li>Given all the new construction on campus and building renovations, are the libraries (Hayden or Noble) slated for any type of remodel or a new library facility on campus???</li>
<li>What are the plans for opening the 'old' first floor entrance at Hayden Library?  When might it happen and what type of presence either security or circulation will be there?</li>
<li>Is Hayden Library scheduled for renovation and expansion some time in the near future? If so, what is the plan and when will the plan be implemented.</li>
<li>Is access services moving to the 1st level?<br><br>
Is the Library going to be open 24hour during the summer?<br><br>
Are we going do self checkout at Hayden?<br><br>
Can we have a Video drop box from the outside into Hayden Library?</li>
</ol>

<span class="embold">Archives</span>
<ol start=14>
<li>Do either ASU West, Poly, or Downtown libraries plan to have an archive, or will the Tempe archive serve all campuses?</li>
</ol>

<span class="embold">Flexible Schedules</span>
<ol start=15>
<li>The state of Arizona and the University endorsed the use of flex time and working from home as policies to help ease the air quality problems in Maricopa county.<br>
Why are we considering eliminating this policy?  If there are problems with the current enforcement of library flex time/work from home policies, why not address that directly and seek solutions instead of a blanket elimination of policies that have usually worked very well for the libraries?  Most of the time these policies have not negatively affected job performance or user needs.  If there are a few instances of problems, why not seek to deal with those directly?</li>
<li>The state and University encourage its employees to take advantage of compressed work schedules as part of the travel reduction program to improve our air quality.  ("Don't Drive One in Five")  Why then is Dean Coleman rumored to be removing the option of compressed work schedules for departments reporting to her?</li>
<li>Why is Dean Coleman trying to omit flew scheduling and telecommuting? Some of us live far from campus and with gas prices and Maricopa County pushes the Don't Drive One in Five it makes no sense. Free bus passes are great but public transportation is inadequate or not a viable solution for many that work here. We use these days for medical appts. and family obligations that would otherwise mean us missing a days work.</li>
<li>I have opted to use a flex schedule so I can make doctor appointments or take care of other obligations WITHOUT having to use my sick leave or vacation time.  That way the department gets the forty hours of work that I would otherwise not be able to work due to missed work time.  Now we are hearing rumors that Dean Coleman will be eliminating the flex schedule option for department that report to her.  WHY?  It will mean less productivity due to missed work hours due to employees having to use the sick/vacation leave they did not previously have to use.</li>
<li>I know the elimination of flex-time has not become official yet, but I understand it is being seriously considered.  At a time when our air quality is so bad that Arizona is fined by the Federal government, traffic is horrendously bad, and parking costs have become prohibitive for many ASU employees (myself included), why aren't flex time and telecommuting being cheerfully encouraged??!!  Sometimes it seems as if the powers that be are *trying* to squash our almost nonexistent morale.  Why is this?!</li>
<li>There is talk in the library that staff under Dean Coleman will not be allowed the option of flex schedules. If this is true, how can one dean mandate such an action when ASU and the state of Arizona actively support a flex schedule as part of their travel reduction and polution control efforts?<br>
On a personal note, a flex schedule is one of the few helpful "perks" allowed for staff. Staff can contribute fully to this library and accommodate personal schedules. We are underpaid and overworked. Allow us to retain this "perk".</li>
<li>Please address the as yet unofficial discussion concerning the elimination of flex-time schedules and telecommuting. I need not point out that the use of this kind of flexibility in scheduling has been strongly encouraged by both the University and the State of Arizona for quite some time. With the advent of $3.00 per gallon gasoline and the extremely bad air pollution it would seem that these schedules should be even more encouraged. Schedule flexibility is also one of the few benefits we can offer employees to help integrate their personal and professional lives.</li>
<li>I've heard through the grapevine that our flex hours may be taken away.  I would like to ask if this is going to happen and if so, why.  The flex hours are very important to me and I would be very displeased to see them taken away!</li>
<li>Concerning possible new policies that would severely limit the ability of library employees to have flex schedules (even those not at public service points such as circulation or reference), how would such policies be reconciled with state policies that encourage flex time schedules, telecommuting, and alternative transportation?  Considering that the university supports these state policies, and that such policies are for the betterment of not only traffic and parking issues, but of air quality as well, how would possibly contradictory ASU Libraries policies be of enough benefit to the libraries to merit such difference with the university and state policies? </li>
</ol>

<span class="embold">Reorganization / Changes</span>
<ol start=24>
<li>What can you tell us about the "Learning Center at Noble"?  What changes and/or opportunities will this make for the Libraries?</li>
<li>As staff, how do you think we can best prepare for changes in the library?</li>
<li>Is there a "solid, crafted plan" for the library's reorg, or is it more of a "work in progress" that even Admin is waiting, watching, and working to discover, develop, and unfold?</li>
<li>How does all the organizational restructuring affect us?</li>
<li>First, a comment:<br>
The first part of John Howard's 3-part lunch and learn program on Technology in ASU Libraries (held today) was a great example of a serious effort to communicate with and inform everyone in the library about coming changes, plans, and goals.  The 3-part program allows for greater depth in explanation of the topic and for responses and questions from those present after each session.  The level of detail and the handout given to attendees in this first session demonstrated a sincere intent to inform and include everyone in the changing goals and structure within the library with regard to technology.<br><br>
A related question:<br>
As ASU Libraries move forward with new technology, new developments, and change staffing and other internal structures, will there be new learning and training opportunities for current employees to better integrate them with the NAUL?</li>
</ol>

<span class="embold">Policies</span>
<ol start=29>
<li>I was wondering if there was any thought of letting students check out the individual study rooms overnight?  The security is ample, and of all students, those who are burning the midnight oil should surely be trusted?</li>
<li>Are community card patrons going to be getting ASURITEs any time soon?</li>
</ol>

<span class="embold">Other</span>
<ol start=31>
<li>Has the administration considered the positive aspects of institutional transparency?</li>
<li>In the current management environment, what role does the administration see for LSA/LCSTF and Librarians Council?</li>
</ol>
