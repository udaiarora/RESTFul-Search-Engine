                      <p>For the online form, follow this link to <a href="submission.html">Course Reserve Submission</a>. (Remember that Library owned books can be pulled from the stacks by Reserve staff but all other materials such as personal books, class notes, sample exams &amp; journal articles must be brought to the library).</p>

                      <p>Complete and sign Reserve Course Sheet.</p>

                      <p>A completed Course Reserve Sheet is required for all Reserve requests. Reserve staff will retrieve books from the stacks throughout the semester. However, due to the high volume of material being processed during the first few weeks of each semester, it is highly recommended that all materials be submitted with the Course Reserve Sheets. Turnaround time during this period can be several days. If an item is checked out, please include it on the course sheet, Reserve personnel will recall it for Reserve. Instructors should confirm with the Reserve department that all requested materials, whether Searches or Recalls, are on Reserve and available for check-out to their students by reviewing the Reserve lists in the Online Catalog or by calling the unit.</p>

                    <p>Yes. All photocopied material that meet the <a href="../copyright.html">University Libraries Copyright Guidelines</a> are placed on Reserve in the library and also scanned for Electronic Reserve, unless specifically asked not to.</p>

                    <p>Unless you specified otherwise, paper Reserves were scanned and made available on Electronic Reserve when they were received. To confirm, contact the appropriate Libraries' Reserve unit.

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>Generally, we will accept the same materials that we have traditionally placed in folders such as, magazine articles, book chapters, sample exams, lecture notes, etc. provided they meet <a href="../copyright.html">University Libraries Copyright Guidelines</a>.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>Yes. We are only accepting material photocopied onto 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper. The quality of the original copy determines the quality of the scan, so we encourage faculty to submit only high quality photocopies.</p>

                      <p> The University Libraries, in consultation with the University General Counsel, has adopted a strict interpretation of the copyright laws as they relate to Reserve materials. </p>

                      <p> The Library may accept only <strong>one photocopy</strong> of any copyrighted item for one semester only. The item cannot be placed on Reserve again without written copyright permission, which the instructor is responsible for obtaining. An example of a permission request is available at Reserve or <a href="../crperm.html">online</a>. All photocopied items will be removed at the end of each semester unless permission had been provided to reserve. </p>

                      <p> A photocopy of one chapter from a single author or co-authored work or photocopies of not more than three chapters or articles from a collective work or periodical volume may be placed on Reserve over the course of a semester. Of these, not more than one article from each collective work or periodical volume may be on Reserve at the same time. </p>

                      </p>
                      <p>If the article is from an E-Journal/Database to which the library subscribes, up to three articles from the same e-journal/database source may be placed on reserve for multiple semesters without needing copyright permission. This applies only to E-Journals/Databases for which the library maintains a subscription. </p>
                      <p><br>
                      </p>
                      <p> Reserve files may not be used to create, replace, or substitute for anthologies, compilations or &ldquo;reading packets.&rdquo; For this reason, each chapter, article, etc. must be listed as a separate file and not linked with others in a &ldquo;packet&rdquo; format. </p>

                      </p>
                      <p> Video materials recorded from television may be placed on reserve one time only for a maximum of 45 days. Only one copy with a single program/segment on the tape is allowed. The recording cannot be placed on Reserve again without written copyright permission, which the instructor is responsible for obtaining. </p>

                      <p>All materials submitted to Reserve must be processed before they are available for student use and will be processed in order of their receipt. Depending upon the length of the list and the backlog of other items, it may take several days for a Reserve Course Sheet to be completely processed. A hard copy for student check-out will be processed first and digital copies will follow as time permits. <strong><em>Items brought in right after a class cannot be immediately available and will be queued behind earlier requests.</em></strong></p>
