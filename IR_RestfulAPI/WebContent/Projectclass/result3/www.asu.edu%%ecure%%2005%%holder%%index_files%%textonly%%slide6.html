            <p>I'm going to give you an overview of the project, talk about some of the original project goals, our methodology, and what we have accomplished to date. Since we're in our third and final year of funding, this overview will necessarily have to be fairly comprehensive in order to put the rest of the discussion in perspective. </p>

          <li value="0">
            <p>As I talk about the project, I'll intersperse the project overview with a discussion of some of the specific data from the interviews, including some of the observed file management behaviors and how they relate to records management practice as we know it, I'll talk about the management of faculty research data specifically, I'll talk about the concept of email as a record and how the interviewees view email, and I'll also talk about the issues of privacy and ownership of institutional electronic records. </p>
          </li>
          <li value="0">
            <p>Then, I'll talk about how the interview findings guided the development of the instructional tools developed by the project and finally,</p>
