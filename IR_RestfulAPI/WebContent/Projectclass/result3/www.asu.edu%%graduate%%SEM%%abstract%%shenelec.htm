C. Shen, P. T. Chang</i><br>Center for Solid State Electronics Research, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287<p><i>Abstract:</i>  p<sup>+</sup>/n<sup>+</sup> InGaAsP tunnel diodes with a bandgap of 0.95 eV were fabricated by liquid phase epitaxy and their electrical properties were characterized. Forward conductances of 500<img src="../images/omega.gif"><sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, peak current densities of 28.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> and peak to valley current ratios of 14.3 were obtained at room temperature. These devices were incorporated successfully as Intercell Ohmic Connections (IOCs) for an InP-based, two-terminal monolithic multijunction tandem solar cell.<p><i>Appl Physics A 59, 199-301 (1994) </i><br><hr><p><a href="../5abstrac.htm#shen">Return to Abstract List</a></body></html>
