        <p>Phase I (July 2002-May 2003)</p>
        <p>Primary Goal: Data Collection</p>
        <ul>

            <p>  Survey and its findings â?? 1899 valid responses at Duke; 1076 valid responses at UNC-CH</p>

            <p>  Interviews â?? 50 at UNC-CH; 50 at Duke; additional 25 with IT staff/administrators from both campuses</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>[click again] In Phase I the primary goal was to collect data to understand how faculty, administrators, and staff use and process electronic documents on their desktop, especially what types of applications they use; what types of files (especially university records) they create/receive; and the challenges they face with digitally transmitted materials. </p>
        <p>Â </p>
        <ul>
          <li value="0">
            <p>[click] A survey was distributed by email and web in September of 2002 to all Duke and UNC employees identifiable by the respective university's campus-wide information technology department. They surveyed 8,334 addresses at UNC, and 17,327 addresses at Duke. About 212 emails bounced at UNC, and about 1,115 bounced at Duke. There were 1899 valid responses at Duke, and 1076 valid responses at UNC. The survey questions were designed to elicit information about email software, volume of time spent on email, attachments, storage practices, importance to job, specific concerns, and willingness to do further interview (UNC Â? 614; Duke Â? 894)</p>
          </li>
          <li value="0">
            <p>[click] The second part of Phase I was to conduct in-depth interviews on both campuses. It was decided to complete 50 interviews at UNC and 50 interviews at Duke. When 100 interviews had been conducted, we devised a separate set of questions for IT staff and administrators and about 25 more interviews were conducted with IT staff.</p>
