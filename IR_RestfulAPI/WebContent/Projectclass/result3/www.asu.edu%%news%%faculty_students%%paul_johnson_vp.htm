      <h2><strong>Johnson appointed associate vice president for research; Raupp, director of Flexible Display Center </strong></h2>
      <p>TEMPE, Ariz. - Paul Johnson, professor of civil and environmental engineering and associate dean for research at the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering has been appointed the new ASU associate vice president for research. Johnson replaces Greg Raupp, who now is the director of the ASU-U.S. Army Flexible Display Center. </p>
      <p><strong><img src="facstudents_images/paul_johnson.jpg" width="167" height="248" align="right"></strong>Johnson, who will report to Jonathan Fink, ASU vice president for research and economic affairs, begins his new duties on April 1. </p>
      <p>The Office of the Vice President of Research and Economic Affairs facilitates research, including scholarship and creative activities that advance the university's disciplines, complements the educational mission of the university and stimulates the expansion and diversification of Arizona's economy. </p>
      <p>"We are very fortunate to be able to tap someone with the experience and expertise of Paul Johnson to fill this very important role," Fink said. "Paul brings a rich mix of academic, industrial and administrative experience to the position. He will become part of the front-line team implementing President Crow's vision of ASU becoming a comprehensive metropolitan research university that has a major impact on the economic well-being of the region and the State. Paul will work closely with me and with Rob Melnick, associate vice president for economic affairs, to ensure that the research and economic goals the President has established for ASU are met. </p>
      <p>"Because of his close working relationship with Fulton School of Engineering Dean Peter Crouch, Paul is perfectly suited to continue integrating the ambitions of the Fulton School with those of ASU overall," Fink added. "I am particularly looking forward to Paul's leadership in expanding ASU's urban environmental research agenda, in building stronger ties with local and national industries and in helping deans and department chairs across the university recruit outstanding new faculty." </p>
      <p>Johnson came to ASU in 1994 after working as a senior research engineer at Shell Oil/Shell Chemical Westhollow Technology Center, Houston. His research program has focused on cleanup and risk assessment challenges associated with contaminated soils and groundwater, and the work has been recognized with awards from the National Ground Water Association, the Department of Defense and the White House. He has also received awards for teaching excellence at ASU and serves as the editor-in-chief of the journal Ground Water Monitoring and Remediation. </p>
      <p>Johnson obtained B.S. and PhD degrees in chemical engineering from the University of California, Davis and Princeton University, respectively. </p>
      <p>Raupp, who now directs the $43.7-million ASU-U.S. Army Flexible Display Center, also will continue to play a strategic role in the design of ASU's research agenda, serving as executive director for advanced technologies and reporting to Fink. </p>
      <p>"Greg was instrumental in pulling together the team, the ideas, and the operational plan that led the Army to choose ASU over several other powerhouse academic competitors," Fink added. "In a short amount of time, he's been able to win the confidence of the Army administrators as well as our industrial and university partners. Under Greg's leadership, this new grant, the largest in ASU's history, has the potential to transform the nature of military communications as well as the economy of metro Phoenix." </p>
