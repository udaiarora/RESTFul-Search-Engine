<h3>
<b>

<div class="bodytext">

Supply Chain Management&#8212;BS</b>
<a id="a68265"></a></h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
A &#8220;supply chain&#8221; consists of all of the entities necessary to transform ideas into delivered products and services. Supply chain management directs and transforms a firm&#8217;s resources in order to design, purchase, produce, and deliver high-quality goods and services. As goods and services flow from supplier to producer to customer to final user, supply chain management is particularly concerned with the interfaces between organizations. One way to view supply chain management is as managing linkages between organizations.</p>
<p>
The competitive and global nature of today&#8217;s business environment dictates that this direction and transformation take place in a way that is as efficient and effective as possible. Continuing emphases on time, cost, and quality improvements have sharpened the need to coordinate and cooperate with trading partners around the world to achieve results that allow customers to be successful. Thus, supply chain management focuses on the integration of activities across several companies to manage the flow of products, services, people, equipment, facilities, and other resources. Supply chain management is also concerned with recycling, reuse, and final disposal of products.</p>
<p>
The major in Supply Chain Management consists of the following courses:</p></div>

Major Proficiency Requirements</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Students must receive grades of &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00) or higher in upper-division courses for the major. If a student receives a grade below &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00) in any course in the major, this course must be repeated. If a second grade below &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00) is received in either an upper-division course in the major already taken or in a different upper-division course in the major, the student is no longer eligible to take additional upper-division courses in that major.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
