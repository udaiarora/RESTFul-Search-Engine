      <h2>Arizona State University announces Delphi Scholarship recipients</h2>
      <p>Arizona State University's College of Engineering
            and Applied Sciences announced that five students have received Delphi
          Scholarships for 2003-2004.</p>
      <p>The Delphi Foundation is an independent
            charitable foundation established in 1999. The foundation focuses
        on educational opportunities and support
          systems aimed at helping young people reach their full potential, with
          special consideration for educational programs in science and technology.
          This year, Delphi provided a gift of $10,000, which was matched by
        Motorola.</p>
      <p>"Delphi
          is pleased to make an educational contribution to Arizona State University,"
          said Marc Martens, Delphi Delco Electronics Systems director
          of public affairs and communications. "We believe that it is good business
          to support the educational institutions that provide an invaluable
        resource for the community."<br>
        Students who received awards are as follows:</p>
      <p>Ai-Chau Diep Thi is a sophomore
          majoring in Computer Systems Engineering. Her godfather was an electrical
          engineer in Motorola's Computer Group
          who took her on a tour of the office. When she realized there were
        few women engineers, she decided to become one. </p>
      <p>Rolando Alvarado is junior
          a majoring in electrical engineering with interests in designing control
          systems, circuits or microelectronics.
          He plans to work in the engineering field, but ultimately he hopes
        to teach engineering or physics at either the high school or college
        level. </p>
      <p>Julie Hall is a junior majoring in chemical engineering with particular
          interests in biotechnology and semiconductor research. She is an undergraduate
        research assistant in a chemical engineering lab. </p>
      <p>Michael Stull is a
          junior majoring in mechanical engineering. He is a transfer student
        from the Maricopa County Community College system who
        is interested in the field of communications. </p>
      <p>Vincent Placido is a junior
          majoring in industrial engineering. He is an ASU Barrett Honors College
          Student as well as an intramural sports
          team member. He transferred to ASU from California Lutheran University,
          where he played football and made the Dean's list two years in a row.
          He hopes to use his degree in industrial engineering to improve the
        quality of life locally and globally. </p>
