      <h2>White House honors science, engineering mentoring programs</h2>
      <p>        Two ASU mentoring programs have received the Presidential Award
        for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring. The
        programs are
          among 10 outstanding individuals and six organizations being recognized
      by the White House.</p>
      <p>A White House statement said "those honored have
          achieved remarkable results in increasing the participation of minorities,
          women and disabled
        students in science, mathematics and engineering." </p>
      <p>The two ASU programs
          honored are the Arizona Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement
          (MESA) and the Strengthening the Understanding of
        Mathematics and Sciences Institute (SUMS) </p>
      <p>The president annually recognizes
          the people and institutions that have provided broad opportunities
        for participation by women, minorities and
          disabled persons in science, mathematics and engineering. No more than
          10 persons and 10 institutions are selected each year for recognition.
          The annual awards, administered by the National Science Foundation,
        include a $10,000 grant and a presidential commemorative certificate. </p>
      <p>"It's a
          special point of pride for two ASU programs to be recognized by the
        National Science Foundation and the White House," said ASU Provost
          Milton Glick. "It's also important to note that in the few years these
          awards have been presented, ASU has been honored four times, twice
        this year for our programs and twice when faculty members have received
        individual
        awards for their service to our community."</p>
      <p>The SUMS Institute is a seed
          program in its 22nd year that has helped more than 1,600 inner city
        and reservation students prepare to study
          mathematics, engineering and science. A large majority of the program's
          participants go on to college, about half attending ASU, and many have
          become scientists, engineers and teachers. A large number of SUMS mathematics
        majors also return to their home communities as high school teachers.</p>
      <p>"Administrators
          constantly have to make hard choices about where to place scarce dollars,"
          says Joaquin Bustoz, a mathematics professor who created
          and continues to run the SUMS program. "For more than 20 years they
        have chosen to support the SUMS mission of bringing low income students
        into
          mathematics and science. The Presidential Award is not solely a SUMS
          honor, the honor is shared by the ASU community and especially by Milt
        Glick." </p>
      <p>The MESA program is a consortium between the University of Arizona,
          ASU and Estrella Mountain Community College that is in its 20th year
          as a
          year-round program to prepare underrepresented, first generation and
          low-income students from 55 schools for mathematics, engineering and
        science at the elementary and secondary education levels. </p>
      <p>The program
          helps high school students succeed in college through academic advising,
          after-school enrichment programs, and tours of university and
          industry sites. More than 80 percent of the graduating seniors in the
          program attend college, and 60 percent declare math, engineering or
        science as their major. </p>
      <p>AZ MESA has two centers, one southern regional center
          at the UA and the central regional center at ASU. ASU MESA works with
          more than 30 schools
        in the valley and with several American Indian reservations. </p>
      <p>"This award
        pays tribute to all their efforts and recognizes all the students that
        the program has touched," said Peter Crouch, dean of the
        College of Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences at ASU. "It is especially
        gratifying that this national recognition is given to a partnership between
        local industry, ASU and the U of A. It demonstrates the power of the
      two universities working together."</p>
