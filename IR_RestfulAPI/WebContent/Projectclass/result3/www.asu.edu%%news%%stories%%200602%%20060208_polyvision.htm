<h1 class="storyhead">'Road map' points way for future of Polytechnic campus </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>ASU officials are starting to see the direction of the path laid out by a proposed five-year "road map" for the Polytechnic campus. </p>
<p align="left">In July, the first doctoral degree offered on ASU's Polytechnic campus was approved. In August, the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) confirmed three new undergraduate degree programs and a name change for one of the academic departments at the campus. And in December, ABOR gave the go-ahead for a School of Educational Innovation and Teacher Preparation. </p>
<p align="left">Other recommended actions include: </p>
<p align="left">. The reorganization of existing colleges. </p>
<p align="left">. Establishing new colleges, schools and degree programs. </p>
<p align="left">. Adding faculty members and facilities. </p>
<p align="left">The road map, developed in collaboration with campus and university academic leaders, outlines the future of the Polytechnic campus, where programs provide a practical and theoretical learning experience. According to Polytechnic's provost, Jerry Jakubowski, these changes are essential in the implementation of the new direction for the campus. </p>
<p align="left">"ASU's Polytechnic campus is the only polytechnic institution in the state, and we are in an enviable position of building a 21st century polytechnic for Arizona," he says. </p>
<p align="center">Reorganization </p>
<p align="left">One of the biggest pieces of the road map is organizing the Polytechnic programs in a way that will serve future generations more efficiently. Some of the reorganization includes the expansion from three colleges and schools to five during the next two years, pending ABOR approval. </p>
<p align="left">East College, the largest of the existing three, for many years served as an incubator for new programs, as well as a home for programs that were not large enough to stand on their own or did not fit in one of the other existing academic units. Because of its mix of programs, the proposed changes for this college will represent the bulk of the realignment efforts. </p>
<p align="center">College of Science and Technology </p>
<p align="left">With ABOR approval, the College of Technology of Applied Sciences will become the College of Science and Technology, where all the technical-, math- and science-related programs will be aligned. The college will include two schools and one division: </p>
<p align="left">. School of Engineering - This school will include aeronautical management technology; electronic systems; engineering, mechanical and manufacturing engineering technology; multidisciplinary and global technology development; and technology management. </p>
<p align="left">. School of Computing Studies - This school will include applied computing and computing systems. </p>
<p align="left">. Division of Science and Mathematics - When established, this school will include applied biological sciences, which resides in East College, applied mathematics and physical sciences. </p>
<p align="left">"Beyond enhancing math and science as degree programs, this new structure and name will bring them into closer coordination with our programs in engineering and technology," says Albert McHenry, dean of the College of Technology and Applied Sciences. "The resulting synchronization will improve their ability to accommodate the special demands placed on these subjects in our volatile polytechnic academic environment." </p>
<p align="left">The new organization is anticipated to be in place by this fall. </p>
<p align="center">Morrison School of Management <br>
  and Agribusiness </p>
<p align="left">Pending approval, the Morrison School of Agribusiness and Resource Management and the existing business and real estate programs will join together to form the Morrison School of Management and Agribusiness, possibly as early as fall 2006. </p>
<p align="left">"Now that the business and real estate programs are established, the realignment of the similar programs under one school makes sense," says Raymond Marquardt, dean of the Morrison School of Agribusiness and Resource Management. "The name recognizes the contributions the Morrison family has made to the Polytechnic campus and clearly identifies the programs offered. And, for more than five years, the faculty in the Morrison School have taught a number of courses for the Business Administration program, so familiarity on both sides exists." </p>
<p align="left">In addition to the realignment, four new faculty positions are opening and a new founding dean is being sought to lead the new school. </p>
<p align="center">School of Educational Innovation <br>
  and Teacher Preparation </p>
<p align="left">Effective this semester, the education program that was part of East College has become the School of Educational Innovation and Teacher Preparation. The new school will have two departments: </p>
<p align="left">. Department of Teacher Education and Administration - This department will be home for the existing undergraduate and graduate education degrees offered, as well as new ones in early childhood education, special education, a bachelor's degree in select studies, and master's degrees in special education, and educational administration and supervision. </p>
<p align="left">. Department of Physical Education This department will be home for the existing undergraduate and graduate degree programs in physical education. </p>
<p align="center">School of Health Sciences <br>
  and Technologies </p>
<p align="left">From the departments of Exercise and Wellness and Nutrition, as well as the Human Health Studies programs in East College, the School of Health Sciences and Technologies will emerge. New degree programs being proposed include medical lab science and technology. A doctorate in physical activity, nutrition and wellness was approved last summer. </p>
<p align="center">College of Social Sciences <br>
  and Humanities </p>
<p align="left">The remaining programs in East College - applied psychology, and the multimedia writing and technical communications programs - will be supplemented with new programs in social sciences and humanities to form the College of Social Sciences and Humanities. Proposed new programs will include: </p>
<p align="left">. Public policy and government. </p>
<p align="left">. Applied art and design. </p>
<p align="left">. Literature, writing and film. </p>
<p align="left">. History and culture. </p>
<p align="left">"The programs that have been in the East College have grown beyond the incubator stage and are ready to stand on their own," says Glenn Irvin, dean of East College. "And the need for the campus to offer comprehensive lower- and upper-division courses and degree programs in the humanities, arts and social sciences is critical to a polytechnic education." </p>
<p align="left">In addition to the new programs and structure, a number of faculty - and, eventually, deans - will be sought. </p>
<p align="center">Program development </p>
<p align="left">Enrollment at the Polytechnic campus is up 22 percent over fall 2004 numbers. The campus experienced a nearly 50 percent increase in freshmen. Total enrollment for fall 2005 was at 4,865. The growth is caused partly by new programs, increased lower-division course offerings and online offerings. Enrollment projections put the campus at about 8,500 students by 2010, topping out at 15,000 by 2020. </p>
<p align="left">For the campus to continue its growth, the five-year plan recommends nearly doubling program offerings, from 33 bachelor's degrees and graduate degrees to 62. </p>
<p align="center">Polytechnic Core </p>
<p align="left">To help attract and retain students, as well as to assure employers of the breadth and quality of their preparation, a "Polytechnic Core" of values and outcomes has been established. These will ensure that every student graduating from a program offered at the Polytechnic campus achieves knowledge and competency in the following areas: </p>
<p align="left">. Information literacy. </p>
<p align="left">. Critical thinking. </p>
<p align="left">. Science/Technology. </p>
<p align="left">. Quantitative reasoning. </p>
<p align="left">. Communication skills. </p>
<p align="left">. Social and leadership skills. </p>
<p align="left">. Ethics. </p>
<p align="left">. Global awareness. </p>
<p align="left">"The Polytechnic Core provides a common set of outcomes and experiences for all students," says David Schwalm, vice provost of academic programs at the Polytechnic campus. "The curriculum is aligned with the core outcomes, and extracurricular activities support and reinforce the curriculum. Students assess their own progress, and the university assesses student achievement through senior-year capstone projects." </p>
<p align="center">Proposed new facilities </p>
<p align="left">As part of the University Comprehensive Development Plan, a series of new facilities is being proposed for the Polytechnic campus. Long-term, the built space will increase from 630,327 square feet to 3.2 million, increasing classroom, research and housing space. </p>
<p align="left">But to address the more immediate space needs, three new facilities totaling 180,000 square feet are under consideration, with construction to begin once funding is identified and final designs are approved. A new science and technology facility will include classrooms, labs and faculty offices. Additional facilities, known as Classroom Office Building (COB) 1 and COB 2, will combine classrooms, faculty offices and other instructional space, such as an auditorium. </p>
<p align="left">During the 2006 legislative session, the university is seeking a $7.5 million annual investment from the Arizona Legislature to finance construction of these three new facilities, Jakubowski says. </p>
<p align="left">"Support from the community to approve this investment, and help in achieving all of our initiatives, will be vital for the university to provide a world-class polytechnic education to students," he says. </p>
