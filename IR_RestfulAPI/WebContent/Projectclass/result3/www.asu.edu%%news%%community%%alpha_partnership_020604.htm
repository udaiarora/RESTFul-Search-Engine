      <h2>ASU leads charge to increase support for Arizona educators, children, families </h2>
      <p>As pre-K-12 education emerges as a critical priority within ASU's vision of the "New American University," the spring 2004 launch of the first comprehensive university-school partnership, called Alpha Partnership, demonstrates ASU's long-term commitment to supporting educators, schools and families in the important work of educating Arizona's children. </p>
      <p>"While multiple factors directly affect learning in elementary and secondary schools, a significant responsibility for student-learning is owned by those of us at the university level," says Eugene Garcia, vice president for university-school partnerships, and dean of the College of Education. </p>
      <p>The Alpha Partnership began taking shape last fall in collaboration with State Sen. Richard Miranda (D-District 13), the Tolleson and Phoenix union high school districts, and their surrounding elementary feeder school districts. Alpha is the first of several university-school partnerships that will be established throughout the state within the next three to five years under the Office of University-School Partnerships, established June 2003. </p>
      <p>"A rash of under-performing schools, poor graduation rates, and the low number of students pursuing post-secondary educational opportunities in Arizona are clear indicators of the dramatic need for innovative, alternative programs to improve student achievement," Garcia says. "The university-school partnerships initiative endeavors to equip educators with the teaching skills and leadership capabilities that are needed to tackle those problems, and help students succeed regardless of their socioeconomic situation, cultural or ethnic background." </p>
      <p>The Alpha Partnership currently provides a comprehensive menu of 18 programs and resources for educators, schools and families and the list is expected to expand as additional linkages are established. Schools within the partnership districts have the flexibility to pick and choose from the programs, services and resources that are most needed to support the students and families that they serve. </p>
      <p>An example of Alpha Partnership programs includes "Leaps and Bounds," a kindergarten readiness program conceptualized and administered by the ASU Office of Youth Preparation. </p>
      <p>Launched this spring as a pilot in the Isaac Elementary School District, the program features a workshop series titled "The World as a Classroom" for parents and families of children ages three to five. The workshops demonstrate effective learning activities that can be conducted by all family members inside or outside the home, in the car and with music. </p>
      <p>"The most recent U.S. Census data revealed that only one in five parents within our community hold a GED or high school diploma," says Kent Scribner, superintendent of the Isaac school district. "So programs providing this type of service are very important to our district." </p>
      <p>The pilot program is currently serving 15 families at Isaac's David Kagan Family Educational Center, however, there are plans to expand it to include two additional sites next year. </p>
      <p>Scribner says that middle school students within his district are being touched by "Early Start to College," a three-day university immersion program designed to help participants transition to high school and then to college. Administered by ASU's Hispanic Border Leadership Institute, this program includes workshops for parents, provides financial aid and admissions information, and provides direct access to Arizona colleges and universities. </p>
      <p>The Rodel Community Scholars program has involved honors students from ASU's W. P. Carey School of Business in a mentoring program serving 120 students within the Tolleson Union High School District. The program is designed to help increase graduation rates among under-represented students in the district and to attract greater numbers of these students to the business school at ASU. </p>
      <p>"These are great programs that will benefit the kids in my district," says Miranda, who was a catalyst in the creation of the Alpha Partnership, which specifically targets school districts serving the West Valley communities he represents. "I'm looking forward to making sure that we can ensure good teachers and improve our graduation rates." </p>
      <p>Miranda, who is a member of the Senate Education Committee, initially appealed to Crow last spring requesting more direct support from the university for schools and families in his community. He has since joined Garcia as an active participant in the dialogues between ASU and West Valley-area school districts that resulted in the creation and launch of the Alpha Partnership. </p>
      <p>"Dr. Crow is a new force in the community," Miranda says. "He's aggressive and committed to the university playing a central role in increasing the success of our schools." </p>
      <p>The ASU University-School Partnerships initiative offers support in four areas - early childhood education; teachers; educational leaders; and students, schools and families.
