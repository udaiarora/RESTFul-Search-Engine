      <h2><strong>Life Sciences Professor Wins NSF CAREER Grant </strong></h2>
      <p>Young scientists who want to make it in the scientific community have to pay their dues. Aside from the time and money spent in graduate schools, hopefuls typically spend a few years working in the labs of other scientists, applying for postdoctoral positions and attempting to compile a list of publications as long as a Burmese python. It can be tough - putting in long hours while living a Spartan life and racking up student loan debt comes with the territory. The hope is that good hard work is recognized and that the cream does rise to the top. </p>
      <p>This year Leah Gerber, Assistant Professor in Arizona State University's School of Life Sciences, finds herself rising particularly high. Gerber, who is no stranger to hard work, has been awarded a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The CAREER Grant is specifically designed to help promising young scientists at the beginning of their careers become the academic leaders of the 21 st century. </p>
      <p>Gerber received her Ph.D. in 1998 and has studied marine mammals up and down the west coast of North America. Gerber is a cross-disciplinary scientist who has succeeded in focusing the scientific community's attention on the integration of population and ecosystem models as they pertain to marine mammal conservation.&nbsp; Her published research includes work on marine ecology, marine mammal population biology, conservation ecology and the conflict between conservation and resources. She has approached these topics from ecological, legal and policy perspectives. </p>
      <p>Gerber was awarded her CAREER Grant for a proposal she submitted to the NSF to study how the reproductive behavior of California sea lions in the Gulf of California affects their population status. According to Gerber, a better understanding of the relationship between behavior and reproduction might help us to make better decisions about marine mammal conservation. </p>
      <p>"For many years, behavioral ecologists have been arguing that behavior is important and that the agencies charged with monitoring population status should also study behavior," said Gerber, "but what is missing is a quantitative framework to include behavior in these population assessments." </p>
      <p>Gerber hopes to fill this gap, providing practitioners with guidelines for understanding when and how behavior should be an important component of a particular management strategy. </p>
      <p>According to Gerber's proposal, studying behavior can aid conservation efforts because individual differences in behavior and social status may help determine the rate of population change and thus the threat that imperiled species face in the real world. Gerber has designed her study to examine the effects of reproductive behavior on extinction risk for the sea lion populations she will be studying. </p>
      <p>In addition to the more empirical collection of behavioral data in the field, Gerber will also develop a theoretical research program that links this data to models that describe the demography of sea lions. She also hopes the theoretical research, along with her past work, will have more general application to other populations of conservation concern, and lead to the development of a general framework for integrating behaviors into estimates of extinction risk. </p>
      <p>Gerber's proposal to the NSF was no doubt strengthened by the work she has already done in her field. The CAREER Grant should help her to take her work to a new level. Said Gerber, "I've been thinking about these ideas from the time I was a Ph.D. student.&nbsp; I pursued them as a postdoc, and now starting a research program as a professor at ASU, I have the opportunity to think, what do I really want to do and how am I going to tackle it? This program gives me the luxury to plan strategically and decide what long term questions I want to answer." </p>
      <p>Gerber isn't the only one who will benefit from her success. The NSF encourages CAREER awardees to integrate research and education. For Gerber, this will involve undergraduate training and curriculum development, graduate and post-doctoral mentorship, outreach and communication of results to the general public. </p>
      <p>Gerber's team of graduate students and postdocs collaborate with her on various aspects of marine conservation in the Gulf of California, and she expects that the success of her new endeavors will be strengthened by their contributions.&nbsp; Gerber hopes her work will also foster research and teaching collaborations with Mexican undergraduate institutions, including a field research exchange program for students in the US and Mexico. </p>
      <p>Gerber has also been involved&nbsp; in developing&nbsp; ASU's School of Life Sciences undergraduate program in conservation biology.&nbsp; Said Gerber, "Our undergraduate major in Conservation Biology is a very exciting and promising program. What we try to do is convey to students that it is not enough to have passion for the environment.&nbsp; Students must be equipped with the necessary 'toolbox' to really make a difference in conservation practice.&nbsp; Mathematical models, for example, are common tools used by conservation biologists." </p>
      <p>Part of Gerber's NSF proposal provides support for a teaching assistant to assist her in developing a computer lab section that goes along with her course in advanced conservation biology. "My goal is for students to learn tools and techniques in population biology that they will need to apply scientific principles to decision making in real world conservation."</p>
