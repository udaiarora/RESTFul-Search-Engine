      <div align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        I didn't notice her until the yelling started. The pharmacy clerk was 
        trying<br>
        to tell her that the state would not pay for her prescription so soon. 
        I went over<br>
        to assert my authority and bring some reason to the scene. Upon evaluating 
        the<br>
        facts I told the young lady that the state welfare system expects a package 
        of<br>
        birth control pills to last for four weeks and she had gotten hers filled 
        just over<br>
        a week ago. She looked at me with question marks in her eyes and said, 
        "How<br>
        do they know?" I told her that there were twenty-eight tablets, one for 
        each<br>
        day, so, a 4 week supply. Now her eyes were filled with surprise and she<br>
        gasped, "You mean you don't take one every time?"<br>
        <br>
        There are always surprises in health care and there always will be. The<br>
        politicians can't seem to decide what is the best way to provide the best 
        health<br>
        care for the most Americans. It's a big issue, an important issue. My<br>
        experience has shown that the advent of managed or supervised health care 
        is<br>
        hastening the departure of compassion and humanity from the delivery of<br>
        health care. The focus has shifted to managed care, and with it a sense 
        that the<br>
        primary purpose of Medicine is to achieve the biggest bang for the buck. 
        <br>
        Managed care is so "managed" that the human components of caring sometime<br>
        get overrun. Front line providers of care are increasingly frustrated 
        by<br>
        decisions of bureaucratic managers who are not compassionate care givers.<br>
        <br>
        It is easy to lose sight of one's humanity when trying to service a seemingly<br>
        endless stream of "state assisted" patients. I've been there. I was having 
        one<br>
        of those harried winter days, when the flu bug was raging and prescriptions<br>
        were flooding the pharmacy. Although I made it a point to hand each patient<br>
        their prescription and tell them how to take it, I made no real human 
        contact. <br>
        Then I presented a filled Rx to Mrs. Browning telling her to take one 
        tablet<br>
        every morning to control her blood pressure. Thinking my duty complete, 
        I<br>
        started to turn away when I heard her ask me, "Do I get a smile with that?" 
        It<br>
        was like a splash of cold water in the face of a feverish man. I stopped 
        in my<br>
        tracks, took one brief look at the work piling up, then turned towards 
        her,<br>
        smiling. I said, "You not only get a smile, Mrs. B, you can have a hug 
        too if<br>
        you like." She answered by holding open her arms. After we hugged I took 
        the<br>
        time to chat with her, just like in "the good old days." With my spirit<br>
        brightened I returned to work with renewed vigor.<br>
        <br>
        It's amazing what a little human kindness and sympathy can do for one's<br>
        outlook! It's so important, not only to our routine dealings with our 
        fellow<br>
        humans, but is also crucial to our mental and physical health. Time after 
        time<br>
        we hear of healing with the aid of psychological or spiritual treatments.<br>
        <br>
        As a child, my family was fortunate to have a doctor who sincerely cared<br>
        for his patients. Dr. Pomerleau had an easy- going manner and the ability 
        to<br>
        make you feel better with a few well chosen words or a small squeeze on 
        the<br>
        shoulder. My Mom said that he could coax the germs right out of your body 
        if<br>
        you gave him the chance. We believed he could, too! I had a wart once 
        and<br>
        Dr. Pomerleau bought it. He pressed a penny on it, spoke some Latin, then<br>
        gave the penny to me and told me to throw it in a river or a stream. I 
        did as he<br>
        commanded and the wart soon disappeared.<br>
        <br>
        Most of today's medical care is not augmented by such metaphysical<br>
        phenomena. More and more, our medical care is being thought of as another<br>
        commodity. I believe that good medicine does not answer to the laws of<br>
        supply and demand. Yet, I have seen our state's welfare medical system 
        turn<br>
        doctors' offices into "fast health" joints where the patients are sent 
        through like<br>
        cattle. I have seen clinics where a doctor is rarely visible.<br>
        <br>
        One patient came to my pharmacy very distressed. Maria was terrified<br>
        because she knew she must be deathly ill. She had been to her clinic and 
        this<br>
        time they made her see THE DOCTOR! Maria had been going to this clinic<br>
        for over a year and had never seen the doctor. Now she had seen him and 
        he<br>
        scared her. She feared that her chart that he was holding contained some 
        dark<br>
        deadly secret. She was apprehensive, intimidated, and flustered. She left 
        the<br>
        clinic and headed straight to the pharmacy. Maria knew that she could 
        talk to<br>
        me. She hadn't even dared to ask the doctor any questions, so she didn't 
        ask<br>
        him about her bothersome cough. I told her she should consider herself 
        lucky<br>
        to have seen the doctor and that I was sure he would have told her if 
        anything<br>
        was seriously wrong. As for the cough, I told her that it was a common 
        side-<br>
        effect of her blood pressure medicine and suggested a sugar free lozenge.<br>
        <br>
        Many patients, like Maria, leave the doctor's office with little idea 
        of what<br>
        their medical problems are, let alone their possible solutions and ultimate<br>
        resolution. The delivery system of care is losing its sense of caring. 
        Patients<br>
        that do not assert themselves because of fear, ignorance, or inexperience 
        are<br>
        often not getting quality care.<br>
        <br>
        The problem does not affect every provider. A great many medical offices<br>
        still take the time to interact with their patients even as they examine,<br>
        interrogate, and treat. These clinicians, by necessity, spend more time 
        with<br>
        their patients. Of course, this means they must be willing to disregard 
        the<br>
        financial incentives that drive them to see more patients in less time. 
        <br>
        Additionally, many HMOs are now examining patient satisfaction levels, 
        with<br>
        some even establishing a maximum number of patients per hour for their<br>
        physicians.<br>
        <br>
        But what can be done to ensure that our medical needs are attended to 
        by<br>
        concerned, compassionate professionals? We have plenty of boards and<br>
        certifying bodies to ensure that the practitioner meets minimum educational<br>
        requirements, but what kind of committee can monitor and encourage<br>
        compassion? It really can't be measured by outside review, but a discerning<br>
        patient can tell when a care giver is acting without empathy. <br>
        <br>
        So maybe a well-informed patient population is a key factor in the<br>
        delivery of quality medical care. But it's probably a pipe dream to hope 
        that a<br>
        provider group or even an insurance company would pay for a training<br>
        program that results in more aggressive patients. I would think that some 
        of<br>
        these bean-counting bureaucrats would pale at the thought of knowledgable<br>
        patients demanding that their doctors spend enough time with them to explain<br>
        their condition and treatment. The patients are the ones that should really 
        be<br>
        scared, though. What do you do if you're stuck with an unsympathetic doctor<br>
        in a health plan that allows you no other choice? With universal coverage<br>
        without freedom of choice, a lot of us could end up in that situation.<br>
        <br>
        We do have a chance to create a health care delivery system that will<br>
        retain the human qualities that make some medical recoveries so incredible. 
        <br>
        Concern and compassion must be encouraged and allowed to flourish. This<br>
        will not happen in an atmosphere of overpowering economic pressures. The<br>
        system must be sure to allow patients to search for and find doctors that 
        they<br>
        can respect, trust, and believe in. Allow healthy competition to drive 
        the<br>
        system towards higher levels of quality. <br>
        <br>
        Pharmacists have always been a very accessible link in the health care<br>
        system and should insist that they remain so. It would be to our benefit 
        to<br>
        insist on that same accessability for all health care providers.<br>
        <br>
        No matter what kind of health care system we end up with, it will<br>
        probably be subsidized by the taxpayer. We can only hope that the taxes 
        are<br>
        kept to a minumum. One of my young patients had an interesting comment<br>
        about taxes. The young man had been browsing near the pharmacy counter 
        for<br>
        quite a while. When I got the chance I asked if I could help him. "I need 
        to<br>
        buy some condoms, but I don't have much money," he said shyly. I pointed 
        to<br>
        a box of three and said they were ninety-nine cents.<br>
        "Great, I'll take those," he said, sounding relieved.<br>
        I rang up his purchase, saying, "That will be one dollar and six cents."<br>
        He seemed suprised and said, "But you said 99 cents!<br>
        "Yes," I replied, "and seven cents for the tax."<br>
        With eyes wide, he blurted, "Tacks, if you have to hold them on with tacks<br>
        then forget it!" Then he ran for the door.<br>
