<h1 class="storyhead">School of Life Sciences professors make time for musical pursuits </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p> The iconic picture of a research professor is someone with gray hair and thick glasses straining over a lab bench, trying to summon order out of chaos. In the School of Life Sciences (SoLS), the musical pursuits of research professors conjure up completely different images instead. </p>
<p> SoLS professors Elizabeth Davidson, Robert Roberson and Ronald Rutowski are researchers cast from a different mold. All three professors play and perform music &ndash; and they have throughout their academic careers. </p>
<p> A typical research professor juggles a schedule that involves any number of meetings and seminars, managing a research lab full of students, applying for grants and conducting experiments that seemingly leave time for little else. </p>
<p> But Barbara Crowe, a professor of music therapy at ASU, is not surprised that busy professors make time for music. </p>
<p> &ldquo;Music is a fundamental human behavior,&rdquo; she says. </p>
<p> Crowe says that there is a &ldquo;primal emotionality that goes into music,&rdquo; and that music has a strong genetic basis. She also notes that there is a strong association between the auditory nerve and the limbic system, which is a group of interconnected structures in the brain that mediate emotions, learning and memory. </p>
<p> Roberson, a professor of cell biology, says that playing music is &ldquo;all about whether you have something to communicate,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;there are a lot of similarities between lecturing and playing (guitar).&rdquo; </p>
<p> Roberson says the Beatles inspired him to take up the guitar in the &rsquo;60s. He would have his mom write down the lyrics of the songs as he and his brother, who also played the guitar, would listen and figure out the chord progressions. Roberson had no formal musical training in high school or college, but he has kept pursuing his love for music throughout his academic career. He enjoys reworking music that he grew up listening to, and describes playing music as &ldquo;rejuvenating.&rdquo; </p>
<p> Local coffee shops and bars lately have been showcasing Roberson&rsquo;s solo concoctions. He enjoys putting together songs of his own that have been buzzing around his head for the past 30 years. Roberson credits his unique musical style to a diverse group of artists, ranging from Neil Young to Philip Glass. </p>
<p> Betty Davidson, a research professor of insect and amphibian pathology, has been singing with the Dayspring Chorale, which is one of several choirs at the Dayspring United Methodist Church , in Tempe since 1985. Singing in the choir has taken Davidson on several concert tours, as the group has traveled and performed in Germany , France , Italy , Austria and Switzerland . </p>
<p> Studying music was not something that Davidson was encouraged to do as a child, even though she always was singing as a young girl. When she started going to the Dayspring United Methodist Church and singing with the choir, she found a fascinating contrast to life as a professor. Davidson said that the choir brings together people from many different backgrounds with experiences very different from her own. She has been able to sing choral music there, dating from the American Revolution to modern African-American gospel, with doctors, car salesmen, lawyers and others. </p>
<p> Davidson also has found some things in her musical training that transferred well to science. As a singer, she has learned the importance of volume, tone and spacing, which applies to the communication of musical themes as well as to communication between colleagues and students. </p>
<p> The artful use of pauses and space in lectures can make what might be a boring stream of words more entertaining, leading to more meaningful communication, she says. </p>
<p> Ron Rutowski, a professor of biology, likes to keep his fiddling expertise quiet. But his skills are well-known in the Valley, since it&rsquo;s hard to keep quiet that he toured with international recording artist Glen Campbell in the &rsquo;90s. He plays a variety of styles, including bluegrass, country and folk. </p>
<p> This summer, Rutowski played with Igor&rsquo;s Jazz Cowboys at a jazz festival in Los Angeles . He also played in concerts with some local country-rock bands, and in recording sessions with local folk, country and gospel singer-songwriters. Rutowski&rsquo;s favorite type of concert is the kind where he gets to combine the different styles and sounds he&rsquo;s learned. He does that in the local band Poor Alfred (<a href="http://www.pooralfred.com">www.pooralfred.com</a>), which plays once a month at the Rio Salado Brewing Co. </p>
<p> Rutowski says that &ldquo;the pattern of biology and music has always been there.&rdquo; He started playing in bands in high school and has never stopped. When asked why he continues to play music, he says it was because it &ldquo;takes a high level of concentration, and can be tremendously rejuvenating.&rdquo; </p>
