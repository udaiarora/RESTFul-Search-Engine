<h4>Bio</h4>

<p><strong class="start">Dr. William E. Lewis</strong> was appointed Vice Provost for 
Information Technology (IT) at Arizona State University in July 1993 after serving one 
year as Interim Director of Academic and Communications Technology. Employing over 
240 people, IT includes telecommunication services and academic/administrative 
computing on the Tempe main campus.</p>

<p>
Lewis has served as a faculty member in the College of Engineering and 
Applied Sciences for over 30 years.  In July 1980 he was the founding chair of the 
Computer Science Department and served as its chair until July 1985.  Since July 1985 he 
has served as both Assistant and Associate Dean in the College of Engineering and 
Applied Sciences with responsibility for Engineering Computer Services, budget, space, 
personnel, and other college activities.</p>

<p>
Lewis served as project leader for the development of the signature 
verification system for the Maricopa County Recorder&#8217;s Office.  This activity 
resulted in the successful verification of over a quarter of a million signatures in the 
Mecham recall drive, without a protest.</p>

<p>For approximately two years, Lewis served on the quality assurances 
committee of the Enterprise Project for ADOT.  He worked with the Arizona Department 
of Health Services on the design of a statewide database to support the Behavioral Health 
Division.  He also served as the evaluation analyst for the Phoenix Alcohol Safety Action 
Program.  This included writing all of the data reduction software required to meet the 
reporting requirements set up by the U.S. Department of Transportation.  His research 
activities have generated more than $7,000,000 in major research contracts for ASU.  
</p>

<p>Lewis received his B.S.E. in Industrial Engineering from The Johns 
Hopkins University and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from Northwestern 
University specializing in &#8220;Theoretical Computer Science&#8221;.  He is a 
member of UPE (Computer Science Honor Society), Alpha Pi Mu (Industrial 
Engineering Honor Society), Sigma Xi (Science Honor Society), and Tau Beta Pi 
(Engineering Honor Society).  </p>

<p>Bill Lewis, his wife Mary Frances, and their seven children are long 
time residents of Tempe.</p>
