However, <a href="acd002.html#facultymember" target="New">faculty members</a> who have applied for promotion may be given by the department chair (or center or school director) and/or the supervising dean a general oral statement regarding the strengths and weaknesses of their application for promotion as evaluated at the department or college level.  This can be done before the materials are forwarded to the next level so that the faculty member may withdraw the request for promotion if he or she desires to do so.  Committee votes are not to be disclosed.<p><b>Tenure Review</b><p>Faculty members under review either during or prior to their final probationary year may be informed orally by the chair and/or dean (as outlined above) of the recommendations being made so that the faculty member may withdraw the request if he or she desires to do so.<p><b>Probationary Review</b><p>Faculty members under review prior to their final probationary year may be informed orally by the chair and/or dean of the recommendations being made.<p>Upon completion of the probationary review, the executive vice president and provost of the university or designee will notify each dean in writing whether the faculty member will be retained, retained conditionally, or given a terminal contract for the succeeding year.  Those faculty who will receive a terminal contract or whose contracts are not being renewed for a succeeding year will be notified in writing by the executive vice president and provost of the university.<p>Faculty who undergo probationary reviews will be informed of the results in writing by their deans or department chairs by April 15 with notification of the retention decisions from the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University.  At the time that faculty members are informed of the retention decisions, they must also be given a copy of the written reviews submitted by each level in the probationary third-year review process, e.g., faculty personnel committee, department chair, college personnel committee, and college dean.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Notification of Conditional Contract</b></font><p>A faculty member who is recommended for a conditional contract must be notified by his or her dean no later than April 15.  The faculty member will have 30 calendar days to petition the dean with reasons for a review of the decision.  If the petition is not received by May 15, the conditional contract will not be reconsidered.<p>If a conditional contract is offered to a faculty member, the dean must state condition(s) that must be met to warrant a regular contract the following year.  A copy of the letter stating the conditions must be sent to the vice provost for academic personnel by May 15.  Whenever a conditional contract is awarded, either a probationary or tenure review must be conducted the next year to determine whether the conditions have been met.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Final Notification of Action</b></font><p>Individuals being considered for promotion or tenure will be informed in writing of the final decision by the executive vice president and provost of the university by May 12 of the year in which the review was conducted.<p>Probationary faculty who are reviewed before their final probationary year will be informed in writing by their deans or department chairs after the deans have received written notification of retention decisions from the executive vice president and provost of the university.<p>All faculty on <a href="acd002.html#ProbationaryAppointments" target="New">probationary appointments</a> who are not to be retained will be notified by the executive vice president and provost of the university by May 12 of the current year.<p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-Reference</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>See <a href="acd508-01.html">ACD 508&#150;01</a>, &#147;Nonreappointment.&#148;<p>&#160;<p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
