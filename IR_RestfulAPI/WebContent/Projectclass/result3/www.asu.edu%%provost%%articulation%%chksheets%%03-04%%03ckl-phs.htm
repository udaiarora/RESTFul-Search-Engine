Symbolic Systems</FONT> </H3>
<P>The Department of Philosophy offers a Certificate in Symbolic Systems. The 
Certificate program takes an interdisciplinary approach to cognition, 
computation, and meaning. Course work is divided evenly between Philosophy, 
Psychology, and Computer Science in order to expose students to the subject 
matter from a conceptual, empirical, and practical point of view. The 
Certificate may interest students with majors in any of the three disciplines, 
or other students who wish to add breadth to their degree through work in the 
other disciplines on topics of common interest.</P>
