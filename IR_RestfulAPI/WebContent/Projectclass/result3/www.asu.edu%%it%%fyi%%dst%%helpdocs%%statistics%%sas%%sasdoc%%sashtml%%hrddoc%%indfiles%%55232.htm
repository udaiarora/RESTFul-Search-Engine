Gain a real-world perspective on statistical methods used in quality       control applications. The example-based approach guides you through
using SAS/QC software to analyze quality control data and improve          processes. Readers with SAS programming experience and statistics
knowledge will learn how to produce and interpret check sheets, Pareto     charts, Ishikawa diagrams, defect concentration diagrams, scatter
diagrams, control charts, histograms, and more! Those new to quality       control will benefit from the detailed section on data collection.
Filled with illustrations, this book gives you a behind-the-scenes look    at quality control tasks performed with and without the SQC and ADX menu
systems. Also featured are strategies for designing and analyzing          experiments, creating sampling plans, analyzing gage repeatability and
reproducibility studies, and performing tolerance and linear calibration   analysis with SAS software.
