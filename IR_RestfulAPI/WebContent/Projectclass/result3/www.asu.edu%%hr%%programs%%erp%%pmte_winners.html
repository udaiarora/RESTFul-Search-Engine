			 <P><A NAME="2003 Pre-reg"><B>Spring 2003 Pre-Registration Ad Hoc
				Recovery Team</B></A></P> 
			 <P>Pre-registration is the beginning step of the registration process
				at ASU. It gives students their first opportunity to enroll and enhances their
				chances to register for the classes they request. Pre-registration also
				benefits the academic colleges by providing preliminary data to assist in
				evaluating course demand for the upcoming semester, so that they know whether
				to add or cancel classes. </P> 
			 <P>During the processing of Spring 2003 pre-registration, the
				implementation of another mainframe application unexpectedly compromised the
				processing, resulting in the deactivation of course edits before the final run.
				Course edits are essential and provide colleges the ability to control
				eligibility for particular classes, by restricting enrollment to students in
				certain colleges or majors or by checking for prerequisites. </P> 
			 <P>Staff in the Registrar's Office and Information Technology, along
				with select college representatives, formed an ad hoc recovery team which
				quickly and effectively identified the problem and its scope, evaluated
				possible corrective actions, communicated updates to the campus community, and
				successfully reprocessed 144,189 class scheduling requests for nearly 32,000
				students in less than a week. </P> 
			 <H3><A NAME="2001-20002">President's Medal Award Recipients for
				2001-2002</A></H3> 
			 <P><A NAME="ASU Interactive Single Sign-On"><B>ASU Interactive Single
				Sign-On</B></A></P> 
			 <P>Access to Internet-based university services, such as Admissions,
				Financial Assistance, Change of Address, Accounts Receivable Payment, Grades,
				Class Schedule and ASU email, is essential to the success of prospective,
				current and former students. These are core services for students and other
				University constituents. Previously, students were burdened with keeping track
				of multiple login credentials, which made access confusing and difficult; and
				there were many different on-screen presentations for the student to navigate
				through. Each presentation was dependant on the programmer who developed the
				application. The Interactive Single Sign-on team's mission was to simplify
				those login processes enabling convenient and effective service
				delivery.<BR><BR> The results are impressive. A diverse team of professionals
				set aside functional boundaries and worked together to develop a consistent
				process for gaining access to University computer applications. This process is
				simple, secure, and repeatable for current and future applications. With a
				single ID and Password combination, students can access all core services.
				Additional positive outcomes include simplifying maintenance of the programs
				and significantly reducing the demand on central ASU computer resources. </P> 
			 <P><A
				NAME="ASU Windows 2000 Active Directory Implementation Project"><B>ASU Windows
				2000 Active Directory Implementation Project</B></A></P> 
			 <P>The ASU Windows 2000 Active Directory Implementation Team was
				established in March 1999 to develop an approach to Windows 2000 Active
				Directory implementation that would provide for maximum possible integration
				capability for units and interoperability with non-Windows 2000 servers and
				services at ASU. The team was made up of assigned members and volunteers who
				were all Windows server administrators at ASU, and these team members worked
				for over 2 years on the design and implementation of the final architecture of
				the ASU Windows 2000 Active Directory (AD.ASU.EDU). <BR><BR> The final design
				provides for integration with all current ASU technology infrastructure
				services and accommodates a variety of options and methods for units across the
				university to participate in the implementation. The design provides for
				reduced administration resources needed by many units and also provides a
				single sign-on solution for accessing Windows resources across the university.
				It is anticipated that most of the over 170 NT domains at ASU will be
				integrated in some manner into the design prepared by this team. </P> 
			 <P><A NAME="Buysense Team"><B>Buysense Team</B></A></P> 
			 <P>The Buysense Team developed and implemented a Web-based ordering
				system that places catalogs that feature University contract pricing on the
				user's desktop and allows users to simply click on the items they need without
				having to be trained to use the University's financial management system.
				Buysense is the first electronic ordering system in higher education that is
				fully integrated to a financial management system. This integration allows
				Buysense orders to be checked against fund availability in Advantage, the
				University's financial management system. Buysense also pushes line item detail
				of items orders into Advantage. Payment requests are also integrated with
				Advantage, so that suppliers are paid faster and all expense detail is posted
				to the appropriate fund account. This initiative cut the expected time from
				requisition to delivery from the current eight days in Advantage to two days in
				Buysense. This 400 percent reduction in delivery time will enhance the
				University's ability to meet its missions of instruction, research, and public
				service. The Buysense project places the University on the forefront of using
				the Web to enhance business processes. </P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Herberger College Web Development Team">Herberger
				College Web Development Team</A></H4> 
			 <P>The 2000 naming of The Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts
				provided a unique opportunity to forge a fresh identity. During a multi-month
				strategic assessment, the college identified key stakeholders of its six
				top-ranked academic and research units and developed "promises" that would
				permeate its branding efforts:<BR> </P> 
			 <UL TYPE="CIRCLE"> 
				<LI>Be accomplished, vibrant and innovative. </LI> 
				<LI>Promote collaborative discovery. </LI> 
				<LI>Nurture a connected community. </LI> 
				<LI>Offer stakeholders a transforming experience.</LI> 
			 </UL> 
			 <P>In a comprehensive audit of communications, the college's Web site
				surfaced as a product with great potential - and great need for improvement. It
				had evolved over time, with many authors, learn-as-you-go design and lengthy
				print-based documents for content. It needed a total remake, but the
				Communications Group had neither the budget for expensive outside consultation,
				nor the time and right combination of talent and technical expertise to handle
				the task alone. What emerged was a multi-talented, cross-functional team
				supported by a faculty-staff advisory group.<BR><BR> Six months later the
				college launched a dynamic new site. After only four months, the site had
				almost 250,000 visits. Total visitorship was up 53 percent and repeat
				visitorship was up 61 percent. <BR></P> 
			 <H3><A NAME="2000-20001">President's Medal Award Recipients for
				2000-2001</A></H3> 
			 <H4><A NAME="ASU West Mobile Computer Classroom Team">Arizona State University at the West Campus Mobile
				Computer Classroom Team</A></H4> 
			 <P>To provide better and more flexible course scheduling of tight
				computer classroom resources, the ASU West Mobile Computer Classroom Project
				studied and implemented a wireless, internet-ready classroom. Testing state of
				the art equipment, they created a configuration that could be used by classes
				of any size up to 45 students that needed infrequent access to computer
				workstations, ASU West resources and software, and internet access.<BR> <BR>
				ASU at the West Campus mobile computer classroom service can now temporarily convert any
				ASU at the West campus classroom into a computer classroom. Instructors may arrange for 15,
				30, or 45 Pentium laptop computers to be delivered to their traditional
				classrooms. Once delivered, a quick setup process allows the computers to
				access the Internet through a wireless connection. The full suite of campus
				software is installed on each laptop. </P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="ACEPT">Arizona Collaborative for Excellence in the
				Preparation of Teachers (ACEPT)</A></H4> 
			 <P>A team of eleven ASU science, mathematics and science/math
				education faculty have collaborated for five years with faculty from ten
				Maricopa Community College District (MCCD) colleges and Din&eacute; College
				(DC) (formerly Navajo Community College) to improve undergraduate science and
				mathematics teaching for all students, with the parallel and coincident goal of
				better preparing future K-12 teachers. The ACEPT development team wrote the
				proposal that, through a competitive review process, received the financial
				support of the National Science Foundation for the five-year period ending in
				June of 2000. This team then guided the project through five years of funding,
				ultimately contributing to the better science and mathematics preparation of
				all students graduating from ASU and, through the teacher education programs,
				to the better understanding of science and mathematics by children in K-12
				educational system.<BR><BR> As a result of this team's effort, ACEPT-driven
				reforms have impacted 65 post-secondary courses, 180 science and mathematics
				faculty, 250,000 ASU, MCCD and DC undergraduate students, virtually all
				elementary and secondary education majors in the ASU Professional Teacher
				Preparation Program (PTPP), and 38% of all Arizona undergraduates studying to
				become K-12 teachers. The ACEPT team has also created two new and innovative
				teacher education programs.<BR><BR> The ACEPT team developed and delivered
				faculty workshops to improve teaching, and developed and used assessment
				instruments to measure student achievement, scientific reasoning skills and
				student views toward science and mathematics. These measurements document the
				substantial degree to which ACEPT reforms have impacted student learning-large
				achievement gains were measured in ACEPT-improved courses compared with
				traditionally taught courses. The ACEPT Reformed Teacher Observation Protocol
				(RTOP) provides compelling evidence that the student gains measured are
				attributable to the ACEPT reforms. The RTOP, perhaps one of ACEPT's greatest
				legacies, is beginning to be used nationally as an accepted instrument to
				measure the extent of teacher reform. <BR> </P>

				1999-2000</A></H3> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Day of Hire">Day of Hire Task Force</A></H4> 
			 <P>The Day of Hire Task Force came together in November 1997 to
				improve the employment/orientation process for over 1,000 new benefits-eligible
				employees hired at ASU each year. The employment/orientation process begins at
				the time a candidate accepts an offer of employment and includes the new
				employee receiving a New Employee Packet, attending a three-part New Employee
				Orientation, completing employment/payroll and benefits forms, obtaining
				temporary and permanent ID cards, obtaining temporary and permanent parking
				permits, and obtaining a computer account. Representatives from Human
				Resources, Purchasing, Parking, and Information Technology worked together to
				redesign and streamline the process. </P> 
			 <P>In 1997, newly-hired benefits-eligible employees had to make at
				least 7 trips to 5 different locations to submit paperwork and obtain services.
				The employment/orientation process was a disjointed, time-consuming, and
				inconvenient process. </P> 
			 <P>By 1999, the following improvements were accomplished: </P> 
			 <UL> 
				<LI>A revamped, customer-friendly New Employee Packet is delivered
				  to hiring departments and new employees earlier in the process. New information
				  sheets, checklists, and a color-coded map help guide hiring departments and new
				  employees through each step. </LI> 
				<LI>The format of HR Employee Orientation has been improved by
				  extending the time devoted to answering questions about benefits, making
				  viewing of the Public Service Orientation video optional, and presenting an
				  overview of the university via a high-quality multi-media presentation. </LI> 
				<LI>Sign-on services are now offered during orientation that save
				  the employee from having to make multiple trips to obtain services. </LI> 
				<LI>A web site for new employees is now on line at
				  http://www.asu.edu/hr/empinv/empori.htm. </LI> 
				<LI>A network is in place for communicating process changes and for
				  exchanging information with Human Resources staff, service providers, Business
				  Operations Managers, hiring departments, and new employees. </LI> 
			 </UL> 
			 <P>New Employee Orientation now welcomes new employees to ASU,
				assists them with completing necessary forms and obtaining services, acquaints
				them with the university's organization and mission, helps them understand that
				they are important contributing members of the university and of the state, and
				sets them up for a successful career at ASU. </P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Tax Credits">Education Tax Credits Reporting
				Team</A></H4> 
			 <P> ASU's Education Tax Credits Reporting Team was established to
				satisfy the mandates of the federal Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 by </P> 
			 <UL> 
				<LI>providing financial information to ASU students enabling them
				  to take advantage of two new federal education tax credits, and </LI> 
				<LI>reporting similar information to the IRS. </LI> 
			 </UL> 
			 <P>One of the team's primary goals was to make information easily
				available to students, so they could determine their eligibility for the tax
				credits. Summary reports (1098-Ts) and ASU Student Supplemental Reports were
				mailed to 62,732 students on February 1, 1999. Because of the thoroughness of
				the information ASU provided, fewer than 450 students called for more
				information, and the informational web site experienced just over 2,500 hits.
				</P> 
			 <P>This project incorporated good planning, cross-departmental
				teamwork, and efficient use of limited resources within a tight time frame.
				Even with these constraints, the team met the IRS reporting requirements and
				exceeded the student information requirements. By maintaining a strong focus on
				the students' needs, ASU compared extremely favorably with other post-secondary
				institutions in satisfying these requirements. </P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="GARP">Executive Team for the Graduate Admissions
				Reengineering Project</A></H4> 
			 <P>Team members of the Graduate Admissions Reengineering Project
				(GARP) have reengineered the admission process for graduate study at ASU and
				implemented multiple supporting technological enhancements. An average of
				21,500 applications are processed each year by Graduate Admissions with 11,000
				of these arriving during the peak period between November and March. </P> 
			 <P>Through the efforts of the team: </P> 
			 <UL> 
				<LI>Students can now access admissions information and submit their
				  application via the web. 65% of all applications are now received via the web.
				  Information is available to applicants immediately, mailing costs are reduced,
				  and information is directly loaded to ASU's student database eliminating 1164
				  hours of data entry annually. </LI> 
				<LI>Academic units' ability to proactively recruit top applicants
				  has been enhanced through the Academic Unit Interface. Application information
				  is available to academic units on-line within hours of data entry in the
				  Graduate College. Admission recommendations are made on-line and due to
				  filters, 85% of admission recommendations no longer require manual review in
				  the Graduate College. </LI> 
				<LI>Paper applications are scanned and automatically uploaded to
				  the Student Information System freeing staff time for other customer services.
				  </LI> 
				<LI>The material from 12 informational pieces was rewritten and
				  consolidated into one application booklet and the language changed to a more
				  customer friendly tone. </LI> 
			 </UL> 
			 <P>Attracting top students is vital for Arizona State University to
				continue its rise to one of the nation's top educational institutions. The
				changes made to the admissions process will enhance and support the
				university's efforts to bring the country's best to Arizona. </P> 
			 <H3><A NAME="1998-99">President's Medal Award Recipients for

			 <H4><A NAME="Courtyard Cafes">Arizona State University at the West Campus Courtyard Cafes Planning
				Team</A></H4> 
			 <P>Provost Elaine P. Maimon organized a Planning Committee to develop
				a concept and implementation plan for the first major fundraising event in the
				history of ASU at the West campus. Key considerations were community perceptions,
				fundraising, strategy, type and scope of event, target markets, internal
				staffing capabilities, underwriting possibilities, and budgetary concerns.</P> 
			 <P>After weeks of brainstorming and research, the Courtyard Cafes
				gala was conceived--an evening event featuring a silent auction, music and food
				from a variety of ethnic traditions to "celebrate our diversity through music."
				The campus venue would offer a continuous schedule of bands playing in each
				courtyard on campus.</P> 
			 <P>Through the dedication of the Office of Institutional Advancement
				and volunteers, Courtyard Cafes met its primary goal of creating a $10,000
				scholarship endowment and surpassed expectations of attendance (450), corporate
				support (10 underwriters), silent auction donations (99), volunteer assistance
				(66), and campus camaraderie (improved relationships and morale). By careful
				study of goals and objectives, sound methodology and planning, and the use of
				available expertise, the gala will now serve as the campus&#146;s annual
				signature event.</P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Service Delivery">Arizona State University at the Tempe Campus Human Resources
				Integrated Service Delivery Model</A></H4> 
			 <P>Three years ago, ASU at the Tempe Campus Human Resources Department
				undertook a multifaceted program review to assess our effectiveness in meeting
				the needs of ASU and to identify recommendations for improvement. Based on
				information provided through an internal self-study and customer feed back, an
				External Review Team concluded that the HR organizational structure hindered
				the ability of HR staff to adequately serve the university community.</P> 
			 <P>In response to this finding, Human Resources appointed three broad
				based teams to design a new organizational structure that would be
				future-oriented; provide seamless services; view HR through our customers&#146;
				eyes; ensure consistent, timely information; provide high quality programs and
				services; and enable continuous improvement.</P> 
			 <P> In July 1998, Human Resources fully implemented a new integrated
				service delivery model to meet the needs of 21<SUP>st</SUP> century ASU:</P> 
			 <UL> 
				<LI>a one-stop HR Customer Service Center;</LI> 
				<LI>HR Partners who provide professional-level advice;</LI> 
				<LI>Workforce Programs that foster individual and organizational
				  effectiveness; and </LI> 
				<LI>HR Leadership Team who provide strategic direction and support
				  to the HR staff.</LI> 
			 </UL> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Campus Announcement">Arizona State University at the West Campus Announcement
				Team</A></H4> 
			 <P>The ASU at the West Campus Announcement project was chartered to help
				improve the overall level of information that the ASU at the West Campus faculty and staff have
				about operations and events that are of interest to them.</P> 
			 <P>The result of the project was implementation of a new service at
				the ASU West campus that permits faculty and staff to send e-mail announcements to various
				segments of the community using either a simple Web interface or their Outlook
				mail clients. The service was put into operation November 3, 1998. Results from
				the first two months of operation reflect that the service is being used for
				its intended purpose, and that it is meeting a need that had been expressed by
				many people over many years.</P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Process Coordination">Graduate Admissions Re-engineering
				Project Admissions Process Coordination Team</A></H4> 
			 <P>The Admissions Process Coordination Team redesigned the process of
				evaluating applications for admission to graduate study at Arizona State
				University. During peak cycle, over 10,500 applications with supporting
				materials are processed by Graduate Admissions Staff.</P> 
			 <P>By totally redesigning the process, the team improved service to
				its customers b</P> 
			 <UL> 
				<LI>Reducing the maximum turnaround time for processing files
				  during the heaviest influx of applications from 4-5 week to 48 hours.
				  Turnaround time during non-peak periods was reduced from 3 days to 24
				  hours.</LI> 
				<LI>Revising application materials to better organize the
				  information and make it easier to read</LI> 
				<LI>Maximizing academic unit flexibility in determining when an
				  applicant file is ready for review </LI> 
			 </UL> 
			 <P>Efficiencies gained include:</P> 
			 <UL> 
				<LI>Moving to smaller base of full time employees (from 13 to 9)
				  while increasing utilization of temporary employees during peak periods.
				  Employee reduction was achieved through attrition for an annual salary savings
				  of $68,4111 plus benefits.</LI> 
			 </UL> 
			 <UL> 
				<LI>An annual reduction of 37,000 photocopies and elimination of
				  4,600 files.</LI> 
			 </UL> 
			 <P>Attracting top students is vital for Arizona State University to
				continue its rise to one of the nation&#146;s top educational institutions. The

			 <H4><A NAME="Electronic Messaging">Electronic Messaging Team</A></H4>
			 
			 <P>The Electronic Messaging Team (E-Team) consists of 5 staff members
				that provide customer and technical support for 56,000 electronic mail (e-mail)
				users at Arizona State University. The E-Team supports the use of messaging
				systems such as Office Vision, ASUMail, Pine, Simeon, Netscape and Microsoft
				Exchange. </P> 
			 <P>During the last year, the E-Team embarked upon a project to

			 <P>"On a lot of these processes, students are shielded somewhat from
				how complex the system is by the heroic efforts of staff" - Lou Ann Denny,
				Registrar, ASU Insight, January 13, 1995. </P> 
			 <P>The Student Accounts and Accounts Receivable Team, a cross
				functional team representing the Comptroller's Office, Applications and
				Consulting Information Technology and the Student Financial Assistance Office,
				developed a three phase plan to move the existing Accounts Receivable system
				from an antiquated batch system to an on-line system supportive of self-service
				and one-stop service. </P> 
			 <P>In May 1997, Phase I of this project was completed, delivering an
				application to customers throughout the university community. For the first
				time, staff customers are able to view account history on-line, produce ad hoc
				reports, and automatically audit accounts. The application facilitates audit
				procedures providing staff the ability to respond to student's inquiries four
				times more quickly than before. The application also facilitates on-going
				analysis and has set a foundation for future development. </P>

			 <H4><A NAME="DARS Team">DARS Team</A></H4> 
			 <P>The DARS Team is responsible for the implementation of the Degree
				Audit Reporting System, an on-line system used primarily for tracking a
				student's progress toward degree completion. A collaborative group with members
				from Applications and Consulting Information Technology (ACIT) and the Division
				of Undergraduate Academic Services (DUAS), the team has been together since the
				fall of 1995 and has: </P> 
			 <UL> 
				<LI>Installed and tested the DARS software </LI> 
				<LI>Encoded, verified, and made available to academic advisors more
				  than 250 academic programs (majors and their variations) for all three
				  campuses, for the 1996-98 catalog year </LI> 
				<LI>Coded 200,000 courses from the Arizona community colleges to
				  automatically fulfill requirements based on prior articulation agreements </LI>
				
				<LI>Coded several thousand courses from University of Arizona,
				  Northern Arizona University and Brigham Young University. </LI> 
				<LI>Trained 300 users to use DARS with students </LI> 
				<LI>Organized several university-wide committees to provide input
				  and solutions for implementation. </LI> 
			 </UL> 
			 <P>DARS has also been used to streamline labor intensive, time

				equivalencies and replacing the undergraduate Program of Study.<BR></P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="SPRP Coord">Student Process Reengineering Project
				Coordinating Team</A></H4> 
			 <P>The Student Process Reengineering Project (SPRP) was organized in
				the fall of 1993 to review and act on opportunities to improve Arizona State
				University's student academic support and student business processes. Sponsored
				by the Senior Vice President and Provost, Vice President of Student Affairs,
				and Vice President of Information Technology, the project pioneered new
				approaches to continuous improvement at ASU. </P> 
			 <P>This application for the President's Medal Award is made on behalf
				of thirteen individuals who committed twenty hours a week during the month of
				September 1995 to create a bridge between the design phase of SPRP and the
				implementation phase. This intensive team effort produced an implementation
				plan for new and improved student services that was innovative, cost effective,
				and consistent with the project's vision. In addition, the team created a
				Student Services Delivery Model that will guide continuous improvement to
				student business services into the next century. </P> 
			 <P>Many higher education institutions have made contact with the
				project manager as a result of posting the Student Service Delivery Model at
				our project's Web site and through presentations at regional and national
				conferences. Universities as far away as Shenshen, China have asked for more
				information on ASU's Student Service Delivery Model and now it is being
				deployed. Here in the states, institutions such as MIT have acknowledged the
				value of the Student Service Delivery Model as a benchmark for their student
				services reengineering project, and in early 1997 the SPRP project manager and
				co-leader of the coordinating Team was invited to University of Maryland at
				College Park to deliver a presentation on the Student Delivery Model and
				project management.<BR><BR> 
				<A NAME="Fletcher Footnotes"><B>Arizona State University at the West Campus <BR>
				Fletcher Footnotes Production Team</B></A></P> 
			 <P>Recognizing the need for an effective communication vehicle that
				would reach staff members throughout the library, the Fletcher Footnotes team
				developed the mission of providing "clear, concise, creative communication
				within the Fletcher community" via the Fletcher Footnotes newsletter. In mid
				1996 our mission was threatened by the labor, cost, and time-intensive
				production of the newsletter and a shortage in staff time. The team
				brainstormed possibilities and developed the concept of an electronic
				newsletter, which would cut production time in half, eliminate costs, and
				better reach readers by being delivered through e-mail. The electronic format
				has allowed for minimal proofing, continuous flexible updating and maintenance,
				current information, later deadlines, longer articles and additional features,
				public relations for our growing group of external readers, and the
				incorporation of more photographs and graphics (which now appear in color with
				a higher resolution). Benchmarking, flowcharts, and surveys have reflected what
				the team believed to be true: that Fletcher Footnotes in its electronic format
				has lifted the production burden from the team and continues to be an effective
				tool for library communication.<BR></P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Virtual University">Arizona State University at the West Campus<BR>
    ASU at the West Campus Virtual
				University Team</A></H4> 
			 <P>ASU at the West campus began offering web-based/Internet courses in 1997 at the
				request of the Arizona Board of Regents, ASU at the West campus administrators, faculty and
				students. A team of eight led a pilot project to design three web-based
				courses. Team roles included the academic, administrative, and technology
				factions of this process. Since no one at West had experience with designing
				and teaching a course completely over the Internet, additional internal and
				external resources were sought. In addition to web design and technology, we
				required participation from many other University resources such as the
				library, general counsel, the bookstore and the course scheduling office. The
				entire process required much problem solving and brainstorming since we were
				held to tight financial boundaries. The goal of designing and offering quality
				courses with maximum accessibility and minimum equipment and effort on the part
				of the student was reached. All customers/stakeholders were satisfied. The
				pilot enabled the team to make recommendations to the University for future
				web-based courses. Many of the recommendations have already been
				institutionalized.<BR>

			 <H4><A NAME="Reference Services">Reference Services Team, University
				Libraries</A></H4> <STRONG>Awarded With Distinction</STRONG><BR><BR> Reference
			 Services is the University Libraries' first self-managed team application. The
			 new organizational structure simultaneously supports the following: examining
			 more than one problem or process; increasing customer-based productivity and
			 effectiveness within ongoing operations; and enhancing the alignment of
			 functions and staff roles with the Libraries' and the University's strategic
			 directions. Ingredients to success have been: changing from measuring outputs
			 to outcomes based on customer needs; embracing consensus as the preferred
			 decision-making approach; and adopting a standard problem-solving/process
			 examination model. Among the results are: expanded reference desk hours, at
			 times corresponding to user needs; a new multi-level telephone system and the
			 introduction of voice and e-mail reference service, to improve access for
			 remote users; a new data-based perspective of why some library users have
			 problems finding needed materials; and an array of improvements to the
			 day-to-day departmental operations. Reference Services has demonstrated that
			 continuous improvement doesn't have to be a single-track venture and that it
			 doesn't have to take a long time to achieve results. 
			 <H4><A NAME="Law">Law for the University Administrator Workshop
				Development Team</A> </H4> The <EM>Law for the University Administrator
			 Workshop </EM>gives university administrators practical information about laws
			 and university policies that affect university services to students, employees,
			 and the public. Each workshop session addresses specific legal issues relevant
			 to the university community, provides practical information about current legal
			 developments, and provides functional workshop materials usable as reference
			 material throughout the year. By applying legal principles to university-based
			 case studies, participants learn from the experiences of others in the class. 
			 <P>Workshop speakers, facilitators and participants include
				representatives from ASU at the Tempe campus, ASU at the West campus and ASU Polytechnic campus.Former presenters have included
				ASU attorneys, university representatives from Affirmative Action, the Campus
				Environment Team, Human Resources, Purchasing and Risk Management, speakers
				from County and State Government, and attorneys representing other
				universities. The workshop has improved the capability of the Office of General
				Counsel to provide timely and useful legal advice to the university community.

			 <H4><A NAME="Registrar">Registrar's Office Team, Arizona State University at the Tempe Campus</A> </H4>
			 The Arizona State University East Oasis is a one-stop service for information,
			 registrar functions, student business services, student financial assistance,
			 scholarships, undergraduate and graduate admissions and other services needed
			 to attend the university. The project was accomplished due to many ASU at the Tempe Campus
			 liaison offices. The Registrar's Office, however, was the primary resource that
			 drove the physical and functional aspects of the Oasis. The Oasis Site provides
			 users with enhanced convenience as it provides access to multiple services in
			 one location. 
			 <H4><A NAME="Fletcher sign">Arizona State University at the West Campus Library Sign Committee</A></H4>
			 Taking their charge to "Provide signage in all public areas of the library that
			 allow our patrons to find/identify destinations, services, resources within the
			 library with the least staff intervention," the ASU at the West campus Library Sign Committee
			 used the innovative approach the United States Air Force calls "Try-Storming."
			 An idea that has the potential for speedy and cost effective results is
			 actually tried and evaluated. For the Sign Committee, the idea was to make and
			 install our own prototype signs, as opposed to identifying what signs were
			 needed, getting an estimate of the cost, then putting the proposal out to bid.
			 The group effort that went into design and production were seen immediately and
			 the effectiveness of these signs was reinforced by the statistics gathered
			 before and after the installation. In addition to the initial dollar savings to
			 the library, when daily statistics indicate a change or enhancement is needed,
			 it can be accomplished in a matter of hours and at minimal cost to the Library.
			 
			 <H4><A NAME="Divisional Network">Divisional Network Team, Student
				Affairs</A></H4> The implementation of a divisional network for Student Affairs
			 resulted in: 
			 <UL> 
				<LI>significant cost savings for Student Affairs, </LI> 
				<LI>an increase in services provided to Student Affairs staff,
				  </LI> 
				<LI>improvements in productivity through more efficient utilization
				  of available computing and networking resources, </LI> 
				<LI>improvements in student computing lab facilities and services,
				  </LI> 
				<LI>improvements in network administration that enhance the
				  stability, reliability and availability of computing and networking resources.
				  </LI> 
			 </UL> 
			 <P>The team's approach to problem solving included planning, defining
				the scope of the project, identification and resolution of issues, development
				of solutions, defining team structure and enhancing group interaction, goal
				definition, and a plan for implementation. The resulting network is the largest
				divisional computing network at ASU. </P> 
			 <P>It is important to note that the technologies implemented were new
				to project team members. While this increased the difficulty and risk
				associated with this project, the project was completed ahead of schedule, with
				minimal disruptions to the user community and to the satisfaction of those
				served.<BR><BR> <FONT
