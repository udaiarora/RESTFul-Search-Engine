              National Palace Museum, Taiwan (1975-6). Since that time Dr. Brown

              Hong Kong Museum of Art (1986 and 1993). She curated two other
              exhibitions shown in Hong Kong, <em>Chinese Cloisonn&eacute;: The
              Robert H. Clague Collection</em>, shown at the Hong Kong Museum
              of Art in 1985, and <em>Minol Araki</em>, shown at the Hong Kong
              Art Centre in 1999. The latter exhibition premiered at the National
              Museum of History, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1998. Recently, she participated
              in international symposia on the history of Chinese painting and
              visual culture in Shanghai (2001), and in Taipei (2002). This year,
              she served as panelist at the international conference, &quot;Contemporary

          <p>Dr. Cutter received his doctorate from the University of Washington in Chinese, with a specialization in early medieval Chinese literature. Prior to coming to ASU, he was a professor of Chinese in the Department of East Asian Languages and Literature at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he was on the faculty for twenty-two years. Now professor emeritus at Wisconsin, he served terms as chair of his department and director of the Center for East Asian Studies. An internationally recognized leader in the field of early medieval Chinese literature and history, Dr. Cutter has numerous books and articles on those topics, as well as on other periods, including modern Chinese literature. His most recent monograph is a book in Chinese entitled Cockfighting and Chinese Culture published by China &rsquo;s leading scholarly publishing house. It is a cultural history of this blood sport based on both literary and historical sources. Dr. Cutter serves on a number of boards and is the East Asia Sectional Chair of the American Oriental Society, the third oldest scholarly organization in the United States.</p>

              World Bank, the Chinese State Planning Commission (SPC), and the
              Ministry of Railways (MOR). In the Coal Transport Study (1989-1994),
              he led an SPC team in developing a large and complex planning model
              of China&#8217;s coal and electricity production and delivery system
              to optimize investment strategies for alleviating China&#8217;s
              energy shortages. From 1994-95 he worked with a Chinese student
              to add energy conservation to the model and analyze the tradeoffs
              between cost and pollution. In the Cost-Effective Technology Evaluation
              (1995-97), he led an MOR team in optimizing the size, location,
              technology, and timing of new railway lines. For the China Transport
              Strategy paper, he forecasted trends in passenger and freight demand.
              Most recently, he has studied the progress of coal washing technology
              and investment in China. He has traveled to China 12 times from
              1989 to 2002, and teaches a course in the Geography of China at

              University in History &amp; East Asian Languages in 1976, and then
              came directly to ASU to teach Chinese cultural history. He has
              published eight books and over forty articles in both English and
              Chinese. Most of his work focuses on retrieving some of the historical
              range of intellectual and cultural alternatives beyond the orthodoxy
              that prevailed in state and society from the thirteenth to the
              twentieth centuries. The rich diversity of Chinese thought has
              commonly been overlooked because of the dominance of that orthodoxy,
              but Tillman retrieves alternative sociopolitical approaches and
              philosophical insights. By demonstrating the diversity and richness
              of these ideas, Tillman hopes to enrich our understanding of Chinese
              traditions and their evolution. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2">Since 1981 Tillman has worked with colleagues, particularly
              at Peking University in Beijing, to enhance international research
              cooperation and scholarly communication. They have collaborated
              in securing international grants to support the research and publications
              of Peking University&#8217;s Center for the Study of Ancient Chinese
              History. In February 2004, ASU signed its first exchange agreement
              with Peking University, a faculty exchange and research collaboration
              agreement with this Center. From September 2003 through December
              2004, Tillman is at the Center and doing his research with grants
              from the William J. Fulbright Foundation and the Council of Learned
              Societies. <br>

          <p>Ning Wang joined ASU in 2005. His research focuses on the interface between law, polity, economy and society, with a thematic focus on international development. He received B.S. in psychology from Beijing University, M. A. in International Relations and Ph. D. in human development from University of Chicago in 1996 and 2002 respectively. </p>
          <p>The primary concern of his research is transition and developing economies. His approach to economic development prioritizes the institutional and organizational structure of the economic system, underscoring the legal framework and social structure within which the economy operates and evolves. His current empirical research on transition economies has a geographic focus on China. He has done intensive fieldwork in rural China, particularly, the rise of commercial fishery. He is launching a project to examine China&rsquo;s emerging auto industry, which is a crowded battlefield for domestic producers as well as multinationals from Japan, South Korea, the United States, and Europe. It is particularly interesting to compare how auto manufacturers respond to outsourcing and globalization, fuelled by and reinforcing increasing technological and organizational innovation. <br>
