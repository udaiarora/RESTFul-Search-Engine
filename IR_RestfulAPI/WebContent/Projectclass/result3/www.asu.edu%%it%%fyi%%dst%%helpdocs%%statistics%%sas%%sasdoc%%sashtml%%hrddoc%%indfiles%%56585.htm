This complete guide to SAS/GIS software, the SAS System's geographical     information analysis component, provides both step-by-step introductions
to the software's data exploration features and comprehensive reference    to all of the software's windows, commands, statements, and options.
This book shows how you can use SAS/GIS software, in conjunction with      any of the powerful data presentation and analysis tools in the SAS
System, to interactively explore any type of data that can be linked to    features on a map. Users who have limited experience with the SAS
System will learn how to select features and perform actions in maps       created by others. More experienced SAS programmers will learn how to
create geographic information systems for end users. Portions of this      book are available online with Release 6.11 and later releases.
