This report provides              the blueprint for the design process that will accommodate the              demands and needs of the Phoenix metropolitan area and the State              of Arizona. While there may be a variety of approaches that              might be taken by ASU to accomplish its objective, there can be              little disagreement about the challenges to address in the ASU              design process:</font></p>          <ul>            <li><font size="2">Rapid socioeconomic change in the metropolitan                region and state (metropolitan Phoenix area is experiencing one                of the nation&rsquo;s              highest rates of population growth, a trend projected to increase              and continue indefinitely);</font></li>            <li><font size="2">Rapid cultural diversification (unprecedented transformation              of regional demographic profile requires ASU to offer access, promote            diversity, and meet the special needs of underserved populations); </font></li>            <li><font size="2">Projections of the number of high school graduates seeking a              college education by 2020 indicate increasing demand and enrollment            growth; </font></li>            <li><font size="2">Limited higher education infrastructure in the region (ASU is              an emerging but not yet fully evolved institution, and the only              major platform of university higher education in one of the largest            cities and metropolitan regions in the United States); </font></li>            <li><font size="2">Underperforming Pre-K&ndash;20 educational system; </font></li>            <li><font size="2">Limitations imposed by ASU&rsquo;s evolutionary            history and present design; </font></li>            <li><font size="2">Physical constraints on the original ASU campus; </font></li>            <li><font size="2">Limited public and private support for the university (declining              state government investment in ASU, when measured on a per student            basis); </font></li>            <li><font size="2">Increasing competitiveness among research universities for limited              funding and resources, i.e., intellectual capital (imperative for            academic excellence); </font></li>            <li><font size="2">The need for research-driven knowledge-based economic development            in metropolitan Phoenix.</font></li>          </ul>          <p><font size="2">In the face of such challenges, the response of most universities            would be to retreat and rely on the elite, historical models of the            past.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>ASU will instead set out to find ways            to operationalize the vision of a New American University. In            doing so, the single biggest question faced by the university is:&nbsp; How            do we operate the university of today while working to become the            university of tomorrow?&nbsp; This report identifies the first of            many steps in the design process that will be necessary to create            the New American University. </font></p>          <p><font size="2">In an organization as large and complex as a major              public research university operating in one of the fastest growing              regions in the nation, there are sure to be many obstacles, problems,              issues, and concerns to confront. While planning adjustments and              course corrections will certainly need to be made along the way,              the university must think and behave strategically. The university              must identify new partners, continue to press its case to its investors,              seize unexpected opportunities, remain responsive to changing conditions,            deploy its resources in ways that empower its many component parts,            and prepare to advance in unexpected ways. As set out in this            report, ASU will undertake these tasks as an organization that focuses            on the building and operation of a <em>federation of unique colleges            and schools (sometimes large and sometimes small), academic departments,            and interdisciplinary research centers</em> (academic            units henceforth generally referred to as &ldquo;colleges and schools,&rdquo; with            colleges being a particular amalgamation of schools). </font></p>          <p><font size="2">The university design process will focus on building strong and            entrepreneurial colleges and schools, encouraged to grow and prosper            to the extent of their individual intellectual and market limits. Through            the creation of a federation of unique colleges and schools, ASU            will lay the foundations of the premier public metropolitan research            university of the twenty-first century.</font> </p>          <p><font size="2">The key to ASU&rsquo;s              transformation and success will be <em>college and school empowerment</em>. Success              will be driven by increasing academic excellence, fostering creativity,              and enlarging the social, economic, and cultural impact of the              university. Such excellence, creativity, and impact are attained              when communities of students and scholars are driven to compete              at the highest level. Such competition is nurtured and enhanced              by close-knit organizations with focused missions and high degrees              of freedom. In the case of a major research institution,              these characteristics are associated with smaller academic units,              such as colleges and schools. </font></p>          <p><font size="2">College and school empowerment will help overcome historical physical            and fiscal constraints through ownership of the competitive academic            process at the level of each college and school. Devolving            intellectual and fiscal responsibility to the level of colleges and            schools will encourage each to excel, allowing them to articulate            new designs and embark in new directions, as well as to set higher            standards to ensure national competitiveness. </font></p>          <p><font size="2">The reconceptualization              seeks to produce a <em>model of differentiation</em> to transform              ASU into a leading major research institution. Rather than              pursuing models from the past which, due to ASU&rsquo;s current              historical, financial, and environmental situation, are not likely              to succeed, such as a replication model that would attempt to reproduce              the organization of successful major research universities, or              a trajectory model that would guide the development of the institution              according to linear extrapolation from the current structure and              dynamics of ASU, the model of distinctive differentiation will              build on existing strengths to produce</font></p>          <ul>            <li><font size="2">Unique colleges, schools, interdisciplinary research centers,              and departments; </font></li>            <li><font size="2">Nationally competitive interdisciplinary traditions; </font></li>            <li><font size="2">A cooperative environment with complementary academic              units in pursuit of excellence;&nbsp; </font></li>            <li><font size="2">Strong and deep linkages to the community; </font></li>            <li><font size="2">Distribution of programs throughout the community. </font></li>          </ul>          <p><font size="2">The design process will guide the creation of a unique institutional            profile to position ASU as one of the premier public metropolitan            research universities of the twenty-first century, an institution            committed to teaching, discovery, and service to the community (university            as social enterprise). </font></p>          <p><font size="2">The university greatly appreciates the work of the University Design            Team on which this report is based.
