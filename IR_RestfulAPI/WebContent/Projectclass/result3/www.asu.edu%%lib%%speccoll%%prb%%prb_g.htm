<P>Galerie du Luxembourg. <I>Burne-Jones et l'influence des Preraphaelites</I>.
London: Hartnoll, c1972. French and English. Catalog of an exhibition held
at the Galerie du Luxembourg, Paris, Mar-Apr, 1972. This catalogue is written
in both French and English. The introduction by Julian Hartnoll discusses
the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood against the background
of 1848, the year of Revolution. The purpose for this particular exhibition
is to demonstrate how the term Pre-Raphaelite &quot;has progressed from
its 1848 meaning, and is now descriptive of a number of related styles
which dominated English artistic life throughout the second half of the
nineteenth century&quot; (1). Hartnoll details the development of the Pre-Raphaelite
brotherhood from its beginnings with just seven members until the end of
the century. PRB-7</P>

<P>Gaunt, William and M. D. E. Clayton-Stamm. <I>William De Morgan: Pre-Raphaelite
Ceramics</I>. Greenwich, CT: New York Graphic Society, 1971. This work
was written because of the &quot;need, expressed by collectors and De Morgan
enthusiasts, for a book giving a fuller account of his development with
a correspondingly comprehensive series of illustrations.&quot; The authors
begin with De Morgan's origins, and then proceed to detail his development,
his meeting with William Morris, his years at Chelsea, his time at Merton
Abbey, and his experiences at Sands End, Fulham and Florence. The work
concludes with an explanation of the De Morgan tradition and a perspective
on him. A chronology is given, as well as lists of De Morgan collections.
A paper delivered by De Morgan in 1892 entitled &quot;Lustre Ware&quot;
is included, as well as a description of the marks on De Morgan pottery
and tiles. There are numerous illustrations, many of which are in full
color. The work concludes with an index and bibliography. PRB-113</P>

cm. Literary organ of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. In tan morocco pull-off
case by Sangorski and Sutcliffe, with <I>The Germ</I> as spine title. This
journal began under the title <I>The Germ: Thoughts towards Nature In Poetry,
Literature, and Art</I>. However, after the first two issues the title
was changed &quot;in consequence of some misapprehension of its intent&quot;
to <I>Art and Poetry: Being Thoughts towards Nature</I>. This particular
volume contains the first four issues, Nos. 1 &amp; 2 (January, 1850 and
February 1850) under the original title and Nos. 3 &amp; 4 under the revised
title. The journal contains &quot;original Poems, Stories to develope thought
and principle, Essays concerning Art and other subjects, and analytic Reviews
of current Literature--particularly Poetry. Each number will also contain
an Etching; the subject to be taken from the opening article of the month.&quot;
The journal is intended to &quot;claim for Poetry that place to which its
present development in the leterature of this country so emphatically entitles
it.&quot; The journal is also designed to encourage the adherence to the
simplicity of nature in all art. The etchings are designed to further this
aim. The journal ceased publication after issue No. 4. PRB-1</P>

bound Preface by William Michael Rossetti which explains the aims of the
Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood as well as the purpose fot this journal. Rossetti
surmises on the reasons for the journal's failure after only four issues.
He also discusses the contents of each issue and includes reviews which
appeared at the time of the journal's publication. The first two issues
appeared under the title <I>The Germ </I>and then the title was changed
so the journal was continued by <I>Art and Poetry</I> (reprint 1901) for
its remaining two issues. PRB-2</P>

<P>Gray, Nicolette. <I>Rossetti, Dante and Ourselves</I>. London: Faber,
1947. In this essay, the author examines &quot;only this idea that the
young Rossetti, in his work up to 1862 created an idea in our minds which
gets between us and dante, between us and a real idea of the Middle Ages,
in fact to find out what sort of a mark rssetti is making on the state
of our minds. For whether we admire or abhor them it seems that his paintings
once seen do make a mark which is ineradicable.&quot; PRB-86</P>
