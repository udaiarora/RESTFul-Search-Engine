<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>The Family Herbal, or, An Account of All Those English
Plants, Which are Remarkable for Their Virtues, and of the Drugs Which
are Produced by Vegetables of Other Countries: With Their Descriptions
and Their Uses, as Proved by Experience.</FONT></I>
<P>Bungay: Printed and published by C. Brightly and T. Kinnersley, 1808
or 1809?. First edition published 1754 under title: <I>The Useful Family
Herbal</I>; subsequent eds, in 1770, 1789, and "about 1809."--Cf.Hunt 551.
Plates 19 and 20: Published by Brightly Bungay 1808. Some plates inserted
in reverse order, e.g. 12, 11; 20, 19.
<P>The fifty-four hand colored plates picture medicinal herbs from England
and other countries.&nbsp; Hill has arranged his plants according to their
English names, adding the Latin name as well.&nbsp; He gives a "general
description of the plant, if it be a common one, in a line or two; that
those who already know it, may turn at once to the uses; and for such as
do not, a farther and more particular account is added.&nbsp; Last come
the virtues, as they are confirmed by practice: and all this is delivered
in such words as are common, and to be understood by all."&nbsp; Hill begins
his work with an introduction detailing the purpose of the work, the methods
of collecting and preserving plants, the techniques for preparing simples,
information about distilled waters and other household preparations, and
the best methods for putting medicines together.&nbsp; This introduction
is then followed by the
<BR>alphabetical listing of the plants, many of which are also shown on
the hand-colored plates.&nbsp; The work concludes with an appendix which
discusses the virtues of plants which have not yet been tried.
