SAS Guide to the Query Window: Usage and Reference, Version 8
</H1><P>
Discover the SQL Query window, which provides an easy-to-use windowing     interface to the SQL procedure. A comprehensive overview and
step-by-step examples show you how to query SAS data sets and data from    database management systems. The SQL Query window supports the PROC SQL
Pass-Through facility and enables you to access data through remote        hosts using SAS/CONNECT software. You can also design reports with PROC
REPORT based on your SQL Query Window's output. This title is written      for those who are familiar with basic SAS terminology and concepts. No
previous experience with PROC SQL or SAS code is needed.
