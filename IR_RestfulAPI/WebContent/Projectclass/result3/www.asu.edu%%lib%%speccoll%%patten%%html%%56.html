<P>This later edition of a 1577 work provides a glimpse of gardening and
gardens in the days of Queen Elizabeth I. The work is divided into two
parts.&nbsp; The first part contains the "manifold trauels, great cares,
and diligence, to be yearly bestowed in euery earth, for the use of a Garden:
with the later inuentions, and rare secrets therunto added, (as the like)
not heretofore published."&nbsp; Hill begins with a discussion of the invention
of garden plots by Pliny in ancient Rome.&nbsp; This is followed by detailed
instructions for the making and maintaining of a garden.&nbsp; The second
part of the work is devoted to the "worthie secrets" about kitchen herbs,
dainty herbs, delectable flowers, pleasant fruits, and fine roots, and
also gives the benefits of each herb for healing.&nbsp; The work includes
a detailed table of contents for both parts, as well as an index to the
second part "breefly shewing the Physicall operations fo euery hearbe and
plant therin contained, with the vertues of their distilled waters."
