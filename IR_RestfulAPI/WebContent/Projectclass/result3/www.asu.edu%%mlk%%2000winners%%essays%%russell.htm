        Gymnastics And<br>
        The Tricks of Life<br>
        &quot;Leadership Through Service Essay&quot;</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The person who I 
        think best demonstrates &quot;Leadership Through Service&quot; is Fransee 
        Goulart. Fransee shows leadership by leading my team and I down the right 
        road of life. She does this by serving us and using her time to help us 
        be the best that we can be in gymnastics and life altogether.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> By using what she 
        has leaned as a gymnast, student, and from growing up, she has taught 
        me not only the skills/tricks needed to move on to the next level, but 
        the things needed to do this and also maintain a 4.0 grade average.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Even though I have 
        been with Fransee for only a little over a year now, I think she has taught 
        me many things. She has taught me how to manage my time wisely, always 
        strive to do my best, and altogether overcome the obstacles of life.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My world is better 
        because of Fransee. I now have someone, other than my parents, to talk 
        to. I feel comfortable asking Fransee anything, as I know she will answer 
        them through her many years of knowledge and experience. Whether it is 
        a question about life or gymnastics, she will answer it as she has probably 
        been through the same thing. If anyone shows &quot;Leadership Through 
        Service&quot;, I would have to say it is Fransee Cherie-Earth Goulart.</font></p>
