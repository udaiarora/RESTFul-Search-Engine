                  <p align="left">a. Dan Stanton, chair of the Nominations and Elections Committee presented the slate of candidates for each office and called for nominations from the floor. It was moved that the slate be accepted. The motion was accepted. The ballots will be sent out April 28<sup>th</sup> and should be returned by May 7<sup>th</sup>.</p>

                  <h3 align="left">&nbsp;</h3>
                  <h2 align="left">IV. Dean's Report : Report and discussion of recent decisions related to continuing appointment for APs.</h2>
                  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">On March 31, 2003 the President awarded promotion but did not award continuing appointment at this time to APs. Sherrie reported that the Provost has said that the President is uncomfortable awarding continuing appointment at this time. This has generated more questions than answers. Sherrie spoke with the persons involved, but didn&rsquo;t make any announcements because it was a personnel action. </p>
                  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">On Monday, April 21, Sherrie met with Vice Provost Gail Hackett with four questions: 1. What is the AP category? 2. Who is eligible for this category? 3. What are the expectations of those in the category? 4. How do you document those expectations? The Dean stated that she was dealing only with librarian issues. Some concerns that Sherrie expressed are the need for academic freedom, the need for documentation, and the issue of continuing status for all librarians. Other questions addressed to Dr. Hackett related to people in the &ldquo;pipeline,&rdquo; grievances, persons who have been offered positions, and recruitment. For persons in the pipeline, nothing has changed. The process has been halted in order to look at the process but changes have not been made. The grievance process is a personal matter and is dealt with by individuals. Regarding offer letters, the library has been instructed to delete the sentence stating that if one is offered promotion, one will receive continuing appointment at the same time. In the area of recruitment, Sherrie feels confident that the issue will be resolved in the near future. In response to a question about what the ads will say, Sherrie indicated that the library could proceed as usual and can contact candidates to inform them that continuing status is under review. In addition the Dean&rsquo;s office will specifically inquire about ads for positions in recruitment. It was pointed out the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook connects promotion and the awarding of continuing appointment but the ACD manual does not.</p>
                  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">There was a short discussion of the review process. A faculty based review committee reviews the dossiers of the librarians at the West campus. </p>
                  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">The Deans&rsquo; office is collecting data to assist in addressing the status of librarians. Kurt reported on the progress of this effort. A questionnaire was sent out to a list of peers of ASU and also to the institutions mentioned in the &ldquo;New Gold Standard&rdquo; report.&nbsp; The questionnaire included questions about status, salaries, contracts, the review process, governance, eligibility for sabbatical leave, and requests for institutional statements about academic freedom for librarians. The results of these surveys will be posted on the web. Sherrie distributed an article by Lewis C. Branscomb that addresses the need for academic status for librarians. Sherrie and Kurt requested that if anyone has research, anecdotes, or information about why academic freedom is important to librarians, please send it to the Dean&rsquo;s office. The appropriate data will be assembled along with pertinent articles and a bulleted sheet of information to support the case of continuing status for librarians. </p>
                  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">Kurt also reported on the meeting of the Academic Chairs and Directors. At that meeting, it was presented that there is a difference between tenure and continuing appointment in the ABOR document. Rob added that the context of the meeting was focused on faculty. Kurt added that it was stated that the President takes tenure and continuing appointment very seriously. It is a 30-40 year commitment and should be awarded very judiciously. It was noted that anyone with continuing appointment will retain that status.</p>
                  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">JoAnn reported that the Provost indicated that the appropriate groups will be addressing the category of academic professionals. </p>
                  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">There was discussion of section 506 of the ACD manual. The section has been rewritten, and APs were removed from the section. This document will have its first reading at the Academic Senate meeting on April 28. Kurt pointed out that 506 is the section on Promotion and Tenure and that the AP section will be moved to another location. JoAnn pointed out that presently, since the section on APs is no longer in the revised 506, the APs will have no policy at all if the revised 506 is voted on and passed in the Academic Senate. There was a short discussion that centered on the situation of the AP category and the variety of types of positions and the presence of continuing or non-continuing tracks. </p>
                  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">There was some discussion of whether and how librarians would be involved in changes in procedures or re-writing of the ACD manual. </p>

                  <p align="left">Section 506 of the ACD Manual, which was re-written, removed APs. Since there is no new section at this time, the APs will be without a policy if this is passed. JoAnn will make this concern known to the Academic Senate </p>

                  <p align="left">CAPS has requested through Vice Provost Gail Hackett the following, that a statement be issued to all academic professionals by the President&rsquo;s office which addresses the current need to re-consider policies relative to granting continuing status to on-track academic professionals. What is the charge to the Provost&rsquo;s office relative to reviewing employment appointment options, salary structure, and documentation for continuing status for academic professionals and what is the timeline for such a review (in consideration of academic professional applications for continuing appointment in Fall 2003)? Dr. Hackett has requested, from CAPS, a list of APs. She will choose six persons to work on the revision of 506. The timeline is unknown. It was suggested that six people is not an adequate representation of the variety of academic professionals.</p>
