      <h2>ASU mourns 'Family Man,' 'Mr. Maroon &amp; Gold'</h2>
      <p>        June 19 should have been a day of glorious celebration.</p>
      <p>House
          Bill 2529, the bill securing $440 million in state funds for research
          infrastructure at the three universities, finally made it through one
          final vote and was on its way to Gov. Janet Napolitano's desk for signature.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately,
          June 19 was a day of tremendous sadness as news circulated that Blake
          Anderson, ASU lobbyist and one of the bill's greatest champions,
          had died hours before HB2529 made it past its last hurdle. Anderson
        died of complications from lupus, following a brief hospitalization.</p>
      <p>Anderson
          worked tirelessly alongside ASU President Michael Crow to convince
        members of the legislature that the bill was not only good for ASU, but
          also good for the future of the entire state of Arizona.</p>
      <p>In an unprecedented
          tribute to a lobbyist, the flag was flown at half-mast at the state
        capitol the day Anderson died.</p>
      <p>Crow, in an emotional note
          to colleagues, said, "Blake was a man who served his family and his
        university with all of his heart and all of
          his energy.</p>
      <p>He contributed to our success and development with his careful
          thinking, great wisdom and friendly spirit. He was a man of honor."</p>
      <p>At Anderson's
          memorial service, held June 21, there was standing room only at St.
        Benedict's Catholic Church, which holds 500 people. Dignitaries
          included former Gov. Jane Hull; Rep. Gary Pierce, R-Mesa; ASU President
          Crow and former President Lattie Coor; Rep. Bob Robson, R-Chandler,
        who introduced HB2529 in the Legislature; Allan Price, who was vice president
          for Institutional Advancement and Anderson's boss at ASU before leaving
          in 2001 to take a position at the University of Oregon; Jaime Molera,
          former state schools chief; and numerous others.</p>
      <p>During the service, Anderson's
          three children, daughters Lindsey, 13, Emily, 10, and Julie, 7, read
          a poem as a tribute to their dad, who,
          above all, was considered a family man by all who knew him. He enjoyed
          sharing his love of ASU with his girls, who particularly enjoyed attending
          Sun Devil baseball games.</p>
      <p>Others also paid tribute to Anderson at the
          service, including his college roommate Cliff Ochser, Crow, Robson
        and Price.</p>
      <p>In his tribute, Price characterized
          Anderson as a mensch, which, in the Hebrew language of Yiddish, is
        the highest honor you can pay someone.
          It stands for someone who is dignified, righteous and honest. </p>
      <p>"All my
          life, I had never come across anyone who could truly be characterized
          as a mensch, until I met Blake," Price said. "I did everything possible
          to put Blake in difficult situations, with difficult people, to try
        and prove what I had always thought - that no one could possibly live
        up
          to being a mensch - but he proved me wrong. Blake, you're a mensch."</p>
      <p>Anderson
          was employed at ASU since 1994. He received his B.S. in Political Science
          from ASU in 1986. In addition to his three daughters, Anderson
          also leaves his wife Debbie, who he married in 1987, his parents, Dr.
          Robert and Mae Anderson, and two brothers, Craig and Eric.</p>
      <p>An account
          has been established at Wells Fargo Bank to ensure the future education
          of Anderson's children. Contributions can be dropped off or
          mailed to any Wells Fargo Bank in care of Deborah Anderson, Account
        No. 9667549142.<br>
        Contributions may also be sent to the Lupus Foundation for Research. </p>
