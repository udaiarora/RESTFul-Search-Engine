                  </h1>
                  <p>Julie Tharp welcomed Brian Doherty, the new head of the Music Library, and Sheila Young, who is now the Engineering Librarian in Noble Library. 
                    &nbsp;

                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>The resignation of Tina Shrader resulted in two vacancies: the position of Secretary of Librarians&rsquo; council and the second year of Tina&rsquo;s two-year term on the Personnel Committee. The executive committee appointed Sheila Young to fill the position of secretary and Linda DeFato to the Personnel Committee to complete the term. Librarians&rsquo; Council approved these appointments. &nbsp;

                  <p>The appointment of Sherrie to the position of University Librarian will promote active coordination and cooperation between the libraries at East, West, and Main. The University Librarian will be responsible to demonstrate this cooperation. Sherrie will also retain the title and the responsibilities of Dean of Libraries of the main campus libraries and remain a member of Deans&rsquo; Council. In the context of the reorganization, Dr. Glick was appointed as the Chief Academic Officer for all three campuses. However, the Deans of the Libraries on each campus will report to their Provost&rsquo;s on their respective campuses. Sherrie will work to achieve the President&rsquo;s goal for the libraries.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>A question and answer period followed:</p>

                    <p>Answer: Yes</p>
                    <p><strong>Question: Regarding governance, will evaluation be done at West within its own structure?</strong></p>
                    <p>Answer: Those conversations have yet to occur.</p>
                    <p><strong>Question: What title will Sherrie use?</strong></p>

                  <h3>b. Scholars&rsquo; Portal &nbsp;
                       
                  </h3>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Sherrie gave a short history on the development of ASU&rsquo;s involvement in Scholars&rsquo; Portal. There have been forecasts for libraries to be replaced by the web. Library use statistics have declined. The literature discusses &ldquo;Googlized&rdquo; students and how students use the web. A Pew report states that 73% of students say they are getting their information online, but doesn&rsquo;t report what portion is through the library via the web. Given all of this, there is a need to present the library in a way that is similar to the web, such as has been done with the catalog and digitized materials. There is a need to allow students to search all sources and bring the results together in a meaningful way. It is also possible to solve the problem of authentication. The Arizona Regents University has provided funding for ASU to be involved in the Scholars&rsquo; Portal project.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>A question and answer period followed:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Question: Is there a roll out date?</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Answer: It is necessary to link some of our resources to our authentication package. The &ldquo;Z to web&rdquo; requires some code to be written. The original date for roll out was mid September. This was too early and presently there is no set date but there will be another release in early January. Scott Herrington commented further on process regarding the preparation of Scholars&rsquo; Portal. There needs to be a critical mass of resources in Scholars&rsquo; Portal and many of our resources need scripts written. There are many committees working on this project. </p>
                    <p><strong>Question: Are there different schedules for roll out?</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Answer: We are among the earliest, (the second) to get the training. The group of universities involves are roughly at the similar stages. &nbsp;
                             
                  </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Sherrie concluded her remarks by stating that there is concern regarding the ARL &ldquo;anointing&rdquo; any particular portal project and that this project does not do that. The group of ARL libraries that became involved in this project did so because it was an opportunity to be involved in defining what a portal project should be. It was a &ldquo;developmental opportunity.&rdquo; The libraries involved in the portal project are not a consortium, and they are not endorsing a particular vendor. &nbsp;

                  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                  <h3>c. Budget &nbsp;
                         
                </h3>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>There is no final information available regarding the budget. The library has put money aside in the information resources budget and in the contingency line because it may be necessary to return money to the state. The library will fill essential lines but will not fill all lines. We may be called upon to return up to 10% of the library&rsquo;s budget. Ten percent of the libraries&rsquo; budget is $1.8 million. The university will try to keep the amount returned by the units as small as possible. There are some central funds which may be applied to the amount that the state requires be returned. The forecasts for next year&rsquo;s budget are even worse than this year. Because of the stock market decline, there are no capital gains. The tobacco settlement money is exhausted, and sales tax collections are down. </p>

                  <h3>d. Meeting with President Crow &nbsp;

                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>The meeting with President Crow went very well. He is fond of libraries and believes that the library is the heart of the university. </p>
                  <p>He has three goals for the library:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      
                    1.
                       
                    Meet the needs of the students and faculty</p>
                    <p>
                    
                    2. 
                       
                    Engage in activities of national and international importance.</p>
                    <p>
                 
                    3. 
                       
                    Find a way to be available to the community</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>There was a short discussion regarding the meaning of goal number three. An example of this goal is to examine becoming a K-12 portal on campus. It was suggested that this might be something like the &ldquo;Gold Files.&rdquo; Another example is to digitize a school library. The library will develop a white paper on what it will take to digitize a school library. &nbsp;
