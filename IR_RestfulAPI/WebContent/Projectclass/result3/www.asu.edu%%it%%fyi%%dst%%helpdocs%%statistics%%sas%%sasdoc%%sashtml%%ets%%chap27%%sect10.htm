<H2>Modeling Complex Intervention Effects  </H2>
<P>You have now defined three interventions to model the changes
in trend and level.
The excursion near the end of the series remains to be dealt with.
<P>Select <TT>Add</TT> from the Interventions for Series window.
Scroll through the data values and select the date on which the
excursion began, August 1990.
Leave the intervention type as Point.
<P>The pattern of the series from August 1990 through January 1991 is
more complex than a simple shift in level or trend.
For this pattern, you need a complex intervention model for an event that
causes a sharp rise followed by a rapid return to the previous trend line.
To specify this model,
use the <TT>Effect Time Window</TT> and <TT>Effect Decay Rate</TT> options.
<P>The options titled <TT>Effect Time Window</TT> control the number of lags of the
intervention's indicator variable used to model the effect of the
intervention on the dependent series.
For a simple intervention, the number of lags is zero,
which means that the effect of the intervention is modeled
by fitting a single regression coefficient to the
intervention's indicator variable.
<P>When you set the number of lags greater than zero,
regression coefficients are fit to lags of the
indicator variable.
This allows you to model interventions whose effects
take place gradually, or to model rebound effects.
For example, severe weather may reduce production during one period
but cause an increase in production in the following period as
producers struggle to catch up.
You could model this using a point intervention with an
effect time window of 1 lag. This would fit two coefficients for
the intervention, one for the immediate effect
and one for the delayed effect.
<P>The options titled <TT>Effect Decay Pattern</TT> control how the effect of
the intervention dissipates over time.
<TT>None</TT> specifies that there is no gradual decay:
for point interventions, the effect ends immediately;
for step and ramp interventions, the effect continues indefinitely.
<TT>Exp</TT> specifies that the effect declines at an exponential rate.
<TT>Wave</TT> specifies that the effect declines like an exponentially
damped sine wave (or as the sum of two exponentials, depending on the
fit to the data).
<P>If you are familiar with time series analysis, these options may be
clearer if you note that together
the Effect Time Window and Effect Decay Pattern
options define the numerator and denominator orders of a transfer function
or dynamic regression model for the indicator variable of the intervention.
See the section &#34;Dynamic Regressor&#34; later in this chapter for more
information.
<P>For this example, select 2 lags as the value of the Event Time Window, and
select <TT>Exp</TT> as the Effect Decay Pattern option.  The window should 
now appear as shown in <A HREF="sect10.htm#tfpr20">Display 27.20</A>.
