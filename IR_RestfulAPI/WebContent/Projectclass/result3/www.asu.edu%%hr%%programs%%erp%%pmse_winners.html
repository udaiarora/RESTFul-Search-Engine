			 <p><span class="MsoNormal"><strong>Arizona Bullying Prevention Partnership </strong></span></p>
			 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Arizona Bullying Prevention Partnership is a public/private collaboration largely supported by the Arizona Parents Commission on Drug Education and Prevention.&nbsp; The partnership includes:</p>
			 Governor&rsquo;s Office for Children, Youth, and Families, Division for Substance Abuse Policy Men&rsquo;s Anti-Violence Network (an initiative of the Arizona Foundation for Women) Arizona State University - Arizona Prevention Resource Center (APRC)
             <p class="MsoNormal">The main goal of the Bullying Prevention Project is to provide a safer environment and more positive climate for learning in schools through the reduction and prevention of inappropriate bullying behavior, violence and negative social interactions.&nbsp; Since the fall semester of 2003 over 55,000 students in 82 elementary and middle schools in 26 school districts throughout the state of Arizona have participated with statistically positive results. Results have shown that within the first year of implementation schools had a 44% decrease in the number of bullies on their campus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Project goals are being achieved through the implementation of the evidence-based Olweus Bullying Prevention Program. </p>
             <p class="MsoNormal">The Arizona Prevention Resource Center administers the data collection, analysis and report-writing for each school, in addition to providing technical assistance for program implementation. Through trainings the Center builds the capacity in schools to sustain/expand the program themselves, and markets the opportunity to participate by making presentations to potential schools and to outside organizations.&nbsp; Through the coming years it is the intent of the partnership to ensure the continued success of the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program in over 100 Arizona schools that will impact over 70,000 students, making our schools a safer and positive experience for all students.&nbsp; This project is central to the APRC&rsquo;s focus on assisting schools and communities throughout Arizona to implement more effective research-based models for drug and violence prevention and increasing positive social outcomes.</p>

             <p class="MsoNormal">Service at Salado engages local schoolchildren in a habitat-restoration project that has become a centerpiece of their school and neighborhood communities. This partnership of ASU and the City of Phoenix&rsquo;s Rio Salado Project has established after-school clubs at four elementary schools in South Phoenix. With funding from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust, ASU&rsquo;s University-School Partnerships, and the National Science Foundation, Service at Salado enables students from underserved and disadvantaged communities to gain experience in ecology and civic involvement. In the process, they practice environmental stewardship and come to see themselves as agents of change to conserve and improve their local landscape. The value of Service at Salado is not limited to local schoolchildren and their commun&shy;ities; ASU under&shy;graduates run the clubs and gain hands-on experience in establishing an environmental education program. Benefits accrue to the ASU community as these undergraduates learn to develop inquiry-based lessons, mentor schoolchildren, and communicate science to a diverse audience. </p>

			              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0;">The Tempe Early Reading First Partnership, a collaboration among ASU&rsquo;s Department of Speech and Hearing Science, Maricopa County Head Start, Tempe Elementary School District, and the Arizona Literacy and Learning Center, is working to improve the early literacy skills of young children in our community to prepare them to enter kindergarten with the necessary language, cognitive, and early literacy skills to prevent reading difficulties and to ensure school success. </p>
             <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0;">Eleven preschool teaching teams and administrators have received more than 100 hours of professional development through ASU classes accompanied by 300 hours of in-classroom mentoring. Three hundred sixty children have benefited from their teachers&rsquo; increased expertise and the $140,000 in early literacy materials that have enriched their classroom environments. Children in the project, including those receiving special education services and those who speak Spanish as their primary language, have shown significantly greater gains in alphabet knowledge, phonological awareness, and print awareness than children in control classrooms. ASU students have gained valuable experience volunteering in classrooms and working on the research team. The success of this partnership is helping set community standards for what constitutes quality, research-based early childhood education. </p>

			 <P>Club ASU, a program through the Office of Public Affairs, is a
				unique youth and community outreach program connecting students and their
				families to Arizona State University. </P> 
			 <P>Focusing on underserved schools and students with little to no
				family history of college education, Club ASU fosters the understanding that
				higher education is achievable. Students, grades 7-12, and their families are
				invited to free club-sponsored events, including athletics, fine arts,
				cultural, and educational events. The whole family has the opportunity to
				explore Arizona State University in an "up close and personal" way. Once
				enrolled, Club ASU tracks member interests and participation in events, while
				keeping in touch with them through mail and e-mail promotional pieces. </P> 
			 <P>Club ASU partners with existing outreach programs throughout ASU,
				including Intercollegiate Athletics, Undergraduate Admissions, and Public
				Events. Since its launch in the fall of 2003, Club ASU has hosted over 3,000
				students and parents from communities all over the state of Arizona.</P>

			 <P><B>Kids and Asthma: A Report to the Yuma Community</B></P> 
			 <P>Asthma is the most common childhood chronic disease in the United
				States. The Health and Disability Research Group in the W. P. Carey School of
				Business examined childhood asthma in Yuma County, Arizona and produced Kids
				and Asthma: A Report to the Yuma Community. This report is the product of a
				unique partnership of researchers from Arizona State University and employers,
				health care providers, legislators, educators, and public health leaders from
				Yuma County. It provides comprehensive demographic, health care utilization,
				and insurance information on Yuma County children receiving treatment for
				asthma between 1999 and 2001. </P> 
			 <P>The information is being used by the community to develop
				intervention programs aimed at improving preventive health care services and
				access to care for children with asthma. Since its initial release, Kids and
				Asthma has been distributed to other health care organizations across the state
				and nation. The partnership, and the continued dissemination of Kids and
				Asthma, is one of many examples of the rich work that can be accomplished when
				ASU and community collaborate to improve health.</P>ASU Team Members: <BR>Wade

			   Nursing Clinic at Central Arizona Shelter Services </B><BR>
	     <BR>
	     Community Health
			   Nursing Practice Standards clearly recognize healthcare as a right of all
			   people, and it is the responsibility of Community Health Nurses to identify
			   those who 'fall between the gaps' and provide them care. This belief guides the
			   College of Nursing's partnership with Central Arizona Shelter Services (CASS).
			   The shelter serves homeless men and women at its downtown Phoenix facility,
			   providing shelter, case management, and now, health care. Each day, 400+
			   individuals may be in residence.<BR>
	     <BR>
	     This nursing clinic was established by
			   Kay Jarrell, MS, RN and Judy Lersch, MS, RN because of their passion and
			   commitment to serving this under-served population. In establishing this
			   clinic, not only do the CASS residents receive free, American-class nursing
			   care, but senior nursing students, graduate students and faculty benefit from
			   this unique educational and practice setting. Each semester over 50 students in
			   the undergraduate BSN program, RN to BSN program, and nurse practitioner
			   program participate in the nursing clinic at the shelter. Two days a week,
			   students provide a range of services to shelter residents: early detection and
			   screening (i.e. health assessment, diabetic and TB screening), treatment (i.e.
			   wound care, foot care), referrals for treatment (i.e. mental health, HIV case
			   management), and health monitoring (blood pressures,
			   medications).<BR>
	     <BR>
	     Shelter residents look forward to receiving nursing care
			   and health education. Students develop respect and understanding of a
			   vulnerable population and become strong advocates for people who are homeless.
			   The entire College of Nursing has adopted this program as a model for community
			   health nursing experience and provided support to students and faculty who
			   serve the homeless residents of CASS.<BR>
	     <BR>
	     Graduates of the program have
			   expressed an interest in developing a volunteer nursing service at the shelter
			   and have made commitments to serve the homeless population in some manner
			   regardless of their area of practice. <BR>

         <BR>
	     The College
			   Knowledge Project is an inter-departmental collaboration of Academic Affairs,
			   Student Affairs, Public Affairs, and K-12 schools to extend college awareness
			   and increase college-going expectations of Valley middle school students and
			   their families.<BR>
         <BR>
	     Building on the community education partnerships that
			   ASU's Academic Community Engagement Services has developed over the past
			   decade, and adding the expertise of the Division of Undergraduate Academic
			   Services, University Undergraduate Initiatives, Student Affairs' Community
			   Service Program, and the Office of Public Affair's Club ASU, The College
			   Knowledge Project was developed in partnership with Laird Elementary, Gililland
			   Middle School, and Tempe High School to inspire and support activities that
			   increase community knowledge about and interest in attending a college or
			   university, and to provide middle school students and their parents with
			   information about the accessibility and affordability of college.<BR>
         <BR>
	     Since
			   its launch in March 2003, College Knowledge Project team members have already
			   made seven presentations to over 150 4th through 8th grade children and two
			   presentations to over 50 of their parents, generating pre-/post-survey results
			   of measurable impact. <BR>

	     Early Start to College, a project of the Hispanic
			   Border Leadership Institute within the College of Education at Arizona State
			   University, is designed to provide essential early information to the central
			   Maricopa area Latino 8th and 9th graders and their parents about college
			   academic preparation, selecting a college, admissions requirements, the
			   application process, and financial aid possibilities. The goal of the program
			   is to motivate students who would be less likely to plan for college due to
			   economic or familial circumstances.<BR>
         <BR>
         Early Start to College was begun
			   with a grant from Lumina Foundation's McCabe Fund, which supports organizations
			   that enable students - particularly first-generation college students,
			   low-income students, and students of color - to broaden and make the most of
			   their opportunities in postsecondary education. As Martha D. Lamkin, President
			   and CEO of Lumina Foundation stated, "We are optimistic that these grassroots
			   initiatives . . . will help reduce the nation's college attainment gap by
			   assisting organizations, such as the Hispanic Border Leadership Institute, that
			   help students achieve their potential by expanding access to an education
			   beyond high school."<BR>
         <BR>
	     Early start to College is now serving 500 students
			   and over 200 parents in cooperation with Isaac, Phoenix, Tempe, and Tolleson
			   Elementary School Districts; Phoenix and Tolleson Union Districts; Stardust
			   House, Phoenix Teacher Prep Charter High School; and Phoenix, South Mountain,
			   and Estrella Mountain Community Colleges. <BR>

	     Dance Arizona Repertory Theater (DART) is the
			   community partnership dance company of the Department of Dance at Arizona State
			   University. DART's most prominent objective is to develop long-term
			   collaborative and creative partnerships with culturally diverse and underserved
			   after-school programs. Under the direction of ASU Dance faculty and facilitated
			   in cooperation with ASU students, DART continually strives to provide quality
			   arts programming that results in an experience, not only in art education, but
			   also in developing life skills that address issues of leadership, sharing,
			   respect and pro-active problem solving. <BR>
         <BR>
	     DART has founded partnerships
			   with Sylvestre S. Herrera School for the Fine Arts, Boys and Girls Clubs of the
			   East Valley, and the Thomas J. Pappas School for Migrant Youth, and Peoria
			   School District. At each site, youth are engaged in collaborative artistic
			   workshops with local and national guest artists that challenge them in their
			   approach to educational and practical concepts. The participating youth are
			   provided with an open, safe and nurturing after-school environment; a need of
		    the surrounding communities of ASU, Arizona and our nation. </p>
