  Facts </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Background<br>
      </strong>From the beginning of its search for a Valley location, Google expressed great interest in ASU. In fact, one of the main reasons the company decided to open a Phoenix-metro location was because it determined that ASU was producing high quality students in engineering, business and other disciplines who could become a pipeline for its future employees. Indeed, Google met with members of the computer science faculty at both ASU&rsquo;s Polytechnic campus in Mesa and at the Tempe campus even before the company indicated its interest in leasing real estate. Google&rsquo;s search for a specific location to lease was a process completely driven by Google.Because a relationship with Google could provide significant benefits to ASU&rsquo;s academic and research programs, as well as enable ASU to help promote economic development of the Valley and state, the university was happy to establish links with Google no matter where the company located in the Valley. In short, ASU was responsive to Google&rsquo;s efforts to establish an initial presence in Metropolitan Phoenix because the entire Valley would benefit from such an important &ldquo;knowledge economy&rdquo; company locating here.</p>
      <p><strong>ASU-Google connections<br>
      </strong>There will be joint education and research projects involving ASU and Google. Google will be a source of internships for ASU students and jobs for ASU graduates. In fact, it began hiring ASU students immediately after its October announcement to seek a Valley location. Certain Google professional staff will be adjunct faculty at ASU and will sit on advisory boards of research centers and academic departments. Because of these types of affiliations that add value to ASU&rsquo;s education and research programs, Google staff will be able to use ASU&rsquo;s libraries and are welcome to pay for certain ASU amenities such as memberships in the university&rsquo;s recreation center.</p>
      <p><strong>Terms of the lease<br>
      </strong>The University Services Building (USB), an ASU administrative building, is located on Rural Road, south of Apache Boulevard.</p>
      <p>Google will initially lease 10,000 square feet of office space, which will accommodate approximately 50 or more employees. The plan is that Google would expand its space in this building to 28,000 square feet by July 2006, which could then accommodate approximately 150 employees. However, the number of employees Google will actually locate in the facility is strictly the company&rsquo;s decision.</p>
      <p>The lease rate for Google is $20 per square foot, which is market rate compared to equivalent space in the Tempe area. </p>
      <p>The lease is for 3 years maximum. </p>
      <p><strong>Short-term lease<br>
      </strong>Although ASU leases space to restaurants, food service companies, banks and other retail services in such places as its Memorial Union and Brickyard complex in Tempe, the Google lease is not an &ldquo;ongoing lease&rdquo;. Instead, the lease is only intended to meet Google&rsquo;s need for immediate and temporary space in the Valley. ASU believes that SkySong, the ASU-Scottsdale Center for Innovation, would be an ideal permanent location for Google. However, where and when &#8212; and under what conditions &#8212; Google would expand its area operations to permanent quarters is solely the company&rsquo;s decision. Nothing concerning the parameters of that decision has been communicated to the university.</p>
