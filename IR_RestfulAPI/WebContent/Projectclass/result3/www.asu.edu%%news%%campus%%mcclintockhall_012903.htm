      <h2>What's in a name?<br>
        McClintock Hall memorializes former student</h2>
      <p> <img src="campus_images/mcclintockhall_012903.jpg" alt="McClintock Hall" width="288" height="187" align="right">Students 
        who live in McClintock Hall, like most students at ASU, live busy lives 
        - some juggling a full load of classes and working every day.</p>
      <p>But some believe their hall's namesake was the busiest student at ASU. 
        In addition to studying for his classes during his last year at the Territorial 
        Normal School, James Harvey McClintock owned a large farm near Tempe, 
        served as Tempe's justice of the peace, published a newspaper - the Tempe 
        News - and helped supervise county road building. </p>
      <p>McClintock, a member of the first graduating class of the Territorial 
        Normal School in 1887, was founding president of the Territorial Normal 
        School alumni association, taught school, was a newspaper editor, worked 
        as a correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, served as Phoenix postmaster 
        and was appointed Arizona state historian in 1919.</p>
      <p>He was selected to be in the scouting party in the early 1900s that was 
        searching for possible locations for dams as the Salt River Project was 
        being formed.<br>
        McClintock even found the time to write a three-volume history of his 
        adopted state, "Arizona - The Youngest State."</p>
      <p>McClintock, born Feb. 2, 1864 in Sacramento, Calif., began his hard-working 
        ways as a young man. At the age of 15, he moved to Arizona and worked 
        as a carnival roustabout - a worker who put up and took down the tents 
        and cared for the animals. </p>
      <p>Then he became a printer's devil (apprentice) for his brother Charles, 
        who was publisher of the Salt River Herald, getting the first injection 
        of printer's ink in his blood.</p>
      <p>History doesn't record why, but McClintock, who later would become Colonel 
        of the First Arizona Infantry, was asked to help recruit young Arizona 
        men to fight in the 1898 Spanish-American War. He went to combat, landing 
        in Cuba's Santiago Harbor as captain of the B Troop in the Roosevelt Rough 
        Riders. He came back from the brief war with leg wounds that would bother 
        him the rest of his life. <br>
        He died in California May 10, 1934.</p>
      <p>He was memorialized with McClintock Hall when it opened in 1951. At the 
        time it was a dormitory for women. Today, the quadrangle building houses 
        168 undergraduate students, both men and women.</p>
