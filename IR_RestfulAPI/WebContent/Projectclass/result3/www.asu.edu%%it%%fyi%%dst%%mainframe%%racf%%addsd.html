FUNCTION
          5740-XXH  (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 1987

    The ADDSD command adds generic and/or discrete data set profiles
    to the RACF data base and can turn on the RACF indicator for the
    data sets.

    In order to add a data set profile:
       1) you must have the SPECIAL attribute, or
       2) you must have the same userid as the first-level qualifier
          of the profile, or
       3) you must have at least create authority to a group whose
          name matches the profile's first-level qualifier, or
       4) you must have the group-SPECIAL attribute in the group
          whose name matches the profile's first-level qualifier or
          in the group owning the userid that matches the profile's
          first-level qualifier.

               FGENERIC

  REQUIRED - profile-name - At least one name must be specified
  DEFAULTS - SET, AUDIT(FAILURES(READ)), LEVEL(0)
  ALIAS    - AD
  NOTES    - (1) in order to specify NOSET, you must have the SPECIAL
                 attribute or your userid must match the profile
                 name's first-level qualifier.
             (2) for generic names, the VOLUME, UNIT, SET, NOSET,
                 SETONLY, MODEL, and tape operands are ignored.


OPERANDS
    profile-name...
      Specifies the profiles whose descriptors are to be added to the
      RACF data base.  If a data set is password protected, the
      password can be specified as part of the profile name.  If the
      data set is password protected and no password is supplied, the
      logon password is used.

  UNIT(type)
      Specifies the device type on which the non-VSAM uncataloged data
      set resides.  Type can be (1) an installation-defined group
      name, (2) a generic device type, or (3) a unit device address.
      If UNIT is specified, VOLUME must also be specified.

      This operand is ignored for generic names.

  VOLUME(volume-serial...)
      Specifies the volumes on which the non-VSAM data set resides.
      This parameter is required if the data set is not cataloged.
      This parameter should not be specified for VSAM data sets.  If
      VOLUME is specified, UNIT must also be specified.

      This operand is ignored for generic names.

  OWNER(userid or group-name)
      Specifies a RACF-defined user or group to be the profile owner.
      If the profile is for a group data set, the user must have at
      least USE authority to the group.  If this operand is omitted,
      the command issuer is defined as the owner, and, for group data
      sets, the command issuer's userid is added to the access list
      with ALTER authority.  The user specified as the owner does not
      automatically have access to the data set.  Use the PERMIT
      command to add the owner to the access list.

  UACC(ALTER | CONTROL | UPDATE | READ | NONE)
      Specifies the universal access for the profile.  If UACC is not
      specified, the default universal access in your current connect
      group is used.

      The valid subfields are:

            ALTER   - ALTER access authority
            CONTROL - CONTROL access authority
            UPDATE  - UPDATE access authority
            READ    - READ access authority
            NONE    - No access authority

  AUDIT(NONE | ALL | SUCCESS | FAILURES | (access-type))
      Specifies  when logging is to occur for the profile.

      The valid subfields are:

            NONE     - Do not log

      or one of the following:

            ALL      - Log all accesses
            FAILURES - Log only access failures
            SUCCESS  - Log only successful accesses

      optionally followed by an access type in parentheses:

            READ     - Log all access types
            UPDATE   - Log UPDATE, CONTROL, and ALTER access types
            CONTROL  - Log CONTROL and ALTER access types
            ALTER    - Log only ALTER access types

      The default is AUDIT(FAILURES(READ)).

  ERASE
      Indicates that the data set will be erased by data management if
      the ERASE-ON-SCRATCH facility is active when the data set is
      scratched.  ERASE is not valid with TAPE.

  LEVEL(nn)
      Specifies a level indicator to be associated with the profile.
      nn must be an integer from 0 to 99.  The default is LEVEL(0).

  SET
      Specifies that the RACF indicator for the data set is to be
      turned on.  SET is the default.

      This operand is ignored for generic names.

  NOSET
      Specifies that the RACF indicator for the data set should not be
      turned on.  In order to specify NOSET, you must have the SPECIAL
      attribute or your userid must match the data set's first-level
      qualifier.

      This operand is ignored for generic names.

  SETONLY
      Specifies that, for a tape data set, an entry should be created
      in the TVTOC only.  No discrete data set profile will be
      created.  SETONLY is treated as SET if TAPE is not also
      specified.

      This operand is ignored for generic names.

  MODEL
      Specifies that the data set profile will be used for modelling.
      The unit and volume information is optional.  No attempt will be
      made to set the RACF indicator.

      This operand is ignored for generic names.

  GENERIC
      Indicates that the profile name should be treated as generic
      even if it does not contain any generic characters.

  TAPE
      Indicates that the data set profile to be added is a tape data
      set.  If the tape data set protection facility is inactive, TAPE
      will be treated as an invalid operand.

      This operand is ignored for generic names.

  DATA('installation-defined-data')
      Specifies a text string whose contents will be placed in the
      data set profile.  A maximum of 255 characters will be stored.

  WARNING
      Specifies that a warning message should be issued if the access
      authority is insufficient, but that the request should be
      allowed.

  NOTIFY(userid)
      Specifies a RACF-defined user to be notified when this profile
      denies access to a data set.

  FILESEQ(number)
      Specifies the file sequence number from 1 to 9999 for an
      uncataloged tape data set.  The default is FILESEQ(1).

  RETPD(nnnnn)
      Specifies, for tape data sets, the number of days the data set
      must be kept before it can be deleted or written over by another
      data set.  If not specified, an installation- specified default
      will be used.

  ADDCATEGORY(category-name ...)
      Specifies one or more installation defined category names.  The
      arguments for this keyword must be members of the category
      profile in the SECDATA class.  Users without access to all
      categories specified will be denied access to the data set.

  SECLEVEL(seclevel-name)
      Specifies an installation-defined SECLEVEL name.  The argument
      must be in the member list of the SECLEVEL profile in the
      SECDATA class.  Users with less than the specified LEVEL will be
      denied access to the data set.

  FROM(profile-name-2)
      Specifies the name of an existing profile that is to be used as
      a MODEL when defining the new profile.  profile-name-2 may name
      either a discrete or generic profile.

  FCLASS(profile-name-2-class)
      Specifies the name of the class to which profile-name-2 belongs.
      Valid class names are DATASET and those defined in the class
      descriptor table.  The default is FCLASS(data set).

  FVOLUME(profile-name-2-serial)
      Specifies the volume to be used when locating profile-name-2.
      Only valid when FCLASS is DATASET and profile-name-2 specifies a
      discrete name.

  FGENERIC
      Specifies that profile-name-2 is to be treated as a generic
      name, even if it does not contain any generic characters.

  ICH09000I NOT AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE command-name

            Explanation:  You are not defined to RACF and cannot issue
            the ADDSD or DELDSD commands, or RACF is not active.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH09001I UNABLE TO ESTABLISH ESTAE

            Explanation:  The command processor was unable to
            establish an ESTAE recovery environment.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH09002I NOT AUTHORIZED TO CREATE GROUP DATA SETS FOR
            GROUP group-name

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to
            create group data sets.  Processing continues with the
            next data set.

  ICH09004I data-set-name ALREADY DEFINED TO RACF

            Explanation:  The data set name indicated in the message
            was found in the RACF data base.

            System Action:  RACF does not change the definition.
            Processing continues with the next data set.

  ICH09005I data-set-name NOT FOUND (ON volume | IN CATALOG)

            Explanation:  If "ON volume" appears in the message, the
            specified non-VSAM data set name was not found on the
            indicated volume.

            If "IN CATALOG" appears in the message, the specified VSAM
            or non-VSAM data set name was not found by a catalog
            search.

            System Action:  If the data set was not found on a
            particular volume, the command processor attempts to
            process the data set on any remaining volumes.

            If the data set cannot be found in the catalog, processing
            continues with the next data set.

  ICH09006I USER OR GROUP name NOT DEFINED TO RACF

            Explanation:  The indicated name (userid or group name)
            was specified as the first-level qualifier of the data set
            name but could not be found on the RACF data base.  To
            protect a data set with RACF, the first-level qualifier of
            the data set name must be a RACF-defined userid or group
            name.

            System Action:  Processing continues with the next data
            set.

  ICH09007I OWNER SPECIFIED IS NOT A RACF DEFINED USER OR
                     GROUP

            Explanation:  The userid or group name specified on the
            OWNER operand is not defined to RACF.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH09008I VOLUME INFORMATION IN RACF PROFILE INCONSISTENT
            WITH CATALOG VOLUME INFORMATION

            Explanation:  In processing a request to delete RACF
            protection for a VSAM data set, RACF found that the volume
            serial number in the data set profile does not match the
            volume serial number in the containing catalog.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

            Problem Determination:  Use the Access Method Services
            LISTCAT command and the RACF LISTDSD command to locate the
            inconsistency.  Processing continues with the next data
            set.

  ICH09009I OWNER SPECIFIED HAS INSUFFICIENT AUTHORITY TO GROUP

            Explanation:  For a group data set, the userid specified
            on the OWNER operand does not have group authority to the
            group and cannot be named the owner of the group data set.

  ICH09010I NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPECIFY NOSET

            Explanation:  To specify NOSET, your userid must match the
            first-level qualifier of the data set name, you must have
            the SPECIAL attribute, or the data set profile is in a
            group in which you have the group-SPECIAL attribute.

            System Action:  Processing continues with the next data
            set.

  ICH09011I NOT AUTHORIZED TO DELETE RACF PROTECTION FOR data-set-name

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient access authority
            to delete RACF protection for the data set specified.

            System Action:  Processing continues with the next data
            set.

  ICH09012I data-set-name (ON volume) ALREADY RACF INDICATED

            Explanation:  While attempting to RACF-indicate the data
            set named in the message, the command processor found that
            the data set was already RACF-indicated.  The RACF
            indicator is in the VSAM catalog for a VSAM data set, in
            the DSCB on volume 'volume' for a non-VSAM DASD data set,
            or in the TVTOC for tape volume 'volume'.

            System Action:  Processing continues with the next data
            set.

  ICH09013I data-set-name (ON volume) IS NOT RACF INDICATED

            Explanation:  While attempting to remove RACF indication
            for the data set indicated in the message, the command
            processor found that the data set was not RACF-indicated.
            The RACF indicator is in the VSAM catalog for a VSAM DASD
            data set, in the DSCB on the indicated 'volume' for a
            non-VSAM DASD data set, or in the TVTOC for tape volume
            'volume'.

            System Action:  Processing continues with the next data
            set.

  ICH09014I INCOMPLETE UNIT/VOLUME INFORMATION SPECIFIED

            Explanation:  Either unit or volume information was
            specified, but not both.  If the data set is cataloged, do
            not specify unit or volume.  If the data set is not
            cataloged, specify both unit and volume.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH09015I I/O ERROR ON OBTAIN ON VOLUME volume

            Explanation:  An OBTAIN issued for the data set on the
            volume indicated resulted in an error return code.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH09016I VSAM CATALOG RETURN CODE IS
            rc - REASON CODE IS IGGOCLaa - crs

            Explanation:  The return code rc and reason code crs were
            returned by the catalog management module IGGOCLaa as a
            result of a catalog error or exceptional condition.  For
            an explanation of the return and reason codes, see the
            description of message IDC3009I in System Messages.

            System Action:  Processing continues with the next data
            set.

  ICH09017I I/O ERROR PROCESSING VTOC ON VOLUME volume

            Explanation:  An I/O error occurred while reading or
            writing a DSCB to the volume indicated.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH09018I OPEN FAILED ON VOLUME volume

            Explanation:  An OPEN failed for the data set to be
            protected or for the VTOC data set on the volume
            indicated.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH09019I data-set-name (ON volume) - RACF INDICATOR
            INCONSISTENT WITH DATA SET PROFILE

            Explanation:  RACF protection was partially added or
            deleted for the data set indicated in the message.

            System Action:  The RACF indicator for the data set was
            processed successfully in the VSAM catalog entry, in the
            DSCB on DASD volume 'volume', or in the TVTOC for tape
            volume 'volume', but the associated data set profile on
            the RACF data base was not successfully processed.
            Processing continues with the next data set.

  ICH09020I data-set-name NOT DEFINED TO RACF

            Explanation:  The data set profile for the data set
            indicated in the message was not found on the RACF data
            base.

            System Action:  Processing continues with the next data
            set.

  ICH09021I data-set-name (ON volume) (AND REMAINING VOLUMES)
            NOT PROCESSED

            Explanation:  RACF processing was not successful for the
            indicated data set.  For non-VSAM data sets, RACF
            processing was not successful on the volume 'volume'.  The
            phrase AND REMAINING VOLUMES means that all volumes
            sequentially after the indicated volume in the catalog
            entry for the data set or in the VOL list specified on the
            command were not processed.

  ICH09022I COMMAND PROCESSOR ENCOUNTERED SYSTEM ERROR

            Explanation:  The RDJFCB function failed during the
            processing of the RACF indicator for a volume of a
            non-VSAM data set.

  ICH09023I data-set-name - LAST VOLUME ADDED TO DATA SET PROFILE
            WAS volume

            Explanation:  During processing of the ADDSD command with
            the NOSET option specified, an error occurred while adding
            volume serials to the newly created data set profile on
            the RACF data base.

            System Action:  The volume indicated by 'volume' was the
            last volume added before the terminating error.

            User Response:  Use the ADDVOL operand of the ALTDSD
            command to add the remaining volumes.

  ICH09024I data-set-name INVALID DATA SET NAME

            Explanation:  The data set indicated in the message is not
            a valid qualified name or the first qualifier exceeded the
            maximum allowed length of eight characters.

            System Action:  Processing continues with the next data
            set.

  ICH09025I NOT AUTHORIZED TO RACF PROTECT data-set-name

            Explanation:  You are not authorized to RACF-protect the
            data set indicated in the message.  To protect a user data
            set, the first-level qualifier of the data set name must
            match your userid or you must have the SPECIAL attribute
            or the data set profile is in a group in which you have
            the group-SPECIAL attribute.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH09026I data-set-name HAS DUPLICATE VOLUME SERIALS

            Explanation:  The same volume serial was found twice in
            the list of volume serials for the data set indicated in
            the message.

            System Action:  RACF does not process and volumes and
            terminates the command.

  ICH09027I data-set-name IN USE - TRY AGAIN LATER

            Explanation:  For the VSAM data set indicated in the
            message, the catalog entry containing the RACF indicator
            cannot be modified because the data set specified is in
            use.

            System Action:  Processing continues with the next data
            set.

  ICH09028I INSTALLATION EXIT FAILED (DEFINE,DELETE) REQUEST
            FOR data-set-name

            Explanation:  The command preprocessing exit routine
            ICHCNX00 issued a return code of 4, indicating that RACF
            should fail the ADDSD or DELDSD request for the data set
            indicated in the message.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

            User Response:  Report this message to the system
            programmer.

  ICH09029I ERROR ENCOUNTERED DURING VTOC ACCESS, RETURN CODE IS xx,
            CVSTAT IS yyy.

            Explanation:  The Common VTOC Access Facility (CVAF)
            issued a non-zero return code, indicating that the VTOC
            update operation did not complete successfully.  Return
            code xx (the contents of register 15 from a CVAF
            invocation) and CVSTAT value yyy are documented in Data
            Facility Device Support User's Guide and Reference,
            GC26-3952.  On MVS/XA, see MVS/XA System Programming
            Library: Data Management, GC26-4014.

  ICH09030I FILESEQ(nnnn) ALREADY DEFINED IN TVTOC FOR SPECIFIED
            VOLUME(S)

            Explanation:  For a tape data set, file sequence number
            nnnn is already defined in the TVTOC for the volume(s)
            specified.  Message ICH09021I will follow this message.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            data set.

  ICH09031I COMMAND PROCESSING TERMINATED.  FILESEQ(nnnn) IS
            INCONSISTENT WITH CURRENT VOLUME CONTENTS

            Explanation:  The specified tape volumes already have data
            sets defined, and the file sequence number nnnn would fall
            after a multi-volume data set on the first volume
            specified, or the second or succeeding volume(s) are not
            currently empty, or the specified tape volume has been
            marked as a single data set volume and the file sequence
            number specified is greater than one.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH09032I UNABLE TO LOCATE TAPE VOLUME FOR DATA SET

            Explanation:  A specific volume for the data set was not
            specified.  RACF attempted to locate a catalog entry for
            the tape date set and an entry could not be found.

            System Action:  Command processing is terminated.

            User Response:  Specify the correct volume for the
            dataset.

  ICH09033I TAPE DATA SET PROTECTION IS INACTIVE.  TAPE IS NOT VALID

            Explanation:  The TAPE keyword may not be specified
            because the tape data set protection facility is inactive.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH09034I GENERIC INVALID, GENERIC COMMAND PROCESSING IS INACTIVE

            Explanation:  The GENERIC operand is invalid.  because the
            generic command processing facility is inactive.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH09035I COMMAND PROCESSING TERMINATED.  USER NOT
            AUTHORIZED TO 'FROM' PROFILE profile-name

            Explanation:  The user does not have sufficient authority
            to the profile specified in the FROM option.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH09036I COMMAND PROCESSING TERMINATED. 'FROM' PROFILE
            profile-name DOES NOT EXIST

            Explanation:  The profile name specified in the FROM
            operand is not an existing profile.

            If the FVOLUME operand was specified, RACF could not
            locate a profile with the specified name and volume.

            If the FVOLUME operand was not specified, either:

            o   There is no profile with the specified name, or

            o   There is more than one discrete profile with the same
                name protecting data sets on different volumes.

            Note:  For fully qualified generic names, the FGENERIC
            operand must be specified in order to find a matching
            generic profile.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH09037I NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE VOLUME nnnn

            Explanation:  The tape volume is already RACF protected
            and the current user has an insufficient authority to it.

            System Action:  Command processing is terminated.

            User Response:  Obtain the authority or specify a
            different volume.

  ICH09038I COMMAND PROCESSING TERMINATED.  USER SPECIFIED
            FOR NOTIFY NOT RACF DEFINED

            Explanation:  The userid specified on the NOTIFY operand
            is not a RACF-defined user.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH09039I COMMAND PROCESSING TERMINATED.  MULTIPLE TAPE
            DATA SETS AND MULTIPLE VOLUMES WERE SPECIFIED

            Explanation:  The user has specified multiple tape data
            sets and multiple volumes.  Either multiple tape data sets
            or multiple volumes may be specified, but not both.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH09041I COMMAND PROCESSING TERMINATED.  FGENERIC NOT
            AUTHORIZED FOR FCLASS SPECIFIED

            Explanation:  The FCLASS keyword was specified with a
            class name other than DATASET or one of those classes
            defined in the class descriptor table.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH09042I COMMAND PROCESSING TERMINATED.  NO (SECLEVELS |
            CATEGORIES) FOUND

            Explanation:  RACF could not validate the name you
            specified on the SECLEVEL or ADDCATEGORY keyword. This
            happened for one of two reasons:

            o   There is no SECLEVEL or CATEGORY profile.
            o   A profile is defined, but it doesn't contain any
                members.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.
