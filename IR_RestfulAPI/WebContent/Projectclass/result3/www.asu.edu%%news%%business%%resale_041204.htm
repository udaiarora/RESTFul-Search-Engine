      <h2>Greater Phoenix resale market reaches new heights in March </h2>
      <p>The Greater Phoenix resale home market continued to surge with a monthly record of 8,780 sales in March, surpassing the previous record set in September 2003 (8,185 sales). This compares to 5,580 homes sold in the previous month, and is well ahead of last year's 6,725 sales. For the first quarter or 2004 a total of 19,460 homes were recorded sold, up from 15,030 homes in 2003 and 12,655 homes in 2002. </p>
      <p>It appears that people cannot get enough of the local housing market. The motivations of home buyers continue unabated: the desire to own rather than rent, to move up to a better home, and to acquire investment properties. Although the home-buying appetite seems insatiable, there are concerns that a still-struggling job market could impact the future income of owners and buyers alike. Further, the strengthening economy, worries about the U.S. deficit, and the possible inflationary pressures of increasing energy costs could lead to higher mortgage rates. Since some of the current purchases are being financed by adjustable rate mortgages, higher interest rates could impact the ability of some of these home buyers to retain their homes. Higher rates combined with stable income and higher home prices will adversely impact the affordability of housing, leading to a potential slowdown of activity. Another consideration is that people with low mortgage rates have little incentive to move and thus provide some additional stimulus to the market. </p>
      <p>Since the record median home price of $160,560 was set in August 2003, there was some decline but the prices have been slowly improving this year - from $156,000 in January to $158,120 in February, reaching a new record of $162,000 for March. For first quarter 2004, the median home price was $159,705, compared to $148,750 in first quarter 2003. Since the Greater Phoenix area is so large, the median price can range significantly: from $395,000 in North Scottsdale to $97,000 in the central western areas of the city of Phoenix. In the first quarter of this year, 48 percent of all recorded sales were for homes priced from $100,000 to $175,000, and 15 percent for homes priced over $300,000. </p>
      <p>The 3,765 resale townhouse/condominium units recorded sold in the first quarter was up from the 3,215 in first quarter 2003 and 2,970 for first quarter 2002. The median price did increase to a record $110,000 compared to $101,000 for a year ago. </p>
      <p>The median square footage for a single-family home recorded sold in first quarter 2004 was 1,655 - an increase over 1,640 square feet reported a year ago. In the townhouse/condominium sector, the median square footage was 1,185, the same as reported a year ago. </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; In comparison to first quarter 2003, recorded sales in the city of Phoenix increased from 4,270 to 5,340, while the median price increased from $122,945 to $128,500. Since Phoenix is a geographically large city, the median prices can range significantly: for example, $96,900 in the Sky Harbor area and $200,000 in the Union Hills area. The townhouse/condominium sector also improved, from 800 to 1,040 sales, while the median price declined from $93,000 to $92,875. </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; The Scottsdale resale home market improved from 1,530 to 1,895 recorded sales. The median sales price continued to rise, from $300,000 to $346,000. The median resale home price is $395,000 in North Scottsdale and $179,225 in South Scottsdale. The townhouse/condominium sector in Scottsdale grew from 745 to 850 sales, while the median sales price <a name="_Hlt445777034"></a>increased from $150,000 to $170,000. </p>

      <p>&#149;&nbsp; In comparison to a year ago, the Sun City resale market increased from 400 to 495 sales, with the median sales price increasing from $108,900 to $127,000. Resale activity in Sun City West declined from 310 to 250 recorded sales, but the median sales price rose from $151,000 to $155,000. The townhouse/condominium market in Sun City improved from 270 to 295 recorded sales, while the median home price increased from $77,000 to $84,000. In Sun City West, sales slightly improved from 75 to 100 sales and the median sales price rose from $105,000 to $116,500. </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; The resale market in Gilbert was better as activity grew from 870 to 1,095 sales and the median sales price increased from $167,000 to $188,000. The townhouse/condominium market slowed from 60 to 50 sales as the median sales price rose from $113,450 to $128,000. </p>
