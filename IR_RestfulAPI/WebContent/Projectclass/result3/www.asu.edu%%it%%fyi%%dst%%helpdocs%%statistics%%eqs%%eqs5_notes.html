<h2>EQS 5.1 for UNIX Release Notes<br>
(November 1, 1995)</h2><p>
<h4>(from the <i>EQS/UNIX User's Guide</i>, published by<br>
<a href="http://www.mvsoft.com/">Multivariate Software, Inc.</a>, 
October 1995)</h4>
</center>


In the efforts to improve the quality of EQS, 
we have added several new features beyond those
described in written documentation. 
This document describes the new features and certain corrections.<p>

For users who have been working with version 3.21 or 4.20, 
this upgrade expresses our thanks for your support.<p>

<ol><li><strong>Yuan-Bentler Corrected AGLS Chi-square Statistic</strong> 
(New)<p>

We have added a new asymptotically distribution free (ADF) statistic 
called 
the Yuan-Bentler Corrected AGLS Chi-square (Yuan & Bentler, 1995). 
It is computed automatically when the AGLS method is requested. 
Theory predicts and simulation has shown that this statistic 
is a major improvement on the
standard ADF test statistic when sample size is intermediate to small. 
This statistic is provided now, prior
to its formal publication, to permit a wider study of its performance.<p>

Note: We recommend that you implement this statistic by also setting<p>
<ul><code><pre>/TECHNICAL<br>   AITR=30;<p></code></pre></ul>

which yields the fully iterated AGLS estimator. 
Without this statement, you get the Bentler-Dijkstra
(1985) linearized version of the new test statistic.<p>

<li><strong>Robust CFI</strong> (New)<p>

Previous versions of EQS did not compute a robust CFI fit index 
with the ML Robust method. 
EQS now prints both the ML CFI (based on the ML chi-square statistics) 
and the Robust CFI (based on Satorra-Bentler chi-square statistics 
for the independence or uncorrelated variables model and the current model)
when the ML Robust method is requested.<p>

<li><strong>Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)</strong> (New)<p>

RMSEA and its 90 percent confidence interval can now be obtained 
in the EQS printout. 
RMSEA and other additional fit indices will be printed 
when using the following print option:<p>

<ul><code><pre>/print<br>   fit=all;<p></code></pre></ul>

<li><strong>Running Multiple Datasets Using A Single Model</strong> (New)<p>

We provide a convenient new feature to analyze external 
simulated data with many replications. 
To use this option, you should have one model and a 
dataset with certain characteristics containing many
replications placed end to end. 
This data set will have been generated outside EQS, 
using your own procedures. 
This option permits you to analyze these data 
using EQS and store the results into a file for
further analysis. 
An example is as follows:

<ul><code><pre>/title
  eqs model using external simulated data
/specifications
  var=6; cases=30; method=ml; matrix=raw;
  data='mydata.dat'; level=v0; loop=200;<br>

/output
  data='simul.dat';
  parameters; standard errors;
/end<p></ul></code></pre>

There are two new keywords in the <code>/specification</code> paragraph. 
One is <code>level</code> and the other is <code>loop</code>. 
You must use <code>level=v0;</code> to tell EQS 
to run a single model with multiple replications. 
The <code>loop=200;</code> tells the
program to run 200 replications using dataset <code>mydata.dat</code>. 
The model will use 30 cases for each analysis in
a single replication. 
It is your responsibility to make sure that the 
data file <code>mydata.dat</code> has 30 * 200 = 6000 cases. 
The specific output you want to study is specified 
in the <code>/output</code> paragraph. 
Note: Extensive data will be generated with this method.<p>

You can only use a raw data file to run this method; 
it cannot be implemented with an ESS file.<p>

<li><strong>Case Contributions to Parameter Variances With ML, 
ROBUST</strong> (New)<p>

EQS will compute an index for each subject 
indicating the extent to which that case contributes to the
robust variances (standard error squared) of parameter estimates. 
The 120 largest case contributions
(sorted in descending order) to parameter variances are printed. 
This information may be helpful in
identifying anomalous or outlier subjects. 
Research is needed to evaluate the usefulness of this index.<p>

<li><strong>Corrected Elliptical Theory Statistics</strong><p>

The test statistic for the model of uncorrelated 
or independent variables, computed automatically in EQS,
was computed incorrectly with the elliptical GLS method. 
This bug has been fixed.  
Iterative elliptical computations also have been improved 
for faster, more accurate convergence.<p>

<li><strong>Corrected Polychoric Statistic for Extremely Skewed 
Data</strong><p>

The polychoric correlation matrix computed for categorical 
data depends on an iterative process. 
With variables that are highly skewed in opposite directions, 
due to an inadequate convergence criterion the
iterative process was found to terminate 
prematurely thus yielding a poor correlation estimate. 
This problem has been fixed.<p>

<li><strong>Handle 100 Groups in Multi-sample Analysis</strong><p>

EQS can handle 100 groups in multi-sample analysis. 
User has to be cautious that fitting a model with
many groups may require very large amount of working array 
and the model may take a long time to complete.<p>

<li><strong>Process 200 Variables and 200 Factors</strong><p>

Unlike previous version of EQS, release 5.1 can 
proeess 200 measured variables and 200 factors. 
The number of variables and factors cannot compensate to each other. 
For example, the program cannot handle
202 measured variables and 50 factors because 
it exceeds the limit of 200 variables.<p>

<li><strong>Printout Standard Deviation</strong><p>

Standard deviations will be printed out automatically 
on the univariate statistics section if a raw
data file is used for the analysis. 
This feature is to address the rule change on APA requirement to
report such information.
