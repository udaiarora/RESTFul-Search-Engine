                      <br>
<p> The evaluation criteria and procedures are developed through the University Libraries' collegial self-governance body, Librarians' Council. Each academic professional of the University Libraries is a voting member of this council and has the opportunity to provide input into the process of developing personnel policies and procedures.

                            <p>The University Libraries employ a goal-based model for annual evaluation. This process is described in detail in Section <A HREF="http://www.asu.edu

                      <p> Performance assessment is an integral component of the formal evaluation process set forth in the Librarians' Handbook. Performance is evaluated on the basis of goal achievement and other criteria relating to professional development and service. <br wp="br1">
  <br>
                      <p> In addition to a narrative assessment of the academic professional's achievements, performance is also assigned a numeric rating based on a multi-tiered scale of merit (see <A HREF="#def">definitions</A> at the end of this section). Numeric performance ratings range from "1" for unsatisfactory performance to "4" for outstanding performance. <br wp="br1">
