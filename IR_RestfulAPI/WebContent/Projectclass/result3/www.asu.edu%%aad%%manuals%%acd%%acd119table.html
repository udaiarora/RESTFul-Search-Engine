<P>
An employee who is convicted of a criminal drug charge resulting from a violation occurring in the workplace must notify the Office of General Counsel within five days of receiving the conviction.</P>

<P>
The Office of General Counsel notifies the employee&#146;s supervisor immediately, and coordinates with the appropriate university office to determine if further reporting of the conviction to a federal agency is required within 10 days. If required, the Office of General Counsel coordinates with the appropriate university office to notify the federal agency on the grant or contract and maintains appropriate records.</P>

<P>
Within 10 days after receiving notice of the conviction from the Office of General Counsel and in collaboration with the dean, the supervisor (chair, director, or center director) and the principal investigator on a grant or contract consults the executive vice president and provost of the university regarding sanctions to the employee. If appropriate, the supervisor and principle investigator initiate disciplinary action and/or referral to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) coordinator within 20 days after receiving the notice of conviction from the General Counsel&#146;s Office and in collaboration with the dean.</P>

<P>
If the employee is referred to EAP, the EAP coordinator and the employee meet to discuss referral to a drug rehabilitation program. The EAP coordinator may refer the employee to an appropriate community drug rehabilitation program based on the nature of the problem and the employee&#146;s group insurance coverage. If required, the employee participates in the drug rehabilitation program.</P>

<P>
Note: The employee may be required to provide evidence of participation  as a condition of continuing employment.</P>

<P>
The EAP coordinator notifies the employee&#146;s supervisor or principal investigator that the meeting did or did not take place and gives the name of the referral agency, if a referral was made.</P>
