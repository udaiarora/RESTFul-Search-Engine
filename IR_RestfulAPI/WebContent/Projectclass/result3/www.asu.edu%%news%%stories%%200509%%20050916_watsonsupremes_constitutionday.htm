              <p class="storyhead"><strong>With two Supreme Court openings, Bush facing pressure from all sides over nominations </strong></p>
              <p>President George W. Bush, with two open positions on the Supreme Court, is under pressure from liberals and conservatives alike as he considers justices to fill the open positions.</p>
              <p>With John Roberts nominated to fill the chief justice position and currently going through the confirmation process, the other open position &ndash; coming from the retirement of Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor &ndash; could become a lightning rod for conservatives and liberals, according to George Watson, ASU professor of political science in the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and an expert on the nomination process for the Supreme Court.</p>
              <p>&quot;The pressure will certainly be on Bush from the Democrats to find somebody less conservative than Roberts to fill the O&rsquo;Connor vacancy,&rdquo; Watson says. &ldquo;But there will be an awful lot of pressure on him from his base, many of whom believe this is the chance they have been waiting for to make a solid conservative majority in the Supreme Court.&rdquo;<img src="images/supremecourtB.jpg" width="200" height="124" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></p>
              <p>Bush has been wise to separate the two appointments, Watson adds, saying that while the president would like to fill the positions as soon as possible, running one candidate through the nomination process at a time is more prudent than trying to move two through, especially in light of the fact that Roberts appears to be a very strong candidate garnering favor from both sides of the aisle.</p>
              <p>&quot;If Bush is appointing two people who are pretty conservative, then the Democrats could use that against him,&rdquo; Watson says. &ldquo;Going with one at a time is probably a better strategy.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>While William Rehnquist and O&rsquo;Connor were considered conservative and were appointed by Republican presidents, the voting record of O&rsquo;Connor was more pivotal. She joined four liberal judges on many 5-4 decisions, including <em>Grutter v. Bollinger</em> (2003), which affirmed the right of state colleges and universities to use affirmative action in their admissions policies to increase educational opportunities and promote racial diversity on campus, and <em>Rush Prudential HMO Inc. v. Moran</em> (2002), which upheld state laws giving people the right a second doctor&rsquo;s opinion if their health maintenance organizations tried to deny them treatment.</p>
              <p>In contrast, Rehnquist was considered a solid conservative, voting in the negative on the two cases above, despite his reputation for supporting state&rsquo;s rights, albeit predominantly in cases that would limit federal authority. For example, in <em>U.S. v. Morrison</em> (1994), a conservative majority of five, including Rehnquist and O&rsquo;Connor, set aside provisions for the federal Violence Against Women Act on the basis that sexual assault was an issue for state and local governments to deal with, not Congress. </p>
              <p>Filling Rehnquist&rsquo;s spot with Roberts, who Watson believes will be confirmed relatively easily, will put Bush&rsquo;s next nominee for the Supreme Court into a much brighter spotlight where liberals and conservatives will battle to influence the president&rsquo;s decision.</p>
              <p>&quot;There are an awful lot of cases in which O&rsquo;Connor was the fifth justice in a liberal direction, even though she basically had a fairly conservative record,&rdquo; Watson says. &ldquo;That is why liberals are so particularly worried, because replacing her with somebody who is fairly conservative could put a lot of those 5-4 rulings in jeopardy.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Watson says Bush has not yet indicated who the second nominee might be. He believes the choice will depend on several factors, including how confident Bush feels in having a 10-member majority in the Senate &ndash; and how willing he is to put up a fight. But Watson does say that if Bush &ldquo;nominates a person who is more of an ideologue than Roberts, then there could be a fight.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>One thing is clear, Watson says: The public should be engaged in the nomination process, especially in ways that mean more than watching Senate hearings on television.</p>
              <p>Watson says the Internet offers great opportunities to find a group (either liberal or conservative) where people can take part in the process. He added that people also can contribute to organizations like the liberal People for the American Way or Alliance for Justice, or the conservative Free Congress Foundation or Progress for America, as well as a place to lend their voices.</p>
