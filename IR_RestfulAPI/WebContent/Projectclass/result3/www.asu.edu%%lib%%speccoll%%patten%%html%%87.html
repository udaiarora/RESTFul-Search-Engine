<p>Sir Hugh Plat was knighted by James I for his inventions and experiments
in agriculture, many of which can be seen in this work. It is also a how
to book with sections on such varied subjects as How to steal bees, How
to prevent drunkeness, How to keep oysters good ten to twelve days, etc.&nbsp;
The author presents "divers new and conceited experiments from the which
there may be sundry both pleasing and profitable uses drawn, by them that
have either wit, or will, to apply them."&nbsp; The author's advice is
practical at times, such as the description of how to make a portable pump,
which can then be used by those people who "dwell near the river of Thames,
to force up water for the service of their Kitchens, which may be performed
in a most reasonable manner."&nbsp; The work has a detailed table of contents.
