<P>Various errors may occur when you initially
try to establish a connection over a network with the DECnet access method.
 Many of these problems are related to the network.  SAS/CONNECT indicates
when errors of this nature occur by presenting a general message with the
specific return code for the error. The form of the message is 



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x<I>nn</I>)</PRE>
<P>where <B>nn</B>  is a nonzero return code that indicates the specific
problem.
<P>The following section explains the most common failures in establishing
DECnet communications.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x03)...</PRE>
<P>The SAS$CONN file is not defined on the remote host. This file is necessary
to invoke the remote SAS session.  Ensure that the file exists and is properly
defined to NCP or that it exists in the remote login directory.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x10)...</PRE>
<P>The host name that you specified as the value for the REMOTE= option
is invalid. Ask your systems personnel for valid names at your site.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x13)...</PRE>
<P>Permission to access the remote host was denied.  Verify that you specified
a valid userid and password for the remote system.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x50)...
ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x51)...</PRE>
<P>Your network is down or cannot be reached.  Contact your systems personnel.
 



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x64)... 
ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x65)...</PRE>
<P>Your remote host is down or cannot be reached.  Contact your systems
personnel.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x24) - 
no privilege for attempted operation.</PRE>
<P>Permission to perform the requested operation was denied. Verify that
you have the access privileges assigned correctly on your system.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0xF4) - 
network partner exited.</PRE>
<P>When trying to establish a session with a remote VMS system, this message
appears if the remote SAS session cannot create a WORK directory.
<P>To resolve this error, change the SET DEF DISK statement in the SAS$CONN.COM
file to a valid directory.  This statement can be removed completely, and
the remote SAS session will create a work directory under the directory it
is being executed from.  This statement should only be used if the user needs
the work directory created in a different location.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed.
ERROR: Remote SIGNON to nodename cancelled.</PRE>
<P>This error occurs if the remote node is busy or the login command files
are long.  In either case, the remote node does not respond in time, and the
local node times out.
<P>To increase the time that is needed before a connection request times
out on the local node, increase the NCP parameter EXECUTOR OUTGOING TIMER.
To increase the time needed before a connection request times out on the remote
node, increase the NCP parameter EXECUTOR INCOMING TIMER.
<P>The error message is 



<PRE>ERROR:  Network request failed (rc 0x3C) - 
Error number 0x3C00 occurred. 
ERROR:  Remote SIGNON to nodename cancelled.</PRE>
<P>If you cannot resolve a problem from the explanations given here, contact
SAS Technical Support for assistance.

<P>These messages may be issued by the DECnet access method when you attempt
to connect to a server with a PROC OPERATE statement or the REMOTE engine
(with a LIBNAME statement).  



<PRE>Network request failed (rc 0x4D) - Error number 0x4D27 occurred</PRE>
<P>The server that was specified by the SERVER= option is not running on
the specified node, or the remote node timed out.  



<PRE>Network request failed (rc 0x31) - Error number 0x3100 occurred.</PRE>
<P>A two-level server name was used and the node that was specified is
not known to the user's node.  Make sure the node name is spelled correctly
and examine the DECnet database.
