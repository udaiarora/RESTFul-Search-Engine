FUNCTION
          5740-XXH  (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 1987

  The ALTDSD command is used to modify the RACF description of one or
  more generic and/or discrete data set profiles.

  In order to specify a data set:
        - You must have group-SPECIAL authority and (1) the data set
          must be owned by the group or by a userid owned by the group
          or (2) the data set high-level qualifier must be the group
          name or a userid owned by the group, or
        - You must be the owner of the profile, have the SPECIAL
          attribute, or your userid must match the first qualifier of
          the profile, or (for discrete names only)
        - If you are explicitly authorized to the data set you must
          have ALTER authority, or
        - If your current connect group is explicitly authorized to
          the data set, the authority must be ALTER, or
        - The universal access of the data set must be ALTER, or
        - You must have the AUDITOR attribute.
  To specify the GLOBALAUDIT keyword, you must have the AUDITOR
  attribute or group-AUDITOR authority over the data set.

OPERANDS

  profile-name...
      Specifies the names of the generic and/or discrete data set
      profiles that are to be modified.  If a data set is password
      protected, you can specify the password as part of the data set
      name.  The password is needed only if the ADDVOL and set
      operands are used for a volume of a multi-volume password
      protected data set.  The write level password must then be
      available.  If the data set is protected and no password is
      supplied, the logon password is used.

  OWNER(userid or group-name)
      Specifies the userid of a user or a group name defined to RACF
      that is to be made the profile owner.  If the owner is a user,
      he must have at least USE authority in the group specified by
      the first-level qualifier of the data set name.  To change the
      owner of a profile, the user must be the current owner, have
      group-SPECIAL authority over the profile, or have the SPECIAL
      attribute.  The user or group specified as the owner does not
      automatically have access to the data set.  Use the PERMIT
      command to add the owner to the access list as desired.

  UACC(ALTER | CONTROL | UPDATE | READ | NONE)
      Specifies the new universal access for the data set.

      The valid subfields are:

            ALTER    - ALTER access authority
            CONTROL  - CONTROL access authority
            UPDATE   - UPDATE access authority
            READ     - READ access authority
            NONE     - No access authority

  AUDIT(NONE | ALL | SUCCESS | FAILURES | (access-type))
      Specifies  when logging is to occur for the profile.

      The valid subfields are:

            NONE     - Do not log

      or one of the following:

            ALL      - Log all accesses
            FAILURES - Log only access failures
            SUCCESS  - Log only successful accesses

      optionally followed by an access type in parentheses:

            READ     - Log all access types
            UPDATE   - Log UPDATE, CNTROL, and ALTER access types
            CONTROL  - Log CONTROL and ALTER access types
            ALTER - Log only ALTER access types

  GLOBALAUDIT(NONE | ALL | SUCCESS | FAILURES | (access-type))
      Specifies which access attempts the user wants to log, in
      addition to logging requested by the AUDIT operand.  Only users
      with the AUDITOR attribute or group-AUDITOR authority over the
      data set may specify GLOBALAUDIT.

      The valid subfields are:

            NONE     - Do not log

      or one of the following:

            ALL      - Log all accesses
            FAILURES - Log only access failures
            SUCCESS  - Log only successful accesses

      optionally followed by an access type in parentheses:

            READ     - Log all access types
            UPDATE   - Log UPDATE, CONTROL, and ALTER access types
            CONTROL  - Log CONTROL and ALTER access types
            ALTER    - Log only ALTER access types

  NOTIFY(userid)
      Specifies a RACF-defined user to be notified when this profile
      denies access to a resource.  If notify is entered with no
      userid, the command issuer will be notified.

  NONOTIFY
      Specifies that a user will not be notified when this profile
      denies access to a data set.

  ERASE
      Indicates that the data set will be erased by by data management
      if the ERASE-ON-SCRATCH facility is active when the data set is
      scratched.  ERASE is not valid with tape.

  NOERASE
      Indicates that the data set will not be erased by data
      management when it is scratched.

  LEVEL(nn)
      A new level indicator, where nn is an integer from 0 to 99.  It
      is included in all records that log the accesses to the data set
      and in the output of the LISTDSD command.

  ADDVOL(volume-serial)
      The volume specified is added to the profile.  Depending on
      whether SET is specified, the DSCB for the data set will be RACF
      indicated on this volume.  This operand applies only to non-VSAM
      data sets.  This operand is ignored for generic names.

  DELVOL(volume-serial)
      The volume specified is deleted from the profile.  Depending on
      whether set is specified, the RACF indicator bit in the DSCB of
      this data set on the volume is turned off.  The volume specified
      may not be the last volume in the profile.  This operand applies
      only to non-VSAM data sets.  This operand is ignored for generic
      names.

  VOLUME(volume-serial)
      The volume serial of the volume on which the data set resides
      (or where the VSAM catalog resides, for VSAM data sets).
      Required only if more than one data set with the same name has
      been defined to RACF.  This operand is ignored for generic
      names.

  ALTVOL(old-volume-serial new-volume-serial)
      Specifies that you want to change the volume serial number in
      the data set profile.  This operand can be specified for both
      VSAM and non-VSAM data sets.  If ALTVOL is specified, the SET
      and NOSET operands are ignored.  When ALTVOL is specified, the
      data set profile is modified but RACF indicator processing is
      not performed.  This operand is ignored for generic names.

  UNIT(type)
      Specifies the unit type to be added to the data set profile on
      which a non-VSAM data set resides.  You may specify an
      installation-defined group name, a generic device type, or a
      specific device address.  This operand is ignored for generic
      names.

  SET
      Together with ADDVOL and DELVOL, indicates that the RACF
      indicator bit in the data set's DSCB should be changed.  This
      operand is ignored if neither ADDVOL nor DELVOL is specified, or
      if the name is generic.

  NOSET
      Together with ADDVOL and DELVOL, indicates that no change should
      be made in the DSCB for this data set.  This operand is ignored
      if neither ADDVOL nor DELVOL is specified, or if the name is
      generic.  In order to specify NOSET, you must have the SPECIAL
      attribute or your userid must match the data set's first-level
      qualifier.

  GENERIC
      Indicates that the profile-name should be trated as a generic
      name, even if it does not contain any generic characters.

  DATA('installation-defined-data')
      Specifies a quoted string whose contents are to be stored in the
      data set profile.  A maximum length of 255 characters will be
      stored.

  NODATA
      Specifies that the installation data information contained in
      the data set profile should be deleted.

  WARNING
      Specifies that a warning message should be issued if access
      authority is insufficient, but access should be allowed.

  NOWARNING
      Specifies that access should not be allowed (rather than allowed
      with a warning message) if access authority is insufficient.

  RETPD(nnnnn)
      Specifies, for tape data sets, the number of days the data set
      must be kept before it can be deleted or written over by another
      data set.  nnnnn is a 1 to 5 digit number in the range of
      1-65533 or 99999 for tape data sets which never expire.

  ADDCATEGORY(category-name ...)
      Specifies one or more installation defined category names.  The
      arguments for this keyword must be members of the category
      profile in the SECDATA class.

  DELCATEGORY(category-name ...|*)
      Specifies one or more category names to be deleted from the
      profile.  If DELCATEGORY(*) is specified all category names will
      be deleted.  If DELCATEGORY is specified without any category
      names, all undefined category names will be deleted.

  SECLEVEL(seclevel-name)
      Specifies an installation-defined security level name.  The
      argument must be in the member list of the SECLEVEL profile in
      the SECDATA class.

  NOSECLEVEL
      Specifies that the security level name will be deleted for this
      profile.

  ICH22001I dsname NOT DEFINED TO RACF

            Explanation:  The named data set is not defined to RACF
            and cannot be altered.  Processing continues with the next
            data set.

  ICH22002I NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPECIFY OWNER

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to
            specify the OWNER keyword.

            continues with the next data set.

  ICH22006I OWNER SPECIFIED NOT DEFINED TO RACF

            Explanation:  The userid or group name specified on the
            OWNER operand is not a RACF-defined user.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            operand.

  ICH22007I OWNER SPECIFIED NOT AUTHORIZED TO GROUP

            Explanation:  The userid specified on the OWNER keyword
            does not have sufficient authority to the group whose name
            is the first level qualifier of the data set being
            altered.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            operand.

  ICH22008I ADDVOL/DELVOL NOT ALLOWED FOR VSAM DATA SET

            Explanation:  The ADDVOL and DELVOL operands apply only to
            non-VSAM data sets.

            System Action:  The ADDVOL or DELVOL operand is ignored.
            Command processing continues with the next operand.

  ICH22009I VOLUME SPECIFIED ALREADY EXISTS IN DATA SET PROFIILE

            Explanation:  ADDVOL or ALTVOL was specified which
            requests a volume to be added to the data set profile but
            the volume already exists in the profile.

            System Action:  RACF terminates processing for the ADDVOL
            or ALTVOL operand.

  ICH22010I VOLUME SPECIFIED DOES NOT EXIST IN DATA SET PROFILE

            Explanation:  DELVOL or ALTVOL was specified which
            requests a volume to be deleted from the data set profile
            but the volume does not exist in the profile.

            System Action:  RACF terminates processing for the DELVOL
            or ALTVOL operand.

  ICH22011I VOLUME SPECIFIED IS LAST VOLUME IN DATA SET PROFILE.
            NO CHANGE MADE

            Explanation:  DELVOL was specified which requested that
            the last volume be deleted from the data set profile.
            This is not a valid request for the ALTDSD command.

            System Action:  Processing for the DELVOL operand is
            terminated.

  ICH22012I NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPECIFY NOSET/ALTVOL

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to
            specify the NOSET or ALTVOL operand.

            System Action:  The NOSET, ADDVOL, ALTVOL, and DELVOL
            operands are ignored.

  ICH22013I ADDVOL/DELVOL NOT PROCESSED

            Explanation:  While adding or deleting a volume, the
            command processor could not establish the required ESTAE
            environment.  Other operands have already been processed.

  ICH22014I NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPECIFY GLOBALAUDIT FOR entity-name;
            OPERAND IGNORED

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to
            specify the GLOBALAUDIT operand for the indicated entity
            name.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the operand for the indicated
            entity name.

  ICH22015I AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE ONLY GLOBALAUDIT FOR entity-name;
            REMAINING OPERANDS IGNORED

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to
            specify any operand except GLOBALAUDIT for the indicated
            entity name.  RACF ignores all other operands for the
            indicated entity name.

  ICH22016I VOLUME SPECIFIED ALREADY EXISTS IN ANOTHER PROFILE FOR
            SAME DATASET NAME

            Explanation:  An ADDVOL or ALTVOL request was specified,
            but the volume serial number to be added to the data set
            profile specified is already defined in another data set
            profile of the same name.

            System Action:  The volume serial number is not added.

  ICH22017I ALTVOL PROCESSING ENDED DUE TO ERROR

            Explanation:  While processing the ALTVOL operand, the
            command processor encountered an error which caused
            processing to be terminated.  Other operands have already
            been processed.

  ICH22018I INSTALLATION EXIT FAILED ALTER REQUEST FOR data-set-name

            Explanation:  The command preprocessing exit routine
            ICHCNX00 issued a return code of 4, indicating that RACF
            should fail the ALTDSD request for the dataset indicated
            in the message.

            System Action:  The command terminates.

            User Response:  Report this message to the system
            programmer.

  ICH22020I GENERIC INVALID, GENERIC COMMAND PROCESSING NOT ACTIVE

            Explanation:  Because the generic command processing
            facility is inactive, the GENERIC operand is invalid.

            System Action:  The command is terminated.

  ICH22021I category ALREADY DEFINED TO profile-name.

            Explanation:  The specified category has already been
            defined in this profile.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the category.  Command
            processing continues with the next option.

  ICH22022I category NOT DEFINED TO profile-name.

            Explanation:  The specified category has not been defined
            in this profile; therefore, deletion is impossible.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the category.  Command
            processing continues with the next option.

  ICH22023I 'NOTIFY IGNORED' SPECIFIED USER IS NOT DEFINED TO RACF

            Explanation:  The userid specified for the NOTIFY operand
            is not a RACF-defined userid.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            option.

  ICH22024I NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE VOLUME volume.

            Explanation:  You do not have allocation authority to the
            volume specified.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH22025I UNABLE TO LOCATE TAPE VOLUME ENTRY FOR TAPE DATA SET

            Explanation:  The tape volume profile for the indicated
            tape data set could not be located.  This error indicates
            a problem with the RACF data base.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            data set.

            User Response:  Contact the RACF security administrator or
            the system programmer.

  ICH22026I TVTOC UPDATE FOR DATA SET dsname BYPASSED.
            UNABLE TO LOCATE ENTRY.

            Explanation:  A TVTOC entry could not be located after a
            discrete profile for a tape data set was found.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            data set.

            User Response:  Contact your systems programmer.

  ICH22027I ALTVOL OPERAND INCONSISTENT WITH TAPE DS PROFILE FOR
            DATA SET dsname.

            Explanation:  A tape data set profile was found when an
            ALTVOL request was entered.  ALTVOL processing for tape
            data sets is not supported by RACF processing.

            System Action:  ALTVOL processing continues with the next
            data set.

  ICH22028I TAPE DATA SET SPECIFIED NOT LAST ON VOLUME -
            ADDVOL/DELVOL IGNORED

            Explanation:  The ADDVOL or DELVOL operand was entered for
            a tape data set that is not the last one on the tape
            volume set.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the operand.  Command
            processing continues with the next data set name.

  ICH22029I TVTOC UPDATE FAILED. ADDVOL/DELVOL BYPASSED FOR DATA SET
            PROFILE dsname

            Explanation:  When ADDVOL or DELVOL operand processing
            attempted to update the tape data set entry in the TVTOC
            of the TAPEVOL profile, a RACF manager error occurred.

            System Action:  RACF does not update the TVTOC.  Command
            processing continues with the next data set name.

  ICH22030I VOLSER LIST INCONSISTENT WITH ADDVOL/DELVOL OPERAND
            TAPE DATA SET dsname

            Explanation:  For ADDVOL, the VOLSER specified in the
            command was found in the tape volume list.  For DELVOL,
            the VOLSER specified in the command was not found in the
            list.

            System Action:  ADDVOL/DELVOL for this data set will be
            bypassed.  Command processing continues with the next data
            set name.

  ICH22031I COMMAND PROCESSING TERMINATED.  NO (SECLEVELS |
            CATEGORIES) FOUND

            Explanation:  RACF could not validate the name you
            specified on the SECLEVEL or ADDCATEGORY keyword. This
            happened for one of two reasons:

            o   There is no SECLEVEL or CATEGORY profile.
            o   A profile is defined, but it doesn't contain any
                members.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.
