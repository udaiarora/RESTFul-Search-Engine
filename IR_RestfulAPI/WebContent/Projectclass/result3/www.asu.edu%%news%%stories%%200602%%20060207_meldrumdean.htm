<h1 class="storyhead">Meldrum to join Fulton School of Engineering as dean</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p><strong><em>ASU selects University of Washington educator to follow Crouch </em></strong></p>
<p>Deirdre Meldrum, who has spent her career forging new scientific links, as well as establishing research centers at the cutting edge of engineering and associated scientific disciplines, has been appointed dean of ASU&rsquo;s Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Meldrum is an electrical engineering professor at the University of Washington (UW), Seattle, and her appointment is part of a major effort by ASU to move the Fulton School to the top level of engineering schools nationally. ASU will provide Meldrum with additional resources to hire new faculty and to invest in start-up labs and research initiatives.</p>
<p><img src="images/meldrum.jpg" width="200" height="281" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">&ldquo;Deirdre Meldrum will be the visionary for the Fulton School, its scientific and technological leader,&rdquo; says ASU President Michael M. Crow. &ldquo;Her work with the Microscale Life Sciences Center, or what researchers call the &lsquo;life-on-a-chip lab,&rsquo; is a prime example of her track record of moving science and scientists to the cutting edge of discovery. Under her direction, we will advance the Fulton School into many new and exciting areas of science and engineering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As principal investigator and co-director of the Microscale Life Sciences Center &ndash; a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center of Excellence in Genomic Science that she helped establish &ndash; Meldrum has played a key role in the development of new tools for an increasingly important area of science, the exploration of the human genome. Meldrum has demonstrated throughout her career a knack for leading investigators onto new paths of discovery by establishing linkages between areas of engineering &ndash; such as electrical, civil and automation engineering &ndash; to other areas of science, such as genomics, nanotechnology, oceanography and ecology. </p>
<p>Meldrum will succeed Peter Crouch, now the leader of the university&rsquo;s global initiatives, who is credited with positioning the Fulton School for this next step in its evolution.</p>
<p>Says Meldrum of her appointment: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking on the challenge as dean of the Fulton School of Engineering because I want to contribute to President Crow&rsquo;s vision of the New American University. ASU is a dynamic university that is growing rapidly in a variety of ways, including quality, expertise, innovation and size.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Crouch built a solid foundation for the school. I want to help take the school to the next level by increasing research productivity, especially in interdisciplinary efforts that include integrating engineering with the ASU School of Earth and Space Exploration, the Global Institute of Sustainability and the Biodesign Institute, as well as business, design and the arts. With innovations in education, we will produce creative students who can work across disciplines, and effectively contribute to society and compete in the global economy.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In addition to being dean of engineering, Meldrum will hold an academic chair and will direct a new center within the Biodesign Institute. She will continue her many research endeavors, and ASU will appoint an executive dean to aid her in running the school on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that Dr. Meldrum is an extraordinary choice to lead the school through its next stage, building on a foundation of teaching and research excellence established by Dean Crouch,&rdquo; says ASU Provost Milton Glick. &ldquo;Dr. Meldrum&rsquo;s demonstrated ability to bring together multiple disciplines to work on &lsquo;grand challenge&rsquo; type problems, and her dedication to including students in research programs are among the reasons we are so excited about her joining ASU.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After meeting Deirdre Meldrum, I told President Crow that I had seen the perfect role model for the type of transdisciplinary engineers needed by a New American University,&rdquo; says Jonathan Fink, ASU&rsquo;s vice president for research and economic affairs, and head of the engineering dean search committee. &ldquo;Deirdre&rsquo;s leadership will greatly accelerate the integration of engineering into the major biotechnology, nanotechnology and information technology initiatives that form the core of the research agenda for ASU and the state of Arizona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meldrum has been at UW since 1992, rising to full professor in electrical engineering in 2001. She also holds adjunct appointments in UW departments of bioengineering and mechanical engineering. In 1996, she was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers &ldquo;for recognition of innovative research using a broad set of interdisciplinary approaches to advance DNA sequencing technology.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In 2001, Meldrum was awarded a $15 million grant for a NIH Center of Excellence in Genomics Science, which led to the establishment of the <a name="OLE_LINK1">Microscale Life Sciences Center</a>. The center was one of the first three national centers (UW has a second one and Yale the third). There are nine such centers nationally. Meldrum plans to bring part of her center to ASU. </p>
<p>At UW, the Microscale Life Sciences Center brings together 10 investigators from departments such as electrical engineering, chemical engineering, chemistry, materials science and engineering, laboratory medicine, microbiology and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to work on developing microscale devices. These devices measure multiple parameters in living cells to correlate cellular events with genomic information, like gene expression and genomic rearrangements. The goal is to understand cell proliferation and cell death as it relates to health problems such as cancer, heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p>Before securing the Center of Excellence in Genomics Science, Meldrum received NIH grants to pursue research in automating the processes involved in large-scale DNA sequencing. Her work initially focused on automating the fluid handling and sample preparation steps of genomic processes. She then worked on a series of projects to develop automated macro- and microscale instruments with sensors for measurements in biological applications. </p>
<p>UW&rsquo;s Genomation Laboratory, for which Meldrum is founder and director, was formed for her work in this area. </p>
<p>Meldrum is a core team member of the NEPTUNE project led by John Delany at UW. NEPTUNE is a cabled underwater observatory that will be built on the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate in the northeast Pacific Ocean for real-time observations and experiments with sensors. Meldrum is developing tools and sensors to measure biological, chemical and physical parameters at the sea floor to discover new microbes, and to learn how they respond to changes in their environment.</p>
<p>The NEPTUNE project is the regional part of the Ocean Research Interactive Observatory Networks (ORION) Ocean Observatories Initiative, which is awaiting a $268 million appropriation from Congress to the National Science Foundation for funding. UW is competing to be implementing organization for the NEPTUNE project, an international project with Canada.</p>
<p>ASU plans to become a partner in the NEPTUNE project with Meldrum as liaison. </p>
<p>Meldrum is a member of the National Advisory Council for Human Genome Research, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. She is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. </p>
<p>Meldrum received a doctorate in electrical engineering from Stanford University (1993); a master&rsquo;s degree in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1985); and a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in civil engineering from the University of Washington (1983). Meldrum is married and has two children. Her husband, Peter Wiktor, has a doctorate in mechanical engineering and owns his own business.</p>
<p>Meldrum will begin her tenure as dean of the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering in January 2007.</p>
