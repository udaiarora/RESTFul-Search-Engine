      <h2>Graduate College to sharpen focus on diversity </h2>
      <p>Several years ago ASU stepped up its efforts to attract, retain and increase graduation rates among minority students. These efforts paid off. Last fall, ASU reported minority enrollment reached an all-time high of 22 percent of the total student body, up from 16 percent in 1992 - 93. </p>
      <p>At the graduate level, similar increases in enrollments have occurred. Since 1993 domestic minority enrollments have increased from 11.6 percent to 16.5 percent. While this is good news, Maria T. Allison, newly appointed vice provost and dean of graduate studies says, "We need to sharpen our focus and enhance our recruitment efforts to encourage under-represented students to pursue graduate studies at ASU, and we need to provide solid reasons why these students should continue their education here." </p>
      <p>Allison, along with several other colleagues, discussed graduate education issues at a recent diversity in education summit hosted by the University of Texas, Austin. </p>
      <p>Diversity in graduate education was one of many topics discussed during the two-day summit in January, attended by administrators from six other public universities. </p>
      <p>Allison knows that ASU is not alone in wanting to increase minority enrollment in graduate programs. "It's important for all universities to increase the pool of qualified candidates to the benefit of the nation's universities and the communities where people work and live," says Allison. "To do this, we need to convince those finishing their undergraduate degrees that pursuing a masters and then possibly a Ph.D. is a good investment in their future." </p>
      <p>Allison and her staff are developing a five-year plan to lay out a strategy to continue to increase minority enrollment in graduate programs for President Crow's review in March. </p>
      <p>"When considering programs at the graduate level, we are looking at all angles of diversity from increasing the number of men in the nursing program to increasing the number of women in the engineering program, as well as low-income or under-represented populations," says Allison. </p>
      <p>In addition to the five-year plan being developed, the University of Mexico, with a grant from the Ford Foundation, is partnering with faculty from ASU, NAU and New Mexico State University to develop an enhanced multicultural curriculum in the region, which may help attract students to pursue graduate studies. </p>
      <p>"While some may think it's limiting to receive two degrees from the same institution, the alternative is that students won't get a graduate degree at all," says Allison. "We need to explore every opportunity to invest in the people and communities of Arizona and the region." </p>
