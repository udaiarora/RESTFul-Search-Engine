	<br>

	  <p ALIGN="left"><u><b>Membership  </b></u></p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left">Council is composed of all the catalog librarians, and several senior cataloging staff members, who serve at the discretion of the Council.  The Head of Technical Services is an ex officio member of the Council. The Head will attend Council meetings dependent upon his or her own schedule and priorities and is exempt from serving as convener.</p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left"><u><b>Meetings  </b></u></p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left">Council meets once a week in a regularly scheduled session. Attendance at Council meetings takes precedence over other matters for all members.</p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left"><u><b>Agenda  </b></u></p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left">Any member of Council may place an item on the agenda. Generally, the originator leads the discussion. Any cataloging staff member may request, through a Council member, that an item be discussed or considered by Council.  </p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left">The agenda always includes the item Other. This is included to give each member an opportunity to make brief announcements, propose topics for further discussion, etc. Other is normally first on the agenda. Any discussion topic or report that will take more than five minutes should be included on the agenda as a separate item.  </p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left"><b><u>Confidentiality</u></b>&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
        Members are expected to exercise discretion in sharing Council business or deliberations. Materials or comments presented off the record are confidential. </p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left"><b><u>Guests</u></b><br>
          <br>
        Council may invite guests to take part if the guests' particular areas of expertise or concern are under discussion. Any cataloging staff member may ask to attend a meeting in order to contribute to discussion of a particular agenda item. </p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left"><u><b>Convener  </b></u></p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left">The position of Convener is taken by each member in rotation. The Convener is responsible for:</p>      <ol>
        <li>
          <p ALIGN="left">Finding a substitute if the scheduled convener knows that he or she will be absent.</p> 
        </li>
        <li>
          <p ALIGN="left">Assembling and distributing the agenda for the meeting. The agenda is distributed to all cataloging staff, preferably on the afternoon preceding the meeting.</p> 
        </li>
        <li>
          <p ALIGN="left">Conducting the meeting.</p> 
        </li>
        <li>
          <p ALIGN="left">Appointing someone to take minutes if the Secretary is absent.</p> 
        </li>
        <li>
          <p ALIGN="left">Reviewing the minutes before distribution.</p> 
        </li>
      </ol>      <p ALIGN="left"><u><b>Secretary  </b></u></p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left">The Secretary takes the minutes of each meeting, edits them, has them reviewed by the convener, or by another Council member if the convener is not available, distributes them, and files the original paper copy in the binder located in the Resource Library. The minutes are distributed via email to all Technical Services staff, the Associate Dean, and such other persons as Council may approve.</p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="center"><b>CATALOG COUNCIL FUNCTIONS</b></p>
       <p ALIGN="left"><u><strong>Cataloging Issues and Policy</strong></u></p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left">Catalog Council serves as the chief forum for the introduction and discussion of cataloging issues; acts as the established working body for the formation, adoption, revision and implementation of cataloging policy for the Libraries; plans, designs and directs procedures and activities to accomplish cataloging tasks and projects in support of the Libraries.  </p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left"><u><b>Care and Enhancement of the Main Catalog  </b></u></p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left">Believing that the main catalog is and will remain indispensable to the Mission of the Libraries, Catalog Council uses its reservoir of knowledge of bibliographic structure and catalog content to respond to organizational needs related to the catalog; actively seeks opportunities to advise and instruct on the bibliographical and structural manifestations of the library automated system. </p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left"><u><b>Profession and the Discipline of Cataloging  </b></u></p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left">Catalog Council contributes to the profession and to the discipline of cataloging in local, national and international arenas. Council forms and expresses opinions on issues within its purview through involvement in the Library of Congress' Program for Cooperative Cataloging (BIBCO, NACO, SACO), OCLC and RLIN, and cataloging opportunities beyond this institution.  </p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left"><u><b>Governance  </b></u></p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left">Catalog Council takes a leading role in short- and long-range planning and goal setting for the cataloging program; develops and implements policies and procedures for cataloging operations including writing or reviewing policy and procedure documents; serves as an advisory body to the Head of Technical Services on matters involving the effectiveness of the cataloging program or the well-being of cataloging staff members; contributes collective opinion or expertise to Library planning or operations issues.</p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left"><u><b>Communication  </b></u></p> 
	  <br>    
	  <p ALIGN="left">Catalog Council serves as a forum for information exchange among the cataloging staff and between that staff and other groups. Catalog Council primarily shares information concerning cataloging policy and professional development and service; it may, however, share information about any relevant item brought to its attention. Catalog Council minutes are the official written means by which Council communicates with others.  </p>
