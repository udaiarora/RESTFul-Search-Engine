    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">Optimization Subroutine Library
    (OSL)</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Optimization Subroutine Library
    (OSL) from IBM is a collection of high-performance mathematical
    subroutines for use by application programs that solve optimization
    problems. OSL takes advantage of machine architectural features.
    (Note: IBM's Vector Facility is not available at ASU; hence,
    only the scalar OSL library is usable.) The OSL subroutines can
    be called easily from programs written in FORTRAN at different
    levels: high-level subroutines can solve a problem without your
    having detailed knowledge of mathematical programming. Low-level
    routines give you the flexibility to structure algorithms without
    having to write programs from scratch.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mathematical programming techniques
    can be applied to problems where you want to minimize or maximize
    a function subject to a set of constraints. A solution is said
    to be &quot;feasible&quot; if it satisfies the constraints. A
    solution is said to be &quot;optimal&quot; if it yields the smallest
    or largest value of the objective function among all feasible
    solutions. OSL allows you to find optimal solutions to several
    types of problems using the following techniques:</FONT></P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H4><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Linear Programming</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Two linear programming methods
      are offered by OSL: a simplex method, which includes a primal
      and a dual algorithm, and an interior-point barrier method.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The simplex method is the most
      common one for solving linear programming problems. A simplex
      algorithm searches for the optimal solution among the vertices
      of the feasible polyhedron, as opposed to an interior-point method,
      which searches for solutions by starting in the interior and
      working toward the boundary of the feasible polyhedron.</FONT></P>
      <H4><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mixed-Integer Programming</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mixed-integer programming problems
      are linear programming problems where some of the variables are
      constrained to be integers. For example, a mixed-integer programming
      problem may be concerned with the number of seats on an airplane
      or airplanes on a route. Decision variables, such as whether
      to produce a particular product, are often modeled by 0-1 integer
      variables. Mixed-integer programming problems are solved as a
      series of linear programming problems.</FONT></P>
      <H4><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Quadratic Programming</FONT></H4>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Quadratic programming problems
      solved by OSL have a convex quadratic objective function and
      linear constraints. There is also a subroutine for solving parametric
      quadratic problems.</FONT></P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">To access OSL from a FORTRAN
    program you need to include a call to the OSL library SYS2.EKKLIB
    in your JCL.</FONT></P>

    <PRE>
    //    JOB
    //    EXEC FORV2CG,LIBB='SYS2.EKKLIB'
    //FORT.SYSIN DD *
         .........
         FORTRAN program with calls to OSL.
         .........
   /*
   //</PRE>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">** NOTE **</FONT></P>

    <UL>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If your program calls any OSL
      routines that require a unit number, you should supply a FTnnF001
      for that unit number. If the unit number is to be connected to
      an existing file (for example, an MPS input file to be read in
      using the subroutine EKKMPS), the following JCL, preceeding your
      FORTRAN program is recommended. <blockquote><CODE>//GO.FTnnF001
      DD DSN=filename,UNIT=SHR </CODE></blockquote>where &quot;nn&quot;
      is the value of the unit parameter passed to OSL.</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Some OSL subroutines need an
      allocated file space for storage during the execution of the
      program. You can use similar JCL statements as above to allocate
      sufficiently large space for the subroutines. It is recomended
      that for your programming purposes you use units &quot;nn&quot;
      which are not in conflict with the units used by any of the OSL
      subroutines, such as (by now known : 12 and 18). Try using high
      numbers as shown in the examples in the OSL manuals. The sample
      FORTRAN programs and include files are in SYS2.EKKDRVF and SYS2.EKKINCF
      partitioned data sets.</FONT>
