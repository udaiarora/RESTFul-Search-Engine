      <h2>Latino leaders - HBLI seminar offers state school boards tools, encouragement</h2>
      <p> ASU's Hispanic Border Leadership Institute (HBLI) is engaging in creative 
        endeavors designed to educate and encourage school boards to stimulate 
        academic success by Latino students.</p>
      <p>The institute's seminar, "School Boards: Superintendent Leadership, Governance 
        and Teamwork," supported in part by the Ford Foundation, focuses on the 
        importance of the relationship between school boards and superintendents 
        as the most critical factor in determining how well a school system operates. 
      </p>
      <p>In addition to Arizona, HBLI will present this seminar to K-12 school 
        boards in Texas, New Mexico, California and Colorado in the next few months. 
        Leonard Valverde says this project is aimed at building and maintaining 
        a strong collaborative leadership by local school boards and school superintendents 
        in order to attain high student achievement.</p>
      <p>"HBLI, and in particular this activity of leadership development of Latino 
        local policy makers, is targeted on school improvement across the state 
        and the Southwest, and pursuing it in ways not done or stressed by units 
        within the College of Education," says Valverde, HBLI executive director.</p>
      <p>At Arizona's three-day seminar, held December 2002, school board members 
        from Tempe, Stanfield, Patagonia, Picacho, Eloy, Douglas and Globe participated 
        in roundtable discussions. State education leaders led discussions on 
        matters that included the fundamentals of board members; public finance 
        of schools; establishing local and state relations; and language programs 
        for limited English speakers.<br>
        Cynthia Matus-Morriss, president of the Arizona School Boards Association, 
        says establishing good communication among school board members is half 
        the battle in achieving academic success.</p>
      <p>"I would encourage school districts to engage in frequent and effective 
        'conversations' with the parents about the importance of a K-16 or even 
        K-20 education," says Matus-Morris, who is also a school board member 
        in Patagonia Elementary School District No. 3. "I say 'conversations' 
        rather than 'communications' because one is interactive and the other 
        might be a written note, brochures or memorandum. I believe Latino parents 
        want their students to succeed but need to feel comfortable and welcome 
        in the school."</p>
      <p>HBLI, established in 1996 by four U.S. Southwestern institutions of higher 
        education, promotes the improvement of the education of Hispanics in the 
        United States. The HBLI consortium comprises ASU, California State University 
        at Bakersfield, Maricopa Community Colleges, New Mexico State University, 
        Southwest Texas State University, University of California-Riverside, 
        University of Texas-Brownsville and University of Texas-Pan American. 
      </p>
      <p>Valverde says HBLI was born from the realization that while Hispanics 
        have made some progress in achieving access and success in education, 
        their status is not much improved over what it was in the past. Thus, 
        the institute seeks to address issues that affect the education of Hispanics 
        at all levels, particularly in settings located on the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
      <p>Matus-Morris says this seminar is one example of how HBLI is aiming to 
        achieve its overall goal of improving education for Hispanics and all 
        other students.</p>
      <p>"The leadership skills fellow Hispanic board members and I received over 
        the three-day seminar will significantly impact the decisions being made 
        at the school board table," she said. "Board members recognized the importance 
        of their roles and responsibilities; relationships with the superintendent 
        and an understanding of the budget process. With these three key points, 
        educated and objective decisions will positively affect the education 
        of the children in their districts."</p>
      <p>Valverde says HBLI is striving to achieve the qualities set forth by 
        ASU President Michael Crow, in his vision of the new American university.</p>
      <p>"President Crow wants ASU to become a force, by becoming relevant to 
        the lives of all Arizonans," Valverde says. "HBLI strives to improve the 
        lives of Latinos in particular but other under-served populations in general, 
        throughout the five Southwestern states."</p>
