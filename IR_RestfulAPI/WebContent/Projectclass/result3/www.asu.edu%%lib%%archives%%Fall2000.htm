<p><b><i><a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/genealogy.htm">Native American Genealogy</a></b></i>, by Joyce Martin, Labriola Center, 1999.
        <br><span style=text-indent:.5in>Ms. Martin assembled the bibliography in response to a high number of inquiries by individual searching for their Native roots.  The Labriola Center holds video recordings, books, and how-to information on searching for one's ancestors.  It also lists websites, and material held in the National Archives.

<p><b><i><a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/films.htm">Indians of North America: Microfilm Publications in the University Libraries</a></b></i>, by Patricia A. Etter, updated yearly.
        <br><span style=text-indent:.5in>Here are primary source documents on microfilm from the National Archives in addition to the personal papers of a number of individuals.

<p><b>Other Links from Labriola website</b>
        <br><span style=text-indent:.5in>In addition to the above publications, the Labriola Web Site also gives links to other Native American sites such as: <a href="http://anpaserver.ualr.edu/">American Native Press Archives</a>; <a href="http://www.doi.gov/bureau-indian-affairs.html">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a>; 
<a href="http://www.cradleboard.org/">Cradleboard Teaching Project</a>; <a href="http://jaie.asu.edu/">Journal of American Indian Education</a>;

        <br><span style=text-indent:.5in>In addition to the above, there is a direct link to the popular <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/db/amerindx.htm">American Indian Index</a>.



<p><b><i><a name=AMERICAN2>American Indian Oral History Collection: Index </a></i>now available</b>
        <br><span style=text-indent:.5in>The collection contains transcripts of over 800 oral histories by members of the Navajo Nation and members of Pueblo tribes. It was contained in 11 reels of microfilm out of the Center for Southwest Research, University of New Mexico.  (ASU FILM 9642, 11 reels)
        <br><span style=text-indent:.5in>There was no index to the contents.  ASU graduate student, Rob Robertson, read and indexed the entire collection and listed names of interviewees, dates of interview, and general topic of discussion, thus allowing access to a valuable resource.  This is not online but a printed guide is available in the Labriola Center. 


<p><b><a name=LABRIOLA>Labriola Center's Indexing Project</a></b>
        <br><span style=text-indent:.5in>In order to find an article in some of the older newspapers, a researcher simply has to read back issues until a pertinent article is found.  There are also a number of smaller but current periodicals that are not indexed in any of the online indexes.  No more!  
        <br><span style=text-indent:.5in>Student aides in the Labriola Center have been indexing a number of newspapers for several years now.  
        <br><span style=text-indent:.5in>For example, a scholarly newspaper, geared for young adults, <b><i>Native Monthly Reader</b></I>, is published eight times a year out of Pauma Valley, California.  Its coverage includes both American and Canadian tribes and covers history, government, science, environment, social studies, and sports.  It has been indexed to the Arizona & Southwestern Index since its inception and is heavily used by ASU students.
        <br><span style=text-indent:.5in>A newer project involves the Hopi weekly <b><i>Qua'Toqti = The Eagle's Cry</b></i>, which was published weekly between 1976 and 1985.  Students are about 1/3 of the way through this valuable publication, where researchers will be able to access some rare information.
        <br><span style=text-indent:.5in>Major articles are being  indexed from early issues of <b><i>Akwesnasne Notes (Roosevelt Town, New York), Tribal Tribune (Nespelem, Washington)</b></i>, and <b><i>Winnebago Indian News (Nebraska), First Nations Messenger (Canada)</b></i>, and others. We are not aware of any other institution that is providing this service.

<TD><b>An Answer to a Common Student Question: "How do I find journal and newspaper articles on my topic?"</b>
<p>The Labriola Center has partially answered this question above, by noting some newspapers that are indexed in the online Arizona & Southwest Index.  <p>(By the way, we must note here, that the name given to the index is a misnomer since it covers material of both national and international subjects.)  <p>In addition to newspapers, a variety of older journal articles not indexed anywhere else, may appear. <p><b>Sources for newspaper and journal articles include:</b> </td>
