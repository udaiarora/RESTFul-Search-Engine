      <h2>Outreach efforts pay off for students, employees</h2>
      <p>        Many graduating high school seniors would like to attend college, but
          for various reasons many of them don't take the necessary steps to
          enroll or don't know what they need to do in order to begin their college
        career. </p>
      <p>ASU's Undergraduate Admissions Office is making an effort to
            change that by providing prospective students the experience and
        encouragement to
          make their dream of attending college a reality.</p>
      <p>Ken Hollin, assistant
          director of student recruitment in Undergraduate Admissions, says it's
          important for students and their parents to start
          preparing for college early.</p>
      <p>"One of the most challenging things is to
          get students motivated for higher education at an early age," says
        Hollin, who has been working
          with ASU's student recruitment efforts for more than 20 years. "Students
          can't wait until the last two years of their high school careers to
        start preparing for higher education. They need to build a strong, solid
        foundation
          way before they reach their senior year."</p>
      <p>The Undergraduate Admissions
          Office offers many programs designed to give prospective students an
          opportunity to learn more about higher education.
          These programs cover the necessary steps for attending ASU, including:
          application forms, transcripts and test scores, financial aid and scholarships,
          housing, immunization, registration, dining, parking and tuition payment.</p>
      <p>In
          addition, one-on-one counseling also provides the opportunity to address
          concerns that students may have, including financial assistance.</p>
      <p>"Our
          office has always worked with students who need financial assistance,"
          says Stacey Kostell, associate director of undergraduate admissions.
          "Our staff is in the high schools regularly, so we have been able to
          prepare and educate the high school counselors that we work with, about
          the recent tuition increase and how a large portion of the increase
        will go toward assisting students with financial need."</p>
      <p>Kostell says outreach
          programs are a strategic approach to the office's recruitment efforts,
          which have proven to be a success. In fact, during
          the 2001 - 02 academic year, early outreach programs brought 1,344
        eighth grade students from across the state to ASU to participate in
        team building,
          tour the campus and learn how to prepare for college. Of the students
          participating, 853 were Hispanic; 66, Black; 62, Caucasian; 59, Native
          American; 8, Asian; and 296, unknown.</p>
      <p>As a follow-up to early outreach
          programs, 36 high schools in the metropolitan Phoenix area are invited
          to participate in FOCUS programs, which offer
          students the opportunity to experience campus by listening to student
          panels, participating in financial aid and scholarship workshops, touring
          campus and sitting in on classes. During the 2001 - 02 academic year,
          FOCUS programs brought 1,811 students to campus - 715 were Hispanic;
          346, Caucasian; 220, Black; 87, Asian; 57, Native American; and 386,
          unknown.</p>
      <p>Amy Castro, a student recruitment/retention specialist for the
          Undergraduate Admissions Office at ASU, says the main objective for
        prospective students
          who visit the Undergraduate Admissions Office is to discover whether
          ASU meets their needs.</p>
      <p>"The transition from high school to college can
          be a challenging time for everyone, especially first-generation college
          students," she says.
          "We are fortunate that our recruiters have excellent relationships
        with high schools and counselors throughout the state. It's a great feeling
          to know you've helped someone achieve their dream of pursuing higher
          education."</p>
      <p>The Undergraduate Admissions Office also recruits National
          Hispanic Scholars. Each year recruiters contact these students and
        encourage them to apply
          to ASU and visit campus. National Hispanic Scholars receive a full
        tuition waiver plus a $1,000 cash award, renewable for three additional
        years.
          For the class of 2003 more than 140 of these top students have applied
          for admission.</p>
      <p>Despite their office's dedication to recruit future ASU
          students, Kostell and Hollin say their success isn't always measured
          in numbers.</p>
      <p>"What I
          find most rewarding is being able to help a student succeed in going
          to college," Kostell says, "whether that be assisting him or her
      through the admission process or helping them receive financial assistance."</p>
      <p>"By far the most rewarding thing is to see smiling faces when students
        get admitted, or get scholarships or get that perfect schedule they were
        looking for," Hollin says. "When they - and their parents - tell you
        'thanks,' that's why most of us are in this business."</p>
