Program Execution and I/O
</center></h2>
<p>
The simplest method of program execution is the "compile,load and go" sequence:
<p><blockquote>
cc source.c<br>
a.out
</blockquote><p>
In this example, the cc commands compiles and loads the programs "source.c"
and automatically generates the executable file "a.out". To execute "a.out",
simply type the word "a.out" at the UNIX prompt. Your program is then
off-and-running.
<p>
There are many methods for getting data into your program.  Data can be keyed-
in at the keyboard, which in UNIX is referred to as the standard input (stdin).
Simply execute your program, then enter your data immediately after it.  Data
items are usually separated by one or more spaces:
<p><blockquote>
a.out<br>
Frank  8.25
</blockquote><p>

Using the UNIX redirection feature, standard input can be redirected from a
file, which you may want to do for lengthy or complicated data.  For example,
if you had prepared your data ahead of time in a file called rawdata, you'd
type:
<p><blockquote>
a.out &lt; rawdata
</blockquote><p>
To avoid problems, make sure your input file contains the data exactly as you
would enter if from the keyboard.

<p>
You can also use redirection to save your output.  The standard output (stdout)
normally goes to the screen; but to save it into a file for later manipulation,
you can redirect it as follows:
<p><blockquote>
a.out &lt; rawdata &gt; outdata
</blockquote><p>
In this example, your program's output would be stored in the file named
outdata.

<p>
The above methods rely on features that are built into UNIX, i.e., redirection.
You can also use the standard C file I/O functions (e.g., fopen, fprintf, etc.)
for handling program input and output as you would on any other system.
However, be aware that UNIX filenames are case-sensitive, meaning that the
following filenames are all different: outdata, Outdata, OUTDATA.  Be sure
to be consistent with upper and lower case when specifying filenames.
