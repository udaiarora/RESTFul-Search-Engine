      <p><strong>Technology and Economic Growth: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>&#8220;Prospects for economic growth now depend importantly on a country's 
          capacity to develop and apply new technologies.&#8221; &#8211;Alan Greenspan.</li>
        <li> Technological innovations have contributed more than any other single 
          factor in America&#8217;s economic history to long-term growth. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong>Investing in Science:</strong> President George W. Bush has 
        requested the largest federal R&amp;D budget in history, <strong>$112 
        billio</strong>n for FY03 alone. </p>
      <p> <strong>&sect; Public-Private Investment Interface:</strong> Major public 
        investment in the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which has seen 
        its budget double in the last 5 years to nearly $27 billion for FY02 alone, 
        has enabled the United States to both create a science and technology 
        base in <strong>biotechnology</strong> and leverage substantial private 
        investment in product and process applications.</p>
      <p> <strong>Commercial Success:</strong> Since the passage of the Bayh-Dole 
        Act, American universities have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Spun off more than <strong>2,200 firms</strong> to commercialize 
          innovations born of research.</li>
        <li> Created <strong>260,000 jobs</strong> in the process. </li>
        <li> Now <strong>contribute $40 billion</strong> annually to the American 
          economy. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> <strong>Regional Economic Growth:</strong> When knowledge is produced, 
        the benefits not only accrue to the producer, they &#8220;spill over&#8221; 
        to the <strong>local economy</strong>.</p>
      <p> <strong>State Policy:</strong> State and local policy makers are key 
        in creating the environments that encourage innovation. Through targeted 
        investment in the building blocks of knowledge infrastructure, <em><strong>states 
        can draw private capital to invest in the building of regional strength 
        in science and innovation and act as catalysts for regional and national 
        economic growth.</strong></em></p>
      <p>In October 2002, United States Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
        argued that we live and work in a global environment &#8220;in which prospects 
        for economic growth now depend importantly on a country's capacity to 
        develop and apply new technologies.&#8221; &#8220;If we are to remain 
        preeminent in transforming knowledge into economic value,&#8221; says 
        Greenspan, &#8220;the U.S. system of higher education must remain the 
        world's leader in generating scientific and technological breakthroughs 
        and in preparing workers to meet the evolving demands for skilled labor.&#8221; 
      </p>
      <p>Technological innovations have contributed more than any other single 
        factor in America&#8217;s economic history to long-term growth. A great 
        many of these technological innovations have grown out of publicly funded 
        research, much of which has been undertaken at America&#8217;s universities. 
        In the last twenty years, legislative and fiscal conditions in the United 
        States have enhanced the ability of universities to interface directly 
        with the market, thus increasing substantially the opportunities for private 
        capital to benefit from public investments in scientific research. Private 
        companies, both established industrial giants and emerging entrepreneurial 
        ventures, have built on America&#8217;s foundation of publicly funded 
        scientific research, investing capital and capturing the innovations that 
        drive our economy forward. These investments have created multiple new 
        industries, thousands of firms, and hundreds of thousands of new jobs. 
      </p>
      <p>Technological innovations drive much of our economic growth at the national 
        level, but it is local economic environments that enable this growth to 
        occur. State and local policy makers are key in creating the environments 
        that encourage innovation. Through targeted investment in the building 
        blocks of knowledge infrastructure, states can draw private capital to 
        invest in the building of regional strength in science and innovation 
        and act as catalysts for regional and national economic growth. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Technology as a Driver for Economic Growth: </strong><br>
          Scientific and technological change accounts for over 50 percent of 
          long-term economic growth.</li>
        <li> <strong>The Role of Science: </strong><br>
          Our ability to produce the incredible advances of the 20th century, 
          the transistor, the laser, the microchip, for example, is dependent 
          on our understanding of the basic sciences of the material world, and 
          much of this understanding is based on publicly funded scientific research. 
        </li>
        <li><strong> Leveraging public investment: </strong><br>
          Investments in the research behind and development of technology produce 
          greater returns than almost any other use of capital. Publicly funded 
          science and technology research provides the foundation for private 
          sector achievements that drive economic growth by building the scientific 
          base for advances in industry and by generating commercial success in 
          the form of spinoff companies and technologies.</li>
        <blockquote> Since the passage of Bayh-Dole, American universities have 
          spun-off more than 2,200 firms to commercialize innovations born of 
          research, created 260,000 jobs in the process and now contribute $40 
          billion annually to the American economy. </blockquote>
        <blockquote> Current and past investment by the United States in our knowledge 
          infrastructure enable U.S.-based companies to obtain science and engineering 
          data much faster than in other parts of the global economy. Given ever 
          shorter product life cycles, this timing factor can be critical. </blockquote>
        <blockquote> President George W. Bush has requested the largest federal 
          R&amp;D budget in history, $112 billion for FY03 alone. </blockquote>
        <li> <strong>Science, Technology and Regional Economic Growth:</strong><br>
          Firms, regions and nations that establish an initial advantage and invest 
          in locally embedded knowledge production will enjoy the benefits of 
          technologically driven economic growth.</li>
        <blockquote> When knowledge is produced, the benefits do not only accrue 
          to the producer, they &#8220;spill over&#8221; to the local economy 
          as technical knowledge accumulates in specialized local assets like 
          labor pools and supplier networks. </blockquote>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>States have the power to create local conditions most conducive to 
            new ideas and new inventions, which in turn inspire new companies, 
            industries, jobs and growth.</p>
