      <h2>ASU's Herberger College of Fine Arts among top schools nationwide</h2>
      <p>One of the nation's top visual arts programs is offered
        by the Herberger College of Fine Arts at Arizona State University, says
        U.S.News &amp; World Report.</p>
      <p>In its recently released "America's Best Graduate Schools 2004," U.S.
        News ranks the masters of fine arts program at the Herberger College
        School of Art 13th in the country and eighth among public universities. </p>
      <p>Three of the school's specialty programs are singled out for additional
        recognition. The graduate printmaking program ranks third nationwide,
        the photography program ranks fifth (second among public colleges) and
        ceramics ranks 14th (11th among public colleges). </p>
      <p>"These rankings further distinguish Herberger College as one of the
        nation's leading centers for the study, practice and development of the
        arts," said Dean J. Robert Wills. "This is a reflection of our accomplished
        faculty and outstanding programs in these areas, as well as the college's
        momentum in recent years." </p>
      <p> U.S. News evaluated 213 visual arts programs. All of the Herberger
        programs are administered by the School of Art, one of four academic
        and two research units housed in the Herberger College of Fine Arts.</p>
      <p>Professor Kathryn Maxwell said ASU's printmaking program - which has
        been ranked in the top 10 nationally since 1997 - has produced alumni
        who now guide other high-ranking print programs throughout the country.</p>
      <p> "We offer students one of the most diverse printmaking educations in
        the United States," she said. </p>
      <p>The Herberger College's printmaking program combines extensive facilities
        with unusual study options such as photogravure, collotype and bookmaking,
        as well as the major printmaking forms of intaglio, lithography, silkscreen
        and photo processing. The result is a rare combination of study options
        not available anywhere else in the country.</p>
      <p>The fifth-ranked photography program is closely linked with printmaking,
        particularly in the area of photogravure, a rare archaic 19th-century
        photographic and printing process. The program embraces the latest digital
        processes, utilized by national- and world-renowned faculty who incorporate
        them in coursework as well as their own cutting edge art, explains photography
        professor William Jenkins.</p>
      <p> Randy Schmidt, a professor in the 14th ranked ceramics program, said
        that the recognition validates what he and other ceramic faculty had
        seen building for years.</p>
      <p> "We have been drawing graduate applications and students from some
        of the best ceramic schools in the country since the 1980s," Schmidt
        said. "Schools such as Alfred University in New York send their students
        here and a high percentage of our graduate students also get teaching
        jobs."</p>
      <p> The broad-based ceramics program at the Herberger College draws from
        all over the world for its guest artist schedule and was enhanced by
        the recent opening of the Ceramics Research Center at the ASU Art Museum,
        one of only a handful of research and study facilities of its type in
        the nation.</p>
      <p>Visual arts was the only fine arts area evaluated by U.S. News this
        cycle. Still in effect for Herberger College are the School of Music's
        ranking as 19th nationwide and the Department of Theatre's as 35th, with
        playwriting recognized as 20th. </p>
