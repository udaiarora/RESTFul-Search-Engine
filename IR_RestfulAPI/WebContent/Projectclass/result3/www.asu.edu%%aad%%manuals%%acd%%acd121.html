<img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2">

<p>
All university <a href="acd002.html#employees" target="New">employees</a> are legally obliged to protect the privacy rights of <a href="acd002.html#student" target="New">students</a> and the confidentiality of <a href="acd002.html#EducationalRecords" target="New">educational records</a>, in accordance with federal law and university policy.  This policy summarizes ASU&#146;s complete and definitive policy regarding the privacy rights of students, which appears in the <i>University Student Initiatives Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i><a href="../usi/usi107-01.html" target="NEW">USI 107&#150;01</a>, &#147;Release of Student Information.&#148; Except in the limited circumstances described in USI 107&#150;01, or when authorized by the student, the release of information from student records is prohibited.

<p>
<a href="acd002.html#disclosure" target="New">Disclosure</a> of educational records includes permitting access, release, transfer, or other communication of a student&#146;s educational records or the personally identifiable information contained in them, orally, in writing, by electronic means, or by any other means to any party.  Educational records include any information or data directly related to a student recorded in any medium and maintained by the university or someone acting for the university.  Media containing educational records include but are not limited to:  handwriting, print, tapes, film, microfilm, microfiche, and electronic media such as databases.  Two types of educational records are subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974: <a href="acd002.html#DirectoryInformation" target="New">directory information</a> and personally identifiable information. Educational records do not include those records specifically excluded by the federal law; USI 107&#150;01 provides full information about such records.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Directory Information</b></font>

<p>
Directory information may be released to anyone without the consent of the student, unless the student indicates otherwise.  Students may complete a form at the Office of the Registrar, requesting that this information not be released.  Students who have submitted such forms will subsequently be excluded from the annual <i>ASU Directory.</i>

<p>
Directory information is limited to: a student&#146;s name, local and permanent address, local telephone number, date and place of birth, residency status, academic level, major field of study, college of enrollment, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b></font>

<p>
Personally identifiable information other than directory information may not be released without the student&#146;s consent, except under the limited circumstances described in detail in <a href="../usi/usi107-01.html" target="NEW">USI 107&#150;01</a>.  Personally identifiable information includes all information that would make a student&#146;s identity easily traceable, such as information linked to personal identifiers (e.g., name or student identification number), a list of personal characteristics, or the name of the student&#146;s <a href="acd002.html#parent" target="New">parent</a> or other family member.

<p>
The limited circumstances under which student information may be released without the student&#146;s permission include release to or granting permission of access to:

<p>
<ol>
<li>ASU officials who have a <a href="acd002.html#LegitimateEducationalInterest" target="New">legitimate educational interest</a> in the information</li>

<p>
<li>officials of other schools in which the student seeks admission or intends to enroll</li>

<p>
<li>parents of a dependent student</li>

<p>
<li>appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency

<p>
and</li>

<p>
<li>persons holding a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<table>
<tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>In certain other limited circumstances described fully in USI 107&#150;01, personally identifiable information may also be released to federal and state authorities, accrediting agencies, and organizations conducting research.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Parties to whom personally identifiable information is released are prohibited from disclosing the information to any other party without the prior written consent of the student.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Inspection and Review of Student Records and Information</b></font>

<p>
Students have the right to inspect and review their educational records. Parents of dependent students also have rights of access under the law and may challenge a student&#146;s denial of access by:

<p>
<ol>
<li>presenting the most current copy of Internal Revenue Service Form 1040, showing the student in question as a dependent

<p>
and</li>

<p>
<li>signing an affidavit affirming the student&#146;s dependency.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Persons desiring access to educational records must display some form of photo identification to the custodian of the pertinent record.

<p>
ASU maintains records of each request for and release of personally identifiable information.  The custodian of educational records at ASU is the Registrar&#146;s Office, which also maintains a directory of records listing all education records maintained on students by ASU.

<p>
Students may grant access to parents or other parties by completing a form in the Office of the Registrar.

<p>
Under the federal law, some records, such as Business Office financial records or confidential letters of recommendation, are not subject to inspection and review.  For complete information about such exceptions, see <a href="../usi/usi107-01.html" target="NEW">USI 107&#150;01</a>.

<p>
No educational record may be destroyed if there is an outstanding request to inspect and review it.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Amendment of Educational Records</b></font>

<p>
Students may challenge the content of records, although grades may not be challenged under this policy.  Only the improper recording of a grade may be challenged under this policy.  Challenges must take the form of an initial informal request and subsequent formal appeals, as described in <a href="../usi/usi107-01.html" target="NEW">USI 107&#150;01</a>.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Enforcement of this Policy and Consequences of Noncompliance</b></font>

<p>
Those complaints related to the confidentiality of student records that are not resolved within the university may be filed with the office and review board designated by the secretary of the U.S. Department of Education.  If lack of compliance with the act or related regulations is found, this federal office may withdraw certain federal funding until the university complies with the policy.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Interpretation of this Policy</b></font>

<p>
Anyone desiring further information about this policy should consult the complete policy, <a href="../usi/usi107-01.html" target="NEW">USI 107&#150;01</a>.  Requests for additional information or clarification may also be directed to the Office of the Registrar.
