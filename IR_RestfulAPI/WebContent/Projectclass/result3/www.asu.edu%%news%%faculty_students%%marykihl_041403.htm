      <h2>Planning organization elects associate dean, professor as fellows</h2>
      <p>        Mary Kihl, associate dean for research in the ASU College of Architecture &amp; Environmental
        Design, and Richard Lai, professor in the School of Planning &amp; Landscape
        Architecture, have been elected Fellows of the American Institute of
        Certified Planners (AICP). </p>
      <p>Election to the status of Fellow is one of
          the highest honors that AICP can bestow upon a member. It recognizes
          the achievements of the planner
          as an individual, and his or her contributions to planning and society.</p>
      <p>Kihl
          and Lai are the first educators who have been elected Fellows in Arizona.
          They join just 35 others from colleges and universities in the
          United States who have this distinction.</p>
      <p>AICP is the American Planning
          Association's professional institute, providing leadership nationwide
          in the certification of professional planners,
          ethics, professional development, planning education and the standards
        of planning practice.</p>
      <p>Kihl began her career as a history teacher at
          the University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown. </p>
      <p>"I quickly sensed an opportunity for students who were sensitive to
        the history and culture of a place to work with its residents to plan
        for
          its future," Kihl said. <br>
        To that end, she established and became director of the Appalachian
          Studies Program, an undergraduate planning program.</p>
      <p>Her concern about rural transportation
          and transportation of special populations led to an invitation to join
          the Iowa Department of Transportation
          to assist with a project on transportation for those with disabilities
          and to further a sub-state regional approach to rural public transportation. </p>
      <p>Kihl's next career move was to ASU, where she is director of the Herberger
        Center for Design Excellence.</p>
      <p>"As director, I have numerous opportunities
          to build interdisciplinary teams in a broad range of topics, including
          conservation of the environment,
          affordable housing, cross-border studies, sustainable environments,
        and livable communities," Kihl said.<br>
        Lai, who has taught at ASU since 1973, is program coordinator for the
          Bachelor of Science in Design with a major in Housing and Urban Development
        (BSD-HUD) program. </p>
      <p>BSD-HUD, initiated in 1996, is in the forefront of
          university programs dedicated to education in the design, development
          and production of high-quality
          and affordable housing, a task essential to the welfare and economy
        of the rapidly developing Sunbelt region of the United States.</p>
      <p>He also played
          a leading role in initiating planning studies at ASU, and his work
        led to the creation of the School of Planning and Landscape
        Architecture.</p>
      <p>Lai created the BSD-HUD with the aim of providing "professional-level
          education for home builders and residential land developers, instilling
          in this 'new breed of developers' not only professional skills but
        also professional values closely allied to those of planning."</p>
      <p>Lai is most
          proud, however, of his influence on ASU students who have become planners
          in the state. "I am gratified above all else to have
          significantly shaped the education of planners throughout Arizona,
        notably in the area of my teaching specialization of planning law," he
        said.</p>
