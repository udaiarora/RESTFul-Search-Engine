      <P><STRONG>General Description</STRONG><BR>
Up to two paid intern positions are available at the Arizona Attorney General's
  Office in Phoenix . The Attorney General is elected by a popular vote of the
  people of Arizona and serves as chief legal officer of the State, presiding
  over more than 900 employees, including assistant attorneys general, executive
  and support staff. The Attorney General's Office represents and provides legal
  advice to most State agencies, enforces consumer protection laws and some criminal
  laws, brings and defends lawsuits on behalf of the State and issues formal
  legal opinions as requested by State officers, legislators or county attorneys
  on issues of law. </P>

      <p>The Attorney General has jurisdiction over Arizona 's Consumer Fraud
        Act, white collar crime, organized crime, public corruption, environmental
        laws, civil rights laws and crimes committed in more than one county.
        Additionally, the Attorney General's Office prosecutes cases normally
        handled by county attorneys' offices if there is a conflict. </p>
      Interns will work in the Executive Office of the Attorney General's Office,
      assisting with legislation and other administrative responsibilities. The
      internship runs from January 2 to May 4, 2007 . Normal working hours are
      8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; however, legislative activity and other job duties will
      require some unpredictable and extended hours and attendance at early morning
      or evening meetings. There are no holidays or semester breaks. The internship
      may be negotiated to extend beyond May 4, depending upon the length of
      the legislative session, the needs of the Attorney General's Office and
      availability of funds.
      <P><STRONG>Duties</STRONG><BR>
 Required duties will include attendance at Attorney General's Office meetings
 and legislative committee hearings; assisting the Attorney General's Office
 in preparing, researching and tracking legislation that impacts the criminal
 justice system; acting as a liaison to the Legislature; and communicating with
 Attorney General's Office staff on legislative activity. Interns will be required
 to prepare written materials (fact sheets, legislative summaries and letters)
 and may make oral presentations on legislation. Interns may also lobby legislators
 on select proposals.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Qualifications</STRONG><BR>
 This position requires basic research skills, word processing and internet proficiency,
 and strong communication and organizational skills. Interns will be expected
 to work independently. Preference will be given to applicants with experience
 and demonstrated interest or academic studies in public administration, the
 justice system, the political process, or law. <strong>Both undergraduate and graduate
 students are encouraged to apply.</strong></P>

<P><STRONG>Application Procedure</STRONG><BR>

To apply, complete the &quot;Arizona Legislative and Government Internship Program&quot; application.
Applications <strong>MUST</strong> also be accompanied by a <strong>RESUME,
TWO</strong> letters of recommendation,
and an <strong>ADDITIONAL WRITTEN STATEMENT </strong>identifying the student's current interests
in issues affecting the Arizona criminal justice system. Applicants should include
reasons for and interest in applying for the Attorney General's Office internship. <BR>

<P><STRONG>Common questions asked about the Attorney General Internship</STRONG>

<P><strong>Q: How many interns will be hired?</strong> <br>
A: <strong></strong>Up to two interns will be hired to work with the legislative
team, which consists of the Director of  Government Affairs,
the Government Relations Officer, and the Legislative Assistant. 
<p><strong>Q: Must I be pre-law or a law school student to apply?</strong> <br>
  A: No. <strong></strong>A demonstrated interest in public administration and/or
  the judicial system, through a student's course work, future career plans,
  or volunteer or work experience is preferred. </p>
<p><strong>Q: How will this internship differ from an internship at the Legislature or
  with another agency?</strong> <br>
  A: Interns will be supervised by a former House Minority Staff Director and
  a former Senate Research Analyst. The interns will gain insight into the inner
  workings of the Legislature as well as gain exposure to the lobbying aspect
  of the political process. The Attorney General's Office represents nearly all
  State agencies and Boards; therefore, interns will learn about issues related
  to many different government entities. Interns will experience working with
  legislative research and policy staff, Legislative Council, in-house attorneys,
  state agency liaisons, and lobbyists. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Does the Attorney General's Office track many bills each session?</strong> <br>
  A: Because the Office represents so many different entities, every single bill
    is reviewed as introduced and as it is amended throughout the legislative
    session. In addition to tracking legislation introduced by others, the Office
    also works with legislators to introduce legislation of special interest
    to the Office. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Will interns spend a lot of time at the Legislature?</strong> <br>
  A: Interns will spend a significant amount of time at the Legislature meeting
    with legislators and legislative staff, monitoring hearings and caucuses,
    and gathering legislative materials. </p>
