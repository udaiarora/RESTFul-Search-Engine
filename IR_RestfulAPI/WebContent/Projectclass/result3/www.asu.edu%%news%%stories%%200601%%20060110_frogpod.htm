<h1 class="storyhead">Student-designed product makes a splash </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p><img src="images/011006FrogPod.jpg" width="288" height="401" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Industrial designers spend their careers creating the products that make up our world &ndash; from toothbrushes to toasters, and from eyeglasses to iPods &ndash; striving to produce that elusive &ldquo;next big thing.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Rebecca Finell, however, didn&rsquo;t even wait to graduate from ASU before she was working on the next big thing. Finell, who graduated last spring with her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in industrial design, is the creator of the Frog Pod and founder of Tempe-based Boon Inc. She developed her debut product, the bright green Frog Pod &ndash; a wall-mounted invention used to scoop, rinse, drain and store children&rsquo;s bath toys &ndash; as her junior year studio project. </p>
<p>Today, the Frog Pod is becoming the darling of the juvenile products market &ndash; distributed through the Web site (Target.com), many Toys R Us and Babies R Us stores, and more than 250 upscale boutiques across the country. Boon has projected revenues of $9 million for this year, and $50 million for 2011. </p>
<p>When Finell first began her studies at ASU, it was with the intention of designing medical devices. Motherhood changed all that. </p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was in school, I didn&rsquo;t go home and sketch all night (like other industrial design students,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I went home and changed diapers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In addition to the stresses it put on her studies, being a mom introduced Finell to the $6 billion juvenile products market. Immediately, she was struck by how poorly designed &ndash; and downright ugly &ndash; most of these products are. Right away, she knew it was a market in need of a serious makeover. </p>
<p>Finell used the junior industrial design studio as an opportunity to put her ideas into practice. Students in the studio enter the products they create in one of two student design competitions: one sponsored by the International Housewares Association, the other sponsored by the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association. Associate professor Lauren McDermott, who also serves as designated chair of the industrial design program, has been teaching the junior studio for nine years now. She says the studio course is about &ldquo;form development, combining functional form requirements with aesthetic desires. What do you want the product to say? What do you want it to mean? What should the colors be to have a feel or emotion? At the same time, it has to function, it has to do the job. It has to be a highly functional product, as well.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The studio also introduces students to many of the tensions that exist in the profession. Students learn how to balance individual creativity with the need to work together with others. They also learn how to present their design ideas to other students and faculty, using a variety of methods. </p>
<p>&ldquo;So there are a lot of individual agendas for that class, and doing the competition fulfills most of them,&rdquo; McDermott says, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we do the competition; it&rsquo;s not about the competition, it&rsquo;s about getting the students psyched up to do all these other miscellaneous things, and give them that focus point.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Finell certainly was &ldquo;psyched up.&rdquo; Her entry, the Frog Pod, won the 2004 Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (JPMA) Student Design Competition. Finell received a $2,500 cash prize and a trip to JPMA&rsquo;s annual trade show in Dallas, where the Frog Pod was a huge hit with manufacturers and distributors. </p>
<p>McDermott says she&rsquo;s not at all surprised that the Frog Pod was a winner. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it stood out from the character development of it, that it had a readily identifiable and appealing character,&rdquo; she says, adding: &ldquo;It was sophisticated.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Finell&rsquo;s presentation at JPMA was equally sophisticated, resulting in several offers to license the Frog Pod. </p>
<p>Says McDermott: &ldquo;What I think is probably her most valuable skill &ndash; that she had before I met her, but certainly she fostered while she was here &ndash; is her presentation: her presentation of her ideas, her presentation of herself, her confidence in her abilities, her confidence in her networking.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In 2005, Finell again attended the JPMA show. This time, it was as the design principal of her own company, Boon Inc. The Frog Pod again created a buzz at the event, landing Finell and Boon the 2005 JPMA Innovation Award &ndash; an honor unheard of for a newcomer to the industry. Meanwhile, Finell was finishing up her senior year as one of six students from industrial design chosen to participate in InnovationSpace, a transdisciplinary laboratory based in the industrial design department. </p>
<p>InnovationSpace brings together entrepreneurial-minded students from the industrial design, graphic design, engineering and business programs to explore user-centered product ideas that improve society and the environment. What other students were learning in InnovationSpace, Finell was learning as a small business start-up &ndash; often ahead of her classmates. </p>
<p>According to Finell, the program was a very good fit. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think InnovationSpace would be highly beneficial for people who want to do this,&rdquo; she says, adding: &ldquo;It was perfect.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Finell had plenty of job offers, but the decision to start her own business was straightforward. </p>
<p> &ldquo;I have a whole bunch of products that I want to create, and I want to control the aesthetics of them,&rdquo; she says. </p>
<p>The Frog Pod is just the beginning. Starting April 15, Target stores will feature two Boon products (the Frog Pod, along with another yet-to-be-released bath product) as one of their most desirable in-store &ldquo;end cap&rdquo; displays. And before the end of this year, Target is scheduled to be carrying five Boon products. </p>
<p>All of this, and it hasn&rsquo;t even been a full year since she graduated. What Finell is most looking forward to is being able to share some of her success. The company is donating 10 percent of profits to children&rsquo;s charities, beginning in the Phoenix area. </p>
<p>When asked how she feels about her Frog Pod making such a big splash, Finell replies, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I got here sometimes &ndash; it&rsquo;s surreal. I&rsquo;m a very lucky girl.&rdquo; </p>
