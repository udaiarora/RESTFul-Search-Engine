      <h2 align="left"><strong>ArtVentures in Engineering presents three days </strong><strong>of events exploring music and the brain</strong></h2>
      <p align="left"> A formal dinner and cabaret performance at the Ritz by former Manhattan Transfer singer Laurel Masse, and a workshop with hands-on activities for the whole family are the highlights of the fourth annual ArtVentures in Engineering. </p>
      <p align="justify">ASU's Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts and Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering will present Music and the Brain - three days of events, March 11-13, focusing on how our bodies process and respond to music. This series of community workshops will examine the subject from different perspectives, including those of an engineer, medical doctor, musician, artist and music therapist. </p>
      <p align="justify">Among the questions addressed by this workshop series are how does one interpret sound, how does sound evoke physiological response, how does music help healing, why do we create and enjoy music, and how can music be used as a medium for connecting with children who have autism and other developmental problems?&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="justify">The three days of events also feature keynote speaker Dr. Daniel Schneck, M.D., Ph.D., and musician, from the Virginia Polytechnic University. Other guest speakers include Judith Schneck, musician, educator and graduate of Julliard School of Music; Barbara Crowe, professor of Music Therapy, Herberger College School of Music; Dr. Stephen Helms Tillery, professor, ASU Harrington Department of Bioengineering; and David Wright, Academic Research Professional, ASU Center for Solid State Science. </p>
      <p align="justify">For the first time, this year's ArtVentures in Engineering will include a dinner and cabaret concert featuring New York jazz vocalist and former member of Manhattan Transfer Laurel Masse, together with her pianist Francesca Tanksley. Tickets to the Friday evening fundraiser at the Ritz Carlton Hotel are $150 per person, with funds raised going to support ArtVentures in Engineering, a program of the Herberger College Community Programs Office and ASU's Women in Applied Science and Engineering program. </p>
      <p align="justify">The ArtVentures in Engineering series will conclude with the popular annual lecture and hands-on workshop, 1-5 p.m., March 13. The hands-on aspect will involve approximately 10 different learning stations featuring such items as oscilloscopes, laser beams, a somatron mat (which vibrates so you can feel music when you lie on it), musical instruments including drums, and physiological response monitors such as a polygraph and an EEG (electroencephalogram), which studies the electrical activity in the brain. </p>
      <p align="justify">All events, except the Laurel Masse dinner and concert, are free and open to the public, although some are more technical or specific in nature than others, and targeted to a certain group. RSVP is required for all events. ArtVentures in Engineering: Music and the Brain is supported by the City of Tempe, Ritz Carlton Hotel, Mayo Clinic Center for Humanities in Medicine, Herberger College of Fine Arts and Fulton School's Women in Applied Science and Engineering Program. </p>
