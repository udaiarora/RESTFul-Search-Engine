<h2><a id="main" name="main"><acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym>&nbsp;2002
        Keynote Address</a></h2>

<p class="byline">By Clifford Lynch</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really a pleasure to be here.  I&#8217;m so glad to see this
<acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym>
series of conferences going forward because, as Sherrie indicated, the issues
that are on the table here are really of enormous importance, And they&#8217;re
issues that I feel like we&#8217;re getting a slightly better handle on year
after year, as we move further into a world that is just extensively dependent
on digital information and network-based information systems.  The answers here
aren&#8217;t simple ones, the issues here aren&#8217;t simple ones, but they
are important ones&nbsp;&#8212; and important ones not for just the short term
but the long term&nbsp;&#8212; and I really want to compliment Sherrie and Rob
and their colleagues on their focus and persistence on moving these issues
forward year after year.</p>

<p>I wanted to talk about connections this morning mostly, about ways in which
our understanding of some of the issues around preservation and stewardship of
electronic records are changing, are getting deeper&nbsp;&#8212; places where
we are starting, I think, to engage other spheres of effort that have
historically been relatively disparate and are no longer able to be disparate
from the considerations around managing electronic records.  And I&#8217;ve got
three or four examples of this of which sort of flow from one to the other.  I
think the place I want to start, though, particularly picking up on some of the
other themes that I noticed in the conference program, is with the connection
between records and information security and preservation.</p>

<p>You know, it&#8217;s funny when we talk about preservation of digital
materials. I&#8217;ve been engaged in these discussions probably for more than
a decade now. And I&#8217;ve been engaged in them well beyond the records kind
of context, into the broader questions about how, for example, we preserve an
intellectual record, cultural materials, things like that, that are
increasingly being born in a digital form.  And you get into an interesting
trap when you have these discussions.  People want to pose the sort of
difficult intellectual problems which postulate: Here we are in the
twenty-third century staring at a collection of gifts that have been bequeathed
to us from two hundred years in the past, and how are we to interpret and find
meaning in these?  This is your sort of classic digital preservation dilemma,
and it&#8217;s a very difficult one. But I think if we focus exclusively on
that scenario it&#8217;s very easy to forget something else which, I think, has
been underscored strongly by the discussions about cyber-security and critical
infrastructure and related things in the wake of September&nbsp;11, 2001.  And
that&#8217;s that bits get to the future a day at a time&nbsp;&#8212; one day
at a time.  And if you have got your bits that you want to bequeath to the
future on insecure systems, on systems that are not well managed, that are not
appropriately replicated and backed-up and redundant, and that don&#8217;t
incorporate the right kinds of data integrity and consistency checks for
example, it really doesn&#8217;t make much difference if we talk about that
impossible dilemma in the twenty-third century, because the bits may not get
there at all. Or if they do get there, they may not be the bits that you wanted
to send there. They may be the bits that amuse some random hacker to replace
whatever it was that you were trying to keep alive.</p>

<p>This is a&nbsp;&#8212; this is a really serious problem. The Internet, for
those of you who aren&#8217;t sort of closely connected with it day by day, has
become to some of us, I would almost say, an astonishingly hostile place in the
last five years.  If you&nbsp;&#8212; for those of you who are at university
campuses&nbsp;&#8212; talk to your network managers, they will tell you I
believe, certainly the ones I talk to tell me they&#8217;re spending an
appalling amount of time firefighting daily incursions. The systems at our
university campuses are being continually probed for weaknesses.  They are
continually under attack. And it&#8217;s really a catch-up exercise at this
point trying to plug those holes; it&#8217;s very hard to get out in front of
this whole data security situation that we&#8217;re facing today.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d say two other things about this that are probably worth
underscoring. The first is that if you look at our sort of&nbsp;&#8212; how to
characterize them?&nbsp;&#8212; professionally managed institutional systems,
mostly these are run fairly carefully and&nbsp;&#8212; yes, once in a while,
things do hit the press when somebody fails to protect one of those and
it&#8217;s broken into&nbsp;&#8212; but those are, I would say, relatively
speaking, uncommon. We have a tremendous amount of digital information, some of
it records, some of it just important material for scholarship, however, that
is scattered around systems that are not professionally managed.</p>

<p>In fact, one of the bizarre things that has happened if you think about it
in the last ten years, and it&#8217;s happened sort of gradually again a day at
a time&nbsp;&#8212; you know, in a sufficiently incremental way&nbsp;&#8212;
that I am not sure we fully recognize its import.  We&#8217;ve turned our
faculty members and our graduate students who seek to use the Internet as a way
of disseminating materials that they create, into systems administrators in
their copious spare time. So much of the material they produce is running on
desktop machines, under the desk machines, in the closet machines, sort of
haphazard personal machines that are not being run to a sort of professional
standard of paranoia and defensiveness.  Your average faculty member who is
entranced and engaged by the ability that the Internet provides him or her to
communicate with colleagues around the world is not generally sort of getting
up every morning and rushing over to the latest list of mandatory security
patches for whatever their operating systems is.  Some of them in fact, have
sort of begged, borrowed, or stolen hardware which is just sort of sitting there
and they&#8217;re hoping that it doesn&#8217;t crash because they&#8217;ve got
no place to get money to buy new hardware.  That&#8217;s how precarious it is
and I think that we need to be very aware of that. At the close of my talk, I
going to spend a little time on some developments which I think, are going
forward largely for other reasons but will have, I think, the very beneficial
side effect of starting to redress that balance.</p>

<p>The other thing that I want to say in the area of security and how that
connects into preservation and information management, and why this frames a
requirement for a lot more interaction between the communities concerned with
information management and preservation and those with security, is that we
tend, I think, to take a very narrow view of security.  If you look at a lot of
the stuff that&#8217;s come out in the last year as a result of some of the
conversations that have moved forward from the federal focus on cyber security,
you&#8217;ll see that there is a obsession with denial of service, and
breakins, and loss of control of systems. What they&#8217;re worried about,
typically is about hackers, or aggressors, or intruders, or whatever you want
to call them, breaking into systems, getting control of them, using them as
launching points for attacks on other systems, using them to disrupt physical
things that are controlled by computers, things like oil pipelines, or gas
pipelines, or power grids, or telephone grids, or things like that.  So
it&#8217;s very much sort of an attack&#8211;defense scenario, where often when
you fail it&#8217;s very visible.</p>

<p>They don&#8217;t talk very much&nbsp;&#8212; they don&#8217;t talk enough, I
don&#8217;t think&nbsp;&#8212; about more subtle attacks that involve
information corruption.  [What] if some of our crucial databases&nbsp;&#8212;
particularly those that underpin some of our scientific, and medical, and
technical enterprises&nbsp;&#8212; become corrupted in various ways? Not
necessarily corrupt in the sense that somebody goes and zeros out an entire
database, but rather someone suddenly introduces some misinformation in there.
That&#8217;s, unfortunately, quite likely to go undetected for long periods of
time and to be carried forward into the future.  And that&#8217;s really
dangerous.  We see anecdotal evidence that errors in scholarship, for example,
are picked up and propagated.  People in the library world, particularly those
who do reference and interlibrary loan will tell you wonderful apocryphal
stories of someone who messed up a reference in a paper, which was cheerfully
propagated to dozens of other papers over time, and about the innocent
researchers who wander in periodically trying to get a copy of this cited thing
that is a wrong citation or never existed in the first place.  Those kinds of
things can really propagate out in very troublesome ways.  I think that we
really need to spend time thinking about this broad area of information
integrity, how to audit information integrity, how to detect corruption in
databases, in collections of structured and unstructured information.</p>

<p>This has come up frequently in the last couple of years in discussions, for
example, about the establishment of long-term archives to do things like
preserve scientific and scholarly journals as they move to a digital form.  The
arguments that are made there are that use, large scale public use, is one of
the best&nbsp;&#8212; one of the best measures for detecting corruption.  And
when you look at the scenarios under discussion that say, basically, 
&#8220;We&#8217;re
going to build a dark archive, and other than checking for maintenance
purposes, this material may not be visible for a hundred years to the public
broadly, until copyright expires.&#8221; People start raising the question
&#8220;Well, how do we know the data will be good for a hundred years? How can
we check it a day at a time in an environment of intensive information security
threats?&#8221;  And the tool kit we have for that right now is pretty barren.
We need a lot more thinking in terms of audit and intrusion detection, not for
the classic take-over-a-system problem, but for the broader integrity of data
problem.</p>

<p>And I just want to put a side note on that, that corruption of data is not
always the result of hostile actions; it&#8217;s often the results of mistakes,
hardware behaving strangely, program revisions that weren&#8217;t quite fully
tested.  Human error plays an enormous role in here too, and it aggregates over
time.  If you get people, mostly off-the-record, who have had stewardship over
large databases of anything&nbsp;&#8212; images, sound recordings,
text&nbsp;&#8212; and have been trying to manage these over time, they will
often admit reluctantly, that &#8220;Yea, we&#8217;ve lost half a percent or so
of what&#8217;s in there. You know, things just didn&#8217;t work out or
failsafe backup systems weren&#8217;t quite failsafe&#8230; Every now and
again, we messed up a little bit in doing database migration&#8230;&#8221; And
they really will admit that even&nbsp;&#8212; even in environments that are not
under hostile attack, the perversity of hardware and software and human error
really does take a toll over time.  We need to come up with ways to reduce that
toll as we look at the management of information.  So I think there&#8217;s a
very important conversation that needs to happen there.</p>

<p>Let me move to my second conflux of issues, and I think the way I&#8217;d
frame&nbsp;&#8212; that is to say, that we focused a lot on digital
preservation, and we very sloppily used the term digital archiving now as a
synonym for digital preservation.  I think it&#8217;s worth remembering that
archiving and preservation really aren&#8217;t the same thing. Preservation is
basically about keeping artifacts alive and comprehensible into the future.
Archiving is about a lot more than that.  It&#8217;s about maintaining some
kind of context and provenance around those objects.  It&#8217;s
around&nbsp;&#8212; it&#8217;s about making choices about what objects you
bring forward and what objects you don&#8217;t bring forward.  And it&#8217;s
very easy, in a world where we now speak of digital archiving and digital
archives as synonymous with systems for digital preservation, to forget those
things&nbsp;&#8212; and to think that we&#8217;re doing all the archival
things, just because we&#8217;re engaged in the issues around digital
preservation.  I think that this is a fallacy, and that the sooner we recognize
that this is a fallacy, the better-off we are, and that we do need to kind of
touch base with a lot of those fundamental archival objectives again, and ask
ourselves, &#8220;Are we really doing those in the digital world, or are we
indeed narrowly focused on the sort of, you know, foundational problem of
preservation which we also must address to the exclusion of those other
issues?&#8221;</p>

<p>When we look at these broader issues&nbsp;&#8212; of context, of meaning, of
selection&nbsp;&#8212; I think that it also helps us to see that we need to
think pretty carefully about how much we need to bring forward into the digital
world in order to understand artifacts that we may preserve.  I&#8217;ll give
you two examples here that just kind of drive the point home.  One is trivial
and one is anything but.</p>

<p>We archive e-mail; we&#8217;ve been doing that a lot. In fact, archive
e-mail is very much in the news, it seems to be always in the news, ever since
Ollie North. Now, if you look at what&#8217;s going on in Wall Street, and some
investigations of the big trading firms, they&#8217;re certainly getting a
superb object lesson in archiving e-mail and some of its ramifications.
It&#8217;s hard to really understand a massive organizational archive of
e-mail, particularly as it grows more distant in time from its point of
capture, without having quite a bit of ancillary information. For example,
directories: some organizations assign e-mail addresses that are very directly
correlated to names.  Others don&#8217;t, and if your looking at mail from
<kbd>ak47</kbd> to <kbd>sg92</kbd>, at some organization, twenty years ago, you
may actually have considerable difficulty&nbsp;&#8212; unless people are using
signature files, unless you&#8217;ve got other context&nbsp;&#8212; figuring
out what this is all about without a directory. You need to save directories, I
think, as part of that archival context for e-mail.  Yet, directories are these
sort of dynamic databases. They&#8217;re often maintained as kind of
organizational infrastructure by a very different group than the group that
worries about records and compliance, and they have a very different
characteristic than just arranging for copies of e-mail to fall into an archive
because of their dynamic update nature.  I would suspect, although I&#8217;ve
certainly not done any kind of organized survey, that these organizations that
are busy archiving e-mail because of various regulatory mandates or legal
requirements to do so, aren&#8217;t necessarily maintaining a snapshot of
directories, a trail of directory updates and images to allow us to interpret
that e-mail downstream.  That&#8217;s a simple example.</p>

<p>Let me give you a complicated example. There is a lot of work going on, both
in the corporate world, in the government world, and also in the higher
education world, in a set of technologies that are loosely called <em>public
    key infrastructure.</em>  Basically what this is about is ways to manage
identity and manage the signing of documents, in such a way that it is
non-repudiatable and verifiable who produced or who had possession of and sent
a document, using various systems of digital signatures.  These are going to
become, I suspect, quite deeply ingrained in the business processes of
organizations, both internally and interorganizationally over the next decade.
This is a enormous complicated context that has to be maintained if we&#8217;re
going to fully assess what the records of those organizations mean and when we
can trust them and when we can&#8217;t, ten or twenty or thirty or fifty years
downstream.  I was absolutely delighted to learn a few months ago that Charles
Dollar is actually doing a careful study of some of the issues around records
management implications and 
<acronym title="Public Key Infrastructure">PKI</acronym>.  This is the first
real work I&#8217;m aware of, in this area, and I know he&#8217;s giving a talk
later today which I&#8217;d urge you to check out because I think that this
begins to shed light on one of these contextual areas that is going to be quite
typical of the digital records world in the coming decade, and to give you a
sense of its richness, its complexity, and its importance. And I&#8217;m really
glad to see someone with that kind of intellectual horsepower taking on an area
like that, that has, I think, been overlooked for too long.</p>

<p>Let me move to my third area, and that&#8217;s rethinking what we mean by records,
particularly in the university environment.  We&#8217;ve had, you know, some sort of
classic definitions and understandings of what constitute records.  And we&#8217;ve
built up a certain&nbsp;&#8212; how to describe it?&nbsp;&#8212; theoretical underpinning
that says why
we consider these things to be records and why we don&#8217;t&nbsp;&#8212; why we consider other things not to be records.  I can&#8217;t help but worry when I see some of that,
about whether we haven&#8217;t selected some things as records and said some other
things aren&#8217;t records because we were capable of capturing some and we weren&#8217;t
capable of capturing others.  You always worry about how much of this is
justification for what we can do rather than what we should do.  I think it&#8217;s
very important to recognize that when you look at what&#8217;s happening at
universities right now, there are some big systemic things that are really
changing the nature of what we can capture and what we can preserve.  Note: I
didn&#8217;t say changing the nature of records, but I think they invite us to think
about whether we want to treat these new things as institutional records or how
we want to consider them.</p>

<p>I would say the two most prominent trends there, are first the proliferation
of audio and video capture of all kinds of events, meetings, classes, lectures,
all of this kind of material.  This is becoming relatively commonplace.  It&#8217;s
slowly creeping into some government settings as well, an obvious example being
those wonderful city council meetings you get on public cable television&nbsp;&#8212;
you know, the reruns and things like that, periodically are the town zoning board
or other esoterica.  But we are capturing a lot more of these kinds of events,
and we can ask the question about whether these should be viewed as formal
records of various sorts.</p>

<p>Perhaps, going even more deeply, though, into the core of what we do at
universities, is the emergence of these things that are variously called
<em>learning management systems</em> or <em>course management systems</em> in
the 
<acronym title="United States">US</acronym>, and in the
<acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> they seem to like to call them
<em>virtual learning environments</em> for reasons that I not real clear on,
but I got a big dose of that earlier this week.  These are systems that moved
part of what has historically gone on face to face in the classroom into the
digital medium, and like anything else that happens in the digital medium, that
means that automatically, as a byproduct of doing the activity, we produce a
record, a recording perhaps&nbsp;&#8212; let me be more precise, since record
has a very special meaning in the context we&#8217;re talking here.  So we get
recordings of this, of things that were historically classroom discussions,
quizzes, tests, term papers&nbsp;&#8212; all of these things that we used to
not be able to capture, or at best they resided somewhere in the files of the
occasional professor organized enough to file them and save them.   We could
treat these as institutional records now. We could preserve them. We can
struggle with the various questions and constraints about how we should make
them available.</p>

<p>I could go on for a long time about the various issues involved there
ranging from faculty and student intellectual property rights, to questions
about privacy, to issues of how this affects spontaneity, how it could change
the tenure and promotion process, at least in those institutions that are
serious about considering classroom teaching and classroom conduct as part of
that process.  But I think, you know, having mentioned these, you can kind of
think through some of the ramifications.  The point here is that, there are a
lot more possibilities for what we can capture, what we can preserve, what we
can make available.  And I think that these probably, if we&#8217;re honest,
should lead us to some reconsideration of the scope of institutional records as
we have historically defined them within our institutions of higher
education.</p>

<p>Let me move to the last piece of this puzzle,  the last set of connections,
and talk a little bit about an idea that seems to be gaining a lot of traction
recently, which is that of institutional repositories.  What&#8217;s happened
is that a number of trends, a number of threads of discussion, seem to be
coming together, and I&#8217;ll just give you a few of them.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s been an ongoing set of concerns about the system of scholarly
publishing and its costs and its constraints.  There has been a closely related
set of discussions about the emergence of a broader system of scholarly
communication, which looks beyond the very paper-rooted things that we have
historically considered the center of that system, that recognizes that faculty
[and] students are going to be producing what are in essence digital multimedia
works, which have some rather different characteristics than your traditional
journal article or term paper. And these may very well be disseminated in
different ways.  Another piece of this has been the move to
&#8220;e-prints&#8221; and preprints, to faculty wanting to more rapidly and
more broadly disseminate their work&nbsp;&#8212; outside of the system of
scholarly publishing as it has been established&nbsp;&#8212; through, you know,
personal Web pages listing their papers, things of that nature.  Yet another
piece of it has been this discussion about learning materials, about on-line
courses and things of that nature, and about the desire of some universities, 
<acronym title="Massachussetts Institute of Technology">MIT</acronym> with its
open courseware initiative being perhaps the, you know, the flagship
institution, that&#8217;s made a commitment on this.  They want to basically
make most of their courses available for the public, worldwide, for free.  And
they need places to put these.</p>

<p>All of these things have combined to lead a number of institutions down the
path of starting to think about the construction of systems and organizations
to achieve what they&#8217;re calling institutional repositories. The idea here
is that these are computer systems, plus organizations around them&nbsp;&#8212;
and I really want to stress there&#8217;s more to this than just building a
computer system.  It&#8217;s the same distinction that I&#8217;d make between
somebody pointing to a database system and saying, &#8220;Oh that&#8217;s a
digital library,&#8221;  and talking about the functions that a library&#8217;s
organization does.  And the key thing here is to recognize that institutional
repositories have a dimension as organization, as well as simply as storage
system.  These are places where the intellectual assets of institutions can be
placed, stored, made available, managed, preserved, on behalf of the community
that makes up the institution, that produces those assets and for the good not
just of the institution but of the entire world, where appropriate.  The things
that go in here can be papers, they can be data sets, they can be courses and
courseware, they can be institutional records.  Institutional records,
particularly the public ones, are a very logical and very natural part of the
collection of materials that could go into these kinds of repositories.</p>

<p>And as I indicate, there is quite a bit of energy going on in thinking
through the construction of such systems at some institutions now, and my sense
is that this is sort of a burgeoning movement. You know, we started with a
couple of dozen of early adopters; now, as those roll out their work, more and
more institutions are starting to think about this.  It&#8217;s useful to
recognize that such a system obviously requires the collaboration of
information technology people and people from the library organization.  It
clearly, in my mind, should also require the collaboration of the records
management organizations within these institutions, although it is not clear to
me that they are always a presence at the table in the design of these,
particularly at places where the primary motivation comes out of a tradition of
advancing and altering the patterns of scholarly communication, rather than
thinking more broadly about stewardship and access to the full panoply of the
institution&#8217;s intellectual assets.</p>

<p>There are technical issues, certainly, in building these things, but there
is also, I think, a very large and complex policy dimension and that&#8217;s
one of the reasons why I think it&#8217;s important for the records management
voice&nbsp;&#8212; as well as other perspectives, including those on campus
concerned with intellectual property policy, with privacy, and other
matters&nbsp;&#8212; to all be present in the debate and the construction of
policies, to guide what can go into these repositories, how long it should be
kept, who gets to see it, what uses can to be made of it, whether deposits,
whether deposits are mandatory and if so, what kinds of deposits are mandatory,
as opposed to what are left to the option of the faculty or other units on
campus.</p>

<p>These institutional repositories, assuming they succeed&nbsp;&#8212; and I
believe they will&nbsp;&#8212; are going to do a lot of things for us. Some of
them are squarely on the agenda of the people advancing them. For example, I
think that they will have a very&nbsp;&#8212; a very valuable effect in
legitimizing works of authorship in the digital medium, as, you know, first
rate works of legitimate scholarship.  Right now there is this complex set of
risks that faculty face when they choose to explore the authorship
possibilities and the communications possibilities of the digital medium,
rather than producing traditional print monographs or journal articles.  They
run the risk that that effort, when time comes for tenure and promotion kinds
of things, will be judged in some way questionable or of lesser importance than
the more traditional publishing output.  And one of the reasons for that is
because there is a sense that this material is ephemeral.   When we set up the
system where it can be placed permanently in institutionally managed
repositories, I believe that is going to provide one of the important
underpinnings for addressing some of the legitimacy concerns about that kind of
scholarly authorship.</p>

<p>Another thing that these institutional repositories are going to do for us
is, I think, they will get a lot of the faculty out of the &#8220;playing
system administrator in their copious spare time&#8221; bind.  Instead of
having to house these on personal desktop&nbsp;&#8212; house these materials on
personal desktop machines, they can move them into the institutional repository
where they&#8217;ll be managed professionally and protected in a more
professional way than a faculty member can typically afford to do in his or her
spare time.  I think that will be an important and valuable byproduct that will
help to protect our intellectual assets.</p>

<p>But the other byproduct we may get here is that we may see institution-wide
systems for digital preservation.  That may really help with the records
management dilemma, in the sense that if we can get some institutional
infrastructure to support preservation activities in a systematic way, perhaps
we can return to some of these more archival and records-management oriented
questions in trying to figure out what to place in the repositories, how long
to keep it, how to establish context and provenance around it, who gets to see
it, and those kinds of questions.  So I think that institutional repositories
are an extremely promising development for those of us who are concerned with
preservation and access to records in higher education.</p>

<p>I hope in these comments that I&#8217;ve at least highlighted a few areas
where the world is changing the whole context around electronic records and
their preservation is changing, and I hope if nothing else, I&#8217;ve
highlighted some activities that may be happening in your own institutions,
where you need to get involved, where you need to be part of the conversation,
because this opens opportunities on the one hand, and fundamentally affects the
framework within which you&#8217;re trying to achieve your own objectives on
the other.  With that, I&#8217;m going to stop, and I would welcome a couple of
quick questions or comments.  Questions?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><em>[Question unintelligible]</em></p>

<p>The question was, do I see the 
<acronym title="Open Archival Information System">OAIS</acronym> standard as
the sort of de facto model for institutional repositories?</p>

<p>Let me say a couple things about that, cause I think that&#8217;s actually a
wonderful question.  The 
<acronym title="Open Archival Information System">OAIS</acronym>
model has been a very useful thing. If nothing
else, it has given us a set of common terminologies to have conversations about
a lot of the processes involved in archiving and preserving digital information
and managing that information.  I think that it&#8217;s introduced a couple of very
useful ideas, the ideas&nbsp;&#8212; for example, submission packages and
delivery
packages, which introduced some helpful discipline into thinking about the
problem.  Having said that, every document I look at now starts with 
&#8220;We are following the 
<acronym title="Open Archival Information System">OAIS</acronym>
model,&#8221; and then proceeds to do whatever it wants.  The
<acronym title="Open Archival Information System">OAIS</acronym> model is a
very abstract beast. It&#8217;s mostly a vocabulary. It&#8217;s not a road map
to how to build things. It&#8217;s really not even a system architecture.  And
while it&#8217;s a useful common vocabulary, I don&#8217;t think it excuses us
from the need to really think through system architectures, and to really think
through implementation strategies; it&#8217;s really not a blueprint to those
things.  The other thing that I would say is that I get nervous whenever
anything like that, this early in a field that&#8217;s this complex, gets this
kind universal sort of adoption.  I think it would be very valuable to see some
critical work on it, looking at &#8220;What are the limits of the 
<acronym title="Open Archival Information System">OAIS</acronym> model is a
model?&#8221;  &#8220;What kind of information, if any, doesn&#8217;t it apply
to well?&#8221;  &#8220;Where&#8217;s it a bad fit, where&#8217;s it a good
fit?&#8221;  I don&#8217;t see enough of that kind of conversation happening,
so I guess, maybe in summary, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a very valuable tool for
facilitating communication among people thinking here. It&#8217;s not a full
blueprint for solution, and it&#8217;s something that, I think, probably would
merit from some further critical study.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><em>[Question unintelligible]</em></p>

<p>That&#8217;s an interesting problem. You know, we talked&nbsp;&#8212; I
think I talked a little earlier about&nbsp;&#8212; we keep things sometimes
because we can, and don&#8217;t worry other things because we can&#8217;t keep
them, like what happens in the classroom.  There are some very scary downsides
of being able to capture more and more of this, and I think we do need to be
careful about that. We need to be worried, I think, about mandates to keep some
of this forever.  I mean, one of the things that I sort of can&#8217;t get out
of my head when I think about this is, imagine that all the term papers that
you ever wrote, from like age six on, were preserved somewhere, and imagine
that was true for everybody.  Now of course there would be privacy things
around these, but we all know that that breaks down occasionally, and one can
just imagine, you know, in a era where no part of the private life, or life
history of political candidates, for example, seems to be off limits, where
corporations seem to be going in for ever more elaborate and paranoid, you
know, life history background checks.  Having these sorts of things there is
chilling, frankly.  The notion of, you know, letting people dissect term papers
that represent part of, you know, your attempts at intellectual evolution, at
age fifteen, is not, doesn&#8217;t really leave you feeling good. So I think
there are some issues there we want to think real hard about, we certainly
don&#8217;t want to lose the atmosphere of spontaneity and of free intellectual
engagement and exploration that I think our universities strive for. And
becoming too effective at record keeping there, particularly when we&#8217;re
not doing it with a great emphasis on informed consent and only doing it in
appropriate places, could have a very chilling impact.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;m getting the signal that we&#8217;re about out of time.
Thanks for letting me be with you this morning.</p>
