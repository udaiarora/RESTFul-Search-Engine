Faculty and other academic employees may serve in more than one unit on affiliated faculty appointments. <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Joint Faculty Appointment</b></font><p>A joint faculty appointment is an appointment of a faculty member to more than one academic unit.  A joint appointment recognizes a faculty member&#146;s long-term commitment to, and participation in, two or more academic units or an academic unit and a center or institute. A joint appointment is a formal agreement entered into by the faculty member and the unit/center/institute and may be revised or discontinued only with the concurrence of all parties. <p>Faculty holding joint appointments have full governance, voting rights and responsibilities in each unit/institute/center, including eligibility to chair dissertation committees, if otherwise qualified. Rights and responsibilities may vary with the faculty member&#146;s professorial rank. <p><b>Memorandum of Understanding </b><p> All joint appointments require a <a href="jointappt.html"><i>Joint Appointment Memorandum of Understanding</i></a> signed by the faculty member and the chairs, directors, or heads of the involved units, centers, or institutes.<p>The <i>Joint Appointment Memorandum of Understanding</i> identifies the academic department or school where tenure resides or will reside and the other units involved; the responsibilities of the faculty member in each unit; determination of salary increases; term of appointment; and the process for review and renewal of the joint appointment.  If the faculty member is tenure-eligible, all involved units should provide recommendations in annual, probationary, tenure, and promotion reviews.<p>In joint appointments with centers or institutes, the tenure home must be inan academic department, school, or program.<p><b>Salary Line </b><p>The salary line for a joint appointment may reside solely in one unit or may beshared among units, either permanently or temporarily. <p><b>Term of Appointment </b><p>Joint appointments may be permanent or may be made for a set number of years and may be renewed with the concurrence of all parties.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Affiliated  Faculty Appointment</b></font><p>Affiliated faculty appointments are made to ASU faculty members (including research and clinical faculty and professors of practice) and other academic employees who hold an appointment in one unit (the primary unit) and are invited to serve in a faculty role in another unit, center, program, or institute (the secondary unit). <p>Affiliated faculty may have governance, voting rights, and responsibilities in the affiliated unit, including eligibility to chair dissertation committees, if otherwise qualified. If the affiliated faculty member is tenure-eligible, the secondary unit should provide input for probationary, tenure, and promotion reviews to the unit in which tenure resides.<p><b>Procedures for Appointment </b><p>An affiliated appointment requires an appointment letter signed by the faculty member, the chair(s)/director(s), and dean(s). Appointments will be made following the procedures for selection and appointment as set forth in college, department, or program policies. The appointment letter should clearly articulate the faculty member&#146;s rights and responsibilities within the unit.  Deans of colleges shall send a copy of all appointment letters to the vice provost for academic personnel.  <p><b>Term</b><p>Appointments are made for a set term of one to three years and are renewable.<p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-Reference</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>See also <a href="acd505-02.html">ACD 505&#150;02</a>, &#147;Faculty Membership, Ranks, Titles, Appointment Categories, and Honored Positions.&#148;<p>&#160;<p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
