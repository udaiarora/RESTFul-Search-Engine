Al-Ge-Ni produces an excellent ohmic contact to both n- and p-type GaAs, and eliminates the need for two metallization steps to produce the three transistor contact.  Complete transistor fabrication, which include separate etching steps to the base and the subcollect, can be carried out in approximately four hours.  We have used this rapid turnaround time to enhance wafer yield by minimizing the lag time between the onset of a growth problem or reactor hardware problem and subsequent growth runs.<p><i>IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, Vol. 8, No. 1, February 1995 </i><br><hr><p><a href="../5abstrac.htm#roed">Return to Abstract List</a></body></html>
