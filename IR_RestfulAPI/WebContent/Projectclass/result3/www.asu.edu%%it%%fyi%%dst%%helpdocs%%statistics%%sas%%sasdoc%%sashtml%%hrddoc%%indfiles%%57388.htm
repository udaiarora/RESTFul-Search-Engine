SAS/STAT User's Guide, Version 8
</H1><P>
This documentation provides the latest, detailed reference material for    all of the procedures in SAS/STAT software. It provides an overview of
the statistical areas covered by the software, and most of the remaining   chapters describe the syntax and usage of the various procedures. This
documentation also includes a discussion on using the new Output Delivery  System with the statistical procedures.  New chapters describe procedures
for spatial prediction and partial least squares regression, while many    other chapters have been updated.
