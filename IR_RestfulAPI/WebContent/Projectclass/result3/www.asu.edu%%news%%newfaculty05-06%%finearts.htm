<p><strong> Julie Anand<br>
</strong><em>Assistant Professor, School of Art<br>
</em>Julie Anand received her master of fine arts degree from the University of New Mexico, a graduate program ranked number two by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>. An interdisciplinary thinker, Ms. Anand received a Bachelor of Science degree in ecology and evolutionary biology from the University of Arizona, where she received a National Science Foundation grant for undergraduate research. Having replaced the burden of proof with the celebration of subjectivity, Ms. Anand&rsquo;s mixed-media and photographic art works draw on the ecological principle of interdependency. She questions conventional boundaries, including the one between bodies and their environments. Her work often uses history-rich materials like wood, soil, and water to speak to the unity of all things through the cycles of matter. Lately she has been wondering if an adobe brick might act epistemologically like a photograph.</p>
