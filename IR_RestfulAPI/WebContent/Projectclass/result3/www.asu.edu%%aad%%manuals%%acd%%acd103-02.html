<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Development of a Higher Education System</B></FONT>

<P>
The Arizona Board of Regents is entrusted by the people of the State of Arizona with the responsibility for developing a system of higher education that provides an opportunity for education to all persons, explores and expands the frontiers of knowledge, and serves to improve the quality of life for the people of the state.  In pursuit of these responsibilities, the board endeavors to develop and maintain an excellent educational system marked by sound academic programs, distinguished <A HREF="acd002.html#facultymember" TARGET="New">faculty</A> and <A HREF="acd002.html#academicprofessional" TARGET="New">academic professionals</A>, institutional diversity, fully equipped facilities, and an open and stimulating environment for learning, teaching, research, and service to the public.

<P>
It is the policy of the board to make this system of education available to all qualified persons in Arizona, to provide <A HREF="acd002.html#equalemployment" TARGET="New">equal employment opportunity</A> and due process for its <A HREF="acd002.html#employees" TARGET="New">employees</A>, to promote freedom of inquiry, search, and exposition of truth, and to involve the faculty in the formulation of educational policy and the governance of the universities.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Board and the Faculty</B></FONT>

<P>
The board recognizes that Arizona universities have long adhered to an honorable tradition of <A HREF="acd002.html#academicfreedom" TARGET="New">academic freedom</A> in teaching, research, and service and reaffirms that faculty participation and consultation in matters of academic policy is a valuable tradition that must be preserved.  The faculty and academic professionals of the university have a correlative duty to share in the responsibilities and obligations of governance and administration.

<P>
In support of the university&#146;s central function as an institution of higher learning, a major responsibility of the board is to protect and encourage the faculty and academic professionals in their teaching, learning, research, and public service.  The authority to discipline faculty members and academic professionals in appropriate cases derives from the recognition shared by the faculty, the academic professionals, and the board that the purpose of discipline is to preserve conditions hospitable to these pursuits.

<P>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Control and Supervision of the University</B></FONT>

<P>
The board is charged by law to exercise control and supervision of ASU and its property.  Any authority delegated by the board shall always be subject to the ultimate authority of the board.  The board retains the right to periodic review and modification of all aspects of governance of the university, and the right to enact such <A HREF="acd002.html#rule" TARGET="New">rules</A>, regulations, policies, and orders as it deems proper.
