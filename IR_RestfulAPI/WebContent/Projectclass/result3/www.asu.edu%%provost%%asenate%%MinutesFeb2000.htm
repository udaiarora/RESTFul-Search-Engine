<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>3.A. Senate President's Report</b>


(David Burstein).</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We will be going out of our normal


sequence today in order to accommodate a bipartisan meeting with the Intellectual


Property Committee. They must consider the same issues that this body does


regarding the ASU Intellectual Property Management Implementation Policy,


which I will refer to as IP-squared. We both must consider the ruling of


the Arizona Supreme Court which affects this document.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Morton Munk, chair, Intellectual


Property Policy Committee, called the committee to order.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: The Senate must


first untable the amended IP-squared policy (January 31, 2000). Do I hear


motion to untable Senate Motion #4 (1999-2000)? So moved by Senator Mayer


and there are multiple seconds. Now, we can begin to discuss the IP-squared


document. The IP Committee and the Senate will now constitute a "committee


of the whole." We will all be able to ask questions on this document.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">First, I will address the issue of


what happens if we must enforce a subpoena. It will go to the civil court


at that point. Anyone who is going to challenge a subpoena from the IP


Committee needs to have a lawyer present, because at that point even the


issuing of the subpoena may be challenged in the civil court. If that person


decides to not adhere to the subpoena, they also will come under the rules


of the civil court. Mary Stevens has said that the General Counsel's Office


has not actually had to deal with a case in the fourteen years she knows,


in which people were not forthcoming with information requested of them.


Senator Jacob, does that answer your question from our previous meeting?


(Yes.)</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Are there further questions on either


representation by counsel or subpoena power of the committee?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Rose: My understanding at


our last meeting was that we agreed that Mary Stevens would provide something


to us either in writing or by speaking to us. Am I now to understand that


she told you this instead? Are we going to get anything in writing?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: I did invite


Mary to attend. I also know that the University General Counsel Office


does a lot of legal consultation with the other two universities as well


as with our campus issues--but Mary is here now and can address those issues


herself. Mary, I told the Senate you said that there has never been a case


where documents were refused to be produced. And I also told them that


if we come under the new rule, and a subpeona was issued, that it would


then go to a civil court. Can you elaborate from that point?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Rose: Why would the initial


challenge not be in front of the IP hearing officer before it goes to the


court? That way it might be resolved before it causes the courts to become


involved.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mary Stevens: You are right. We don't


expect much activity on this item because in order to obtain a court subpoena,


the IP hearing officer is the one that has the authority to issue the subpoena


and who must get it enforced if it is being violated, or it is not being


complied with. Before you get to that juncture, the university would hire


an attorney. We would not expect a hearing officer to do that on his or


her own. We would hire counsel to go into court to enforce the subpoena.


But again, before that you make a lot of determinations, and as David said,


we have never had the need to get a subpoena enforced. That is not to say


that a subpoena has not been issued, because sometimes people do not want


to testify or are unable to because they are out of the country on sabbatical


or travel. In those cases, we have worked reasonably to obtain the testimony.


In the case of confidential documents, they have been made directly available


for the hearing panel, but not to all the parties in the hearing. You really


must, in the case of subpeona, decide if the witness's testimony or the


documentation is absolutely necessary for the case. We have not so far


had those kinds of issues to confront.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Jacob: Are we already governed


by policies that give boards subpoena powers that could invoke a civil


court action?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mary Stevens: No. We did not have


that language until last November when the court made its ruling. Anyone


who is asked to give testimony at a hearing, or produce a document, is


expected to do so. That has always been sufficient. There is an expectation


that the university will produce documents necessary for a hearing. Because


of the decision by the Arizona Supreme Court in the Kimball case, we must


now add in that language to conform.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Jacob: Must we then give


all our grievance policies this language, and the subpoena power?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mary Stevens: What the Supreme Court


says is that when grievances comes under our policies, we must provide


that person with the right to full representation by counsel, and the right


of subpoena power to the committee that hears the grievance.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Jacob: We have had a closed


system of governing ourselves up until now, and this now opens grievance


hearings up to being decided by state authorities. Do we have any discretion


at all?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mary Stevens: No, we cannot reject


a Supreme Court decision.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: No one in the


university, your faculty leadership, the General Counsel's Office, the


administration, no one here or at UofA likes it, but yes, we have to obey


the law.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Feller: That is a very strong


statement. I would like to know what basis you have to make that statement.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: We, as Senator


Jacob said, tried to have as collegial a setting as possible with hearing


panels. The new policy permits our grievance hearings to become trials


by situation. We are not happy about this. How many of you will be willing


to serve on grievance committees if they become a lawyer versus lawyer


situation?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Feller: I am not debating


that matter. I am against your statements such as "we don't like it and


very few people like it." I am a member of this Senate, and no one has


ever asked me whether I like it or not. Please clarify your statements


to speak for yourself and not the Senate as a whole.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: I thought I made


it clear whom I had spoken with on this issue. Obviously, I had not consulted


you.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Rose: As a counter point,


I have read this document, and I do not share the philosophy of doom that


you have reflected and that you say others share. It basically says that


in a proceeding where something important is at stake, you have to give


the person who is considered a victim a right to have an attorney, which


is also true under the Administrative Procedures Act with any other state


agency deciding these kinds of questions. You can debate whether this is


a good or bad idea. It may have some very good aspects. I have sat on university


procurement grievances before, and it is common to have attorneys in a


university setting. I am sure there are other bodies where this happens.


I do not think that the sky is falling on this issue. We must live with


it. It remains to be seen how may people will demand attorneys and secondly


I would say that giving this right to people who might lose their tenure


or have something else important to lose is not such a terrible idea in


any event. I think there has been a considerable amount of overreaction


to this. Nor do I think, as Senator Jacob suggested, that we have always


had a closed system and that now it is open. People who are unhappy sue


the university, and in some ways this new language may make it more difficult


to sue the university. Court trials mean further trials, and this alone


could curtail the number of suits. You can still sue the university, and


then, we have to hire attorneys to defend the university and this means


it has not been a closed system up until now.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mary Stevens: Just to follow up.


When I first came here, I was surprised to hear that attorneys could only


advise but not participate in grievance hearings. I had come from litigation,


where attorneys have a much greater role than that. In the 14 years that


I have been here since, every single grievance at the university where


the attorneys have come in, we have had to deal with the arguments of the


grievant's counsel. So, it did not surprise me that the Arizona Supreme


Court decided the way it did. The bigger problem that some of us are having


is the faculty grievance committees at the university function, in my opinion,


extremely well, and they are quite effective in conducting their hearings


in a collegial manner where parties can speak directly to one another.


In the ones that I have observed over the years, I have found that process


a good one. Our bigger concern here is that we do not yet know how the


change to allow full counsel will affect the hearing process. The hearings


of the American Aribitration Association, of which I am a member, allow


counsel and their arbitration processes seem to run efficiently and probably


last a shorter amount of time. We do, for your information, retain the


right of the members of the committee to talk directly to the parties.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Grossman: If our current


practices allow for counsel, and the Supreme Court is defining who may


do what, why then do we have to have a policy in the first place? The policy


seems to state the conditions under which we exist anyway. For that reason,


even if it may be rarely used, I would be reluctant to invest one of our


policies with subpoena power--it is a rather contentious type of exercise


anyway--if a subpoena came from someone in questionable standing and they


could still go to court. Why must we have a policy when the Supreme Court


ruling dictates what we will do anyway?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: Although the


revised statute says that there should be right to counsel and subpoena,


it is not spelled out that we actually operate on a three-tiered system--if


the grievant chooses no counsel, the respondent and the committee cannot


have counsel. If the grievant chooses to be advised by counsel, the respondent


and the committee can be advised by counsel. If the grievant chooses full


representation by counsel, the respondent and the committee may have full


representation by counsel, with the latter of the two being supplied either


indirectly by the university or directly by the university. That is not


spelled out in the ABOR policy itself.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Grossman: How about the issue


of subpoena authority?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: We have to state


that because all it says in the statute is the committee chair shall have


subpoena power. We have to spell it out. We have to get that into the record


as to how we will implement that right here on campus.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Jacob: I am not at all concerned


about counsel being present. My concern is that we would have a force wherein


our own grievance procedures could invoke an appeal, and then the sanctions


for refusing that appeal could be sanctions outside our own usual sanction


system within the university rules. In this case, a board within the university


now has the power to send a matter to the civil authorities. Of course,


if it gets to a civil action, there are civil court sanctions involved.


On that one particular point, we are now outside the university with our


sanctions, rather than inside, and cannot control the outcome of those


sanctions.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mary Stevens: You are not wrong on


that. However, the possibility of getting there is complicated. First,


in the policy, you have to have a party refusing to appear or refusing


to produce documents. To the extent the university can control a document,


we are not refusing to produce documents. Then, you have to have the party


decide they absolutely must have that document or that witness. Then the


hearing officer has to decide that it is so important that the hearing


officer wants to enforce it. It is discretionary. The hearing officer does


not have to issue a subpoena. They just have the authority to do this.


If the testimony can be provided in a written document or they can proceed


without a document, then the hearing officer will not proceed with the


enforcement. They will probably not only consult with the hearing panel,


but also our office, because it is so critical of a document or testimony


that it must be enforced. Then it actually goes to court and that means


there are arguments on both sides for production. One attorney will argue


why it should not be produced and the other attorney will argue for the


other side that it should be produced. The court may decide in our favor.


At that point the penalties may set in, but the courts generally do not


assess penalties where there is good faith involved. We would not go into


court and attempt to enforce a subpoena unless we felt we had a good argument.


Getting to the courts is a long involved process and the judge may not


enforce a subpoena in the end. If they do enforce it, there could be a


penalty, such as a fine.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Jacob: You are speaking to


the likelihood and I do not think that is the issue; the issue is the existence


or the nonexistence of a possibility. But then I would ask, what would


be the difference if we were just to say vote down this language? It (the


policy) would simply be imposed on us anyway by state statute or by Supreme


Court decision. Why are we discussing whether or not to vote or not on


that?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mary Stevens: I am discussing the


likelihood because if there is a concern of some change that we are required


to make, then we should have some idea of the likelihood of the event.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: Let me answer


with respect to why we are voting on it, to remind people of the<font color="#0000FF">


</font>history<font color="#0000FF">. </font>We are voting on this policy


because of its history. We were first given the Intellectual Property Management


Implementation Policy for the Senate to approve, as we approve all other


policies dealing with faculty. That was held in abeyance due to an Arizona


Supreme Court ruling that says we must add certain stipulations to the


IP-squared. First of all, we must approve this policy because it is a policy


of the Senate. We do not have much discretion in terms of what we can do


about the Supreme Court ruling because we do not have discretion there.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Are there any questions from the


IP Committee?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Al Poskanzer: I would like to explain


why this policy was brought forth in the first place. The Board of Regents


policy (ABOR 6-908) specifies there shall be an appeal procedure, but intentionally


leaves out the details of how that procedure is to be constituted. Each


of the three universities apply their own procedures. This IP-squared policy


sets forth the appeals procedure that we have to have in place.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: Are there other


questions? Hearing none, Dr. Munk, please call your committee to order.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr. Munk: The vote of the IP Committee


is affirmative.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: I will now entertain


a vote of the Senate. The Amended Intellectual Property Implementation


Policy (January 31, 2000) passed by voice vote, with two abstentions.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We will now return to the normal


order of business. Thanks to all of you for your patience during this debate.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As a further announcement, I mention


an issue that is before the State Senate that could be damaging to our


tenure and promotion policies--Senate Bill SB1512--is a so-called revision


to the whistleblower statute. SB 1512 provides, in the event that a faculty


member becomes a whistleblower, in connection to their tenure or promotion


decision, that person can have that tenure or promotion decision taken


up by a committee of five--two of whom the grievant picks, one the grievant


and the university pick, and two that the university picks. Again, I cannot


act as a lobbyist and tell you what to say to your legislators. However,


I feel that with that kind of a provision in a bill, anyone who is up for


tenure, and is unsure that their tenure is secure, could take it upon themselves


to be declared a whistleblower on some issue, then the whistleblower statute


would be invoked and the party could, at that point, forego the internal


eight-tiered process within the university and have the tenure or promotion


decision made by one outside committee of five. In my opinion, that is


a trojan horse with respect to promotion and tenure.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Rose: I assume that this


bill supercedes the language in the existing law that says university employees


are not subject to the state whistleblowing statute if they develop competent


policies of their own. Because this decision that you dislike so strongly,


also said that university employees were not subject to the state statute


on whistleblowing because the universities have adopted policies.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mary Stevens: We are more concerned


about the whistleblower bill (Senate Bill #1512) than the Kimball case


(A.R.S. 41-1062). With the proposed language, the current whistleblower


statute has an exemption in it for the universities, and the Board of Regents


provided that we must have a policy in place to protect whistleblowers


from retaliation. The whistleblower policy we have now, we have spent a


great deal of time on; and the Senate voted on it. It was just effective


in March of 1999, so we have not had any faculty cases come under it yet;


we have had a couple of staff cases come under it and it seems to be working


very well. Because the sponsors of the bill in the last couple of years


have wanted to take our exemption away from us, we feel it would be unconstitutional,


because the Board of Regents governs the universities, including our personnel


policies and our hearing processes, not the state legislature. We feel


they are trying to get around that by saying, "you still have the exemption,


however, your policy must say this, this, and this and be identical to


the law," which is even more of an infringement than before. Some of the


language says that the hearing officer can make a recommendation that the


tenure decision will be made by this body that has five chosen members,


rather than the normal process within the university. There are several


things we are concerned about in this bill.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: At the Statehood


Picnic today, the legislators that I spoke to said they are only getting


email in favor of this bill. If any of you have concern about this, or


if you wish the bill to pass, I would urge you to contact your legislators.


I would like you to bring that message back to your departments and schools.


In other words, if others are as concerned as we are here, I would like


you voices to be heard.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Ferraro: Is there any indication


of a veto if the bill should pass.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mary Stevens: We have discussed that


option but I do not know. I do know if it passes, there will be discussion


on the need to challenge it. I do not know if any of you are aware of an


employee at the University of Arizona, Carol Bernstein, who for three years


now has tried to get the whistleblower policy amended. She feels that the


university employees do not have enough protection. She regularly writes


to her legislators as well as posts letters for others to use as examples


in contacting their legislators. She is in favor of S.B. #1512.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: My other remarks


will be short today because I will put further remarks on this item and


others, in the next Academic Senate Newsletter.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.B University Provost's Report


(</font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Milton Glick).</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My concern on Senate Bill #1512 is


that many legislators are willing to believe the worst truth about the


universities. To me that is of greater concern than the specific legislation


itself. They seem ready to accept things about the universities that are


negative, without challenging the evidence.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I want to let you know, and some


of you know already, that our partnership with the German Company, SAP,


has ended. With David Burstein's leadership we have been working with the


SAP to help them develop a student information system which they were then


going to market. At the end of the first year of our work together, it


became evident that we would have to either adopt the whole suite of SAP


components for an Enterprise System (including Human Resources and Finance)


or walk away from this partnership. After two months of traumatic discussions,


we have decided to put our student information system on the back burner.


We now have a better sense of what it would take in out of pocket and in


kind resources. That total came to about 31 million dollars, of which,


15 million would be out of pocket cost and the rest was going to come from


reassigning people. That reassignment was an opportunity cost--it meant


that we would not be able to get the web page front ends we need, we were


not able to deal with plus/minus grades, a whole series of other things.


And as we looked at the institutional priorities, we felt that to commit


that much resource to a system, part of which has not yet been built, balanced


against other institutional priorities, we do not think it was the right


thing to do. Therefore, we have terminated our relationship with SAP, not


because they failed, but because we both came to understand the magnitude


of the undertaking. We will continue to track their progress, and over


this past year we have learned much about the needs and priorities in information


technology at the university. My colleague, Dr. Burstein, thinks we are


absolutely wrong on this decision, that we have to make that adjustment


at some time, and now is better than later. He is a Physicist and I am


a Chemist; he is sure that I am wrong and I am not sure I am right (much


laughter here). We will try to harvest from this experience what we have


learned and set a series of institution-wide information technology priorities


that will try to implement over the next couple of years. We will continue


to watch the issue of the Enterprise Resource System. Senator Philippakis,


who probably knows a great deal more about this, could tell you that there


is now a lot of tension between priority for an Enterprise Resource System


and a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system and this debate is


ongoing. I became convinced that you could only justify an investment of


this large magnitude if you thought your current system were going to fail,


or if you were going to use the new system to dramatically enhanced either


the revenues or the effectiveness of the university. And that means doing


so within a culture that we all live in and try to protect. That is where


we are with our decision.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the last Senate meeting, someone


asked me whether the Craig and Barbara Barrett gift would be used to mediate


the problem on graduate waivers. I said no, but that it is a step in that


direction. I also promised to come back with more information. As many


of you may have heard, our success in recruiting better and better classes


has had an impact on our availability of scholarships--a very slow impact.


We are authorized by the Regents to give resident waivers--the $2,000 that


a resident student pays for tuition, or alternatively $2,000 of the $9,000


that a non-resident pays. We are allowed to give 10% of our total student


body resident waivers without having to repay them. Please understand that


those are not free. That means at $2,000 times 4,000, even assuming that


some of those students may not have attended anyway, means in effect we


have lost 8 million dollars in unrealized revenue. That is a real cost


to the institution, and we are not making any headway.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Second, we are allowed to give 10%


of our non-resident students, non-resident waivers, which means again a


loss of 7,000 dollars in foregone revenue. To the extent we give waivers


beyond that point, we have to find a source outside of our general fund


to pay for those tuition waivers.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is the situation for graduate


student waivers. If you assume that we give out resident waivers and allocate


them proportionally to what fraction of our students are graduate and undergraduate


students, then we can calculate the number given to graduate students.


Resident waivers are given either to resident graduate students or as a


part of a non-resident student packages. In the past, we have only used


about 250 of those resident waivers for graduate students. So undergraduates


got a disproportionate share of the resident waivers. In the future, we


will be giving the graduate students their proportional share of resident


waivers.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On non-resident waivers, which some


of you are more concerned about, the proportional allocation of graduate


non-resident waivers is about 220. In the past, we actually gave about


500 to 400 non-resident waivers; in the future we will be giving them the


proportionate share, so in essence, we have increased the number of graduate


resident waivers and decreased the number of graduate non-resident waivers


to bring them into proportion.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Finally, since all graduate assistants


automatically get a non-resident waiver, that is an additional 1,000 non-resident


waivers given. The total number of graduate non-resident waivers has gone


from about 1500 to about 1200 as a consequence of the above. The total


of resident waivers for graduate students has gone from 200 to 550. In


fact, we are giving out more waivers than you see here (in the overhead),


but those are being paid for by some other fund source. I will be happy


to answer questions at this point.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Rice: One indication is that


the non-resident waivers will continue to drop next year as well.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Provost Glick: That is correct. The


non-resident waivers are only used for students that do not have graduate


assistantships. Graduate assistants get a non-resident waiver automatically.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Gooding: Has anyone done


an analysis of what impacts it will have on our ability to recruit non-resident


top graduate students?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Provost Glick: We recognize that


if we do not find additional resources for recruitment, it will have a


negative impact on both the quality and the number. On the other hand,


what has happened is that we have been over-allocating in the past. One


of the major reasons we are pushing so hard to raise our external funding,


both through gifts and through grants, is so we can have a financial profile


more like other universities that do use complete support strategies.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

for nonresident waivers.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Provost Glick: The policy states


10 percent of the population, but the number was capped by the Board. So,


whereas resident waivers can grow with the student population, the nonresident


waivers cannot. It will not surprise you that the Board of Regents is not


as supportive of the importance of nonresident studentS as we are in the


university, but they understand it. We are capped at 25% of student body


being nonresident whereas many states cap at 10%.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

(Jenny Holsman).</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I have good news for you about the


teacher evaluations programs. I assume you all received the email that


I sent to Dr. Burstein in regard to other universities across the nation


and to how they post their teacher evaluation information on a public or


a private site. I have also been working with Jennifer Walker who is the


director of the teacher evaluation program. She tells me that they have


taken all the teacher evaluations over to University Testing Services.


We are hoping to post this information on the web or publish it as soon


as possible. We did about three hundred classes this semester. We are hoping


to do evaluations for about 700 classes next semester.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Pac-10 student body presidents


came together at a conference recently and developed a resolution on diversity


on campus. The main thing we wanted to focus on was that ASU's minority


student enrollments have increased 70 % over the past ten years. We are


very excited about that and the other Pac-10 leaders looked at us as a


pillar. We participated in this resolution because we feel that we want


diversity to remain a high priority, not only for students but faculty


and staff as well. I can provide copies of the resolution to anyone who


requests one.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Student Regent selection is in


the final process now. After a month and a half of application review,


interviews and the selection phases, we have made our selection and forwarded


that name to the Governor. We are almost done. We are also almost done


with our elections also, and we participated in the Statehood Picnic today.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>3.D ASUW Senate Report </b>(Rick


Knopf).</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">ASU West is positioning itself to


be more forceful in the graduate arena. In fact at our January 20 meeting,


we approved Masters of Social Work; Communication Studies, Interdisciplinary


Studies, and Human Justice.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our Senate had a debate in November


on the issue of integration of scholarship, teaching and service. One of


the out falls of that debate is an increased campus consciousness that


there probably is a disconnect between the culture we are trying to define,


the reward structure and promotion and tenure policies. We are also looking


at the issue of diversity, which is also a hallmark of our campus. When


we look at the personnel policies, review text, and materials, we really


do not find diversity cropping up. We have established a Senate task force


to look at the connection or disconnection of the campus culture as manifested


by our hallmarks, and our promotion and tenure review policies. This will


be a year and a half process for us.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Third, on November 18, at the Board


of Regents meeting, ASU West presented a feasibility report looking at


the issue of moving into the lower division undergraduate arena. To make


a long story short, it suggested that the campus stands ready to do so,


if called upon. This raised questions of workload distribution, marketing


and public relations. There would be disproportionate involvement of our


own faculty in a flurry of activities. So, we have also sent this item


to the Senate Personnel Committee (task force) to look at the implications


for faculty for moving into undergraduate education.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

Carol Bernstein give to her support of the revision of the whistleblower


bill?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: That the universities


are unfair to their employees.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President-elect Johnson: The system


is broken.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Mayer: Does she give examples?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: She points to


people that the university has been unfair to, but her issue is what the


proposed revision to the policy will provide (Senate Bill #1512).</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Feller: I am concerned that


we would assume the worst about our faculty and employees. I am very disturbed


by your statement that if the whistleblower statute were applied to the


university, that every faculty member would try to use it to cover up weaknesses


in their own case for tenure. I think this is a complex issue. Whistleblower


cases are difficult ones. It is certainly possible that a whistleblower


statute could be abused but it is also possible the abuses could occur


in the absence of the statute. I am glad to hear the question about what


are Carol Bernstein's arguments. If we are to get involved as a Senate


in this issue, maybe we should invite her to address the Senate.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate President Burstein: First


of all, I said that one case that involves abuse would make the process


become unfair to everybody else. We want to have control over our tenure


and promotion processes internally. Anything that moves that away from


us is bad, in my opinion.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Second, if you wish, we will give


your name to Carol Bernstein so she can communicate with you.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Provost Glick: I think it would be


helpful to look at the state whistleblower policy and this new one under


consideration, so people could draw their own conclusions as to whether


the policy the Senate adopted last year is consistent with the state policy.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate President Burstein: Darby


will send via email to the senators, the URLs of those two documents along


with the URL of Carol Bernstein's web page. What I do know is that she


claimed that we do not give the whistleblower the opportunity to choose


the hearing officer, and we do. Our policy does do that. Carol Bernstein


says basically, if the whistleblowing allegation is found to be true, that


our policy says we just go back to the same routine. That is incorrect.


In our current whistleblower policy the members of any committee can be


substituted, whole committees can be substituted, if need be. What we do


not do is take it away from the tenure decision process. That is the foundation


of our tenure and promotion policies of this university.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The important changes I am aware


of in the bill (SB 1512) is that it does not allow us to choose the hearing


officer, and we now do that under our current policy. In fact, members


of committees can be substituted as well as whole committees can be substituted,


if need be.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Webb: I have not read her


statements, but Carol Bernstein has a long history of being a faculty advocate,


so, I would not wanted to see her painted with such a wide brush. She has


been an advocate for our medical care and numerous other issues over the


years. I am reluctant to suggest that she is trying to do anything other


than advocate for advancing faculty rights, rather than curtailing them.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Burg: Is Carol Bernstein


speaking as an individual faculty member or is she representing the UofA


AAUP chapter?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: She is a representative


of the AAUP Chapter at UofA. She was president of the state chapter in


the past. She speaks for the AAUP chapter, representing 300-400 faculty


in the state. However, the three faculty presidents at the UofA, NAU, and


ASU are in accord on opposing this bill, and we represent 5,000 faculty


in the state.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Solis: Does the Board of


Regents support this bill?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: It is on their


agenda as a bill for the Board of Regents to oppose. They recognize there


is a problem.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Solis: Does this call in


question the veto on this item, since the Board of Regents are appointed


by Governor Hull?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: Once a Regent


is appointed, they are not beholden to the Governor in any way.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Solis: Is there anything


seriously against having Carol Bernstein speak to the Senate?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: We could certainly


invite her to give her view, but the bill will in all likelihood be considered


before our next Senate meeting on March 20, and therefore would be a moot


point. We can certainly invite her up here to give a talk. I will just


forewarn that she has a particular agenda. My agenda is clear; I wish to


protect faculty rights. I wish to protect as much as I can of faculty freedom.


But I do not see faculty freedom as freedom to do anything, nor do I see


my own personal freedom as a citizen to do anything. As a citizen I am


under certain controls and certain laws. As a faculty I should be under


similar certain controls and certain laws. That is the way I would define


freedom.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As your Senate President, one of


my central roles is to protect faculty freedom.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

were revised there were extensive changes. This time the changes are more


narrow and clear. We set out to increase the enfranchisement of the individuals


involved in this body. We decided to try to simplify the parliamentary


complexity of what we do and we tried to simplify our committees. You have


all received the draft revisions via email. Under 1.A, under membership,


we enfranchised "the faculty". Secondly, we allowed all full-time lecturers


and senior lecturers (on three-year renewable contracts) to be enfranchised,


rather than to specifically limit it to lecturers in the Honors College.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We dealt with the issue of what it

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The last thing we did, under the


old committee structure: we had two committees under University Affairs


Committees: Financial Affairs and University Services and Facilities. Financial


Affairs has been nonfunctional now for several years. So, we have dropped


both of those and collapsed them into one University Affairs Committee


and took the functions and combined them under the new committee.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

was introduced: </b>"The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends


Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal


Arts and Sciences for the disestablishment of a Degree Program BS in Women?s


Studies." Rationale: The Women?s Studies Curriculum Committee voted in


favor of discontinuing the BS. Degree program as one step toward simplifying


their curriculum. The rationale behind the degree no longer has pertinence


to their students. When the degree was established in 1984, it was an alternative


for students who did not want to complete the language requirement in the


College. No longer is that applicable. Moreover, so few BS. Degrees in


Women?s Studies have been awarded since 1984, that the committee believes


that this simplifies degree offerings which is consonant with ABOR directives.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>


<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Fouquette: They will retain


the Bachelor of Arts in Women's Studies.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Burstein: One additional


announcement I need to insert. There will be an election that will be held


in conjunction with our Assembly election, for 4 individuals to serve on


the Intellectual Property Policy Committee. Since they have become a hearing


committee for grievances, we now have the right to elect members to that


committee, as we do on the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure and


the Governance Grievance Committee. So, from now on, there will be nominees


for you to vote on that are paired by their specific expertise for membership


on this important committee.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
