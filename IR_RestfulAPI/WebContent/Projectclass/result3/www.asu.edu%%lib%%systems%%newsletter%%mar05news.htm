                    have just received word that the team that created the Libraries&#8217;

                    to receive the President&#8217;s Award for Innovation. This 

                    award recognizes ASU individual employees or teams for innovations 

                    that improve educational, administrative, or other organizational 

                    processes through creative approaches. Philip Konomos, Stephen

                    will be honored at a private award ceremony hosted by the 

                    President's Office. LIST and Access Services staffers were

                    Project</font></h3>

                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reference linking 

                    is a technology service that enables linking from a citation 

                    to the full text of the cited item, which has become a common 

                    means for research libraries to enhance user access to scholarly 

                    literature. The Libraries have created a Reference Linking 

                    Task Group, chaired by Dr. John Howard, to evaluate various 

                    reference linking tools for possible purchase.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Task Group 

                    has scheduled two informational presentations on reference 

                    linking and the OpenURL standard it&#8217;s based on. All 

                    library staff are welcome to attend and learn more about this 

                    exciting technology:<br>

                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congratulations 

                    to Heather Knowles, Matthew Harp, Stephen Tanner and Philip 

                    Konomos who were invited to give a presentation at the Microcomputers 

                    in Education conference. Their presentation was titled Distance 

                    Leaning and Library Information: From Collaboration to Integration 

                    Via Streaming Video. The presentation (<a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/digilib/MEC/">available 

                    online</a>) dealt with design and implementation of the Library's 

                    streaming media projects and what the future holds for this 

                    exciting technology we&#8217;ve developed. The Microcomputers 

                    in Education Conference is in its 25th year of exploring ways 

                    to enhance education through technology.</font></p>

                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LIST has a plethora 

                    of new projects that we will be dealing with in the near future 

                    &#8211; new web design, single sign-in authentication development, 

                    ordering and distribution of 150 new computers, infrastructure 

                    upgrades, and implementation of a link resolver, to name just 

                    a few &#8211; and we are repositioning ourselves to take better 

                    advantage of our personnel resources. As a result, Rob Fidler 

                    and Keith Swartz will be taking on new responsibilities.<br>

                    <br>

                    Rob will become our Facilities and Infrastructure Coordinator. 

                    Among his new duties will be coordinating and tracking all 

                    our new hardware purchases, including inventory control and 

                    life cycle management; coordinating projects with IT; and 

                    developing and delivering IT-related training sessions for 

                    Library personnel.<br>

                    <br>

                    With Rob taking so many new responsibilities, Keith will assume 

                    supervision of the SOS desk and queue. This will become effective
