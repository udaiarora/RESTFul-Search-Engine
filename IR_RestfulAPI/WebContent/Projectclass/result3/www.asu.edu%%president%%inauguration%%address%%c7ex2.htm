The         <a href="http://www.asu.edu/xed/">ASU Downtown Campus</a> Initiative will         explore options for the advancement of knowledge and societal transformation         downtown and in surrounding neighborhoods. The presence of our existing         downtown Center and the availability of land position ASU to become a         key stakeholder in the revitalization of downtown Phoenix. </p>      <p>ASU plans to establish programs downtown in such areas as urban design,         economic development and diversification, and education and training.         The presence downtown of the state-wide genomics collaborative is another         incentive for ASU to develop a campus.</p>      <p>ASU has the opportunity to enhance and diversify its profile in the community         by developing an identity downtown. We hope to attract members of the         creative class to our campus, and in so doing, encourage the economic         development of downtown Phoenix. We hope that developing an academic center         will also encourage residential development in this diverse and vibrant         district of Phoenix. We hope to encourage new creative urbanism in Phoenix,         embedding the arts into the planning process. </p>      <p>The <a href="http://www.asu.edu/caed/joint_urban/JUDPhome.html" class="nodecor">Joint         Urban Design Program</a>, an outreach arm of the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/caed/" class="nodecor">ASU         College of Architecture and Environmental Design</a>, is already a presence         downtown. Through partnerships between the college and other units at         ASU and other public and private agencies, the program fosters environmental         stewardship, neighborhood and community development, quality of life,         sustainability, transportation improvements, and a revitalized urban form.         An example of the program's support for the community is the development         of Arizona's Capitol Mall, a project that as it continues, involves the         <a href="http://ssw.asu.edu/" class="nodecor">ASU School of Social Work</a> as well.<br>      </p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><br>      </p>      &nbsp;<BR> </td>    <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
