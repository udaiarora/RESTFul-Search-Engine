<P>3. &#9;Announcements and Communications.</P>
<P>3.A  Senate President's Report</B> (William Davey).</P>
<P>The Senate at our last two meetings debated the university whistle-blower policy and this policy has been approved by President Coor.  Simultaneous to the approval of the system-wide whistle-blower policies, at the UofA and NAU, there has been a push by the AAUP leadership, particularly Carol Bernstein, to put forward a piece of legislation which takes whistle-blower activities out of the hands of the individual personnel practices and policies of the individual institutions, and places it in the hands of the state general services administration.  At this point in time, those bills are dead, but Senator Peterson is proposing the development of a student committee to make some changes and then probably will bring back a new bill next year.  I will tell you that this bill has come forward in some form every year since 1988.  While this year it had a substantial amount of support in the Senate, it was defeated in the House.  We will probably have to revisit this bill next year, but our university policy has been approved by Dr. Coor and is now an active policy.  </P>
<P>I want to thank the Senate for the careful manner in which this bill was debated and the clarity that debate added to the final university policy.</P>
<P>Regarding retroactive sick leave accrual for faculty, several Senate meetings ago, Provost Glick made an announcement that active faculty employees (administrative and staff employees already accumulate sick leave) would begin to receive accumulated sick leave.  Faculty now have a policy that basically says they may have up to 30 days of sick leave, if approved by their department chair and dean, and, in some extenuating circumstances, by the provost.  What happens is that in the case of illness, your colleagues cover the classes.  Our sick leave policy was more liberal than at the other two institutions.  Our policy was a good policy up until the period of time that the legislature passed a bill giving a sick leave buyout of up to $30,000 upon retirement.  Then our faculty were put in a negative position since they were not accumulating sick leave, as opposed to the faculties at the other two universities who were accruing sick leave.  It was stated by our administration and others that the Faculty Senate at this institution had approved our 30-day sick leave policy.  We have researched that rigorously and the faculty at this institution never approved our buyout of the state system.  What we can gather is that it was reported to the Senate as an administrative announcement.  That changes things a bit regarding the possibility of litigation on the issue, because this was not a voluntary action on the part of the faculty.  </P>
<P>Alan Price and Blake Anderson met with the Attorney General's office last week and they are working out a way to make the retroactive accrual of sick leave happen.  There is a question about gifting, there is a question about constitutionality; they are working through that.  The discussions were quite cordial and we hope the outcome will be productive.  We should have a concrete answer within a week or two.  I have prepared in any event by contacting the National AAUP chapter to seek legal guidance, and if necessary we are prepared to take legal action.  I am hopeful that this issue will be resolved and that our faculty will not be put in an injurious position.</P>
<P>We do not have a budget yet, although the discussion on the budget indicates there will be a little extra money; not at the level we would like, but not catastrophic.  The faculty pay package in the governor's budget is still on the table.  Several people have asked me about the 2.2% retirement buyout with 77 points, and as far as I know that is still on the table; 2.5 is dead but 2.2 percent per year is still being considered for those that are in the state retirement system (not for supplemental plan participants).  There is a possibility of a three or 4-month retirement window being opened.  </P>
<B><P>3.B  University President/Provost Report</B> (Milton Glick).</P>
<P>We had a meeting with the faculty who have retired after July 1, 1998 and they have yet to receive the first of three payments that they are entitled to under the buyout plan.  The Attorney General has been asked to give an opinion as to whether the way in which we are back attributing sick leave is legal.  We brought the faculty who attended the meeting up to date, and gathered information from them about any impact this delay or the decision not to give them sick leave would have.  We asked for this information to help us in our discussion downtown.  Allan Price met last Tuesday with the Attorney General's Office; they have not issued a decision on whether retroactive sick leave is legal.  They expressed some reservations but also a willingness, if they decide it is not legal, to work with us to find another way to make this happen.  They are trying to find a way that this may be legally possible.  We will keep the faculty who have already retired informed, as well as keeping the Senate informed.</P>
<P>There is to our knowledge no budget approved downtown as yet.  From a distance, the House and Senate Republican leadership seem to have come to agreement on a package, but they have not come to agreement with the governor, nor have they sold it to the House and Senate Republican constituency.  In the Senate, there is a 16 to 14 split and one vote could hang it up.  There is not much new that was not news two weeks ago.  </P>
<P>It appears the final results on whistle-blowing, at least in this legislative session, will be to create a whistle-blower study committee which then will report back to the Senate and the House in the next session.  The ASU Senate's passage of the whistle-blower policy took a lot of wind, at least temporarily, out of the sails of those who wanted a whistle-blower bill.  To the best of my knowledge neither NAU nor UofA have passed a policy yet, although President Likens at the UofA has implemented on a temporary basis an executive order that resembles our policy, while the senate there continues to discuss and deliberate this issue.  </P>
<B><P>3.C  ASASU President's Report</B> (Paul Frost).</P>
<P>I have just returned from Washington, D.C. where several other student officers and I have participated in a national student government conference to talk about legislative issues dealing with higher education.  On Tuesday of last week, we did a little bit of lobbying on Capitol Hill with the congressman from Arizona, from this district, Matt Salmon.  We met with him and his staff people about educational issues.  I think in the future it would be more effective to work with the congressional members that are on the education committee, since they have the most influence on higher education issues. </P>
<P>The final elections for the Associated Students will be held next week on Tuesday and Wednesday.  The finalists for the office of President are Mike Sosso and Jennifer Holsman.  Both candidates are well qualified.  </P>
<P>We are continuing to work with the Provost's Office to streamline the graduation requirements.  This will be considered by the General Studies Council on March 23.</P>
<P>I bring to your attention that there have been some student and faculty concerns about some legislators being in favor of cutting the funding for non-traditional classes.  Particularly they were talking about the women's studies courses and many of the people in the women's coalition, students particularly, are concerned that those programs will be affected.  </P>
<P>Senator Strom: I would like to hear your view on the approximate number of students that vote in the ASASU general elections, the percent.</P>
<P>Paul Frost: My take on the low voter turnout is that it is a difficult thing to mobilize a student body, especially a student body that commutes.  We do need to do a better job of reaching out to the students and getting them engaged in the student government process.  In general, it is difficult to get people to vote, not only for student government elections but for elections in general.  It is something that I am very concerned about.  I would recommend announcing it in your classes.  We are trying to do as much as we can to let the students know who is running, and ways that they can look up information on the web site.  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Regarding the issue of streamlining, the report of the Curriculum Streamlining Committee, we went through a series of open fora on this campus as well as at ASU West.  The recommendations made as a result of  those discussions will  go to the General Studies Council tomorrow and then to CAPC on Wednesday, March 31. We hope that CAPC will approve those recommendations and bring the report to the Senate for a first reading on April 19.  Then we could vote on it at the May 3 Senate meeting.  </P>
<B>
<P>4.  Open Forum</B>.</P>
<P>Hal White (ASU Retirees Associaton): I reported to you last spring that for the first time your Senate allowed a representative of the ASU Retirees Association to visit your meetings.  My term is completed next month with that group, and today will be the last time I will visit with you in this role.  Thank you.</P>
<P>Usually we alternate years with a president who is a staff member, and then a faculty member; however, this year we have faculty next year also.  Zeke Prust, a friend of many of you here, will be sitting with you next.  It has been very special for me having represented my department and my college, and then I had the privilege of losing the election as president, and then ended up being the Senate President.  As a memento, I am taking my senator's card with me today!  </P>
<P>&#9;Just to remind everyone, there is a special going on--you can join the Retirees Association now and  we will admit you as an associate member for $5.00, that offer is for those who are at least 55 but not yet retired, instead of a regular membership after you are fully retired for $10.00.  Our group is doing a good job: two years ago we started lobbying in conjunction with the retirees at NAU, UofA and ARPA; they did not know us in the legislature two years ago.  Last year we got one piece of legislation through. This year, you never know until it is over, but we have five items in various stages of committee consideration.  They recognize our people now; they know we will be coming back.</P>
<P>&#9;As an aside, two years before I became Senate President, Michael Nielsen did a great deal in assuring that faculty could be present when the Board of Regents had their monthly meetings.  The next year was a difficult transition because the Regents sort of looked upon us as wild-eyed radicals.  When I became president, we were well accepted into the process and they even let us talk to the Regents.  The year that I was president-elect, a lot of the faculty were saying "Why be involved in the Faculty Senate? Nobody's paying attention to us anyway and I have better things to do."  Dick Peck, then Provost, Elmer Gooding, who was in the Provost's office at the time, and then Lattie Coor, when he became President, not only listened to us but asked us to talk to them.  What we do now has become institutionalized, the wonderful interaction that we are having with the Regents and the legislature and the administration.  Nine years ago, we did not have this process.  I think it is a compliment to our leadership and all you members of the Senate, and to the people in administration: Dr. Glick, Dr. Coor and others.</P>
<P>&#9;Senate President Davey: Thank you, Hal.  We certainly inherited quite a legacy from you all in the early days.  We really do have an interactive faculty governance system.  I think the Regents have taken us seriously over the last several years, thanks to Dan Landers with the faculty workload issue and Tom Callarman, Darwyn Linder, and Debby Losse.  Now, a member of the faculty sits at the table with the Regents and that was not so back in Hal's time as president of the Senate.  The level of influence that we have is largely due to the relationship that we have with our administration, and that we can work through issues together.  They also help us get access to administrative information that we would not have had normally.</P>
<P>&#9;The second issue to come before the open forum is a report on the ad hoc Committee on Insurance Benefits appointed recently by Mernoy Harrison.  This committee is to look at the form and scope of insurance policies available to the faculty, and to make a report back to the Senate concerning some of those policies and some of the major issues affecting faculty and staff relative to their health insurance.  We asked Jonathan Rose of the Law School to chair the committee.  All the members of the committee are very active, either professionally or within the areas of governance structure, with the insurance committees of the state, or are experts in terms of insurance law or experts in the field of insurance.  It is a blue ribbon task force with people who are significantly skilled in looking at these issues.  I would like Senator Rose to give you a brief overview of the initial work of that committee and to give you an idea of what this committee is designed to do.  </P>
<P>&#9;Senator Rose: Bill's introduction highlights one of my concerns about peoples' expectations of this committee.  We have had one meeting of the full committee.  The first thing we are trying to do is to define a manageable task.  We can sit down and complete our job by the end of next fall semester, and this we hope will contribute in a beneficial way to the plight of faculty and staff regarding health insurance.  This is an issue that I have been involved in for some time, both formally and informally, on campus and in state government.  Many of the problems of ASU faculty and staff are no different than other state employees' or for that matter no different than for lots of people with health insurance.  There are a few problems that are distinctive to the university, but one of my concerns with an introduction like the one that Bill gave me is that people have exaggerated hopes, or maybe fears in some quarters, that we are going to solve the health insurance crisis.  That is where the challenge of defining a manageable task comes in.  In general, we started out with two problems in mind: 1) A concern to assure that faculty and staff will have a reasonable choice of affordable health care programs.  There is some concern that the different types of plans and the different alternatives will diminish over time.  That is a concern that a lot of people were not paying attention to; it is not our main effort, although it is not irrelevant to our effort, to deal with every fight that all faculty and staff have with their current insurance program.  Thus at least one general problem is to try to see what can be done to assure a reasonable choice of affordable plans into the future, for faculty and staff.  A second problem, that has been partly addressed already, is to have this whole issue of good health insurance coverage on the "radar screen" of both the university and the state Department of Administration.  When we started out on this several years ago, one of the concerns was that the university was not paying enough attention to this, nor was the state Department of Administration.  The involvement of the provost, the Academic Senate, and the vice provost have partially removed one of those problems--it is at least to some extent on the radar screen of the university--and there has been a change of administration within the Department of Administration that is favorable.  </P>
<P>We will begin by gathering information from faculty and staff.  We are in the process of drafting a questionnaire, and I hope that everyone will cooperate and return it.  I think the kind of information in the very beginning that we are looking for is quite different than that which you are asked about in circulars from the Department of Administration, which basically go to the quality of the benefits package.  We are more interested in what program you chose and why did you choose it, were you well informed about the coverage and the options when you chose it and to what extent have you encountered problems in trying to use it?  We want to go beyond simply fighting over coverage.  For example, a common problem is what I call network shrinkage; you signed up because your doctor or other providers were part of the plan you chose and now they are no longer part of the plan.  That has one consequence for HMOs and that has another consequence for PPO or indemnity plans.  We have found generally that there is not as good information to faculty about the coverage of their plan as we would like.  A very common complaint of faculty and staff is that their plan is not mobile.  They go away for a sabbatical, they go away for a summer, they go on a research leave and they have no health insurance.  That is clearly a problem related to inadequate information; three quarters of all faculty and staff are enrolled in two HMO programs, Intergroup and Cigna.  Generally speaking no program like that has any mobile benefits unless you end up in a place where they have an office.  It is a question of faculty who think they are well, choosing on the cost of the plan, not understanding at all that they have chosen a plan whose benefits are not mobile.  We are not going to be able to make those benefits mobile, but we can try to do more to make sure that faculty understand the consequences of their choice.  Finally, there is a complex relationship between the university and the state Department of Administration.  Almost all the policy changes are in the hands of the state Department of Administration which puts out requests for bids on the health insurance plans.  If there are things about them we don't like, there is not much the university administration can do, but it is very possible that one of our recommendations will be that there needs to be a much more aggressive and persistent role on the part of the university in dealing with the state Department of Administration in raising the kinds of issues that need to be raised.  Even if they are the same issues for all state employees, they will need to raise them on behalf of university employees, in order that our voices be heard better and that problems be communicated and maybe even some restructuring of the contract which would give university personnel a great deal more leverage than they have now, which is none, in trying to deal with the health insurance companies.  </P>
<P>We are in the process of writing a questionnaire and we will get it out soon.  We have not decided whether we will send it to everyone, or to some randomly chosen group.  We will hope to have more information that will identify some of the problems and identify some of the solutions as well.  My email address has been sent to you in other announcements.  I have received some emails from you already and I have shared them with the other members of the committee.  We are meeting next week to review our draft questionnaire and we hope to get it out by the end of the semester and get the staff working on analyzing the data.   </P>
<P>Senator Chisholm: In your random sampling, will you include the faculty at ASU West and East Campus?</P>
<P>Senator Rose: Yes, we will.</P>
<P>Senator Mayer: Actually, my policy says that if you have an emergency you can call a 1-800 number.   </P>
<P>Senator Rose: That is limited to emergencies only.  I am speaking about non-emergency care.  If you go away for three months in the summer, go on a sabbatical leave, or go on a research leave, other than emergencies, you will have no health insurance coverage if you have an HMO at all unless you come back  to Arizona, or unless by coincidence you happen to be in a city where your plan has an office that will honor your Arizona contract.  Our preliminary information is that many faculty chose HMOs not knowing that information and are now unhappy that they have no coverage when they go away.  Even though that information was there, they will just have to have more effective sessions describing to people these kinds of coverage issues during the open enrollment periods.</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Thank you, Jon.  Are there any other things to bring before the house under open forum?</P>
<P>Senator Escobar: In a department meeting today in our Chicana and Chicano Studies Program, there was discussion and some intensive concern about the attack on the Women's Studies Program that has gone on over the last few weeks.  They have been targeted by some off campus elements to have their funding cut by the legislature.  We are concerned on a couple of issues: first, as another interdisciplinary studies program, we believe in general that Women's Studies is very important, secondly, as faculty members of this institution, we support the protection of academic freedom.  We are aware of the efforts of the university leadership, of President Coor and the rest of you, in supporting Women's Studies as you are doing.  We appreciate that.  We wanted to state both our concern and our appreciation for the efforts on behalf of Women's Studies as an ongoing program.  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: The bill in the legislature is pretty well dead right now, is it not?</P>
<P>Provost Glick: There is no footnote today; we believe there will not be one, but having said that, we are keeping a close eye on the situation.  I want to express appreciation to professor Mary Rothschild and her colleagues, who have worked very closely with us to make sure that in making clear their position they do not create a back-fire that could cost us as a university.  Our people on this campus know what is constructive and what is destructive.  A footnote of this type would be even worse than one a few years ago--then the appropriation was cut because the legislature wanted to reduce funding to the Law School.  Last year we had a footnote that reduced our state appropriation by $250,000, because that amount was for the museum.  In both cases, while the legislature reduced our budget because of something they did not like, that did not prohibit us from funding these items internally.  The footnote, as rumored, this year would have been far worse because it not only would reduce our appropriations; it would include a proviso that no state funding could be used for such a purpose.  While the others make us unhappy and they are wrong, they do not keep us from fulfilling our responsibilities.  If they would put in a footnote that precluded us from using state funding for such a program, I believe it would be unconstitutional but more important it would be a serious attack on the university's integrity and academic freedom, so, we cannot let that happen.  Our goal is to work with people such as the women's studies faculty to make sure people know where we stand.  This is a delicate situation for us because we do not want to reassure faculty prematurely that nothing could happen with the budget, then it may happen anyway.  We are trying to share what updates we do have as we learn them, so that we all know the same information.  On the other hand we cannot tell people what to do; we have to respect their decisions.</P>
<P>Please stay tuned to our reports from the legislature.  Right now, there is no footnote that we can see.</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: I can assure senators that I have contacted every member of the house relative to this issue, explaining our profound support for interdisciplinary programs and the issues of academic freedom associated with this proposed legislation.  I am also in daily contact with our lobbyists relative to the legislation that is appropriate to the universities.  I spoke to Blake Anderson on Friday and there is no footnote now, but we will keep an eye on it very closely and we will report back to you through the Senate Listserve, if there are issues that come up.  I was told by at least one legislator who was supportive of deleting women's studies, that Mary Rothschild's arguments to them were well received.  They did not necessarily agree with her views but they were well presented and done in a professional way.  That is all we can do, to lay out our issues in a professional way and keep pushing to make them understood.  We will keep in touch with that issue and report to you over our listserve, particularly about the budget issues and this one, when we hear anything new.</P>
<P>Senator O'Grady: Are there any revisions being made to the streamlining document?  Is there a plan to publish them before the next meeting of the Senate?</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: The document will go before the General Studies Council tomorrow.  We will see what the Council says and then at that point in time, we will publish a streamlining document--we will try to do that over the Internet as well.  Certainly when it comes to the Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee, you will receive a revised report for a first reading at the April 19 meeting, and hopefully a second reading at the May 3 meeting.</P>
<B>
<P>5.  Unfinished Business (Motions from Committees).</B>  There were no items of unfinished business to come before the house.</P>

<B><P>6.  New Business (Reports from Committees).</B> </P>
<P>&#9;<B>6.A  Executive Committee</B> (William Davey).</P>
<P>&#9;By statute, the Senate President must appoint a bylaws revisions committee every four years.  I will bring to the Senate Executive Committee a list of names, and a charge for this committee at their next meeting.  If any of you wish to serve on this committee, please forward your name to me within the next few days and I will be happy to include you in this group.  They will take up the issues of the status of lecturers and senior lecturers, Board of Regents policy updates that may affect the Academic Constitution and bylaws, (1996 was the last bylaws revision).</P>
<P>&#9;<B>6.B  Committee on Committees</B> (Tim Karcher).  </P>
<P>The CoC has formulated a ballot slate for the 1999-2000 Academic Assembly Elections Ballot.  This list will be published in the March 26 issue of ASU Insight with a call for additional nominations by petition (50 signatures required) by April 9, 1999.</P>
<P>&#9;<B>6.C  Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee</B> (Linda Johnson).</P>
<P>&#9;6.C.1  Action Item:</P>
<P>Senate Motion #17 was introduced for a first reading: The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of the proposals submitted by the General Studies Council to establish a continuous enrollment requirement in General Studies N1 courses."  The motion is attached with the rationale.  Are there any questions?</P>
<P>&#9;Senator O'Grady: Doesn't General Studies Council consider this type of thing part of their domain?  They seem to be setting up a system similar to the English proficiency, but English proficiency is not a part of general studies.  This seems to be more properly the choice of the student.  Why are S1 and S2 classes not made to be this way?  I do not understand why this came up at all.  </P>
<P>&#9;Senator L. Johnson: There is a rationale included with the motion.  That was primarily to encourage the students to take their courses earlier in their career.</P>
<P>&#9;Senator Winkelman: There is a concern that the further away a student gets away from the mathematics they had at the high school level, the more difficult it becomes for them to comprehend upper division courses -- the mathematics department has data on upper division students taking courses such as Math 114, Math 117, etc. and having difficulty.  Mathematics is something that students need to take early in their degree program, if they are to be successful.   </P>
<P>&#9;6.C.2  Information Item:</P>
<P>&#9;Name Change of a Concentration, under M.S., Family Resources: General Family Resources and Human Development to <U>Human Nutrition</U>.       </P>
<P>&#9; Establishment of a Concentration, under the B.S., Mathematics: <U>Computational Mathematical Sciences.</P>
</U><P>&#9;<B>6.D  Personnel Committee</B> (Ronald Hoffmeister).  No report.</P>
<P>&#9;<B>6.E&#9; Student-Faculty Policy Committee </B>(John Crawford).</P>
<P>&#9;Paul Frost is present and he may want to update the Senate on the Teacher Evaluation Program.  Essentially, one hundred classes were evaluated this semester, and so far the results have not been submitted; they have been lost in limbo in a computer somewhere.  Are they out now?  Even with that data being available, there was a bit of insurrection inside student government.  Some were saying that  they do not really support the current questionnaire format; they want to go a different way with a different focus--on what they want to ask and how they would like to go about the asking.  I believe we are not ready to do a roll out of a student-based evaluation program at this time.  Paul can you tell us more about this situation.</P>
<P>&#9;Paul Frost: Dr. Crawford was right that some students in the ASASU Senate do not support the current evaluation form.  I feel that this format has been thoroughly researched and a lot of thought and discussion has gone on, especially with President-elect Burstein, on the current evaluation form.  I feel we should move ahead with the format we have.  This semester we intend to do 1,000 classes and just push ahead with the program.  I think that if anything were to change with the program and we were to reconsider it that would be a great detriment to the program and its original intent.  We do have the data; that is not a problem.  The only thing we need to do for this semester is to get the evaluation out.</P>
<P>&#9;Senator Bortner:  Who has assessed the data from the pilot study that we now have, of the 100 classes, to make a decision that it merits moving to 1,000?  </P>
<P>&#9;Paul Frost: We did a pilot study of 10 classes that we presented to the Senate last semester.  The reason that we moved from 10 to 100 to 1,000 is to see what kind of bugs there are in getting the program off the ground.  We discovered some things we need to work on in doing 100 and in doing 1,000, but we have not really made any major changes to the program since that time.  Senator Crawford: Will you be bringing that data to the committee soon?   </P>
<P>We do have a Student Faculty Policy Committee meeting on Wednesday, March 24, and I believe we will see the results of this data summarized and presented.  On the committee, we have several members who are good at number crunching.  I believe that is the kind of evaluation that we are curious about.  The way they are doing it is reporting raw numbers, done as percentages.  That is one of the concerns, Paul, of the student senate: that when you look at those numbers they are not very helpful.  I am not sure that we will be able to give them any more help, or to clarify what is coming.  The SFPC had the same concern, that this is not a particularly useful number to look at.  There was not a whole lot of information that was quoted.  There will not be open data, no statements generated by students put out in an anonymous format.  That is one of the key variables that generated a lot of faculty concern, having open ended data.  </P>
<P>Down the road, we will be seriously trying to find a mechanism by which this can be done on the web.  That is already being done at several universities; there are some pilots that at least can be looked at but we are quite a ways away from trying to do that at ASU.  That is something that I think your people are very interested in and it makes all the sense in the world.  If we do that, there will probably be a stronger collaboration between the faculty member and the evaluation system.  There would probably be a statement by the faculty member in the published course evaluation data about the nature of the course.  There would then be a little bit more informative component, so a student could connect to the web, type in something like COM 312, see a description by the faculty member of what the course is like, what books are required, what assignments are expected, and then scroll on down and see some numerical input from students as to what they thought of all that.  That kind of an experience is where the whole system would like eventually to go.  Its function would be to help students make better decisions about what courses to take.  At no time is this thing ever going to drift off into an evaluative kind of thing that will have any impact whatsoever on the tenure and promotion process.  That is not its intent, that is not what the student body wants it to have, it will not be taken in that direction.  If anything, it will become a better tool to facilitate better decision making for course selection.    </P>
