<i>Abstract: </i>  Yttrium layers on amorphous or crystalline silicon substrates were irradiated with 600 keV Ar<sup>++</sup>, Kr<sup>++</sup>, and Xe<sup>++</sup> ions between liquid-nitrogen temperatures and 265°C.  Ion-induced YSi<sub>1.7</sub> formed in those samples irradiated above 205°C and fluence <u>&gt;</u> 1 x 10<sup>15</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>.  The growth rates were monitored as a function of fluence and nuclear energy deposition at the Y/Si interface. for each ions species investigated, the growth rate varied linearly with the square root of fluence.  The apparent activation energy was determined to be 0.6 - 0.1 eV.  The experimental growth rates also exhibited a linear dependence on the nuclear energy deposition. This finding agrees qualitatively with the premise of nonoverlapping subcascades. <p><i>J. Appl.
