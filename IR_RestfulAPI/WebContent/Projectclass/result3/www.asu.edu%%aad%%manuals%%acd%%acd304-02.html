<center><font size=+2><b>Policy</b></font></center>
<img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2">

<p>
<a href="acd002.html#student" target="New">Students</a> who participate in university-sanctioned activities that require classes to be missed, should be given opportunities to make up examinations and other graded in-class work. However, absence from class or examinations due to university-sanctioned activities does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of the absence.

<p>
The deputy vice president/university dean of Student Affairs shall determine, for the purposes of this policy, whether a particular event qualifies as a university-sanctioned activity.

<p>
In each college, a specific individual (e.g., dean&#146;s designee or college <a href="acd002.html#ombudsperson" target="New">ombudsperson</a>) should be responsible for facilitating adherence to this policy. In particular, students who participate in university-sanctioned activities should be given the opportunity to make up examinations or other graded in-class work due to classes missed because of that activity, unless it can be shown that such an accommodation would constitute an unreasonable burden on the instructor. Should disagreement arise over what constitutes such a burden, the instructor and the student should initially contact the <a href="acd002.html#departmentchair" target="New">department chair</a> or the dean&#146;s designee.

<p>
The specific activity program coordinator (e.g., assistant athletics director for academic services, director of forensics, director of bands) should, as early as possible, provide the college-designated individual with the class schedule of any student who may be required to miss class because of a university-sanctioned activity.

<p>
Students should inform their instructors early in the semester of required class absences. Instructors should attempt to provide opportunities for equivalent work, either before or after the class absence, in accordance with any <a href="acd002.html#department" target="New">department</a> or college requirements, which may apply.

<p>
Incomplete grades (I) should not be used unless deemed necessary by the respective faculty.
