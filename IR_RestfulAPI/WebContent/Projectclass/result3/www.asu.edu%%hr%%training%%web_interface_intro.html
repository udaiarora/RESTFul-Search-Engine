			 FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><BR>Starting June 3rd, the
			 site <A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/hr/training">www.asu.edu/hr/training</A> will
			 offer a new professional development course catalog, which will include courses
			 delivered by many campus departments. Departments depend on our Learning
			 Management System, which also handles online registrations, cancellations,
			 class rosters, and other new functionalities in order to deliver their
			 development opportunities to the ASU community.<BR><BR>

			 Catalog</B></A><BR><FONT
			 FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The new course catalog this
			 year offers a way to view all offerings by first narrowing your choices down by
			 categories. For example, you may be looking for computer-related training on
			 campus. When you open the catalog, you would see a category specifically for
			 "Computing: Instructor-led, on campus," which would take you to the courses in
			 that category and their descriptions. From there, you may select a course and
			 see when and where individual classes for that course will be offered and
			 complete a registration, or simply add the course to your Development Plan (see
			 below). As you narrow your choices by looking at categories, you can also add
			 in keywords for better searching. The new course catalog will be faster and
			 easier for you to use, as you will not be required to look through a long list
			 of classes anymore.<BR><BR>
			 <A
			  HREF="https://lms.asu.edu/stc/employee/psciis.dll?plan=employee"><B>My
			 Development Plan</B></A><BR><FONT
			 FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The My Development Plan
			 function allows you to create a "document" much like how an academic student
			 would create a "Plan of Study." The development plan allows you to "grab"
			 courses from the course catalog, and add them to your development plan, without
			 committing to actual class times and dates. Then, as time allows, you can open
			 your development plan and schedule the sessions you previously identified as
			 necessary. It is our hope that supervisors will work with employees to create
			 development plans as we begin another performance evaluation year to take full
			 advantage of the Training Release Time Policy (<A
			 HREF="http://asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/spp601.html">SPP 601</A>).
