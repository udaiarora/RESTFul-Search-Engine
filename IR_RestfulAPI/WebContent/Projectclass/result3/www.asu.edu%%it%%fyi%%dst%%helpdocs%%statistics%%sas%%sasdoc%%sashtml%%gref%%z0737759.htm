<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">HTML= specifies COUNTRYDRILL as the variable that contains
the targets for the bars. HTML_LEGEND= specifies YEARDRILL as the variable
that contains the targets for the legend values. Specifying HTML variables
causes SAS/GRAPH to add an image map to the HTML body file. NAME= specifies
the name of the catalog entry. Because the PATH= destination is a file storage
location and not a specific file name, the catalog entry name GRAINALL is
automatically assigned to the GIF file. DES= specifies the description that
is stored in the graphics catalog and used in the Table of Contents.
