<BR><BR>A system of equations can be nonlinear in the parameters,
nonlinear in the observed variables, or nonlinear in both
the parameters and the variables. 
<I>Nonlinear</I> in the parameters means that the mathematical relationship
between the variables and parameters is not required to have a linear form.
(A linear model is a special case of a nonlinear model.) 
A general nonlinear system of equations can be written as
<BR><BR><DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="458" HEIGHT="173"
 SRC="images/modeq1.gif"
 ALT="&q_{1}&( y_{1,t}, y_{2,t} , { ... } , y_{g,t}, x_{1,t}, x_{2,t} , { ... } , x_{m...
 ...x_{m,t}, {\theta}_{1}, {\theta}_{2} , { ... } , {\theta}_{p}) = {\epsilon}_{g,t}"></DL><BR>where <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>y</I><SUB><I>i</I>,<I>t</I></SUB></SPAN> is an endogenous variable, <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>x</I><SUB><I>i</I>,<I>t</I></SUB></SPAN> is
an exogenous variable, <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/modeq2.gif"
 ALT="{{\theta}_{i}}"> is a parameter, and
<IMG WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/modeq3.gif"
 ALT="{{\epsilon}_{i}}"> is the unknown error. The subscript <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>t</I></SPAN>
represents time or some index to the data.
In econometrics
literature, the observed variables are either <I>endogenous</I> (dependent)
variables or <I>exogenous</I> (independent) variables.
This system can be written more succinctly in vector form as

<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="119" HEIGHT="74"
 SRC="images/modeq4.gif"
 ALT="q( y_{t}, x_{t}, {{\theta}}) = {{\epsilon}}_{t}"></DL>
This system of equations is in <I>general form</I> because the
error term is by itself on one side of the equality. Systems can also
be written in <I>normalized form</I> by placing the endogenous variable
on one side of the equality, with each equation defining a predicted
value for a unique endogenous variable. A normalized form equation system
can be written in vector notation as

<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="74"
 SRC="images/modeq5.gif"
 ALT="y_{t} = f( y_{t}, x_{t}, {{\theta}}) + {{\epsilon}}_{t}."></DL>
PROC MODEL handles equations written in both forms.
<BR><BR>Econometric models often explain the current values of the endogenous
variables as functions of past values of exogenous and endogenous
variables. These past values are referred to as <I>lagged</I> values, and
the variable <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>x</I><SUB><I>t</I>-<I>i</I></SUB></SPAN> is called lag <I>i</I> of the variable 
<I>x<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN></I>.
Using lagged variables, you can create a <I>dynamic</I>, or time dependent,
model. In the preceding model systems, the lagged exogenous and endogenous
variables are included as part of the exogenous variables.
<BR><BR>If the data are time series, so that <I>t</I> indexes time
(see chapter tsdata for more information on time series),
it is possible that <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/modeq6.gif"
 ALT="{{{\epsilon}}_{t}}"> depends on
<IMG WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/modeq7.gif"
 ALT="{{{\epsilon}}_{t-i}}"> or, more generally, the
<B><IMG WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/modeq8.gif"
 ALT="{\epsilon}"></B><SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>'s are not identically and independently distributed.
If the errors of a model system are autocorrelated,
the standard error of the estimates of the parameters of the 
system will be inflated.
<BR><BR>Sometimes the <B><IMG WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/modeq8.gif"
 ALT="{\epsilon}"></B><SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>i</I></SUB></SPAN>'s
are not identically distributed because
the variance of <B><IMG WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/modeq8.gif"
 ALT="{\epsilon}"></B> is not constant. This is
<A NAME="idxmod0005">&#13;</A>known as <I>heteroscedasticity</I>. Heteroscedasticity in an
estimated model can also inflate the standard error of the estimates 
of the parameters.
Using a weighted estimation can sometimes eliminate this problem.
Alternately, a variance model such as GARCH or EGARCH can be
estimated to correct for heteroscedasticity.
If the proper weighting scheme and the form of the error
model is difficult to determine, generalized methods
of moments (GMM) estimation can be used to determine parameter estimates
that are asymptotically more efficient than the OLS parameter estimates.
<BR><BR>Other problems may also arise when estimating systems of equations.
Consider the system of equations:

<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="302" HEIGHT="77"
 SRC="images/modeq9.gif"
 ALT="y_{1,t} = {\theta}_{1} + ( {\theta}_{2} + {\theta}_{3} 
 {\theta}^t_{4})^{-1} + {\theta}_{5}y_{2, t} + {\epsilon}_{1,t}"></DL>

<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="309" HEIGHT="77"
 SRC="images/modeq10.gif"
 ALT="y_{2,t} = {\theta}_{6} + ( {\theta}_{7} + {\theta}_{8} 
 {\theta}^t_{9})^{-1} + {\theta}_{10}y_{1, t}+ {\epsilon}_{2,t}"></DL>
which is nonlinear in its parameters and cannot be estimated with
linear regression. This system of equations represents a 
rudimentary predator-prey process with <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>y<SUB>1</SUB></I></SPAN> as the 
prey and <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>y<SUB>2</SUB></I></SPAN> as the predator
(the second term in both equations is a logistics curve).
The two equations must be estimated simultaneously because of the
cross dependency of <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>y</I></SPAN>'s. 
Nonlinear ordinary least-squares estimation of
these equations will produce biased and inconsistent parameter estimates.
This is called <I>simultaneous equation bias</I>.
<P>One method to remove simultaneous equation bias, in the linear case, is to
replace the endogenous variables
on the right-hand side of the equations with predicted values that are
uncorrelated with the error terms. These predicted values can be
obtained through a preliminary, or &#34;first stage,&#34; <I>instrumental variable
regression</I>.
<I>Instrumental variables</I>, which are uncorrelated with the error term,
are used as regressors to model the predicted values. The parameter estimates
are obtained by a second regression using the predicted 
values of the regressors.
This process is called <I>two-stage least squares</I>.
<P>In the nonlinear case, nonlinear ordinary least-squares estimation is 
performed iteratively using a linearization
of the model with respect to the parameters.
The instrumental solution to simultaneous equation bias in the
nonlinear case is the same 
as the linear case except the linearization
of the model with respect to the parameters is predicted by
the instrumental regression. Nonlinear two-stage least squares 
is one of several instrumental variables methods available in the MODEL
procedure to handle simultaneous equation bias.
<P>When you have a system of several regression equations, the
random errors of the equations can be correlated.
In this case, the large-sample efficiency of the estimation
can be improved by using a joint generalized least-squares method that takes
the cross-equation correlations into account. If the equations
are not simultaneous (no dependent regressors), then 
<I>seemingly unrelated regression</I> (SUR) can be used.
The SUR method requires an estimate of the cross-equation error 
covariance matrix, <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/modeq11.gif"
 ALT="{\Sigma}">.The usual approach is to first fit the equations using OLS,
compute an estimate <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="21" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/modeq12.gif"
 ALT="{\hat{\Sigma}}"> from the OLS residuals,
and then perform the SUR estimation based on <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="21" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/modeq12.gif"
 ALT="{\hat{\Sigma}}">.The MODEL procedure estimates <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/modeq11.gif"
 ALT="{\Sigma}"> by default, or you can supply
your own estimate of <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/modeq11.gif"
 ALT="{\Sigma}">.<P>If the equation system is simultaneous, you can combine the 2SLS and SUR
methods to take into account both simultaneous equation bias and
cross-equation correlation of the errors.
This is called <I>three-stage least squares</I> or 3SLS.
<P>A different approach to the simultaneous equation bias problem
is the full information maximum likelihood, or FIML, estimation method.
FIML does not require instrumental variables, but it assumes that
the equation errors have a multivariate normal distribution. 
2SLS and 3SLS estimation do not assume a particular 
distribution for the errors.
<P>Once a nonlinear model has been estimated, it can be used to obtain
forecasts. If the model is linear in the variables you want to forecast,
a simple linear solve can generate the forecasts.
If the system is nonlinear, an iterative procedure must be used.
The preceding example system is linear in its endogenous variables. 
The MODEL procedure's SOLVE statement is used to forecast nonlinear models.
<P>One of the main purposes of creating models is to obtain an understanding
of the relationship among the variables. There are usually
only a few variables in a model you can control (for example, the amount of
money spent on advertising). Often you want to determine how to change
the variables under your control to obtain some target goal.
This process is called <I>goal seeking</I>. PROC MODEL allows you
to solve for any subset of the variables in a system of equations 
given values for the remaining variables.
<P>The nonlinearity of a model creates two
problems with the forecasts: the forecast errors are not
normally distributed with zero mean, and no formula exits to calculate the
forecast confidence intervals. PROC MODEL provides Monte Carlo techniques,
which, when used with the covariance of the parameters and error covariance
matrix, can produce approximate error bounds on the forecasts.
