Learn how to work smart in planning and conducting research projects       with this new resource for successful research data management (RDM).
You can read about basic concepts and techniques of RDM and then see       them illustrated in case studies from a variety of research fields.
Readers with some experience leading research projects and an              understanding of programming basics will value both the theoretical and
the practical information provided here. In addition to RDM methodology    and four case studies, the book features a concise list of tips to
remember at the end of each concepts chapter, an appendix with SAS         programming tips, and a list of recommended supplemental texts,
including SAS manuals and SUGI papers. Ideal for researchers in the        field and the classroom.
