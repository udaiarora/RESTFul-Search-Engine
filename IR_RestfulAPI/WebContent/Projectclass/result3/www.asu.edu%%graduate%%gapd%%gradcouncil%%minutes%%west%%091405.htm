          FAB N303C</strong><br>
         
        </div>
        <br>

       The council met in FAB N303C at 10:00 a.m.  In attendance were:  Joan F. Brett, Candice Bredbenner, Maria Cardelle-Elawar, 
	   Mohan Gopalakrishnan, John Greenhut, Dennis Isbell, Jeffrey Kassing, Stephen Lawton, Sarah Lindquist, Julie Ramsden, Jennifer 
	   Shaffer, Suzanne Vaughan, Monica Whitlock, Marge Williams, and Paz Zorita.  Guest in attendance:  Ray Buss and Ida Malian, 
	   from the College of Teacher Education and Leadership; Richard Morris, President, Academic Senate.
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       ANNOUNCEMENT ITEMS
       <br>
       <br>
       At the beginning of the meeting, the members introduced themselves.  Then Dr. Brett, Associate Vice Provost 
	   Academic Programs and Graduate Studies, gave a short description of the council?s origin as a hybrid committee 
	   and its mission.  The Graduate Council at the West campus mission statement is:    
	   <blockquote>?The Graduate Council at the West campus serves in an advisory role to the Associate Vice Provost of 
	   Graduate Studies and Academic Programs.  As part of its duties, the graduate council reviews proposals for new graduate 
	   degree programs and concentrations and sets campus specific policies and standards for admissions.?
	   </blockquote>
	   Dr. Richard Morris, President, Academic Senate for the 2005 ? 2006 academic year and gave the Graduate Council its 
	   charge of reviewing new graduate programs, curriculum action proposals, and recommendations to the Provost of ASU?s West campus.
	   <br>
       <br>
       <br>
      DECISION ITEMS
       <br>
       <br>
       The council quickly unanimously approved Dennis Isbell as co-chair for the 2005-2006 academic year.  
<br>
<br>
Dr. Brett introduced the Request for Implementation Authorization for the Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in Leadership and 
Innovation by giving a compressed history of the proposal?s development during the past year; and, at this time the council 
will be reviewing only the overview of the program.  The details of the courses and the syllabi will be brought forward at 
a latter date.  She then introduced Dr. Ray Buss, Assistant Dean of the College of Teacher Education and Leadership, and 
turned the table over to him to describe the program.  
<br>
<br>
Dr. Buss thanked the members of the committee who work so diligently on the proposal during the past year and saw it through its 
many versions.  He then turned the table over to Dr. Stephen Lawton, Director of Graduate Programs in the College of Teacher 
Education and Leadership.  Dr. Lawton distributed an outline that highlights the proposed doctoral program as an applied 
practitioner program with two separate specializations; one specialization in policy and administration; and, the other 
specialization in teaching innovation.  The applicant selection will be very rigorous, as the faculty review committee may 
select only 12 students out of a possible 40 applications the first semester.  
<br>
<br>
A concern regarding the required research methods courses was raised.  It seemed that students were directed to pursue either a 
quantitative or a qualitative approach, but not both; and, there was concern that this approach would not serve our doctoral 
students well, who may be required to write grants in their professions.  It was explained that the program is not methods focused.  
However, it is understood that the students? dissertation topic will direct the research method.   The chair suggested a change to 
include research methods courses in the list of electives.
<br>
<br>
A concern was raised regarding a description in the Ed.D. proposal of the Research Consulting Center.  The center no longer 
exists as described in the proposal.  This is a serious situation if we are going to continue to develop research base programs.  
Dr. Brett stated that this will be noted as a general concern for campus support.  In addition, the description of the Research 
Consulting Center will be deleted from the proposal.
<br>
<br>
A member objected to the notion of online courses from other universities being accepted as transfer credit into the Ed.D.  Since 
there is concern regarding the quality of some on-line coursework offered by other institutions, the word, ?online? was stricken 
from the proposal and the statement now reads as, ?approved accredited courses.?
<br>
<br>
Given the high projected market demand, a question was raised regarding the low projected enrollment for the first 5 years of the 
Ed.D. program.  A discussion followed which described the debate on how enrollment numbers had changed during the course of the 
proposal?s process.  A footnote will be added to the proposal stating that enrollments were set at a lower than market projections 
to allow the program to become established.
<br>
<br>
A request to add the number of projected vacancies in superintendents to provide more information than just a 22% turnover rate 
was made by a council member.  The proposal will be changed to add 45 as the number of projected superintendent vacancies.
<br>
<br>
Five minor changes were made to the document: include all CIP codes, add a footnote on the projected annual enrollment, delete 
the statement on the Research Center, add the number of superintendent vacancies, and the deletion of the term ?online,? the 
first doctoral program at ASU?s West campus was unanimously recommended to move forward.
<br>
<br>
<br>
DISCUSSION ITEMS
<br>
<br>
In recent years, the number of Graduate Certificate programs has increase and number of students interested in such programs 
has also increased.  Therefore, to keep the programs well defined, the Graduate Programs Advisory Committee (GPAC) has made 
several recommendations to govern the graduate certificate programs.  The main concern of the members of the council was the 
possibility of ?double dipping.?  
<br>
<br>
The certificate program in gerontology is the only graduate certificate program at the West campus.  It was stated that the MAIS 
program allows all 21 credit hours of the gerontology certificate program to be used as part of the program of study for the Master of 
Arts, Interdisciplinary Studies.  However, history of the Graduate Council at the West campus states approval up to 18 credit hours of 
the graduate gerontology certificate program may be part of the MAIS program of study.  This discrepancy will be looked into.  It was 
recommended that a policy limiting the number of shared credit hours between graduate certificate programs and graduate degree programs 
be developed.
<br>
<br>
Dr Brett announced that the scholarships dedicated to programs last spring for recruiting/retention purposes went unused by some 
programs.  This will not happen again.  We will make better use of our scholarship allocations by allocating them for targeted 
recruiting early in the Spring.  The goal being to allocate all scholarships by May 2006, for the 2006-2007 academic year.
<br>
<br>
Developing a strategic recruiting plan will be one of our primary goals this year.  Dr. Brett handed out a proposed recruiting plan 
for Graduate Studies to be discussed in detail in a meeting with the Graduate Directors.  In addition, the graduate directors were 
requested to think about their recruiting efforts, target numbers and capacity numbers for each of their programs.  What would be the 
best strategy to increase current student numbers?  The Graduate Studies office will meet with the directors of graduate programs and 
work with them in this recruiting effort.  Dr. Maria Allison, Dean of the Division of Graduate Studies, at the Tempe campus has offered 
to conduct workshops with multi campus programs that offer the same or similar graduate programs titled, ?Building Collaborative 
Recruiting Strategies.?
<br>
<br>
The meeting adjourned at 11:40 a.m.
