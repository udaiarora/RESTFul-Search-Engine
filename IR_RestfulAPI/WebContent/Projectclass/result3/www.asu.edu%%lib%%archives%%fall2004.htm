<p> Peterson Zah, now Assistant to ASU President, Michael Crow on American Indian
  Affairs, donated his collection of papers and memorabilia to the Labriola Center
  in 1999. Much of the material on display covers his administration of the Navajo
  Tribal Council between 1983 and 1987. A later campaign took place in 1990,
  when he ran successfully and became the first President of the Navajo Nation.
  He served in that office until 1994.
<p> The exhibit, researched and mounted by Library Specialist Senior, Joyce Martin,
  features campaign memorabilia, buttons, ballots, photographs of the candidates,
  and official returns.

  The Labriola Center has recently acquired the <em>Cherokee Phoenix and Indian&#8217;s
  Advocate</em>, the first tribal newspaper and the first to publish the news in an
  American Indian language. It used the syllabary created by the Cherokee, Sequoyah,
  and was printed in both languages in parallel columns, and published out of
  New Echota, Cherokee Nation, Georgia.<br>
  Its first editor was Elias Boudinot, who also raised the funds to purchase
  the necessary equipment. According to Daniel Littlfield and James Parins, it
  was not an easy task to establish a press in Indian country, and they faced
  numerous obstacles, one being typesetting because of the language barrier (<em>American
  Indian and Alaska Native Newspapers and Periodicals, 1826-1924</em>, Greenwood Press,
  1984).
  <p>
  The first issue was published on February 21, 1828. The mission was to publish
  the laws of the nation, provide information on Cherokee customs and other tribes,
  principal news of the day, and articles discussing religion, civilization,
  and religion among the Cherokees.<p>
  Apparently, the paper was not widely circulated among the Cherokee people,
  and did not reflect the way in which the mass of Cherokees lived. Thus it was
  said that the paper was a propaganda device aimed at white readers. There is
  good deal of material dealing with removal to lands west of the Mississippi.<p>
  <em>The Cherokee Phoenix</em> was published between 1838 and 1829, and as the <em>Cherokee
  Phoenix, Indians&#8217; Advocate</em>, between 1829 and 1834, &#8220;printed under
  the patronage, and for the benefit of the Cherokee Nation, and devoted to the
  cause of the Indians.&#8221; There are three reels, FILM E99.C5.C56 Labriola.

<p> <font color="#400000" size="+1">Colonial and American Indian Treaties: a Collection
</font><br>
ASU College of Law, Indian
  Legal Program, presents a collection of Colonial and American treaties with
  Indian Nations on CD-ROM. The collection contains
  700 agreements, some dating to the early Seventeenth Century. The College of
  Law has compiled these searchable texts for use by students and teachers of
  American Indian history and Federal Indian Law as well as for practitioners
  of Federal Indian Law. <p>
  An introductory essay by the faculty of ASUs Legal Program discusses the history
  of treaty making with the Indian nations and demonstrates the contemporary
  importance of these foundational documents.<p>
  The College notes that from the time of the first contact between Europeans
  and the indigenous peoples of North America, a system was needed to establish
  and maintain relations between colonizing nations and the indigenous nations.
  Once their foothold in North America was established, the European powers proposed,
  and the Indian nations agreed, that their relations would be conducted by treaty.<p>
  Net proceeds from the sale of this educational software ($100) will be donated
  to the Indian Legal Scholarship Foundation. Please see

  <font color="#400080" size="+1">Canyon Records Collection gifted to ASUs Music Library</font><br>
  The Arizona Historical Foundation, located in Hayden Library on the ASU campus,
  has turned over a valuable collection of Native American recordings to the
  Music Library.<p>
  The generous donation of some 450 items was published by Canyon Records, in
  Phoenix, Arizona. Founded in 1951, by Ray and Mary Boley, the company was the
  first to market Native American music to the Indian people. When the couple
  retired in 1992, Canyon Records Productions was purchased by Robert Doyle,
  who continues to explore and record music of the American Indian People.<p>
  Brian Dougherty, Head, Music Library, said that &#8220;this amazingly complete
  collection provides an important collection of regional material that is unique
  to the music library&#8221; adding &#8220;that it is the only intact collection
  that I know of.&#8221; Dougherty remarked that it also represents a history
  of media technology, and fortunately, the library has the equipment needed
  on which to play the varied formats.<p>
  For example, there are sixteen 10&quot; records at 78 rpm, which were manufactured
  through the 1960s. One example is Old Time Squaw Dance (Navajo), with Joe Lee
  of Lukachukai. Next, with 22 examples, is the 45 rpm (7&quot;) record, represented
  by Les Lacopa&#8217;s Pueblo Corn Dance Song. Recorded on a 33-1/3 speed long
  play disc are the Pigeon Lake (Alberta) Singers presenting Cree Tribal Songs.
  There are 35 in the collection.<p>
  By far the largest group is recorded on audio cassette, some 324. One example
  is by Robert Tree Cody, Dreams from the Grandfather. Finally, on CD, are Aaron
  White, Kelvin Bizahaloni, and Michael Bannister with Burning Sky: Music for
  Native American Flute, Guitar, Percussion. <p>
  These will be kept as a discrete collection, and will not circulate, though
all are welcome to listen to the various works.</p>
