			<h2>8410 Digital Set</h2>
			<img src="img/8410D.jpg" width="132" height="165" border="0" />
			<p>$125.00 installation <br /><br />	
			$28.00 per month <br /><br />
			The 8410 voice terminal is a multi-appearance digital telephone with 10 call 
			appearance/feature buttons, four standard fixed feature buttons (CONFERENCE, DROP, HOLD, and 
			TRANSFER), a blue SHIFT button, a MUTE button, a SPEAKER button which can access either a 
			2-way speakerphone or a 1-way, listen-only speaker, a TEST button, and a Volume control 
			button.</p>
			
			<h3>Features</h3>

			<p><strong>Eight Fixed Feature Buttons</strong></p>

			<p>The 8410 has the following eight fixed feature buttons:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>CONFERENCE (labeled CONF) button</li>
				<li>DROP button</li>
				<li>TRANSFER button</li>
				<li>A red HOLD button</li>
				<li>A blue SHIFT button</li>
				<li>MUTE button</li>
				<li>SPEAKER button</li>
				<li>TEST button</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>The SHIFT Button</strong></p>

			<p>The blue SHIFT button on the set can be used in the following ways: (The red light next to 
				the SHIFT button goes on steadily when the button is activated.)</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Used with the HOLD button to select your own personalized ring from among eight 
					available patterns.</li> 
				<li>Used with the SPEAKER button to perform an acoustic test of the environment and adjust 
					the speakerphone to the surrounding acoustic environment for optimal performance.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>Call Appearance/Feature Buttons</strong></p>

			<p>The 8410 voice terminal has 10 call appearance/feature buttons, each equipped with a red 
				and a green status light. Usually, at least three of these buttons are administered as 
				call appearances for the terminal&#8217;s primary extension number, where calls are placed and 
				answered. The rest of the buttons can be used for more call appearances (including bridged 
				appearances of other stations&#8217; extensions) and features. Buttons administered for features 
				have only their status lights active.</p>

			<p><strong>Message Light</strong></p>

			<p>The red Message light goes on when a message is left for the user. It goes off when the 
				user retrieves the message or when the message is erased.</p>

			<p><strong>Speakerphone</strong></p>

			<p>The 8410 voice terminal is equipped with a built-in speakerphone. (The voice terminal can 
				be optioned for a 1-way, listen-only speaker instead.) The Speakerphone capability allows 
				a user to engage in a hands-free conversation with the far-end party. The speakerphone can 
				be turned on or off with the SPEAKER button; can be muted with the MUTE button, and the 
				volume can be raised and lowered with the VOLUME â??â??arrow" button. The Speakerphone feature 
				also allows the user to adjust the speakerphone for optimal performance. By pressing the 
				blue SHIFT button on the set and then the SPEAKER button (if the voice terminal is set for 
				the Speakerphone feature), the user hears a set of tones as the speakerphone performs an 
				acoustic test of the environment. When the tones stop, the speakerphone has finished 
				adjusting itself and is ready for use. The user must reset the speakerphone in any of 
				three instances: whenever the voice terminal is moved to another place (even in the same 
				room), whenever the red light next to the SPEAKER button is fluttering, and, when, in the 
				unlikely event, the speakerphone is making a squealing sound.</p>

			<p><strong>Speaker (Listen-Only) Feature</strong></p>

			<p>Although the 8410 voice terminal is shipped from the factory with the terminal set for the 
				Speakerphone feature, the 8410 voice terminal can be optioned instead for a 1-way, 
				listen-only speaker. If this is the case, use the SPEAKER button on the front of the 
				voice terminal for turning on and off the speaker. The Speaker (listen-only) capability 
				allows a user to engage in a 1-way conversation with the far-end. Specifically, the user 
				can only listen to the far-end. To speak with the far-end, the user must use the handset 
				which turns off the speaker. The Speaker function may also be disabled.</p>

			<p><strong>MUTE button</strong></p>

			<p>The MUTE button is a fixed feature button with a red status light. The MUTE button turns 
				off the microphone of the built-in speakerphone or the handset so that a person can 
				converse with another person in the room without the other party listening in.</p>

			<p><strong>VOLUME Control button</strong></p>

			<p>The 8410 voice terminal has a VOLUME &#8220;arrow&#8221; button on the front of the set. 
				This button has several functions. When the user is using the speakerphone or the 1-way 
				speaker, the VOLUME button controls the volume of the speaker. When the user is on a 
				call using the handset, the VOLUME button controls the handset volume. When the voice 
				terminal is idle, the button controls the volume of the tone ringer. When the user sets 
				the volume for the speaker, speakerphone, handset, or the tone ringer, the display on the 
				8410D voice terminal shows a &#8220;bar array&#8221; that indicates the volume setting.</p>

			<p><strong>TEST button</strong></p>

			<p>When the voice terminal is initially powered up, the green light next to the TEST button 
				flashes if the link with the PBX is not (or not yet) operational. The light changes to 
				steady green when the voice terminal is able to communicate with the 
				<acronym title="Private Branch Exchange">PBX</acronym>. After the voice 
				terminal is powered up, you can press the TEST button to test the lights and the display 
				on your voice terminal.</p>

			<p><strong>Display</strong></p>

			<p>The display on the 8410D set has two lines with 24 characters on each line. The display, 
				along with the softkeys and the display control buttons, can be used to access 12 softkey 
				features (the default softkey features and the alternative softkey features are listed 
				under &#8220;Softkeys&#8221;).</p>

			<p><strong>Display Control Buttons</strong></p>

			<p>These four buttons are labeled Menu, Exit, Prev, and Next. Menu is used to enter Softkey 
				Mode and access the 12 softkey features. Exit is used for exiting a display feature and 
				returning to Normal (call-handling) Mode. Prev and Next can be used to go back and forth 
				through the feature option screens.</p>

			<p><strong>Softkeys</strong></p>

			<p>The four buttons located below the display and labeled with arrows correspond to features 
				listed on the second line of the display screen. (There are four features on each feature 
				option screen.) The user can access any of the 12 features by pressing the softkey below 
				the feature abbreviation.</p>
