  Carlos Montezuma , physician and Indian rights activist, was born near Four Peaks in the Superstition Mountains of Central Arizona about 1866. He was the son of Yavapai Indians, Co-cu-ye-va and Thil-ge-ya, but was captured by Pima Indians and then sold to Carlos Gentile, who gave him his Anglo name. Gentile took him to Washington, DC and then to Chicago, where he received a public school education, and later was awarded a degree from the University of Illinois. He received his medical education from Northwestern University, and established a private practice in Chicago. He founded the journal, <em>Wassaja</em>, in 1916, which addressed issues dealing with Indian rights. He ultimately returned to Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, where he died in 1923.

<br><p><em><strong>Carlos Montezuma</strong></em>, text by Peter Iverson, illustrations by Kim Fujiwara. Austin, TX: Raintree: Steck-Vaughn, 1993.<br>
  Here is a children&#8217;s version of the Yavapai Indian who became and important advocate of Indian rights, earned a medical degree, and founded the Society of American Indians. <strong>Labriola Center E99.Y5 M6533</strong></p>
<br><p><em><strong>Carlos Montezuma and the Changing World of American Indians</strong></em>, by Peter Iverson. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1982.<br>
  Iverson was first to write a full-length biography on this Indian activist. He noted that Montezuma stressed adaptation to the cultural mainstream, an approach that could often stir controversy. He wrote a good deal about his work in the field of water rights. <strong>Labriola Center E99.Y5 M6534</strong></p>

  Here is the most recent of the many publications covering Montezuma&#8217;s life. The author has gone into great detail and has included for the first time, original material held by Leon Summit of New York. The material was ultimately microfilmed as Supplement to the Papers of Carlos Montezuma, M.D. (See below). <strong>Labriola Center R696.M66 S66</strong></p>
<br><p><em><strong>Wassaja: Freedom&#8217;s Signal for the Indians</strong></em>, Carlos Montezuma, Chicago, Ill., 1916-ceased publication in 1922.<br>
  Chicago&#8217;s Newberry Library has the only known original copies of Montezuma&#8217;s periodical, <em>Wassaja</em>. Photocopies of issues of <em>Wassaja</em> are included in both the Iverson Collection (LAB MSS-165, Labriola Center, ASU Libraries) and the Montezuma Collection (CM MSS-60, Archives &amp; Special Collections, ASU Libraries).

<blockquote>
  <p> Montezuma&#8217;s papers remained in the custody of his widow, Mary Keller Montezuma Moore. Following her death in 1956, the record of trusteeship is interrupted. The collection reappeared in an auction house in Huntsville, Alabama in 1971. Ultimately, in 1972, the papers were purchased by the Wisconsin History Foundation who donated them to the State Historical Society of Wisconsin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> The materials contained in the above collection were obtained from over forty repositories throughout the United States, as well as from more than sixty newspapers and periodicals. Every reasonable effort was made to recover Dr. Montezuma&#8217;s statements from the press and periodical literature and to search for lost correspondence. ASUs manuscript collection is mentioned in the guide in addition to those at the Arizona Historical Society, Tucson, and Arizona State Library and Archives, Phoenix,</p>

<p><strong>Supplement to the Papers of Carlos Montezuma, M.D. [Microform]</strong>/ edited by John W. Larner, Jr. Wilmington DE: Scholarly Resources, 2001. Supplement to: to the Papers of Carlos Montezuma. Scholarly Resources, 1983 edition. <strong>FILM 9954, 9 reels, Arizona Collection, Department of Archives &amp; Special Collections, ASU Libraries.</strong></p>
<br><p> <strong>Guide to the Supplement: E99.Y5 P38 2004</strong>. Copies (Pp. 121-129) can be found in both the Labriola and Arizona collections.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> The complex story of how this supplement came to be is contained in pages 121-124 in the guide. According to the editor, John W. Larner, &#8220;it is vital to stress that no complete understanding of Dr. Montezuma and his associates can be gained without consulting this supplement.&#8221; For example, there are 95 letters from the Ojibwe priest, Father Philip B. Gordon, who actively supported Montezuma&#8217;s anti-World War I activities, and nearly all of Montezuma&#8217;s extant office files and case histories, letters from Richard Henry Pratt, and more.</p>
