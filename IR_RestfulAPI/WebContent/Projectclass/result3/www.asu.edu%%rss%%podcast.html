		<h2>Podcasting</h2>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p><strong>Wikipedia, on Podcasting</strong></p>
			<p>Podcasting is a method of publishing files via the Internet, allowing users to subscribe to a feed and receive new files automatically. It became popular in late 2004, intended largely for downloading audio files onto a portable MP3 player. However, listening to podcasts does not require a portable player and it is not traditional "broadcasting" to a mass audience at a fixed time.</p>
		    <p>Podcasting is a portmanteau word, combing "broadcasting" with the name of Apple Computer's iPod audio player (although podcasting was not invented by Apple, nor do podcasts require a portable player or Apple software).</p>
		    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">View the full Wikipedia entry</a> </p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>A podcast is much like an audio magazine subscription: a subscriber receives regular audio programs delivered via the internet, and she or he can listen to them at her or his leisure.</p>
		<p>Podcasts differ from traditional internet audio in two important ways. In the past, listeners have had to either tune in to web radio on a schedule, or they have had to actively download individual files from webpages. Podcasts are more flexible and much easier to get. They can be listened to at any time because a copy is on the listener's computer or portable music player, and they are automatically delivered to subscribers, so no active downloading is required.</p>
		
		<h2>How to Produce a Podcast </h2>
		<p>You have several options when creating a podcast. Your choice should be based upon your production budget, time and experience.</p>
		<h3>Low cost </h3>
		<p>Sign up with <a href="http://audioblogger.com/">Audioblogger</a>. It's free, and the easiest choice in terms of podcast production.</p>
		<h3>Medium cost </h3>
		<blockquote>
          <p><strong>STEP 1: </strong>Create a Podcast Recording<br />
    Create content (speech, music, etc.) using your favorite sound editing program. GarageBand and Audacity are popular options. Save the file as an MP3 and set the ID tag information; this can be done with iTunes (Artist, Genre, Date, Comments, etc.).</p>
          <p><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Upload your Podcast<br />
    You need to be able to upload (sometimes using FTP) your .mp3 file to a host somewhere that will allow downloading of the file using HTTP protocol.<br />
    For example: http://www.asu.edu/public/mypodcast.mp3</p>
          <p><strong>STEP 3:</strong> Post a blog entry or web link that references your Podcast file in an RSS2 enclosure tag<br />
    Add a tag that looks like this to your RSS feed:</p>
          <pre>&lt;enclosure url="http://www.asu.edu/public/mypodcast.mp3" length="5221964" type="audio/mpeg"/&gt;</pre>
          <p> (<em>length is the size of the file in bytes)</em></p>
      </blockquote>
	  
	  <h3>High cost</h3>
