Timeout - Print Jobs Automatically Purged</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">
Print jobs sent to IT-provided printers in the public computing 
sites can only remain in the print queue for <B>two hours</B> 
before being <B>automatically purged</B>. This timeout does not 
apply to other printers (e.g., department printers) nor to jobs 
waiting in the mainframe print queue. The two-hour limit applies 
only when you actually send the job to the printer.
    </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">
After you have sent a print job to the printer, the print job is 
kept on hold in the printer's print queue (not the mainframe print 
queue) and is not actually printed until you pay for the print job 
with your Sun Card. Once payment is made, the print job is released 
and printed. If you wait longer than two hours to make payment, 
the print job is automatically purged from the printer's print queue.
    </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">
A purged print job cannot be recovered. If you need the printed 
output from a purged job, you have to print the file again.
    </FONT></P>

RECOMMENDATION:
<blockquote>
Do not use the "traditional" method of printing an entire job. (The 
traditional method is "typing the destination code (usually UCC1) in 
the destination field of the job on the IOF output screen".) 
This method results in the job being removed from the mainframe print 
queue as soon as it is transferred to the printer's print queue. 
Additionally, this method may result in increased print costs, since 
the JCL and LOG portions of the job are printed, too.
<P>
Rather than print the entire job, you should consider printing only 
selected output files within the job. To do this, use the "S" line 
command on the IOF output screen for the desired job, which will 
display a list of output files within the job. For each output file 
you want to print, use the "P?" line command without changing the 
destination code. "P?" causes another screen to appear for the 
selected output file; then, on this latter screen you should type 
the desired destination code.
<P>
When using the "P?" method, only specific output files are printed 
rather than the entire job, which can save on print costs. It also leaves 
the entire job in the mainframe print queue in case you want to print 
selected portions again.
