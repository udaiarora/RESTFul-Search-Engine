      <h2><strong>ASU nominates three faculty for 'U.S. Professor of the Year' </strong></h2>
      <p>Arizona State University's Center for Learning and Teaching Excellence, with the support of President Michael Crow, has nominated three faculty members for the Council for Advancement and Support of Education's (CASE) U. S. Professor of the Year award. </p>
      <p>The nominees are Allan C. DeSerpa, professor of economics; Amy L. Ostrom, associate professor of marketing; and William J. Boyes, professor of economics. </p>
      <p>The awards, which carry a cash prize, will be presented in late October. Nominees are presented for "an extraordinary dedication to undergraduate teaching," and the winners are judged on four criteria: </p>
      <p>. Impact on and involvement with undergraduate students; <br>
. Scholarly approach to teaching and learning; <br>
. Contributions to undergraduate education in the institution, community and profession; and <br>
. Support from colleagues and current and former undergraduate students. <br>
  Four winners are chosen through a multi-level process. CASE convenes one panel to select approximately 100 semifinalists, then another panel to determine 24 finalists. </p>
      <p>The finalists' nominations are then forwarded to the Carnegie Foundation, which convenes the third and final panel, the Grand Jury. </p>
      <p>The Grand Jury, which usually includes a past U.S. Professor of the Year winner, a student, and education association and campus representatives, selects the U.S. Professors of the Year in four categories, and one winner from each state, provided there are winning entries from each state. </p>
      <p>DeSerpa was nominated for his personal attention to students, and for his commitment to learning along with them. </p>
      <p>"The application form asks for a 'key contribution' made as an undergraduate teacher," DeSerpa wrote. </p>
      <p>"I have no singularly flashy contribution to reference, but suggest that I have spent a career doing the little things that add up to a commitment to my students' education." </p>
      <p>The "little things" include building his law and economics class from scratch; providing a website with material that is thorough and meticulously prepared; preparing relevant and challenging assignments; personally grading each assignment and providing detailed commentary within 24 hours; working with students from classes other than his own; and attending every W.P. Carey School of Business and Barrett Honors College convocation. </p>
      <p>DeSerpa also developed a casebook for his law and economics class that "appears to be destined to be a market success," he said, "but is primarily a labor of love and the fruit of my commitment to teaching." </p>
      <p>Ostrom was nominated for being "an exceptional classroom educator." <br>
  A former student wrote that Ostrom's Consumer Behavior course was 'the most informative, interesting and interactive class I have ever taken." </p>
      <p>"On the first day, Dr. Ostrom took snapshots of every student and asked us to write down our names and a brief summary of our long-term goals. By the end of the week, she knew each of us by name. As the semester continued, she would bring in articles and other materials to students that related to their specific goals." </p>
      <p>The student noted that they were comfortable enough with Ostrom to come early to class and stay after to talk to her. </p>
      <p>Ostrom also is the faculty advisor for the Honors Marketing Association and attends every event and has gotten to know every student and his or her interests. She also finds opportunities for students to network. </p>
      <p>Boyes said that "whereas some teachers might consider their work a vocation (or even avocation), I consider mine as a key part of who I am. My goal is to entice people into thinking, reasoning and questioning with a degree of skepticism. </p>
      <p>"However, while always an enthusiastic and dedicated teacher, I did not fully understand how much teaching mattered until I had a child with learning differences. Although my daughter is highly intelligent, mainstream education has failed her due to her inability to learn in the traditional manner." </p>
      <p>Thanks to his daughter, Boyes said, he has learned to provide "many different approaches to learning, appealing to many learning styles." </p>
      <p>Students in his classes will find audio, visual and textural approaches to learning, and opportunities to work together or alone. </p>
      <p>Boyes takes his teaching beyond the classroom. "Students and student groups are invited to my house for discussion and dinner," he said. "I also provide avenues for students to apply what they have learned in the classroom." </p>
      <p>For more information about the U.S. Professor of the Year Award, contact Judy Grace, (480) 965-2495 or Judy.Grace@asu.edu. </p>
