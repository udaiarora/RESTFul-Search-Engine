      <h2>        Researchers, students explore domestic violence in Arizona, find prosecution
        inconsistent</h2>
      <p>        Making courses relevant to real world situations is one of ASU's primary
        goals. Students in the spring 2003 sections of BIS 302 were presented
        with a research topic that is definitely real-world - domestic violence.        </p>
      <p>The students, under the tutelage of Bachelor of Independent Studies
        Lecturers Kevin Ellsworth, Layne Gneiting and David Wells, conducted
        the first
          ever review of domestic violence prosecutions in Arizona.</p>
      <p>Their findings,
          best described as disturbing, include:</p>
      <p>. Women victims
          are often arrested improperly;<br>
        . Cases are not designated as domestic violence in a consistent manner; <br>
        . Lower conviction rates and lighter sentences are associated with
          cases designated as domestic violence, particularly at the felony level;<br>
        . In Maricopa and Pima Counties, African-American men are three times
          more likely to be arrested for crimes with a domestic violence designation
          than white men. If convicted, their sentences are more severe;<br>
        . Crimes not designated as domestic violence at the time of initial
          arrest have little chance of receiving the designation at a latter
          date, reducing
          the consequences for perpetrators; and,<br>
        . Even when there are convictions, sentences vary widely among the
          counties in Arizona.</p>
      <p>"We found that domestic violence statutes are enforced on
          an uneven basis," says Wells. "Some counties appear to practice an
        'arrest them all and
          let the courts sort it out' policy rather than applying the law. It
        may be something as simple as a lack of information among officers and
        prosecutors
          or it could be a form of bias. Either way, the situation needs to be
          dealt with."</p>
      <p>Wells says students looked at the consistency and differences
          in charges for domestic violence filed from Jan. 1, 2000, through Dec.
          31, 2002.
          The database was based on information about a set of crimes often associated
          with domestic violence. Data includes information on charge, conviction,
          sentencing and whether domestic violence was designated either at the
          time of the arrest or time of disposition. Overall, the students looked
          at a database that included approximately 260,000 charges over two
        years.</p>
      <p>"We
          were able to ascertain differences in how domestic violence prosecution
          is dealt with in Arizona as well as key indicators that suggest substantial
          shortcomings that merit further investigation," Wells says. "It's our
          hope this report will help policy makers focus efforts on improving
        Arizona's response to domestic violence.</p>
      <p>"The laws on domestic violence
          appear to be misapplied in many cases," he says. "Arizona may need
        to do a better job of educating officers
            about domestic violence so that the laws we have are effectively
        enforced."</p>
      <p>The
          course, BIS 302, is a research methods class that works in conjunction
          with local non-profit organizations to conduct field research as a
        teaching method.</p>
