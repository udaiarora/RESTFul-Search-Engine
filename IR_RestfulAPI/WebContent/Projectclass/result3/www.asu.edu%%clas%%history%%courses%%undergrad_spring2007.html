                    </strong><br>
                  The course spans the chronological period from the mid seventeenth century, when piracy began to flourish in the Caribbean to the mid years of the reign of George I, when piracy in the Atlantic was substantially reduced. The first section of the course deals with the earliest pirates and buccaneers on the island of Hispaniola and moves on the Jamaica-based depredations of Henry Morgan, who created havoc in the Spanish Empire over many decades. The middle portion covers some of the legendary English Pirates who not only savaged the Caribbean and the Spanish Main, but threatened maritime commerce northward from the Caribbean along the coast of North America, into the Bahamas, on the west coast of Africa, around Cape Horn, and on to the East Indies. The Final segment is concerned largely with recent scholarly research on pirates by modern historians.<br>

                    <strong>HST 300: THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION (27181)<br>
                    Dr. Laurie Manchester<br>
                    1:40-2:55, MW, ED 328</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    The Russian Revolution ushered into power the world's first totalitarian dictatorship. In terms of both its breadth and its extremity, it is considered by many to be the greatest revolution in history. The Marxist revolutionaries who came to power in October 1917 ruled Soviet Russia until 1991, initiating a Cold War that divided the world into communist and capitalist spheres of influence for most of the 20th century. Domestically the Russian revolution was responsible for the most profound social upheavals to have ever occurred on a single geographic territory within a short period of time. Because of the scope of its influence, the Russian revolution has received a great deal of attention and has been the subject of great controversy. In this course we will read excerpts from the major debates that have erupted between historians over the Revolution, examine how Russian filmmakers and artists have depicted it over the decades, and survey a wide variety of primary sources, including memoirs, diaries, letters, folk art, political treatises and translations of newly released archival documents such as peasant petitions and secret police reports. By examining different interpretations of the Russian Revolution, as well as primary sources, this course will introduce you to historical methodology by encouraging you to challenge the assumptions that other historians make about the event?s origins, dynamics, and significance, while also asking you to develop your own interpretations and analysis through the writing of numerous papers.</p>

                  The (im)migration experience has been a major part of nation building processes and social developments in the U.S., Canada and the various European countries. Immigrants have inserted themselves into the receiving culture and in the process experienced changes as much as they impacted on and changed the culture of their ?new home country.? These processes are shaped by race, class, generation and culture as well as state policies and legal negotiations. In this course we will take in-depth looks at the historical experience of some ethnic groups (i.e. Germans, Italians, Chinese, and Mexicans) in a comparative perspective in order to gain an understanding about the various migration trajectories, group formation and ethnicization processes. We will analyze and discuss primary sources, various historical theories and methods and historiographical developments. In various writing assignments affective historical writing is practiced. <br>

                  <br>
                  This section of HST 300 is focused on the history of the turbulent relations between U.S. and China during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  In the first half of the course students will be asked to read four books that examine U.S. ? China relations from a variety of perspectives.  We begin with how twenty something college students have perceived China (through a short autobiography by Mark Salzman ) and then  look at a volume of translations of writings by Chinese visitors to the U.S.   We then proceed to more weighty subjects such as diplomatic relations and journalist perceptions.  Students will be asked to discuss and write short (3 pp.) papers on each book.  The final assignment is a longer paper on a particular subject of the student?s choosing but of relevance to roller coaster ride of U.S.-China relations.  This will include a short oral presentation of findings to the class.  There is no final exam.  Your professor has just returned from a year in Beijing with a wealth of experiences in U.S.-China relations going back to the 1972  which he would like to share with the class. <br>

                  The major theme of this class is the history of Mexican Americans and their effort to gain equality guaranteed by the United States Constitution.  Students will be exposed to historical research methods and the process of historical inquiry that relates to this topic. The class will pursue a reading agenda that will provide a background on civil rights issues and Mexican Americans and be tested on these materials.  The class which will then embark on analysis and assessment of selected documents and other sources Each committee will be responsible for (a) administering a quiz to the class on selected documents from each chapter, (b) a class activity on these documents, and (c) a media presentation to the class examining two or three of these documents as well as other sources such as photographs, posters, oral interviews, or other forms of material culture.  At the end of the class, each student will turn in a paper that analyzes three documents and other primary sources. <br>

                  <br>
				  This course provides a survey of the cultural reaction to jazz from its emergence as a distinct form of music in the first decades of the twentieth century to its inclusion in the intellectual academy as an accepted form of music in the last decades of the twentieth century. Through the study of texts and music, the course hopes to provide students with a sense of how both jazz and its audiences evolved over the century. While some consideration will be given to jazz as it was experienced in Europe and the rest of the world, the main focus will be on how jazz developed in the United States. Because the concern is to connect jazz styles with other contemporary cultural phenomena, coverage will decline after 1970, by which time most of the styles presently maintained had come into existence.<br>

				  <strong>HST 302- Western Medicine (40393)<br>
					Professor: Monica Green<br>
					3:15-4:30pm, T-TH, ECGG 247</strong><br>
					<br>
Recent scares over anthrax, smallpox, ?emerging diseases? like avian flu, and drug-resistant strains of common microbes have shaken the confidence in modern medicine that reigned throughout most of the 20th century. We are now perhaps better able to appreciate the fact that disease and attempts to relieve suffering from disease have been and will always be part of the human condition. The manner in which individuals have suffered, however, and the ways in which societies have organized medical knowledge and care have always been in flux. This course will trace the many manifestations of the western medical enterprise?that nexus of theory, therapeutics, and social organization?from the time of the ancient Greeks up through the beginning of the 21st century when ?western medicine? is no longer the property of just the West but of the whole world.<br>

We will explain how Jewish mysticism functioned in traditional Jewish society, the degree to which Jewish mysticism was influenced by other mystical traditions (e.g., Sufism), and the impact of Jewish mysticism on Western culture, especially in early-modern Europe.  We will conclude by pondering the popularity of Jewish mysticism in the US today in the context of New Age religions. <br>

                    As the nations of South America  entered the 20th century, cracks in the system of elite-dominated  electoral politics and free trade economics began to appear.&nbsp; With the  onset of the Great Depression, South America,  like much of the world, was faced with the need to try new ideas and new  policies to meet the challenge of economic catastrophe.&nbsp; In much of the  continent, the answer was populism.&nbsp; In South America,  Populism meant a turn to mass politics- incorporating large sectors of the  population into the political system that had been marginal before.&nbsp; Labor  unions and women in particular became much more active in the political life of  their countries.&nbsp; This participation, in turn, affected the economic  policies South American countries pursued.&nbsp; Abandoning classic liberal  strategies of free trade, the governments of the region took on increasingly active  roles in economic development.&nbsp; In doing so, they reduced the importance  of agricultural and mineral exports- and the power of the wealthy men who  controlled these resources- in favor of industry and domestic markets.&nbsp;  While these policies encountered short-term success, in the long term  complications arose that persist to the present day.&nbsp; Since we will be  unable to give proper attention to each nation of

It focuses particularly on legal challenges to civil liberties and civil rights, beginning with the advent and aftermath of the U.S. War for Independence (1775-1783) and proceeding to the "War on Terrorism" President George W. Bush announced in response to assaults on the United States on 11 September 2001. The inquiry focuses especially on issues of national internal security. Concentrating on domestic developments sometimes described as the war at home, the course seeks perspective on the impact U.S. engagement in war has had on public policies and practices affecting constitutional rights and civil liberties that the U.S. Supreme Court in Mills v. Rogers, 457 U.S. 291, 300 (1982), called ?federally protected liberty interests?. The core readings are in Thomas J.

                    This course is designed as a writing seminar to fulfill the requirement of a senior seminar for the major in history.  The class begins with a careful reading of Victor Hugo?s monumental novel, Les Misérables covering the tumultuous years of the first half of nineteenth-century France.  Subsequent reading involves historical sources that cover some of the themes in French history that the novel describes, such as: the life and times of Victor Hugo, the Napoleonic Wars, the Revolutions of 1830, students in Paris, abandoned children, unwed mothers, crime, prisons, religion, urban development, and issues related to gender and poverty in the nineteenth century. It is assumed that students have no prior in-depth knowledge of French history and no reading knowledge of  French, although both would be beneficial. <br>

                  This seminar focuses on the era of revolution, reform, and reaction which characterized Russia from the great Reforms of the 1860?s through Stalin?s Great Terror of the 1930?s. In October 1917, Bolshevik intellectuals and workers staged a revolution which ushered in the first communist state, a revolutionary regime which lasted until 1991 and engaged in a tense cold war with the West which divided the world. Yet there were revolutions and rebellions previous to October, as well as attempts by the Tsarist autocratic state to reform itself. Why did these alternatives to communism fail? Why did communism triumph in Russia? How much of an aberration from original Bolshevism was Stalinism? Was the October revolution the culmination of a Russian revolutionary movement with primarily indigenous origins, or should it be seen as the importation of a foreign ideology, that of Marxism, to Russia? What were the motivations of Russia?s revolutionaries? Did the peasant masses and workers share their goals, and if so, once Stalin consolidated power in 1928, did they continue to share their goals? What about other social groups? We will discuss these issues, and will also explore how legitimate cold war assumptions about Russia are as well as how native Russians view this era. By reading together different types of translated primary documents written by revolutionaries and Russian citizens (including those recently released from the archives), utilizing theoretical works to analyze such documents, and studying recent and classic historiographical debates and interpretations of this era, students will acquire the skills to research and write their senior research seminar paper on any topic of their choice connected with this era in Russian history. In addition, students will be required to give several extended oral presentations over the course of the semester, write book reviews on a scholarly monograph they are employing for their research papers, write a short paper on a historiographical debate, hand in a rough draft, preliminary bibliography and prospectus of their final paper, and participate actively during each class meeting. This class does not employ any of the texts assigned for HST 300: The Russian Revolution, and students who have taken that course are encouraged to sign up for this seminar, as are all students interested in Russia and/or revolutionary eras.</p>

                    This seminar will investigate ?Watergate,? the term given to a whole host of illegal and questionable legal practices in which the Nixon administration engaged from its inception in January, 1969 until the break-in at the Watergate Apartments on June 17, 1972 -- and the cover-up by President Nixon and his associates that occurred afterwards, until his resignation on August 8, 1974.  Many Americans think of Watergate as the break-in and the subsequent cover-up, but it applies to a much broader range of activities that, some asserted, would have undermined American democracy irreparably if they had gone undiscovered.<br>
                    <br>
                    Using Watergate as the main theme, students will be asked to acquire and use state-of-the-art historical research techniques to investigate such topics as:<br>
                    <br>
                    o Was Watergate unique? To what extent did previous presidents engage in similar practices?<br>
                    o What was the CIA?s role in Watergate? the FBI?s?<br>
                    o What was the role of the press in uncovering Watergate?<br>
                    o What was the role of Congress in uncovering Watergate?<br>
                    o What was the role of the federal judiciary in uncovering Watergate?<br>
                    o What was the role of the Supreme Court in uncovering Watergate?<br>
                    o What was the perspective of individual participants in Watergate: Richard Nixon, Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, Gordon Liddy, John Dean, Charles Colson and others?<br>
                    o What were the short- and long-term impacts of Watergate?<br>
                    <br>
                    Our main text for the course will be Keith W. Olsen?s _Watergate: The Presidential Scandal That Shook America_ (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2003), and we will also examine the Washington Post?s WWW site on Watergate.<br>
                    <br>
                    This course should be seen as both content- and method-driven.  Thus, the course will focus on the content of the topic -- Watergate -- and the newer historical methods, beyond those previously learned by students, to investigate that topic in more depth.  In writing the 15-20 page paper that will be the major product of the course, students will be expected to incorporate both the new knowledge and the new techniques that they have learned, in part through the instructor?s guide entitled ?The Internet, the Electronic Media, and Historical Research,? at http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/History300/Resources.htm . <br>

                    This course deals with  urbanization in the American Southwest since 1930s &ndash; the area and era of greatest urban  development in the nation. <br>
More specifically, it takes  as a case study the Phoenix  metropolitan area, the nation&rsquo;s 5th largest city and its 12th largest  metropolitan area. Some elements of this area are unique, but other cities  throughout the West also displayed huge population mobility, high tech economy,  links with the &quot;military-industrial complex,&quot; political dynamics, new  types of suburban development, debates over transportation, problems of  pollution and congestion, as well as the expansion of tourism and entertainment  (including sports). The Phoenix  focus also has practical benefits, since the rich resources of this area make  it possible to pick from a wide range of research topics.</p>
                <p>This writing intensive  course will start by examining the broad context of Southwestern urban  development and then turn to the Phoenix  case. The primary aim of this course is to enable students to develop research  and writing skills, and to expand our knowledge of this subject. Thus, this  course covers how to design a research project, what sources are available, and  how to complete such a study. Class time will include a range of features such  as discussions of resources by local specialists, guest&rsquo;s presentations by  people involved in the city&rsquo;s history, and trips to sites within the city.  Students will design a draft project, revise the project based on suggestions  from the instructor and other students, make oral progress reports, consult  individually with the instructor, and present a final paper.</p>

                    This course is about women, gender, sexuality, work, class and  power in Africa. We will explore the various  forces affecting the lives of women in Africa from the beginnings of Islam in Africa until the present time. We will investigate three  important themes:</p>
                <ul type="square">
                  <li>The traditional status of women in Africa before they became &ldquo;Islamized&rdquo;. </li>
                  <li>How women's fate and function changed with       Islam and later with colonial and postcolonial       &quot;modernity&quot;.&nbsp; </li>
                  <li>The modern debate about women status in the       African societies influenced by Islam and feminist anthropology. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will begin with a brief introduction to women in Africa and Islam and then we will dispel the  misconceptions and stereotypes about African women and decode the stories  collected by anthropologists and others.&nbsp; We will study to understand the  economic power of women, their interactions with men, their roles in  reproduction and in the production of local culture, the transmission of  religious beliefs, and their role in the transmission of collective memory.  &nbsp;We will study the changes in women's condition in Islam concerning work,  education, economic activity, marriage, divorce, sexuality and political  action.&nbsp; The second turning point in history is the colonial legacy in Africa, did colonialism lower living standards of women  or did it advance women's emancipation as it is claimed in the colonial  writing? <br>
                  To avoid the risk of unjust generalization we will examine  regional case studies, focusing on North and West Africa.  We will focus on four countries: two Arabized and Islamized countries Morocco and Egypt  and two Islamized countries Senegal  and Nigeria.</p>
                Students  will analyze the role of women in these various societies based on their  readings. From reading the assigned books and novels students will draw rich  portraits about women, gender and sexuality in the African societies influenced  by Islam.

Students will complete a 20-page (minimum) original research paper based on a selected topic of their choice that explores Indigenous activism in contemporary Indigenous struggles. In designing and implementing a research project, students will develop skills in selecting primary and secondary sources, creating a thesis, and confronting the ethical implications in researching topics that may affect living peoples.  In addition, students will develop a critical understanding of the theoretical debates over legitimate source materials (such as oral vs. written history) and the frameworks in which Indigenous people and their actions may be interpreted. <br>

                    History 498   English Travelers, 1600-1800.  This senior seminar?s major project is a 5,000-6,000 word paper based on primary and secondary evidence.  Readings will include information on English society and the status of the traveler in the social structure, the culture of the place visited, and how to write history papers.   How travelers defined themselves and how they defined different peoples and lands will be questions that will be raised.  Most of the journals or letters will have been published and questions will be asked about why they were published. Students will learn how to cite material and how to compile bibliographies, statements of purpose, and outlines.  For their papers, they will select one or more English travelers who went to any contemporary country for any reason between 1600 and 1800.  The travelers could be merchants, diplomats, soldiers, tourists, or explorers, for example.  Class attendance is required and mandatory. <br>

                    This seminar examines women?s direct involvement in warfare in modern European history, focusing especially on the 19th and 20th centuries.  However, students may research European contexts in the 17th and 18th centuries if more appropriate for their studies.  In particular, students will question and assess the traditional gendered view about the dichotomy between battlefront/homefront.  The course will pay particular attention to ?conventional? warfare in Europe.  However, discussions about European revolutionary moments, independence movements, and terrorism will also be included.  While they develop their own research projects representing the capstone of their degrees at ASU, students will read memoirs, other translated primary documents, select secondary sources about the subjects at hand, and study relevant historiographical issues.  By doing so, students will acquire the skills to research and write their 20-25 page senior research seminar paper (including footnotes, bibliography, etc.) on a topic of their choice associated with the course.  Topics can include women?s involvement in a particular component of warfare (medical service, armed battlefront experience, ?home front? production of weapons, etc.), examined in one context or comparatively.  They may also choose to focus on an individual, a national context, a particular war, or specific time frame.  All research must engage at least one first-person account as a significant, though not singular, component of the final paper.<br>

				  <strong>HST 498- Democracy- Latin American (11458)<br>
					Professor: Lynn Stoner <br>
					TTH, 10:40-11:55 COOR 4401<br>
					</strong><br>
					From the perspective of most U.S. citizens, Latin American democracy has rarely been achieved in terms we understand. Elections, political stability, and the absence of dictators and military coups do not characterize Latin American power agreements. Coups d?etats, repression, and revolutions are more the norm. From the end of the nineteenth century to present, the United States has involved itself in the domestic politics of Latin American nations from Panama northward, involvements that include political advice, diplomatic pressure, favorable or unfavorable economic agreements, invasions, and blockades, all in the name of democracy. Latin Americans have an entirely different perspective about their struggles for democracy. Latin American governments still adhere to colonial policies, with strong militaries that assume power, and little tolerance for opposing views. Economic development has favored the few and disadvantaged the majority, leaving little recourse for those espousing democracy but revolution. Most often these revolutions are nationalist and not communist as the United States alleges.<br><br>
      This course will explore the divergence of views about Latin American democracy through preliminary readings and a research paper. By the third week in the semester, students will have selected a paper topic and will begin researching library holdings for sources. Seminar meetings consist of discussion sessions at which students will examine and analyze assigned readings. The meetings will also focus on the methods of identifying research topics, searching for sources, formulating a thesis, using sources accurately, outlining a paper, and writing. Three class sessions will be devoted to individual consultations with the professor. Students are expected to participate in every phase of the course. Your presence at each seminar and in individual tutorials is required. <br><br>
      The pace of the course has been designed to insure that you can complete all requirements by the end of the term. Do not overlook any step and do not fall behind. This is a demanding course and many of the elements will be new to you. The course requirements reflect my insistence that you participate every week.<br>
