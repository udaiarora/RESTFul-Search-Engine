				  <p>Probationary evaluations are carried out in the second and fourth years

according to the Schedule of Personnel Actions, which is prepared and

distributed to all academic professionals by the Assistant Dean for Personnel

at the beginning of each fiscal year. Refer to the <a

href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd506-08.html">ACD 506-08</a>, for

general procedures for Probationary Evaluations of Academic Professionals.</p>



<br>
<p>Assistant academic professionals have a probationary period of no more than

six years. Associate academic professionals, hired without continuing

appointment, have a probationary period of no more than four years. See <a

href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd506-02.html">ACD 506-02</a> and <a

href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd506-03.html">ACD 506-03</a>. for

extension of normal probationary term.</p>



 <br> <p>Retention as an assistant academic professional requires evidence of successful 

    job performance and activity or achievement in other Criteria indicating progress 

    toward continuing appointment as the probationary period progresses. See <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/library/lc/handbook/E2.html"><i>Librarians' 

    Handbook</i>, E.2</a>, Criteria for Retention, Continuing Appointment, and 

    Promotion. </p>

    for Academic Personnel Action form to the primary evaluators of the 2nd and 

    4th year probationary librarians.</p><br>

revises it as necessary in consultation with the primary evaluator. Adds a copy
    
of the current job description to the packet. (See <a

<h3>NOTIFICATION</h3>

<br>

  <p>Procedures for the notification of academic professionals 

    are outlined in <a

href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd506-10.html">ACD 506-10</a>. </p>

<br>

<h3>CONDITIONAL RETENTION</h3>

<br>

<p>Conditional retention is an optional recommendation

for a probationary academic professional who is not making satisfactory

progress toward continuing appointment. The University Librarian and Dean of

the University Libraries must notify the academic professional of the

conditional status and provide a written statement of conditions that must be

met to warrant a regular contract the following year. These conditions should

be developed by the primary evaluator and the Associate Dean when appropriate.

The specific program for improvements and/or accomplishments, including a

timetable, is to be developed by the primary evaluator and the academic

professional. See <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd506-10.html">ACD

506-10</a>.</p>
