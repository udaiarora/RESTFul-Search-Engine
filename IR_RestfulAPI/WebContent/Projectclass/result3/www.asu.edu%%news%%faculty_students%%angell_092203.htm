        C. Austen Angell, (480) 965-7217, caa@asu.edu </p>
      <h2>ASU professor receives top chemistry society honor</h2>
      <p>The American Chemical Society (ACS) will honor C. Austen
        Angell, an ASU Regents professor of chemistry and biochemistry, for his
      pioneering work in the area of supercooled liquids. </p>
      <p>ACS will give Angell the 2004 Hildebrand Award in Theoretical and Experimental
        Chemistry of Liquids for "pioneering experimental studies of supercooled
        and glassy water, and for introduction of seminal ideas of liquid fragility,
        liquid and vitreous polyamorphism, and non-aqueous electrolytes." Angell
        will be presented with the award in March2004, at ACS's spring meeting
        in Anaheim, Calif. </p>
      <p>"I am very proud of this honor and it's a great recognition not only
        of my personal input in this area, but of a great series of students
        and post-doctoral co-workers over the years," Angell said. "The people
        I have worked with deserve a lot of the credit."</p>
      <p>Angell's work has explored the behavior of liquids that only freeze
        when they are cooled very slowly. Even water doesn't become ice until
        it reaches -40 C (-27 F), when it is very clean. Some of his best-known
        work involves experiments on water and its solutions in this low-temperature,
        supercooled liquid domain. </p>
      <p>"We have been studying water, perhaps the most important liquid in the
        world, under conditions that people don't usually imagine it existing,"
        Angell explained. "We find out how strange water is at these low temperatures."</p>
      <p>For example, he said, some liquids never crystallize as they cool but
        instead form transparent glasses. When these liquids turn into their
        glassy states, a sharp change in properties called the "glass transition"
        occurs. Angell has worked his entire career to properly understand that
        transition. </p>
      <p>"One common feature of all liquids when they are supercooled, is they
        turn into glasses," he said. "We study the glasses because of all the
        uses to which they can be put. For instance, sugar glasses are now being
        used by the pharmaceutical industry to preserve drugs. We helped stimulate
        that development with a 1989 paper co-authored by Jenny Green." The paper
        has been cited more than 200 times in other biological and pharmaceutical
        work.</p>
      <p>Angell also studies the behavior of a wide range of other liquids, like
        molten salts and liquid metals, as they are put into supercooled and
        glassy states. He also has studied electrolytes, and his work in this
        area has led to a number of patents related to lithium batteries. One
        of these electrolytes is now considered the best choice for the next
        generation power supply for laptop computers and the new 42-volt auto
        starter motor batteries. </p>
      <p>But his work on glass forming liquids has long been a personal interest,
        dating back to 1964 when most other scientists thought of them as an
        esoteric area of research. Today, Angell says, supercooled liquids are
        the focus of many international scientific teams of chemists and physicists
        alike.</p>
      <p>"The glass transition is now recognized as one of the outstanding, unsolved
        problems in condensed matter physics," Angell says. "To me, it's a continuing
        source of fascination."</p>
      <p>Angell has worked with many researchers including George Wolf, Stuart
        Lindsay and John Holloway, all faculty members of Arizona State University,
        turning out significant scientific advances in the understanding of liquids
        and glasses.</p>
