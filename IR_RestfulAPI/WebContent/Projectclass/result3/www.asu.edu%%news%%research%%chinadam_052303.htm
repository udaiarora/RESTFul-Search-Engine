      <h2>Giant dam is a problem for the environment but an opportunity for ecoscience </h2>
      <p>China's Three Gorges Dam, the largest dam project ever, has been seen
        by ecologists as an environmental disaster in the making. With construction
        scheduled to be completed later this year, little can be done to stop
        it, but some Chinese and American ecologists point out that the dark
        cloud of the environmental consequences does have a silver lining - an
        unprecedented opportunity to do environmental science.</p>
      <p>In an article forthcoming in the May 23 issue of Science, Arizona State
        University landscape ecologist Jianguo Wu and co-authors Jianhui Huang,
        Xingguo Han, Zongqiang Xie and Xianming Gao, all from the Institute of
        Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, argue that the project represents
        an opportunity to conduct arguably the largest and most complete experiment
        ever run on the effects of habitat fragmentation, an ecological condition
        that affects environments across the globe through the process of ongoing
        human development.</p>
      <p>Habitat fragmentation occurs when human development or some other force
        eliminates large areas continuous natural habitat, leaving habitat "islands"
        where remaining species of plants and animals are left in a limited space,
        isolated from other similar communities and habitats. Examples of the
        condition are wild spaces (parks or undeveloped lots) that are surrounded
        by urban development, remnant patches of wilderness that are left when
        a forest is cleared for farming, or elevated terrestrial habitats that
        suddenly become scattered islands when a landscape is flooded. While
        some plant and animal species initially remain on the habitat fragments,
        the long-term stability of the isolated ecosystems is in question.</p>
      <p> In the case of Three Gorges Dam, the reservoir will cover 1080 square
        kilometers of ecologically rich landscape, leaving several dozen to perhaps
        more than 100 mountaintops as islands. </p>
      <p>"Habitat fragmentation is a pervasive global problem that has generally
        been recognized as the primary cause of the loss of biodiversity," said
        Wu, "yet its underlying processes and mechanisms remain poorly understood."</p>
      <p>Wu argues that because of the dam's size, the biological richness of
        the area, and the possibility of doing thorough before-and-after surveys
        and studies, the Three Gorges Dam Project would allow the best opportunity
        to date to study habitat fragmentation, in process and on a full landscape
        scale. At issue is experimental verification of the fine points of Hierarchical
        Patch Dynamics, an ecological theory that inter-relates specific plant
        and animal populations, communities and habitats in a complex and dynamic
        linkages over diverse landscapes. </p>
      <p>"Historically, we have had only a few remarkable natural large-scale
        ecological experiments with habitat fragmentation," he said. "It is clear
        that some of the most valuable knowledge of the ecological consequences
        of habitat fragmentation have been gained by this kind of study. With
        Three Gorges Dam, we will be able to learn vastly more."</p>
      <p>Though similar studies have been done at Gatun Lake in Panama and Lake
        Guri in Venezuela, no previous study of the effects of habitat fragmentation
        has had the advantage of the kind of "planned experiment" that Three
        Gorges Dam represents. Because of the groundwork laid by previous research,
        the existence of a developed theory to guide the current research and
        the opportunity to fully study the landscape before it is changed, Three
        Gorges Dam will allow the thorough testing and refinement of key hypotheses
        in conservation biology and landscape ecology.</p>
      <p>The key issues for the proposed experiment at the moment are time -
        the dam will be completed later this year and the six-year process of
        filling will begin - and the need to quickly marshal a team of scientists
        and a large set of resources from both China and the international community.</p>
      <p>"A lot of Chinese ecologists are looking forward to some sort of international
        collaboration," said Wu "The Chinese government, including the Academy
        of Sciences, the Natural Science Foundation, and some other agencies
        have already supported some small projects, but I think it is extremely
        important to have an international collaborative team to really carry
        this forward.</p>
      <p>"International expertise and funding, combined with existing Chinese
        resources will make this a very productive project for ecology. I don't
        think we could find any other place with this opportunity where we would
        find all these human resources and support from all angles to do such
        a gigantic experiment," he said.</p>
      <p>Though much will be lost in the process, the knowledge that can be gained
        from the research may ultimately help humanity better preserve the global
        biosphere, Wu notes. "The world's largest dam is not only a demonstration
        of the mighty power of humanity; it can and should become a unique and
        rich source of information for understanding and conserving biodiversity
        and ecosystem services," he said.</p>
