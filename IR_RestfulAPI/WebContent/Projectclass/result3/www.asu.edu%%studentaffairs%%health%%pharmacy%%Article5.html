          Student Health and Wellness Center pharmacies are, for the most part, 
          small in size and serve specific, generally healthy patient populations. 
          Most operate under some type of formulary. Many patients and even providers 
          have negative feelings towards formularies resulting from bad experiences 
          with restrictive managed care formularies. This usually is a result 
          of having perceived that our access to care was being limited. Many 
          of these managed care organizations, such as a hospital or HMO, base 
          their formulary decisions on pharmacoeconomic research. Student Health 
          formularies will not and should not mirror those of nearby managed care 
          organizations. This does not mean that Student Health formularies should 
          not be built upon sound pharmacoeconomic principles. Formularies, used 
          properly, are useful tools to manage costs and quality in any setting. 
          Good formulary design and management can increase clinician efficiency, 
          reduce costs, maximize therapeutic benefits, reduce workloads and most 
          importantly, improve patient health. Both patients and providers will 
          accept a well-managed formulary, enmeshed in responsible and caring 
          policies. Credibility is very important. If your committee makes well 
          reasoned and well-justified choices, then your formulary will be immune 
          to all but positive criticism. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The P&amp;T Committee<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A formulary 
          is normally designed and maintained by a Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) 
          Committee. A representative P&amp;T committee is essential for good 
          formulary management and acceptance. Choosing committee members that 
          are interested and that will aggressively support their personal point 
          of view makes for a healthy P&amp;T committee. Physicians, pharmacists 
          and nurses should be well represented. The idea of randomly assigning 
          personnel from each Student Health department does not result in a representative 
          committee. The result is too many disinterested, unproductive members 
          and a few interested members who can control the direction of the committee.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The committee should 
          be selected with input from the chairperson. Various prescriber types 
          should have a representative on the committee. For example, an acute 
          care physician, a GYN nurse practitioner, a general medicine clinician, 
          and a psychiatrist might be your prescribers appointed to the P&amp;T 
          committee. In any case, an effort should be made to involve clinicians 
          with different perspectives on prescribing. Be sure to represent nursing 
          on a P&amp;T committee. Their input has often proven to be highly relevant 
          and representative of a unique clinical perspective. Pharmacist involvement 
          is essential. For our Student Health center we also include a health 
          educator. If possible, a dedicated, knowledgeable secretary is highly 
          desirable.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pharmacy &amp; 
          Therapeutics Committee is responsible for three essential areas of Student 
          Health operation: Formulary Management, Drug Utilization Review (DUR) 
          and Policy and Procedure (P&amp;P) maintenance as pertains to pharmaceuticals. 
          The previous sentence is a mission statement for a P&amp;T committee. 
          Your mission statement does not need to be complex. Methodology, membership, 
          motivation and procedures can be outlined elsewhere. Be sure your mission 
          statement reflects what the committee has been chartered to accomplish. 
          In some situations the P&amp;T committee may only influence P&amp;P 
          through an advisory capacity.</font></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Formulary Design<br>
          </font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A formulary 
          is a tool, which should be designed to serve the needs of its users. 
          Physicians and other prescribers, patients, pharmacists, nurses and, 
          of course, budget administrators are all concerned that the formulary 
          serve their needs. A well designed formulary will satisfy all these 
          needs, and be readily accepted, if it has been created with the involvement 
          of the interested parties and implemented in a forthright manner.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are several 
          things to consider when designing or modifying a formulary:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. <i>Patient population</i>. 
          In college health, the patient population tends towards young and healthy 
          individuals. This group may, however, have tremendous demands for services 
          and medications for contraception, STD prevention and treatment, mental 
          health and various other areas. Also, many campuses have a large international 
          population with needs that may differ from indigenous students.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. <i>Physician 
          preference/expertise</i>. Physicians and other prescribers are individuals 
          that tend to make therapeutic selections based on prior experience and 
          acquired knowledge. Many times this familiarity is desired in a clinical 
          setting and should be supported by P&amp;T whenever reasonable. However, 
          they should be willing to listen and learn when new, superior products 
          become available. Communication with the medical staff and the Continuing 
          Medical Education (CME) committee is important. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. <i>Allied health 
          care provider preferences</i>. Nurses, pharmacists and other health 
          care providers often have pertinent information based on their own perspectives. 
          Nurses often point out differences in dosage forms or delivery systems 
          that impact ease of use and therefore man-hours. Pharmacists provide 
          a good understanding of therapeutic equivalencies and can provide usage 
          data for retrospective drug studies. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. <i>Drug Utilization 
          Evaluation</i>. Whenever possible, drugs being considered for formulary 
          status can be compared to other treatment choices available. A brief 
          comparative study, based on package inserts, drug monographs and current 
          pricing data, should be prepared and distributed to committee members 
          before the next scheduled meeting. This will allow all participants 
          to prepare for the issues to be discussed. Samples of this type of "handout" 
          can be seen in Exhibits 1 and 2. These particular studies were authored 
          by Russell Newman a Pharm. D. candidate from the University of Arizona 
          College of Pharmacy on a site rotation. Drug monographs, package inserts 
          and other informational materials are also appropriate.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. <i>Drug Utilization 
          Review</i>. Retrospective studies of drug use can be very helpful when 
          reviewing the status of drugs currently on the formulary. Sometimes 
          a simple utilization report from the pharmacy is all that is needed 
          to show that a drug no longer warrants a place on the formulary. If 
          a drug shows little or no movement over a significant amount of time 
          it lacks the <i>velocity </i>that is desired for most formulary products. 
          Several drugs with similar indications may also be reviewed for cost 
          effectiveness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. <i>Pricing</i>. 
          The cost of the drug being considered or reviewed can be an important 
          factor. Again, the pharmacist can be an important source of information, 
          providing current costs and notification of price changes to the committee. 
          The cost of a drug is significant when considering cost-effectiveness, 
          especially when drug supply costs have been rising at an annual rate 
          ranging from 9% to 20%. Many Student Health centers are eligible for 
          various preferred pricing contracts either as state institutions and/or 
          teaching facilities. Oral contraceptives are one category where institutional 
          pricing can have a profound impact on product selection.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Drug Utilization 
          Review (DUR)<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 
          to the DURs conducted for formulary modification, these studies can 
          be helpful to document prescribing habits. This information can be used 
          to assist other departments that wish to determine if their programs 
          are effective in changing behaviors. For example, reports can be created 
          that show last months nursing in-service on self-care led to an increase 
          in triage nurse recommended non-prescription medication. Pharmacy software 
          that supports this function is helpful and is available with most prescription 
          processing applications.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Cost Effectiveness 
          Studies<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When performing 
          DUE or DUR you will often encounter or create cost effectiveness studies. 
          These studies attempt to measure the relative cost effectiveness of 
          a particular medication. Be sure to pay close attention to the type 
          of study that you are looking at, as there are degrees of pertinence 
          depending on the type of study. The attached exhibits are rudimentary 
          cost effectiveness studies that look merely at cost per dose or container. 
          Some studies will examine cost per treatment. The preferred study is 
          one that determines cost per outcome. We want to know the best drug 
          based on the cost for a successful outcome with minimal adverse effects 
          and/or subsequent clinician visits. We find looking at cost per treatment 
          to be inadequate. </font></p>

          service Policy and Procedure manual section regarding pharmaceuticals 
          and pharmacy services. Once again the pharmacist can alert the committee 
          to changes in procedure necessitated by external forces that require 
          changes in the P&amp;P manual. Physicians and nurses will require P&amp;P 
          changes periodically due to staffing changes, procedural modifications 
          and alterations in services provided. The committee should periodically 
          review the pharmacy section of the manual to make necessary changes 
          or additions. This routine review will save much time when an accreditation 
          survey is approaching.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two policies that 
          have a dramatic effect on pharmacy services are related by result. One 
          policy provides the pharmacy with the ability to fill prescriptions 
          from providers not affiliated with the Student Health service. These 
          providers, of course, have no knowledge of the formulary. The second 
          policy, then, allows the pharmacy to order products not on the formulary. 
          It is best to order only stock sizes that can be dispensed as a unit 
          for a specific prescription. In other words, you don&#8217;t want any "leftovers" 
          in the pharmacy inventory. This policy also gives the Student Health 
          staff more flexibility, and allows the pharmacy to order infrequently 
          prescribed or expensive medications on an "as needed" basis. For most 
          pharmacies, this will only delay initiation of treatment by one day. 
          These two policies can dramatically increase the level of service of 
          a Student Health pharmacy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All policies are 
          subject to approval of the Management Team, the governing body, administrative 
          committee or director depending on your organization.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Departmental 
          Indicators<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Continual 
          monitoring and periodic reporting of selected information can be very 
          helpful to the P&amp;T committee. These <i>indicators </i>can be established 
          within departments to monitor various clinical or therapeutic activities. 
          In our pharmacy, for example, we have monitored the prescribing of the 
          "morning after pill (MAP)," the number of pharmacy interventions and, 
          in cooperation with one of our asthma team clinicians, established an 
          asthma indicator. The MAP indicator not only monitors the count of these 
          prescriptions but also identifies repeat patients who are then offered 
          additional counseling on their next visit. Pharmacy interventions are 
          tracked to document pharmacist involvement in preventing drug interactions, 
          patient allergies or inappropriate dosages or therapies. This indicator 
          has resulted in specific CME programs being offered to prescribers as 
          well as changes to the formulary. Our asthma indicator is a measure 
          obtained by dividing the number of bronchodilator inhalers dispensed 
          by the number of anti-inflammatory inhalers dispensed. This dividend, 
          when viewed over time, has given us some indication of the impact of 
          asthma treatment and adherence to established treatment guidelines at 
          our Student Health center. Other indicators can be created to fit your 
          particular needs. These indicators are reported to P&amp;T and will 
          often trigger involvement with other committees or departments.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Interactivity<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The P&amp;T 
          committee should be a highly interactive element of a Student Health 
          Center. P&amp;T provides information to administration, clinicians, 
          nurses, other staff and patients. P&amp;T often interacts with other 
          committees, such as Quality Assurance (QA), Continuing Medical Education 
          (CME) and occasionally Plant Safety/Risk Management. Input from the 
          Student Health Advisory Committee (SHAC) should also be encouraged and 
          considered. This group is well suited to present the needs of your patient 
          population from their own perspective. P&amp;T minutes should be distributed 
          to all department heads, administrators and other interested parties. 
          It is important to make every effort to notify all prescribers, including 
          contracted consultants, of any and all formulary changes. We make use 
          of a pharmacy newsletter to alert clinicians to formulary changes, usage 
          velocities by categories and general prescribing information pertinent 
          to our student health center. Remember too, that P&amp;T activities 
          often have implications for Quality Assurance, Risk Management, Continuing 
          Medical Education, Practice Guidelines or other committees or groups 
          with similar functions. Our formulary is available at our web site for 
          added convenience.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Certain committee 
          members should serve as liaisons with their respective sections or departments. 
          Every effort should be made to advise other committees and departments 
          of the activities of the P&amp;T committee. Many changes may appear 
          to affect only a limited area, but will actually have a ripple effect 
          throughout the facility. Communication will prevent misunderstandings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Chairperson Considerations<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Director 
          of Student Health and Wellness Center usually designates the chairperson 
          of the P&amp;T committee. Often, a departing chairperson will make a 
          recommendation for a successor to the Director. Being a committee chairperson 
          is sometimes a somewhat thankless task and often requires dedication 
          above and beyond their job classification. There is a lot of work to 
          do. In any case, the P&amp;T chairperson should be committed, not to 
          an asylum, but to managing an effective, reasonable and credible committee.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The chairperson 
          should be a person unafraid to delegate. He or she shouldn&#8217;t hesitate 
          to assign research projects to appropriate committee members. Be sure 
          to allow sufficient time to accomplish assignments. It is best to get 
          the agenda and any related readings to members a least one week before 
          the scheduled meeting. Don&#8217;t forget to appoint liaisons to disseminate 
          information to other groups. Encourage input from all members and make 
          sure that the entire staff knows that they can make a formulary modification 
          request. There are times when it is appropriate for a requester to be 
          invited to the P&amp;T meeting to support his or her request.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Drug Displays<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
          way to get the clinical staff involved in drug selection is to schedule 
          "drug displays." Pharmaceutical representatives can arrange a room in 
          your facility to display their products. This avoids the problem of 
          drug reps waiting in the hallways with patients, hoping to impose on 
          the clinician&#8217;s time "between patients." We schedule a drug display 
          for at least two hours, usually 8:00 A.M. to 10:30 A.M. or 11:00 A.M. 
          to 1:30 P.M. These time slots allow the prescribers time to learn about 
          new products at their convenience. It is always made clear that these 
          drug displays are for all staff and we have been very successful with 
          this program.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The New Formulary<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A new 
          formulary can be designed using these principles and methods. Many student 
          health centers initiating a formulary can obtain copies of similarly 
          sized schools&#8217; formularies for review and revision. If a formulary is 
          being created for an existing health center, the P&amp;T committee should 
          perform a comprehensive chart review to ascertain the prescribing preferences 
          of its medical staff. A new formulary will often be much like a lump 
          of clay, unappealing to most observers, but ready to be molded and shaped 
          to fit the needs of the facility it serves. It is the challenge of the 
          P&amp;T committee to create a work of art from that lump of clay. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Conclusion<br>
          </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Your formulary 
          can be a helpful tool for the entire staff if designed thoughtfully 
          by credible means. Your Student Health center&#8217;s P&amp;T committee is 
          the entity responsible for designing and maintaining the formulary. 
          Make sure it is representative of the clinical staff. Each student health 
          center is different and may need to adapt this model to suit their needs 
          and/or practice guidelines. Make every effort to get those most affected 
          by the formulary involved in its creation and maintenance. Remember 
          to consider the concerns of your patient population and desired therapeutic 
          outcomes. Many drugs can be kept off the formulary if they lack the 
          velocity for inclusion but can be ordered (usually with only a one-day 
          wait) on an as needed basis. Try to develop a regular review schedule 
          that covers all formulary areas so the committee will be proactive rather 
          than reactive. With a little work and plenty of diligence a formulary 
          can be friendly. More importantly, the formulary and the process of 
          maintaining it can result in improved health intervention outcomes.</font></p>
