        <p><strong>Regents' and President's Professors </strong></p>
        <p>George Poste   is among six ASU faculty members who have been awarded Regents Professor appointments for 2006. Regents&rsquo; Professors are marked by excellence in teaching, exceptional achievements in research or other creative activities, and national and international distinction in their fields. Named by the Arizona Board of Regents, they serve as advisers to the university president and take on a broader role as consultants and teachers throughout the university.</p>
        <p> The members of this year's Regents' Professor class are: <a href="../200602/20060209_regents_candelaria.htm">Cordelia Candelaria</a>, Chicana and Chicano Studies; <a href="../200603/20060323_regents_chavez.htm">Carlos Castillo-Chavez</a>, Mathematics and Statistics Department; <a href="../200602/20060202_regents_montgomery.htm">Douglas Montgomery</a>, Industrial Engineering Department; <a href="20060407_regents_poste.htm">George Poste</a>, Biodesign Institute and School of Life Sciences; <a href="../200602/20060216_regents_prescott.htm">Edward Prescott</a>, Economics Department, <a href="../200603/20060331__regents_windhorst.htm">Rogier Windhorst</a>, Physics and Astronomy Department. </p>

        <p>This year ASU is honoring the first class of ASU President's Professors. This new prestigious award, is designed to reward enthusiasm and innovation in teaching, the ability to inspire original and creative work by students, mastery of subject matter and scholarly contributions.</p>
        <p> Inaugural awardees are <a href="../200603/20060309_cerveny.htm">Randall Cerveny</a>, professor of geography; Alice Christie, associate professor of technology and education; Ian Gould, professor of chemistry and biochemistry; and the late Paul Rothstein, associate professor of industrial design.</p>

<p align="left">George Poste can identify the person who first cultivated his interest in science. It was his high school biology teacher in a rural community south of London. </p>
<p>"At that time, only 3 percent of students were admitted to university, and they typically were not kids from rural, blue-collar families like me," says Poste, the director of ASU's Biodesign Institute and the Del E. Webb Distinguished Professor of Biology. "The admission standards were very rigorous, but my teacher, Peter Smith, inspired in me the drive and passion to pursue something that no member of my family had attempted. His confidence in me remains one of the greatest gifts I've ever received." </p>
<p>That could explain why Poste is so committed to inspiring the next generation of researchers and innovators. Despite demanding roles directing the Biodesign Institute and important civic service commitments, he makes time for student lectures several times each quarter. He has presented to students pursuing studies in such diverse areas as the life sciences, engineering, architecture, business and law. After a recent presentation hosted by ASU's College of Law, Poste demonstrated the passion that makes him such a popular presenter. </p>
<p>"I was so impressed with the amount of time he spent with students after the event, making sure every student had the opportunity to ask questions and voice their opinions," says Beth Shapiro, the associate director of communications in the College of Law. </p>
<p>Poste's selection as a Regents' Professor represents an important honor in a long chain of accomplishments that demonstrate he was eminently worthy of his teacher's confidence. After being admitted to the University of Bristol, England, Poste received a doctorate in veterinary medicine, graduating first in his class. </p>
<p>"My pursuit of veterinary medicine stemmed from my early childhood perceptions about what was important to the community in which I was raised, and livestock was the economic mainstay of that community," he says. "To be a veterinarian was to bring real value to a community." </p>
<p>This achievement set the stage for what would become a theme for Poste: being compelled by human needs to seek knowledge and skills that would enable him to contribute to solutions. To address the challenges posed by infectious diseases, he pursued a second doctorate in virology. To better address diseases such as cancer, he pursued a doctorate of science and became board certified in pathology. He has received honorary doctorates in law and science for his contributions to international health policy. In every pursuit, he sought good teachers. </p>
<p>One such search led him to the United States. A pre-eminent cancer researcher, Leonard Weiss, was located at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and Poste was determined to study under him. He was elated to earn a position as professor of cellular and molecular biology and principal cancer researcher at the university-affiliated prestigious Roswell Park Memorial Institute, one of the three leading cancer research centers in the United States. </p>
<p>Poste found it stimulating to be able to inspire students in the classroom, but his work in cancer research was creating a sense of unrest. </p>
<p>"Cancer is an absolutely wretched disease, and the need for new treatments is profound," he says. "People desperately needed better treatments - and, at the time, the best place to influence that was the pharmaceutical industry." </p>
<p>So Poste embarked on a 19-year career in the pharmaceutical industry that earned him international recognition. He quickly ascended to the top ranks in research and development at pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beecham (now GlaxoSmithKline), where he was responsible for bringing more than 30 drugs and diagnostics to market. </p>
<p>Poste left the pharmaceutical industry at the turn of the millennium to make a home in the Valley and ease into retirement, something he knew would be a 'relative' term. His plan was to consult with West Coast biotech companies and serve on select boards and governmental committees, while spending plenty of time with his family and pursuing other interests. </p>
<p>But two new challenges redirected his path. </p>
<p>The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. on Sept. 11, 2001, forever changed lives of many Americans - and they also had a profound impact on Poste, who became a U.S. citizen in 1989. As a member of several prestigious government committees dealing with global health and infectious diseases, Poste was well-known in Washington for his expertise on naturally occurring biological threats. </p>
<p>That expertise immediately made him a prime authority in addressing new threats from bioterrorism. He was asked by U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to head the Department of Defense Task Force on Bioterrorism. Since then, Poste has spent significant time on issues related to national security. </p>
<p>The second challenge was placed in his sights in 2003. He received a call from ASU President Michael Crow, who asked for his thoughts on the best way to build a world-class interdisciplinary research institute at ASU. </p>
<p>"I didn't realize at the time that I was being recruited, but was immediately impressed by President Crow's vision of what can be achieved by a university, and his plans for taking ASU to that pinnacle." Poste says. </p>
<p>Poste says he quickly saw that leading the new Biodesign Institute was an opportunity to build a research enterprise uniquely suited to meeting the increasingly complex challenges to human health, environmental sustainability and national security. He also believes that he, in concert with others at the Biodesign Institute, can contribute to the transformative, multidisciplinary educational system needed for the next generation of scientists. </p>
<p>"George Poste is one of these rare individuals who has the capacity to cross between many disciplines, to understand where biology has been and where biology is going," says ASU President Michael Crow. "He understands the interface between science and technology, and he understands human needs." </p>
<p>Poste admits his motivation also has personal dimensions. </p>
<p>"Apart from doing a job that fascinates me, I know that any advances we make at the Biodesign Institute are pertinent to my children, my grandchildren and beyond, and to the role of Arizona as a leading research center," he says. "The promise of that legacy is the most powerful driver I know." </p>
