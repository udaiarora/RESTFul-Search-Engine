      <h2>Circuitous route leads Smith to Regents Professor </h2>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/maryleesmith_030504.jpg" alt="Mary Lee Smith" width="216" height="299" align="right">Mary Lee Smith is a renowned scholar, an award-winning educator, and a voice for social justice. </p>
      <p>She has come a long way since she was faced with a choice as a college student in the early 1960s, on her own financially and armed with a history degree. </p>
      <p>Smith had developed a budding interest in research and psychotherapy. But her well-meaning advisers, who were unable to visualize in those days how Smith might channel those interests into stable and gainful employment, were urging her to become a high school teacher. Instead Smith followed her instincts, a decision that has led to international prominence and, now, distinction as one of eight new Regents Professors, one of the university's highest honors for faculty members. </p>
      <p>"My career has been one of those trips where you don't know where you're going until you end up there," she says. In reflecting on her journey, Smith says she couldn't have planned it better if she'd tried. </p>
      <p align="left">She is internationally recognized as a pioneer in meta-analysis, a statistical <br>
  method for synthesizing research studies. <br>
  Her scholarly contributions are represented in seven books based on her research, and in dozens of articles in prominent and selective journals focused on the fields of education, psychology and policy. She also wrote a widely used textbook on research and evaluation. </p>
      <p align="left">Smith is one of eight ASU professors recently inducted as Regents Professors. The others include Charles Arntzen, molecular biologist and Florence Ely Nelson Presidential Endowed Chair; Phil Christensen, Korrick Professor of Geological Sciences; Gene Glass, professor of educational leadership and policy studies; Luis Gomez-Mejia, Horace Steel Heritage Chair in management; Stephen Pyne, life sciences professor and authority on fire; and Psychology Professor Irwin Sandler, director of the Center for Prevention Research. </p>
      <p align="left">Smith joined ASU in 1986 and is jointly appointed to the programs in Education Policy Studies and Measurement, Statistics and Methodological Studies in the College of Education. But, the pathway leading to ASU and her place as a leading scholar in education policy was hardly planned and far from predictable. </p>
      <p align="left">As a high school student in the late 1950s, Smith thought about becoming a journalist or somehow pursuing her interests in writing and history. Mostly, she was concerned with how she would continue her education after high school. Smith's father died when she was only 14, and at the age of 18, she became financially responsible for herself. </p>
      <p align="left">A bright student, she enrolled at the University of Colorado at Boulder on scholarship, at the time not realizing how pivotal this step would be in shaping the course of her professional life. </p>
      <p align="left">Rejecting advice to teach high school history, she entered graduate school at the University of Colorado, Boulder, again on scholarship, and ultimately earned a Ph.D. in counseling psychology. Her plan was to practice psychotherapy on a college campus. Soon after she completed her doctorate, however, she was invited to join the faculty at the University of Colorado in research methodology. </p>
      <p align="left">"All of a sudden, I found myself in a <br>
  faculty position that I wasn't sure I wanted," Smith remembers. "But it grew on me, as I realized that with tenure I'd have a much greater opportunity to make my own direction." </p>
      <p align="left">It was during this time that she joined colleague Gene Glass, also recently named ASU Regents Professor, as he developed ground-breaking work in meta-analysis methodology. Together they published a book and numerous scholarly articles about the effects of psychotherapy. Their study gained instant notoriety, and ultimately was identified as one of the "forty research studies that changed psychology." </p>
      <p align="left">More than 20 years later, the studies conducted by Smith using meta-analysis remain among the most often-cited studies in psychology. </p>
      <p align="left">"It was exciting to be involved in something that revolutionary and new," Smith recalls. </p>
      <p align="left">More recently, she's turned her attention to school policies, conducting research on identification of learning disabilities, effects of grade retention, and consequences of high stakes achievement testing. The latest book, "Political Spectacle and the Fate of American Schools" (Routledge, 2003), culminates her analysis of education policy that is corrupted by politics. </p>
      <p align="left">"The focus of my work has shifted to the politics of research, particularly the politics that underlie education policy and how those politics are making schools worse instead of better for crass, political reasons," she says. </p>
      <p align="left">In addition to her noteworthy scholarship, Smith is a talented and committed teacher, who is a past recipient of the Outstanding Mentor by the ASU Graduate Student Association. She has chaired more than 20 doctoral dissertations to completion and has had major responsibility for the design, analysis and writing of 20 more. </p>
      <p align="left">"I took a rather circuitous route in my career, but I wouldn't change it," Smith says. </p>
      <p align="left">At present, she is conducting research and writing on the topic of politicizing of policy research. She plans to craft articles for a general audience. </p>
