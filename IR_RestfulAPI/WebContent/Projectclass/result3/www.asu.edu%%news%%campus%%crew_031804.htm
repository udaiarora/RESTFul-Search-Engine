      <h2>ASU crew team to compete in rowing invitational </h2>
      <p align="center">The Rowing Club at ASU is making waves in the national competition circuit. </p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/crew_031804.jpg" width="288" height="175" align="right">Stanford University and Windermere Real Estate in California have invited ASU's Rowing Club to compete in the second annual Windermere Collegiate Crew Classic, an invitational rowing regatta held at Redwood Shores, in Redwood City, Calif. This two-day community event will take place March 29 and 30, and will feature crew races between men and women from 15 of the nation's top schools as well as local high school and community club teams. </p>
      <p>The Rowing Club at ASU, established September 2002, currently has 40 members. </p>
      <p>This is the first time ASU has been invited to compete in this invitational, and for Crew Coach Jeffery Wilkinson, this event will help them grow to be a stronger team. </p>
      <p>"My goals include being competitive in the event, gaining more national and intra-state recognition, and having the students interact with other university programs on a personal level," Wilkinson says. "As a coach I'm excited to meet and converse with some of the top coaches in the nation." </p>
      <p>In addition to ASU, men's and women's teams will compete from Stanford University, University of California, Yale University, University of Pennsylvania, University of North Carolina, California State University - Sacramento, Cornell University, University of Virginia, Michigan State University, Washington State University, Harvard University, Princeton University, Georgetown University and the U.S. Naval Academy. </p>
      <p>The ASU team meets at Tempe Town Lake each morning at 4:45 a.m., for a three-hour practice session. Wilkinson says training isn't limited to the water. </p>
      <p>"Rowing machines are the most beneficial, " he says, "but we try to do power movements while increasing our cardiovascular output as well by running up 'A' mountain, doing squat jumps and jogging." </p>
      <p>Nicholas Shiya, a freshmen engineering major, says he became interested in rowing after learning his cousin had joined the Dartmouth Crew. </p>
      <p>"I was surprised to hear that ASU had a crew club and I took advantage of the opportunity right away," says Shiya, one of the 22 males in the Rowing Club. "I think rowing is unique because in many sports, there are teams that are led by a dominant player or 'all-stars,' but in crew, each man must be on his game in order for the boat to function as one. If one man falls, he takes his team with him." </p>
      <p>Club President Becky Moody, a junior business management major, is one of the 18 women in the club. She says building speed and focusing on technique are just a few challenges she faces as a rower. However, she says the rewards from participating always outweigh the challenges. </p>
      <p>"What's rewarding is getting to row with seven of my closest friends every morning and the whole time knowing we are in this together," she says. "There is nothing better than knowing you had a clean, smooth row and every single person in the boat contributed equally to it. That's the best team bonding experience out there." </p>
