<p><font size=+0>The meeting was called to order at 3:20 p.m. by Senate

President Doug Johnson.</font>

<p><b><font size=+0>2. Acceptance of Previous Minutes of August 28, 2000.</font></b>

<p><font size=+0>The draft minutes of August 28, 2000 were approved as

published on the Academic Senate web site. If there are further editorial

corrections, please contact Darby Shaw at the Senate office (965-9245vm).</font><b><font size=+0></font></b>

<p><b><font size=+0>3. Announcements and Communications.</font></b><b><font size=+0></font></b>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.A. Senate President's Report</b> (Douglas Johnson).</font>

<p><font size=+0>We are going to attempt to use more technology today and

project a web page on the screen to assist your following the agenda. We

are trying to cut down on our paper expenses at the Senate Office. So,

we will continue our practice of not distributing hard copy unless there

is a special request. How many people had trouble downloading the agenda

or minutes today? Seeing none, this approach must be working OK. Let us

know if you think this is a satisfactory method for displaying the agenda

during the meeting.</font>

<p><font size=+0>I want to thank Alex Bainbridge, President of ASASU, the

Alumni Association, ICA Board and all the people that made the Faculty/Staff

Appreciation Tailgate so successful this weekend. (It was very nice to

win the game, too!)</font>

<p><font size=+0>In the coming weeks there are many activities that deserve

your attention. Learner Centered Education is one of the core issues this

year for the Regents and for us. Tom Trotter will speak to that issue a

little further down on the agenda.</font>

<p><font size=+0>The Power of Technology Workshops, which we are calling

demonstrations and conversations, are scheduled beginning on Wednesday

of this week. I encourage you to go to the Center for Learning and Teaching

Excellence Web Page (</font><font size=-1><a href="http://www.asu.edu/clte">http://www.asu.edu/clte</a></font><font size=+0>)

and review the upcoming events. We have scheduled a presentation each week

for the next two months. They are scheduled over the lunch hour so you

can easily fit them in your schedule. I would advise you to pick areas

that are similar to yours or pick some in different areas, but get involved.

Look and see what people are doing in their distance learning classes.

Think about what might be the possibilities for your area. We encourage

you to drop a note to people in your department reminding them of this

opportunity. The initial registration is well over 100 right now. We are

very pleased with the level of response.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Another event on Friday: the Center for Intergroup Relations

is sponsoring "Diversity and L.C.E. in the ASU Classroom" ? a one-day conference

for faculty and graduate students. The goal of the conference is to encourage

you to think about Learner Centered Education and how alternative strategies

provide opportunities to a wider variety of learners.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.B University Provost Report</b> (Milton Glick).</font>

<p><font size=+0>I will ask Tom Trotter to take a few moments of my time

to talk to you today. What I have tried to do for the last year or so is

pick out a subject that we can explore in some depth and have dialogue

on. I want to do the same thing this year. I will report on any issue you

may want to hear about; just send me an email note before the Senate meeting.

What I have asked Tom to do is give you some sense from the Office of the

Provost on how he thinks the institution is approaching L.C.E. and what

we need to do to make it work.</font>

<p><font size=+0>I wanted to thank those of you who were able to attend

one or more of the candidate forums. I attended two of the four forums,

and I was impressed with how many people showed up. I was also impressed

with the format they used this year, because they used predetermined questions

for each of the candidates. They had one minute or two to respond. This

format avoided most negative arguments that we have seen happen at some

of the coffees in the past year . I attended the forum at our Law School

and all but two of the candidates (six were present) really pledged themselves

to help education. I think that was true at the Downtown Center forum also.

I think it was very valuable to have so many ASU people present.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Regarding enrollment figures this year, the 21<sup>st</sup>

day was last week, and we now have the official numbers available. The

freshmen are up 192. This does not necessarily mean new freshmen, because

a lot of our students from last year are still under 24 hours. Sophomores

are up 171, juniors are up 130 and seniors are down 389. Pre-graduate students

are up 36 and non-degree graduate students are down 162. The net count

is that we are minus 89 head count. The campus enrollment in terms of volume

is where it has been for the last two or three years. This figure, minus

89, is deceptive because we have moved the Nutrition Program to East Campus

and that involved about 200 students. This shows a very modest increase

acutally, before we factor out the students that moved to East. The other

notable thing is the substantial decrease in seniors which we would like

to believe is due to people graduating. There are three possibilities:

one is graduation, the second is it relates to fewer transfer students,

as we have made an effort to increase transfer populations at East and

West Campuses as well as the freshman population at Main. Either of those

would be good reasons. The third reason is that they just got tired and

left us. I am sure that could not have happened to very many. Maybe a few.

Once again, we are getting a much higher ratio of full-time equivalents

to head count. If you look at our full-time equivalents rather than our

head count, we are actually up 360. I think that is a good sign because

more students are getting their courses and more students are interested

in being full-time, and that is a pattern that we have been working on

for about the last five years. We are at about 6,000 new freshmen and that

is where we want to stay. A decade ago, as you may recall, we were at 2,800.

We achieved 6,000 two years ago. We do not want to increase beyond the

6,000, but we do want to increase the out-of-state applicant pool so that

we can improve the credentials, diversity and the size of our freshman

class.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Dan Landers: We have a cap on our enrollment.

How close are we to that while increasing the number of our full-time students?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Provost Glick: We are 1,800 below the cap. Other questions?</font>

<p><font size=+0>FYI: FTE is what drives the funding formula. Keeping the

head count down but the FTE up is what alters the funding. I notice you

have new Athletic Director Gene Smith on the agenda today, and I think

you all will be enthusiastic about him, as are those of us who have spent

some time with him already. He hails from Iowa State.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Baker: I have a question about parking in Structure

One. I park in that structure, and I am aware that a deal has been made

with the Honors College students to park on top of that structure. They

are not doing that. Is anything being done to rectify this agreement?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Provost Glick: That is a very good question, and we are

hearing from both sides on that issue right now. As you know, we are building

three new residence halls--one will be on the north side of campus, facing

Palo Verde; a second residence hall is going in the big lot where the Dash

Inn was once located. The third project is the filling in of an area in

the Irish, Best, Hayden Complex to create two court yards. This area will

be the new Honors College Hall. What they are building on used to be parking

lots, so those students were moved out of the parking lot into Structure

One. At the same time, we reduced the number of students in Structure One.

The overall numbers show there used to be 600 students in Structure One,

and there now are 400. There is higher occupancy now, because there are

200 students using the structure day and night (100% occupancy). We are

asking Honors College students to park on top and receive a special discount

rate. It still is a problem. We are talking about the possibility of delaying

cross-parking, which now happens at 4:00 p.m. We are talking with the student

leaders. A memo has gone out on this from my office, and I will keep the

Senate informed of any new progress. After a decade of no building on this

campus, we will all have some adjustments in the process of building three

new residence halls, a mediated classroom, a research complex, and the

expansion of the Memorial Union. There is also construction going on at

ICA. We will try to give adequate notice to employees in those areas when

construction will begin.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.C Vice Provost for Academic Affairs </b>(Tom Trotter).</font>

<p><font size=+0>I am new to being Vice Provost, and I have been on a learning

curve for the past three months. I want to thank both David and Doug for

their time spent in my office trying to teach me things about the history

of governance and academic/administrative interfacing. Thanks to both of

you.</font>

<p><font size=+0>When the subject of Learner Centered Education first crossed

my agenda, I asked Provost Glick what it was and why was it important.

What are the workshops about, that the Senate President mentioned? Let

me try to give you a beginner?s perspective. On the one hand, Learner Centered

Education is nothing new. Each of us who has ever supervised a Ph.D student

has worked in an environment where the roles are reversed--and what that

student takes away from his or her interaction with you. One simpleminded

definition of Learner Centered Education would be to take the philosophy

of mentoring the advanced Ph.D. student, invert it, and apply it all the

way down through the curriculum as best as time and resources would allow.

The emphasis is on the student learner at the bottom. One reason L.C.E.

is important is that the Board of Regents has taken as one of their goals,

that each time an academic program submits a request for planning authority

or a request for implementation of a degree program, these basic principles

about Learner Centered Education must be addressed.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Let me give you my personal view which I have developed

over a quick three-month study. One emphasis would be on outcomes and assessment.

You will be able to say what your courses are all about and, at the end,

have someone from the outside take a look at what the students have done,

and say that you (all of the faculty) have done well, or not so well. We

will need to say up front what you are trying to do. Another key point

is accessibility that goes outside the classroom. Courses will be more

accessible to students through the expanded use of technology. Another

component is quality and teaching excellence, and that involves not just

the dedication to students but the methods and the teaching techniques,

the way we do our job. The Center for Learning and Teaching Excellence

has just been moved administratively to where it reports to the Vice Provost

for Academic Affairs. What this will do is tie teaching excellence more

closely to the mission of the university. As we work through this year,

look for teaching old dogs (like me) new tricks. Some of it will involve

learning the new technology, and some of it will be just recasting things

we have done for much of our teaching career.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: The analogy of Ph.D. education

to Learner Centered Education is a good one. The problem is how do we manage

to teach each freshman the same way we would a Ph.D student? A lot of resources

would be required to do so, and they have not traditionally been spent

that way. I think one of the most exciting things that has happened during

this whole period of discussion with the Regents is that they have said,

we need to review our accountability procedures, measurements, and how

those things constrain our ability to deliver Learner Centered Education.

That openness to go back and reexamine rules and regulations is a huge

opportunity to restructure our contract with the Regents in a way that

helps Arizona and helps our faculty. I am really looking forward to that

discussion. If you in your own discovery of Learner Centered Education

find these constraints, please share them with me so that I can take them

forward to the Regents. If we can unbind the constraints that hinder our

mission, we will be more efficient and effective.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Landers: I guess I have a concern with the analogy

from the Provost. If you listen to the Regents, it sounds great, but if

you go down to the legislature, you hear that we are not devoting enough

time to our classes, and they do not much count that extra work that we

do with our graduate students. I just wonder if we start down this path

and move away from our formal classes, are we going to get punished for

it down the road by the legislature?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: There are risks involved in

the changes that we will make. In this case, the potential benefits are

enough to make taking some chances worthwhile. We have to figure out ways

to get away from credit hours as the measure of our work .</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Landers: How much are the benefits really objective?

Is this based upon good science or is this just something that has come

up?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: There is a body of literature

that supports L.C.E. There are a multitude of concepts invoved in doing

L.C.E, so if you believe in additive models, there is pretty good support

for this.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Landers: Those represent numbers. Is it just theoretical?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: I think it focuses on issues

that we need to have a thoughtful conversation about. We are trying to

schedule a continuing discussion throughout the campus. We would like to

have you involved in those discussions, and asking hard questions is a

part of that process. Let?s take a look together to see what support there

is for this concept and whether it is a good venture for us. Perhaps we

are overstating the concept to say that we would treat a freshman as a

doctoral student, but if we can personalize the process, if we can improve

interaction with students, we will improve the outcome of our efforts and

increase the return on the state?s investment as well.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.D ASASU President?s Report</b> (Alex Bainbridge).</font>

<p><font size=+0>I want to thank you for attending the Faculty/Staff Appreciation

Day; it was a pleasure to serve you that day.</font>

<p><font size=+0>We are currently working on our endowment, which has reached

maturity this year, and we will be working with Dr. Glick and Dr. Johnson

on the choice of the department that will receive the endowed professor

for one year. This will be a great advantage to everyone, and we look forward

to working with you on this project.</font>

<p><font size=+0>We are working with ICA to come up with a new event at

football games. We want to have a "mike man" who will sit in the student

section and get the students riled up with a little more energy and hopefully

get more people involved in our football games. Meanwhile, I will be up

there probably chanting, Prop 301, Prop 301, more money for higher education!

Also, ICA has allowed us to put in a voter registration booth at the table

for ASASU inside the main gate. We will spread our information on both

legislative propositions. I encourage any of you to stop by and register

to vote.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Regarding the Parking Structure One problem, we are working

with Honors College students who have written a letter to us. We intend

to gain many perspectives on this problem, because many students wait until

their junior or senior year to get a parking pass for Structure One--many

faculty and staff have waited years and years to get a Structure One pass.

Now, add another layer to that: the necessity of having students parking

by their residence halls. We will look at everyone?s concerns about this

problem, and hopefully there is a good compromise solution.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: The parking issue is a hot one

for us this year. The reality is that parking is going to change; we just

need to make sure that what we do has the least amount of impact on our

lives.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.E Past President?s Report </b>(David Burstein).</font>

<p><font size=+0>At the Faculty/Staff Appreciation event, a faculty member

came up to me and said, first of all they had actually read the <i>Academic

Senate Newsletter</i>, and secondly, they read my column. They took issue

with my strong support in the <i>Newsletter</i> for support of the new

tax (in Prop 301). I am not sure I can make it more plain than to say,

if you vote against Prop 301, you shoot yourself in the foot. This is a

proposition that supports higher education; it is a proposition that supports

education of students. If you haven?t noticed, the students come into our

university after twelve years of rote memorization. Then we expect them

to process new information and come up with new ideas, and it is a struggle

for many of them. If we are to change this situation, we must start with

Prop 301. We start changing it with better education in this state. I hope

each of you takes this message back to your department--that we need to

be strongly supportive of Prop 301 and Prop 106, the redistricting proposition,

because if we who are involved in education do not support Prop 301, the

prospect for legislative support for education in this state over the next

ten years is unlikely. In case you have not heard, the denial of ACE, a

rather "cadillac style" proposition in the late ?80s, has effected us greatly?the

denial of the ACE Initiative was used like a sledge hammer over our heads

for the next 10 years as to why the legislature should not support us.

Denial of Prop 301 will be like a sledge hammer over our heads for the

next ten years of why they will not support us. The one thing that I have

learned in the last two and one half years is that the degree to which

what we want to achieve as a university is fully constrained by how much

funding we have. It is not a matter of choice. It is not a matter of what

we need. It is a matter of making a choice over many of our needs. If I

sound strident on this, this is the only way I can be right now. If we

don?t support it as faculty, we are shooting ourselves in the foot. Thank

you.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: I am in favor of Prop 301, because

we have to believe as educators that we can invest some of the state?s

money in education and get a good return. I feel we can help the state

to invest well for the future.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Burgess: The Arizona Republic is doing a big issue

called "Working" and they called me to schedule an interview on working.

I don?t know whether this will appear in the article, but I pitched Prop

301 as being crucial to the future of our citizens because if we don?t

prepare our citizens for the knowledge economy, they will be doomed to

poverty. That is what I said.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: This is upbeat, folks! (much

laughter here) We could very easily be an economy based on call centers,

credit card processing, and warehouse distribution centers. We must create

new ideas and bring them to fruition to create companies and jobs?Research

is the driver of the new economy.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Burgess: What the legislature can provide is infrastructure

to the institution. We do a wonderful job of educating, and we do a terrible

job with financing buildings.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: We have to focus what we do

better. A vote on Prop 301 as I see it is a vote of confidence for educators

in this state.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.F ASU West Senate Report</b> (Afsaneh Nahavandi).</font>

<p><font size=+0>I am Afsaneh Nahavandi, ASU West Senate President-elect,

and I will give a brief report today. Our first Senate meeting will be

this Wednesday, September 20, at West. Most of our efforts will be focused

on the lower division creation of our program. We are really excited, and

we have a lot of work ahead. Our Arts and Sciences faculty will do the

lion?s share of the work there. If you have any input, please share it

with me.</font>

<p><font size=+0>I will be attending your meetings regularly now instead

of Vince Waldron.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: That is an exciting project,

and we wish you well. Now, for a special guest, Gene Smith, the new Athletic

Director has joined us today.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.G Director of Intercollegiate Athletics</b> (Gene

Smith).</font>

<p><font size=+0>Thank you, Doug, for the opportunity to meet with the

faculty today. I want you to know who I am, and I want to share a bit of

my philosophy about the program today. I think we have something very unique

at ASU in our athletic program. We have over 500 student athletes. My goal

is to create an environment for our student athletes to be successful.

My number one goal for them is that they first and foremost get a degree,

and secondly that they be given the opportunity to develop their athletic

talents that have been developed in the K-12 years. We want them to grow

into the best athletes they can be individually. We want them to gain that

competitive experience and have that winning experience. We want them to

grow socially. We have a great foundation and culture here at ASU, where

the majority of our student athletes will be able to leave this institution

and work with major corporations, be successful, and be good citizens.

I am excited about our program. It is my first year, and I am trying to

assess things--our ASU family, our environment. Please feel free to call

me and share your ideas. This is a learning period for me. We have an organizational

structure (ICA) that is going through change. I am interviewing everyone

in the athletic department, and we have 182 employees. I want everyone

to understand their role in our program.</font>

<p><font size=+0>We (athletic directors) are in the recruiting business,

and I was happy to come to ASU from Iowa State. Note: He told a very funny

story about recruiting athletic directors at the Perly Gates (too long

to include here). He also said that he will keep on the path where Kevin

White left off and will work hard to make us proud of the ICA program.

He would welcome any invitation extended to him in the future to speak

to academic groups about the program. Just call him or email him (</font><font size=-1><a href="mailto:eugene.smith@asu.edu)">eugene.smith@asu.edu)</a></font><font size=+0>.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: Thanks, Gene. We want you to

feel that you can always come back to the Senate and have a captive audience.</font>

<p><font size=+0>We have another special speaker to get to, Dr. Greg Shrader

from the Health Services at ASU.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>3.H ASU Psychologist</b> (Greg Shrader).</font>

<p><font size=+0>I want to update you on our services (three handouts were

provided). I want to share with you how the academic side of the house

has utilized our services in the past and also talk about upcoming programs.

In our brochure it gives the phone number 965-1646. I would encourage you

to change that last number to 7. That will get you a person, if you are

in an emergency situation. We offer our services to all ASU students. We

also offer couples counseling and group counseling. Most of these groups

will be starting within the next week or two. A couple of hidden services

that we offer, which you may not be aware of, are career testing and career

counseling. We work closely with career services on this. We offer two

tests that if you went off campus for the same test, it would cost you

upwards from $200. We offer our career tests for $20 on campus, and we

also provide an interpretation by one of our staff members. Another program

we have is called Testing Support Services. TSS are similar to standard

Kaplan courses, in that we prepare students to take the Graduate Record

Examination. If you went off campus for this service, it would cost upwards

to $1500. For those courses our price is greatly reduced, but our instructors

have the same qualifications as the standard Kaplan instructors.</font>

<p><font size=+0>I want to talk to you about some of the trends that we

have seen with the students that we have counseled. Over 30% of the population

that we serve right now are students who have a diagnosis of depression.

We are a multi-disciplinary staff. The former ASU Mental Health has merged

with our department, and we now offer psychiatric services under our umbrella

at two locations. We are located in the Student Health Building as well

as on the third floor of the Student Services Building. A third of the

students that we see who are diagnosed with depression are on medication.

On your handout we note the National Depression Screening Day which will

be on Thursday, October 5. It is an opportunity for students who might

feel a little intimidated to come to the Health Center who might still

have some concerns about depression. They take a simple fifteen-question

survey, and then they go over it with a staff member who might make recommendations

in terms of getting them some resources. I would encourage you to encourage

your students to take advantage of this opportunity.</font>

<p><font size=+0>We offer outreach services to the Academic Senate. What

we have done in the past are presentations ranging from sexual abuse to

eating disorders, Depression Awareness Week activities, anxiety, substance

abuse, anything that you might feel your students might be going through.

We would be happy to come in and do a presentation in your class. We are

also available for consultation at any time. We have had a few occasions

when a student has been lost in a class, or there has been some other major

trauma that has effected the entire classroom. What we have done there

is debriefing work in the classroom. Any time you feel there is a mental

health issue and you are not sure how to intervene, please feel free to

give our office a call. We are here for you as well for any mental health

issues.</font>

<p><font size=+0>You may also contact me by email (</font><font size=-1><a href="mailto:gshrader@asu.edu).">

gshrader@asu.edu).</a></font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: It is interesting to hear about

the percentage of students that are depressed. What is the percentage of

faculty that get depressed? Show of hands? (much laughter here). We will

ask you again after the Prop 301 election.</font><b><font size=+0></font></b>

I hope you all have had an adequate chance to review this item on the web.

Vice Provost Bill Lewis is with us today with the hope that we will endorse

this policy with its new revisions. Are there any questions for Dr. Lewis?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Burgess: Can he clarify about the high speed internet

service; can you dial in and still maintain your ASU IP address?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Vice Provost Lewis: There currently is an agreement in

effect with Sprint/Releban Services; we do have a connection directly from

Sprint to ASU. If you are an ASU faculty or staff, it will transfer you

directly. We are doing the same thing with Quest with cell service. I was

told this is in transition status, but it was supposed to be done a couple

of weeks ago, but it has not been finalized. Cox has not yet decided to

provide this type of service for us.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Bell: I have one question of clarification from

one of the people that I represent. On page three, and I think this is

self-explanatory, the section that regards making ASU computer resources

available to individuals not affiliated with ASU without approval or authorization?.It

is obvious to me that in the libraries we have been doing that for a great

number of years. I assume the fact that you can come in and use all the

resources which are offered in the Library and not be against this policy

(That is correct). The second item regards child pornography. I am assuming

viewing or posting is addressed in this policy (Yes. Absolutely).</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Rivera: Is Cox just not interested in having an

agreement with us?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Vice Provost Lewis: We have talked to them about it, and

we actually have a fiber optic connection with Cox that was here on an

old project some years ago, but Cox has not seen fit to discuss this with

us yet. We are working on them.</font><font size=+0></font>

<p><font size=+0>Provost Glick: I want to clarify that you can get high-speed

service without that link, and you can maintain your campus email address.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Rivera: I understand that. Obviously, you can

log into your high-speed service address, but if you try to get into the

Web of Science or some similar area is there a way of getting around the

ASU PPP?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Vice Provost Lewis: We are doing that with Sprint right

now. I have Sprint at my house. When I log into ASU, it assigns my IP address

temporarily. But when I am going anywhere else, I use Sprint service. There

are a couple of things from the Library that are databases, where they

actually transfer you out over the Internet and then expect you to come

in with an ASU IP address and be transferred back out to a Sprint IP address.

We have a problem there and are trying to find a way to resolve it.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Rivera: Is there a way around this by logging

onto some special server?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Vice Provost Lewis: One of the way to overcome this is

the use of a proxy server. We are looking into that. You would log into

a proxy server, which would then change your credentials.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Cochran: I have a question about paying for setting

up computers at home. When I moved the computer around at my house, I had

to have wiring rerouted. I had money in a research fund?(another example

is, if I want to get a monthly service account, ISP or some other provider)

-- I was told that we have to pay for it personally, that we cannot get

someone to pay the $75 to have the phone company come out and rerun the

computer wires. Is there anything we can do about this policy? It certainly

discourages people from setting up remote work, work at home, things that

are encouraged in surveys to the faculty every year, but you have to pay

for it yourself, even if that is dedicated to university research or other

university work.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Provost Glick: We have left that to the discretion of

the administrator, the dean of your unit. If they will approve your use

of grant funds, then we will go along with the decision.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Cochran: Then there is no policy per se?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Provost Glick: We have chosen to do it this way for obvious

reasons. It is an exception, but nevertheless that exception is allowable.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Baker: Our college has recently told us they are

having a branding image issued. I do not see reference to that in this

policy. Are we as faculty obligated to use this branding image on our individual

web pages?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Vice Provost Lewis: As departments you are allowed to

do this, and as faculty you are allowed to do branding; in the College

of Business they have done extensive branding. What we do want to have

is some level of ease of use and conformity. There are ABA issues and accessibility

issues to deal with. There is no restriction as long as you are not earning

revenue or generating revenue from the pages.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Provost Glick: Let me add that having looked at all those

pages, the vice presidential and dean web pages, there is not one that

is consistent with the university?s front page. I think we are going to

establish a protocol this year at the college level and senior administrator

offices. We will not try to get down to the individual faculty. If we can

get the colleges consistent, that is a good start. I could not find one

that met G5 standards. But before we do that, we are going to try to look

at what we want the university web page to do. (We really do not want you

to have a much worse web page, because several are more advanced than our

own front page).</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Chaudhuri: You mentioned that you have Sprint

at home. Some of us have borderline issues. As an example, a person makes

an inquiry to me through my university email, and then I make the judgment

that I should respond in a non-university manner. I used to have AOL which

caused problems with compatibility sometimes. Do you have any recommendations

on outside providers?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Vice Provost Lewis: Most providers now have web browsers

that access the web. Most of them use standard formats. I would suggest

the 1STUP (one first up) service provider which I have used, and now use

when I travel all the time. It provides me with web access. They give me

an email address that I can use. I can get the mail if I wanted to from

that address and then reply from that address. But, if you get the mail

from ASU, and you stay on the ASU server and reply, you will have an ASU

IP address on it. You may decide to use another service. I have been using

1STUP, and it has been relatively good, and I have not had any problems

with it. Some people have a few problems at getting into some particular

university resources, if you do not have an ASU IP address.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Past President Burstein: The Alumni page set up through

ZSunDevils.com is for this purpose as well.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Chaudhuri: I tried to access this page and could

not.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Jackson: As a member of the TPAC committee that

originally considered this document, I would like to speak to the issue

of revenue generation. That issue came up repeatedly within the committee.

I want to clarify that there is a possibility of posting information on

your computer that would lead to sources that would generate revenue for

the department or the unit. That would be the case when ASU Purchasing

has to set up a procedure that has been approved and has been negotiated

between the unit and this provider. When revenue is generated this way,

it could be all right.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Vice Provost Lewis: The whole issue is that of exclusivity.

If we let one vendor and not another, we need to go through a fair bidding

process. That is the issue.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senate President Johnson: We have a resolution to endorse

the Revised Acceptable Use Policy (4-11-00) (the TPAC policy). If there

is no further discussion, then we will move to a vote. The TPAC policy

was endorsed by a voice vote of the Senate.</font>

<p><font size=+0><b>6.A Executive Committee </b>(Douglas Johnson).</font><font size=+0></font>

<p><font size=+0>At each Senate meeting this year, we will attempt to invite

people in to discuss issues with controversial interest. In the near future,

we would like to talk about health care issues. We would like to look at

a number of other policies that we are concerned about. Parking would be

one of them. Think about services that faculty use at the university and

how well we are being served in those areas. Please drop me an email if

you have things you would like to be discussed in the Senate, and we will

see if we can?t get those on the agenda as well.</font><b><font size=+0></font></b>

<p><font size=+0><b>6.B Committee on Committees</b> (Brent Brown). No report.</font><b><font size=+0></font></b>

<p><font size=+0><b>6.C Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee</b>

(Michael Mayer).</font><b><font size=+0></font></b>

<p><b><font size=+0>6.C.1 Senate Motion #1, Establishment of a B.S. American

Indian Studies in the College of Public Programs (including a new minor

in American Indian Studies), </font></b><font size=+0>was introduced for

a first reading. Rationale: The proposed degree is an integral part of

American Indian Studies, and it will contribute to the program?s critical

forum for the articulation, celebration and protection of American Indian

cultures. The AIS program emphasizes the unique status of American Indians

as sovereign governments with unique cultural traditions and contemporary

interests and challenges. AIS provided a long-needed institutional home

for intellectual inquiry, service, policy analysis, and research. The AIS

Program?s attention to American Indian voices (student, faculty and community)

strengthens the university?s ability to recruit and retain American Indian

faculty and students, and to provide a vibrant link with American Indian

communities.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Chaudhuri: I am supportive of the idea, as I have

been involved in the development of the AIS program. My question is, in

the planning stage, how much of a dialogue was there with the College of

Liberal Arts and Sciences and any other colleges?</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Mayer: I did invite someone to attend this meeting

and answer questions. It is an interdisciplinary faculty. There are three

people from English, one from Anthropology, one from Religious Studies

and one from History, who are on the committee as well as an individual

from the College of Education. I do not know if there have been any formal

discussions with others.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Segal: I was not involved in the preparation of

this proposal, but I did meet with Dr. Ewing because I am the Senator-at-large

from the College of Public Programs. I just wanted to call your attention

to the fact that students in this program would be expected to use many

courses in this major from the liberal arts area. There is already recognition

of the necessity of a broader education and then building and specializing

upon that.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Chaudhuri: That is my sense that the original

Justice Studies department was involved, and their intent is to have a

broad and diversified program.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Segal: It just so happens that there is an American

Indian Studies program in the College, and some but not all of the faculty

involved are from Justice Studies, but that is not the intent of the program.</font>

<p><font size=+0>Senator Mayer: We also have information items to bring

forward. CAPC has approved at its last meeting the following items of information

(do not require Senate action):</font>

<p><font size=+0>The establishment of a minor under the School of Planning

and Landscape Architecture: Landscape Studies.</font>

<p><font size=+0>The establishment of a minor in the College of Public

Programs: American Indian Studies.</font>

<p><font size=+0>The disestablishment of a concentration in the Department

of Languages and Literature: M.A. in French, with a concentration in Language

and Culture, and then in conjunction with that</font>

<p><font size=+0>The establishment of a concentration in the Department

of Language and Literatures: M.A. in Linguistics</font><font size=+0></font>

<p><font size=+0>Planning for a new degree program, in the Department of

Religious Studies: Ph.D. in Religious Studies.</font><b><font size=+0></font></b>
