<I>by Thomas Miron</I><P>
New and intermediate users will appreciate this easy-to-use guide to       the basics of the SAS System. Arranged in three parts, readers will find
this notable book both a highly detailed usage guide as well as a          handy reference packed with examples of SAS programs. Solutions for
common data processing problems are provided along with an extensive       cross-reference to SAS Institute product documentation. The examples are
realistic and cover everything from the most basic commands to the more    complex. Specific topics, presented in a task-oriented format, include
how to enter, read, and edit data using INPUT, INFILE, SET, and MERGE      statements; DATA step programming methods to manipulate data; combining
SAS data sets; customizing reports; and creating tables, bar charts,       line graphs and plots.
