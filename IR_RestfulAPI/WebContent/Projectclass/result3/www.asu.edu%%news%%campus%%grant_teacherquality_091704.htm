      <h2>$10 million grant will strengthen teacher training</h2>
      <p align="left">ASU&rsquo;s College of Teacher Education and Leadership has received a $9.97 million grant from the U. S. Department of Education for &ldquo;Teacher Quality Enhancement.&rdquo; The grant is the largest ever awarded to a college at the West campus.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="../clip_image002_0000.jpg" width="126" height="180" align="right">The award was presented at a ceremony Sept. 14 by Susan Sclafani on behalf of U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige.</p>
      <p align="left">&ldquo;Research and common sense tell us that teachers have a significant impact on student achievement,&rdquo; Paige said in a statement. &ldquo;These grants support projects to strengthen teacher training programs and improve student achievement &ndash; a key goal of the No Child Left Behind education reforms.&rdquo;</p>
      <p align="left">The ASU project, led by Scott Ridley, associate professor in the ASU College of Teacher Education and Leadership at the West campus and principal investigator in the grant, will focus on two key areas:</p>
      <p align="left">&bull; Recruit, prepare and retain high-quality new teachers in high-poverty urban and remote districts in Arizona.</p>
      <p align="left">&bull; Ensure high-quality teaching and increased student achievement in these districts.</p>
      <p>The No Child Left Behind&rsquo;s Teacher Quality Enhancement program includes partnership, state</p>
      <p>and recruitment grants. The partnership grants support projects to increase the number of highly qualified teachers, particularly in core subject areas such as math and science, using research-based teaching methods.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The announcement of this grant not only signals good news for students of this state, but it also acts as a powerful reinforcement of our vision of ASU as firmly embedded in the life of our communities,&rdquo; said Mark Searle, vice president and provost at ASU&rsquo;s West campus.</p>
      <p>Teacher knowledge created as a result of this university-school collaboration ultimately will benefit all Arizona schoolchildren.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Our K-8 school districts, the immediate beneficiaries of the grant, play a fundamental role in the task of producing the kind of educated work force that make the American dream of upward mobility possible,&rdquo; Searle said.</p>
      <p>The grant will maintain three existing partner districts in high-need urban districts of metropolitan Phoenix &ndash; Madison, Osborn and Avondale school districts &ndash; while adding four new partner districts in remote, underserved areas of Arizona. The latter group includes the Chinle Unified School District in Chinle, the Whiteriver Unified School District in Eastern Arizona, Indian Oasis-Baboquivari Unified School District in Sells, and Douglas Unified School District in Douglas.</p>
      <p>Chinle school superintendent Leon Ben echoed district officials in his appreciation of the program, saying: &ldquo;Our daily bus runs equate to driving between Los Angeles and New York. Most of this travel is on dirt roads. Because of the isolation, we continue to have significant turnover of staff. I envision several important benefits of the project &ndash; in developing new teachers who are committed to remaining in the area, in providing ongoing high-quality staff development, and in training teachers in strategies that are most appropriate for our students.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The real heart of this project is the partnership,&rdquo; Ridley said. &ldquo;None of the partner institutions could do this on their own. But together we can accomplish great things.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Corporate partners Sonic Foundry and Intel Corp. also received recognition for their participation. Sonic Foundry will provide on-site installation and training assistance for distance learning technology. Intel will provide expertise in classroom technology integration, provide a senior manager to advise the project team on state-of-the-art technology applications and provide collateral infrastructure to support the seven remote partner district classrooms.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Intel Corp. is a committed partner to education and welcomes this opportunity to collaborate with ASU&rsquo;s College of Teacher Education and Leadership,&rdquo; said Eugenia Echols, the company&rsquo;s education programs manager.</p>
      <p>Joseph Ryan, interim dean of the College of Teacher Education and Leadership at the West campus, noted that the grant advances the mission of the college and the university to &ldquo;develop the best teachers in the world for the students of our state.&rdquo;</p>
