      <h2>Ceremony points to institute's impact; speakers laud AzBio's promise</h2>
      <p>        It was a day of ceremony and celebration as leaders from ASU and around
          the state gathered to mark the official groundbreaking of the Arizona
          Biodesign Institute April 29. The event honored both the start of the
        project and the future promise it holds for ASU and the state.</p>
      <p>"In spite
            of the state's severe budget shortfall, we are here today building
            our future - not wringing our hands over our problems, but planning
            for
          tomorrow and positioning ASU and the state of Arizona to be leaders
        in an exciting field," said Gail Howard, the governor's policy adviser
        for
          economic development."As Governor Napolitano has said, for too long
        Arizona has been a big state with small ideas. Today we are a big state
        with
          a big idea, an idea that we can be a world leader in bioscience. Today
          we are laying the groundwork toward that success, and how exciting
        it is to be here and be a part of it."</p>
      <p>The ceremony drew more than 150 participants
        from around campus, including several state legislators and other state
        dignitaries. The event was
        hosted by Jonathan Fink, ASU's vice president for Research &amp; Economic
        Affairs, and included speakers Frank AtLee, AzBio advisory board chairman,
        Charles Arntzen, AzBio's founding director, and Howard, on behalf of
        Gov. Janet Napolitano, who had a previous engagement out of town. ASU
        President Michael Crow also spoke during the event, delivering his vision
        for the institute and announcing the selection of George Poste to head
        AzBio.</p>
      <p>The new building, slated to open in fall 2004, is the first phase
          of a four-building biodesign corridor, slated as the eastern gateway
          to
          campus. The $69 million, 170,000 square-foot building will include
        flexible modular lab space to allow for rapid changes in the facility's
        use. The
          complex will house researchers and students working at the intersections
          of biology, chemistry, physics, math and engineering, developing pharmaceuticals
          and medical devices for both the developed and developing worlds.</p>
      <p>"Even
          though ASU is one of youngest of the world's research universities,
        it has made a name for itself by being flexible, innovative and interdisciplinary,"
          Fink said. "This complex reflects those same qualities that distinguish
          ASU."</p>
      <p>AtLee, chairman of the board of the Monsanto Company, a leading
          plant biotechnology and genomics company, said AzBio and the new facility
          would
          greatly enhance the university's ability to partner with industry. </p>
      <p>"Research
          partnerships with industry are directly focused on commercial applications
          that will drive new research opportunities for AzBio and
          are a win-win for ASU and Arizona," he said. "This new facility will
          demonstrate to potential industry partners that we have human and facility
          resources to deliver on our research commitments."<br>
        Charles Arntzen, the founding director of the institute, said the new
          facility will help answer the need for new high-tech research space,
          felt by faculty members across campus.</p>
      <p>"As we plan for the four-building
          campus on this site, I can foresee an incredible spurt of new scientific
          activity as the space crunch is
          resolved, and we are only constrained by our imaginations," he said.</p>
      <p>He
          said even though the work is just beginning on the facility, AzBio
        is already helping generate success for the state in terms of partnerships
          with industry and other researchers. He said the institute is working
          closely with Jeffrey Trent of the Translational Genomics Institute
        to
          pursue new federal grants and recruit top scientists in genomics. </p>
      <p>"I'm
          sure this is just the tip of the iceberg as AzBio continues to grow
        and our collaborations in the community expand and mature."</p>
