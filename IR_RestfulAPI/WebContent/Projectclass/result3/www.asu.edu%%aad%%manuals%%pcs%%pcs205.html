However, the buyer does have the option to purchase, pursuant to applicable purchasing policies, vehicles on the open market if the cost is lower than it would be on a state contract.<p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>The university does not have a state contract for the purchase of aircraft or watercraft.  Departments must contact Purchasing and Business Services before preparing requisitions to determine special specifications on such purchases.</td></tr></table><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Electrical Vehicles</b></font><p>Before purchasing electrical vehicles, departments must contact Parking and Transit Services to obtain a university authorized parking space.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Used Vehicles</b></font><p>Before purchasing used vehicles, an individual must obtain approval from their department chair.  Approval may be given in a memo or as a statement on the requisition.<p>Purchasing and Business Services is not obligated to assist the department in purchasing used vehicles unless they are purchased from the Arizona Department of Administration&#146;s Surplus Property Management Office.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Screening for Availability</b></font><p>Screening for availability of existing vehicles within the university must be conducted before a vehicle can be purchased, regardless of the source of funds.  This screening is the responsibility of the acquiring department.  It is the responsibility of both the department and Property Control to screen for vehicles costing more than &#036;20,000.  If the vehicle is available elsewhere on campus, the acquiring department should attempt to purchase the vehicle, share usage, or make arrangements with the custodial department to transfer the vehicle at no cost.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Registration and Title</b></font><p><b>University-owned Vehicles</b><p>Title vests with ASU immediately when a vehicle is purchased with state or local funds.<p>Fleet Service charges a nominal fee to register the vehicle with the state Motor Vehicle Department (MVD) and to add university decals and safety features.  The registration fee is a one-time charge and covers the life of the vehicle.  Registrations are maintained at Fleet Service, and titles are maintained at Surplus Property and Recycling until the vehicle is sold.<p>The department is responsible for registering aircraft and watercraft vehicles with the appropriate state and federal agencies and for maintaining registrations for these vehicles.<p><b>Sponsor-owned Vehicles</b><p>Titles to vehicles purchased with sponsored funds vary depending on the terms of the contract or grant.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Insurance</b></font><p>Each department possessing state-owned vehicles receives a monthly charge for insurance through the Arizona Department of Administration&#146;s Risk Management Division.<p><img src="pcshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Procedures</b></font></center><img src="pcshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Coding Requisitions</b></font><p>When preparing requisitions, use object and commodity code 7810 13 to classify vehicle purchases.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Screening for Availability</b></font><p>Screening for availability of existing vehicles must be conducted as follows:<p><b>Vehicles Costing More than &#036;5,000 but Less than &#036;20,000</b><p>The department must<p><ol><li>Coordinate with the Fleet Service supervisor to determine whether the request(s) for the vehicle can be met with available resources and/or vehicle requirements.</li></ol><p>If a similar vehicle is not available within the university:<p><ol start="2"><li>Contact Purchasing and Business Services to see if a state contract exists for the vehicle being purchased.<p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>Vehicle specifications must be approved by Purchasing and Business Services and Fleet Service.</td></tr></table></li><p><li>Prepare an off-campus purchase request (RX) and obtain necessary approvals.
