      <h2>ASU Announces plan to Improve Quality, Enhance Access </h2>
      <p>As the next step in its evolution from a teachers' college to a young regional university and now to a national research university, Arizona State University has unveiled the blueprint for its future, to improve the quality of all the university's individual colleges and schools and to enhance student access. The plan includes expansion to a new downtown campus in Phoenix. </p>
      <p>"ASU is a public metropolitan research university, and, as such, the profile of our student body, the character of our research enterprise, and the scope of our community engagement differ from that of other institutions," said ASU President Michael M. Crow. "Our objective is to build a comprehensive metropolitan research university with an unparalleled combination of academic excellence and commitment to its social, economic, cultural and environmental setting." </p>
      <p>The plan announced April 8 by Crow will take place in phases that will require three, five, 10 years and longer to complete. However, ASU is prepared to move some programs to downtown Phoenix within a year or two. </p>
      <p>ASU, with some 57,000 students, is the only research university serving metropolitan Phoenix, which is one of the nation's fastest growing urban regions. The university will keep enrollment at its original campus in Tempe at about 50,000 students and build its Polytechnic campus in the East Valley from 3,200 students today to 12,000 to 15,000 students and its West Valley campus from 7,100 students to the 10,000 to 12,000 student level. In addition, ASU plans to have another 12,000 to 15,000 students on the campus to be built in downtown Phoenix, the cornerstone of new mayor Phil Gordon's effort to revitalize the downtown area. </p>
      <p>ASU intends to provide the best possible education for qualified students. To enhance its national competitiveness, ASU plans to increase overall academic excellence through a "school/college-centric" model by which each school and college competes for status, not with other divisions within the university, but rather with peer institutions around the country and around the world. Each school and college will have an opportunity to gain its own competitive status within its own sphere. </p>
      <p>ASU also is dramatically increasing its research infrastructure, adding over one million square feet of research space during the next few years. </p>
      <p>Specific changes announced by President Crow are summarized below. </p>
      <p>I. Moving to the new Capital Center campus in downtown Phoenix are: </p>
      <p>. The College of Nursing, which will also offer programs on the Polytechnic campus and the West campus. </p>
      <p>. The Public College (formerly known as the College of Public Programs) along with its School of Public Affairs, School of Social Work, and The Morrison Institute for Public Policy. </p>
      <p>. The Department of Recreation Management and Tourism will move from the Tempe campus and be renamed the School of Community Service and Development in the Public College. </p>
      <p>. KAET, Channel 8, ASU's PBS television station. </p>
      <p>. The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, which will become a stand-alone school and have facilities contiguous with KAET. </p>
      <p>. The School of Health Management and Policy. </p>
      <p>. The new University College, which will house a new School of Interdisciplinary Studies, the Community College Alliance, and the Extended Education programs. </p>
      <p>. Miscellaneous offerings in business, communication and education will be available on all campuses. </p>
      <p>II. In addition, several schools on the Tempe Campus will expand their programs to other campuses: </p>
      <p>. The College of Architecture and Environmental Design will offer select programs to students on other campuses on a distributed basis. </p>
      <p>. The Herberger College of Fine Arts will develop an arts presence at the Capital Center campus and the Polytechnic campus. </p>
      <p>. The Del E. Webb School of Construction within the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering will offer a Construction Management Program on the Tempe campus and a Construction Technology Program on the Polytechnic campus. </p>
      <p>III. Other enhancements to the Polytechnic campus include: </p>
      <p>. A general engineering program will be developed on the Polytechnic campus. </p>
      <p>. The Physical Education Program will relocate from the Tempe campus to the Polytechnic campus. </p>
      <p>. A new School of Industrial Administration will be developed. </p>
      <p>IV. Other enhancements to the West campus include: </p>
      <p>. The Administration of Justice Program at the West campus will become the School of Criminal Justice and Criminology with administrative responsibility for applied programs in criminal justice. </p>
      <p>. The College of Education on the West Campus will be renamed the College of Teacher Education and Leadership to reflect its mission and strengths. </p>
      <p>. The Recreation and Tourism Management Program will be enhanced on the West campus. </p>
      <p>V. ASU will redesign existing schools or create new ones focusing on the following areas: </p>
      <p>. anthropology and social change; </p>
      <p>. earth sciences: </p>
      <p>. global studies; </p>
      <p>. global health and appropriate technology; </p>
      <p>. sustainability; and </p>
      <p>. family and human development. </p>
      <p>VI. Other decisions include: </p>
      <p>. The College of Law will continue to explore alternate program opportunities. It also should consider opportunities for its existing programs as part of the planning and development of the Capital Center campus. </p>
      <p>. The Hugh Downs School of Human Communication will remain on the Tempe campus. With the relocation of the College of Public Programs to the Capital Center campus, the school will become part of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. </p>
      <p>. Justice Studies on the Tempe campus will be renamed the School of Social Inquiry or some other appropriate name to be more reflective of its academic focus and will decide if it should relocate to the Capital Center campus or become part of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences on the Tempe campus. </p>
      <p>Planning and implementation of this strategy through Arizona Board of Regents and other public and private bodies will begin immediately, and will include acquiring the resources ASU needs to accomplish this transformation. </p>
