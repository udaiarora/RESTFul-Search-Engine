      <h2>Sparky Award to recognize individuals, teams</h2>
      <p>ASU's Department of Intercollegiate Athletics will honor ASU student-athletes for their academic and athletic achievements with a first-ever Sparky Awards ceremony. </p>
      <p>Award categories will include Male/Female Scholar-Athlete of the Year and Male/Female Athlete of the Year. Additionally, 270 student-athletes, who within the past calendar year have achieved a one-semester grade point average of 3.0 or better, will be honored as Maroon &amp; Gold Scholars. </p>
      <p>The ceremony, to be modeled after ESPN's ESPY awards, will feature a keynote address by <em>Sports Illustrated </em> writer Rick Telander and appearances by current and former Sun Devil greats. Also included will be a performance by Arizona's "American Idol" contestant Suzy Vulaca. The ceremony will take place May 2 in Wells Fargo Arena. The doors open at 6:30 p.m. with the event getting under way at 7 p.m. </p>
      <p>A lifetime achievement award will be presented to Bill Kajikawa for his lifelong contribution to Sun Devil Athletics. As an undergraduate, Kajikawa played on ASU's football and baseball teams. Upon graduation in 1937, he began his coaching career at ASU that lasted until retirement in 1978. He served ASU in a variety of roles including freshman football coach, head basketball c oach from 1948 - 57 and head baseball coach from 1947 - 57. He was inducted into the ASU Hall of Distinction in 1982 and in 1995 the Sun Devil football practice facility was named in his honor. </p>
      <p>Also, the Golden Heart Award, given to a student-athlete who has overcome tremendous adversity to return to the field of play, will be given to men's basketball player Justin Allen. Allen was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in September 2000, his sophomore year, and began chemotherapy and radiation therapy treatments that October. Nonetheless, after finishing treatment, he went on to continue his playing career and graduated in four years, earning his B.S. in justice studies in May 2003 with a 3.46 grade point average. He earned Academic All-Pac-10 honors the past two years; has been awarded the Jimmy V. Comeback Award, presented by the Jimmy V. Foundation; and the Gene Autry Courage Award presented by the Tempe Sports Authority and the California Angels. </p>
      <p>Tickets to the ceremony are available and fans wishing to attend should call the Sun Devil ticket office at (480) 965-2381. Tickets cost $10 for adults and $5 for youth and seniors. Tickets will be available through April 30 and must be purchased in advance. ASU faculty, staff and students will be admitted free of charge at the door with their ASU ID. </p>
