		  <dt><u>How do I declare Political Science as a major?</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>Access a &ldquo;Degree&#047;Major&#047;Campus Change Request&rdquo; form on the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/registrar/forms/regforms.html">Registrar&rsquo;s Web site</a> or pick up a form in person at the Registrar&rsquo;s office in the Student Services Building (SSV). Fill out the form as much as you can and call the advising office at 480.965.6551 to schedule an appointment with an advisor.</dd>
		</dl>
		<a name="declare-minor"></a>
		<dl>
		  <dt><u>How do I declare a minor?</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>First, review the minor requirements to make sure you understand what will be expected of you. Requirements are described in the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/catalog/">Arizona State University General Catalog</a> and generally on the department&rsquo;s website. Then, to officially add the minor to your record, you must have completed (or be in the process of completing) 5 of the 6 required courses. Once you have completed this, contact your advisor to request that the minor be added.</dd>
		</dl>
		<a name="dog"></a>
		<dl>
		  <dt><u>What is a Declaration of Graduation and how do I submit one?</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>A Declaration of Graduation (DOG) is a soft contract signed by the student stating that he or she understands the graduation requirements at Arizona State University and plans to take the appropriate coursework to complete his or her degree. The DOG is also signed by the student&rsquo;s academic advisor. When a student files a DOG, he&#047;she &ldquo;locks in&rdquo; a catalog year and may add a minor or a second major. Students in the Political Science Department must complete a Declaration of Graduation during the semester in which they complete their 87th semester hour. After the student is notified that s&#047;he must file a DOG, the student should call 480.965.6551 immediately to schedule an appointment with his or her academic advisor. The paperwork will be completed in the Political Science Department. A more complete description of the DOG (and the older &ldquo;Program of Study&rdquo;) is available in the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/catalog/">Arizona State University General Catalog</a>.</dd>

		<a name="apply-graduation"></a>
		<dl>
		  <dt><u>How do I apply for graduation?</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>During your final semester at ASU, you must file for graduation with the University Graduation Section of the Registrar&rsquo;s Office in the Student Services Building. It is best to file for graduation in the beginning of the semester (<strong>first 4 weeks</strong>). First, go to the Cashiering Services at the Student Services Building (SSV 224). You will be charged an $18 graduation fee. After you pay and fill out a brief survey, you will be directed to the Graduation Section of the Registrar&rsquo;s office (SSV 140). An audit will be run to verify the completion of your degree requirements, and further information (e.g., Commencement ceremony, cap and gown purchase) will be provided. <strong>The deadline to file for graduation for Fall 2006 is October 16th</strong>. If you miss the deadline to file for graduation, you will be assessed a small late fee.</dd>
		</dl>
		<a name="internship"></a>
		<dl>
		  <dt><u>How do I earn credit for an internship?</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>The Political Science Department grants variable credit for internships (POS 484). Professor Thomas Keating is the internship coordinator. All students interested in earning credit for an internship should contact Prof. Keating directly. He can be reached at <a href="mailto:Thomas.keating@asu.edu">Thomas.keating@asu.edu</a> or 480.965.1336. Generally, students can earn up to 12 Internship credits, of which 6 can be applied towards the Political Science degree. Students earn 1 credit hour for 50 hours of work, for a possible total of 300 working hours. The department hosts Capitol Scholars (contact: <a href="mailto:Richard.Herrera@asu.edu">Richard.Herrera@asu.edu</a>) and also has other internship opportunities on our departmental posting board, near the advising offices.</dd>
		</dl>
		<a name="second-degree"></a>
		<dl>
		  <dt><u>How can I earn a second degree?</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>Students who wish to earn two undergraduate degrees may do so, with the permission of the college(s) that offer the degrees. Be sure to review the policies and procedures regarding <a href="http://clas.asu.edu/students/degreerequirements/concurrent.htm">concurrent degrees</a>. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences has one form that students must complete (<a href="http://clas.asu.edu/students/degreerequirements/concurrent.htm">Concurrent Degree Notification form</a>). If students wish to pursue two degrees in two different colleges, the rules and guidelines of each college must be followed. <em>It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to meet with the advisors in the respective departments, and to find out the rules and regulations pursuant to both degree programs</em>.</dd>
		  <dd>Students who already hold a baccalaureate degree, and wish to earn another baccalaureate degree, must apply for admission to ASU. Additionally, students must complete thirty additional hours of resident credit and meet all degree and university requirements for the second degree. Consult advisors in the relevant departments for more information.</dd>

		<a name="incomplete"></a>	
		<dl>
		  <dt><u>What happens with an Incomplete?</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>An instructor can give a grade of &ldquo;I&rdquo; (Incomplete) to a student who is passing a course, but is unable to complete a course because of an illness, death in the family, or other circumstances beyond the student&rsquo;s control. The instructor will likely need documentation from the student stating the special circumstances that prevent him&#047;her from completing the course. It is up to each individual instructor as to the appropriate guidelines for securing an &ldquo;I&rdquo; grade. After one calendar year, an &ldquo;I&rdquo; on a student&rsquo;s academic record <em>automatically</em> changes to an &ldquo;E&rdquo;, so the student must take the initiative to find out the work he&#047;she must complete in order to successfully complete the course within one academic year. <strong>A student should never re-enroll in a course in which he&#047;she has already received an Incomplete</strong>. See the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/catalog/">Arizona State University General Catalog</a> for more information.</dd>
		</dl>
		<a name="withdraw"></a>
		<dl>
		  <dt><u>Can I withdraw from a course?</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>Per the ASU&rsquo;s registrar&rsquo;s site, &ldquo;a student may withdraw with a grade of &quot;W&quot; from one or more classes beginning with the second week of classes through the tenth week of classes for the Fall and Spring semesters. For summer session classes, a student may withdraw with a grade of &quot;W&quot; from one or more classes beginning with the second week of classes through the third week of classes. To withdraw from all classes a student must request a Complete Withdrawal.&rdquo; Students seeking a course withdrawal need to take the following action: access the ASU Interactive website or call SunDial at (480) 350-1500 or fill out a Withdrawal Form and have it processed at any Registration location. The form can be found at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/registrar/forms/pdf/withdrawal.pdf">http:&#047;&#047;www.asu.edu&#047;registrar&#047;forms&#047;pdf&#047;withdrawal.pdf</a>. Instructor approval is no longer required for a course withdraw during this time frame. In order to process a Complete Withdrawal from all of your classes, follow the same procedures stated above.</dd>

		<dl>
		  <dt><u>How can I apply for a medical&#047;compassionate withdrawal?</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>Per the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences website, &ldquo;If you experience a serious illness or injury or other significant personal situation that prevents you from continuing your classes, you may request a medical&#047;compassionate withdrawal. You should first make use of the regular withdrawal procedures, take incompletes or make other arrangements with your instructors if possible. All applications for medical&#047;compassionate withdrawal require thorough and credible documentation. For additional information see the following procedures.&rdquo; For further information regarding medical&#047;compassionate withdrawals, contact Jenny Smith or Barb Colby at 480-965-6506.</dd>

		  <dd>Students on probation normally have one semester to clear up their academic problems. <strong>They must see an advisor in the CLAS Office for Undergraduate Programs to be cleared to register for classes (480.965.6506) once they are placed on probation</strong>. A student who is placed on probation at the end of a semester is subject to disqualification by the college at the end of the following semester if his or her GPA does not improve. A disqualified student is not allowed to register in a fall or spring semester at the University until reinstated. Reinstatement is handled by the CLAS Office for Undergraduate Programs, located in the ASU Foundation Building, Room 110 (480.965.6506).</dd>

		<a name="ap-exams"></a>
		<dl>
		  <dt><u>What credits do I get for Advanced Placement Exams?</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>Yes. If you take the AP exam in either &ldquo;American Government and Politics&rdquo; or &ldquo;Comparative Government and Politics&rdquo; and score a 4 or a 5 on the exam, you will receive credit for POS 110 and POS 150, both required courses for the POS degree. For further information on AP exams, please see page 76 of the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/catalog/">Arizona State University General Catalog</a>.</dd>
		</dl>
		<a name="gpa"></a>
		<dl>
		  <dt><u>How can I calculate my GPA?,</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>Per page 83 of the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/catalog/">Arizona State University General Catalog</a>, &ldquo;grade points are assigned to each of the grades for each semester as follows: A+ = 4.333 points; A = 4.0 points; A- = 3.667 points; B+ = 3.333 points; B = 3 points; B- = 2.667 points; C+ = 2.333 points; C = 2.000 points; D = 1.000 point; and E = 0 points. Grade points earned for a course are multiplied by the number of semester hours to produce honor points. For example, receiving an A, which is assigned four graded points, in a three-semester hour course would produce 12 honor points. The GPA is obtained by dividing the total number of honor points earned by the total number of semester hours graded.&rdquo; <strong>Although it is possible to get a semester GPA that is over 4.0, the cumulative GPA is capped at 4.0.</strong> There are GPA calculators you can use to easily predict your GPA; go to <a href="http://universitycollege.asu.edu/advising/gpa.php">http:&#047;&#047;universitycollege.asu.edu&#047;advising&#047;gpa.php</a> to calculate your semester GPA.

		<dl>
		  <dt><u>I need additional help in my classes. Where can I go for tutoring?</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>First, if you are having trouble in any of your classes, your first contact should be with the professor. Contact the professor either by phone or email and make an appointment to meet with him&#047;her during his&#047;her office hours. Additionally, many professors have teaching assistants (TAs) who also hold office hours, so you should also make an appointment with the TA. If, after contacting both the professor and the TA, you need additional help, you should contact ASU&rsquo;s Learning Resource Center, at 965.6254 or by email at <a href="mailto:TheLRC@asu.edu">TheLRC@asu.edu</a>. Their website is <a href="http://www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/lrc/">http:&#047;&#047;www.asu.edu&#047;studentaffairs&#047;lrc&#047;</a></dd>

		<a name="writing"></a>
		<dl>
		  <dt><u>According to my professor, I need some help with my writing skills. Where can I get help?</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>First, don&rsquo;t be offended or alarmed if a professor suggests you seek additional help with your writing. Writing expectations at a university, such as ASU, are sometimes very different than the writing expectations at your high school. If you get help early, it may make your collegiate experience go quite smoothly. Additionally, you&rsquo;re honing a critical skill that is necessary for any successful professional career or future graduate degree. Fortunately, ASU has a superb resource for students who need extra help with their writing: ASU&rsquo;s Writing Center. Visit their website at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/duas/wcenter/">http:&#047;&#047;www.asu.edu&#047;duas&#047;wcenter&#047;</a>. Their &ldquo;main hub&rdquo; is located in the Language and Literature building, room #340. Their phone number is 965.4272. They also have additional &ldquo;hubs&rdquo; on campus.

		  <dt><u>What can I do with a Political Science degree?</u><b>[ <a href="faq.html">TOP</a> ]</b></dt>
		  <dd>There are many options for you when you earn a Political Science degree. You are gaining a liberal arts education, which means that you have learned much about the world around you, you&rsquo;ve learned how to think critically, write analytically, and articulate your views in a thoughtful manner. Generally, with a liberal arts education, you learn how to think on your own and defend certain positions with the skills you&rsquo;ve gained in research, writing, and thinking. According to the American Political Science Association, &ldquo;Political science students enjoy a versatility of skills and a marvelous range of exciting careers in federal, state and local governments; law; business; international organizations; nonprofit associations and organizations; campaign management and polling; journalism; precollegiate education; electoral politics; research and university and college teaching.&rdquo; You should check out the American Political Science Association&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.apsanet.org/content_3360.cfm">http:&#047;&#047;www.apsanet.org&#047;content_3360.cfm</a> for further information regarding careers for Political Science majors.

		  <dd>DARS (Degree Audit Reporting System) is an automated report which matches courses a student has completed with the requirements of a particular academic degree program. Undergraduate students may review their degree audit with their academic advisor. Students may also request an audit on the ASU web at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/sos/">Student Online Services</a> by selecting <em>Academic Planner or Request&#047;View your Degree Audit</em>. They may request an audit for their declared major or any other major or certificate. From an online audit, students can view course descriptions and see course availability from the Schedule of Classes. In addition to its functions in advisement and academic planning, the degree audit is used as the program of study in the Declaration of Graduation (DOG) process and as the checkout tool for graduation.</dd>

		  <dd class="spacer">In-state (Arizona Community Colleges, NAU, U of A):</dd>
		  <dd class="spacer">A maximum of 64 transferable semester hours completed at a regionally accredited two-year institution may be transferred to ASU. All transferable community college credits are accepted as lower-division credits and do not satisfy upper division <em>General Studies</em> or graduation requirements.</dd>
		  <dd class="spacer">ASU accepts credits for all college level courses with a grade of &quot;C&quot; or better taken at a regionally accredited college or university, providing the courses are not remedial or developmental. An important part of selecting coursework is knowing which degree you wish to pursue. TIP: In order to select courses which will transfer without loss of credit, you should declare your intended major at a point no later than the semester prior to the completion of general education (i.e. after roughly 30 units of coursework.)</dd>
		  <dd class="spacer">If you are uncertain as to how a particular class will transfer to ASU, please visit the Academic Transfer Articulation Office website:</dd>

		  <dd class="spacer">Transfer credits are not evaluated in advance of an offer of admission. In general, ASU accepts credits for all college level courses taken at a regionally accredited college or university, providing the courses are not remedial or developmental. You must receive a grade of &quot;C&quot; or better for them to transfer. The decision on whether courses you've taken will apply to a particular ASU degree program is made upon an offer of admission by the degree program academic advisor. All general studies requirements are reviewed by an advisor in the College of Liberal Arts and Science (480-965-6506).</dd>
		  <dd>All POS courses taken at institutions outside the state of Arizona must be evaluated by a Political Science advisor (480-965-6551). Please bring a copy of the course syllabus or course description to the appointment.</dd>
