This form is used to determine that the prospective contractor is not a university employee, is not related to any university employee who has any connection to the service to be performed, and cannot be considered an employee for tax purposes (for more information, see the <i>Staff Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i><a href="../spp/spp210.html" target="NEW">SPP 210</a>, &#147;Consultants/Independent Contractors&#148;).<p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>This form is not required for lecturers, entertainers, and athletic officials; for individuals doing business under an Employer&#146;s Identification Number; or for companies.</td></tr></table><p>For a copy of the Arizona State University (ASU) Employee/Independent Contractor Determination Checklist, contact ASU at Tempe campus Financial Services tax unit at 480/965&#150;8479 or ASU at West campus Human Resources at 602/543&#150;8400, or download it from the Financial Services or <a href="hrforms.html">Human Resources</a> Web site.<p>ASU Substitute W-9 and Vendor Authorization  (see the <i>Financial Services Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i><a href="../fin/fin421-01.html" target="NEW">FIN 421&#150;01</a>, &#147;Guest Lecturers, Consultants, and Other Independent Contractor&#148;) is required from all firms and individuals being paid more than $100 for services, rentals, royalties, copyright fees, participant stipends, and participant subsistence payments.  This form is required only one time.  To determine if the form has been previously submitted, inquire whether or not the potential contractor is listed in the VEN2 or VEN3 table of Advantage.  If an entry appears in the Tax Ctry field, then a certification form is on file and a new one need not be submitted.  If there is no entry in the Tax Ctry field, then an Guest Lecturers, Consultants, and Other Independent Contractor must be completed and sent to Purchasing and Business Services, USB (mail code 5212), before a payment can be made.  For information on independent contractor payments made to nonresident aliens or foreign partnerships/corporations, see the <i>Financial Services Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i>FIN 425&#150;04.<p>With the exception of construction-related services, the expected dollar amount to be paid to the contractor determines whether or not a contract may be executed by the department.  If the amount, not including expenses, is less than $5,000, the department may select the firm or individual to perform the services.  The selection for services must be made on the basis of the best qualified contractor at a fair and reasonable price.  The department and the proposed contractor complete a <a href="purforms.html">Departmental Professional Services Order</a>. Payment is made by completing a Payment Voucher (PV), submitting it with the Departmental Professional Services Order, and by completing the Arizona State University (ASU) Employee/Independent Contractor Determination Checklist, if necessary, and submitting it to Payables and Reimbursements.
