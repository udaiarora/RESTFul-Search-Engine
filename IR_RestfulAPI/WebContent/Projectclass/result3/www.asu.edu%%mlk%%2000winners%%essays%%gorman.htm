        my grandfather.<br>
        A strong Navajo man,<br>
        who accomplished many goals,<br>
        encouraged moving forward,<br>
        and held traditional beliefs.<br>
        his hands<br>
        wringled,<br>
        cracked,<br>
        cover his face like a mask.<br>
        He peers out upon<br>
        those who now, take his place.<br>
        He served many people,<br>
        his country,<br>
        those in battle,<br>
        the Dine people and culture,<br>
        but most loyally,<br>
        his family.<br>
        He sits at home in his veteran's house<br>
        awaiting the next<br>
        football game.<br>
        Yet, he has contributed<br>
        to his people more<br>
        than they might see.<br>
        A man at home, tired<br>
        who had once shaken the hand<br>
        of a president years before,<br>
        has what every hero truly needs,<br>
        A home and <br>
        a loving family.<br>
        He has the life many <br>
        Navajo men desire.<br>
        To have seen the world,<br>
        survived a war,<br>
        become a respected councilman,<br>
        and to be loved endlessly by<br>
        those around him.</font></p>
