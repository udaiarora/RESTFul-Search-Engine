    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This appendix contains MVS-specific
    information related to moving your files from an MVS system to
    a non-MVS system. For example purposes, UNIX is the target non-MVS
    system, and ftp is the utility used to transfer files between
    systems.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Select Files to be Transferred</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The first task is to determine
    which files you want to transfer. There may be files which are
    no longer needed. Some files, such as an MVS binary executable
    file (load module), are of no use on a non-MVS system and should
    not be transferred. (For a binary executable, you would transfer
    the original source code, not the executable, and then recompile.)
    Other files need reformatting prior to transfer, else they will
    be unusable on the new system. Files in this latter category
    include SPSS save files, SAS system files, WYLBUR edit format
    files, and TSO packed format files, each of which will be discussed
    in this document.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Various file attributes, listed
    in the table below, affect the file transfer process. Only disk
    files can be transferred via ftp. Archived files and tape files
    must be copied to disk (hence, becoming disk files) before ftp
    can be used to transfer them; therefore, any discussion regarding
    disk files also pertain to archived files and tape files.</FONT></P>

    Alternately, you can use TSO's ISPF option 3.4 to display the
    same information; however, ISPF can only show the information
    for one naming convention at a time. That is, ISPF can show information
    for data sets with TSO-type names or with WYLBUR-type names but
    not both at the same time. The batch job prints information for
    both types at the same time.</FONT></P>

    requires the first three qualifiers to be &quot;WYL&quot;, &quot;xx&quot;,
    and &quot;yyy&quot; respectively, where &quot;WYL&quot; is a
    literal, &quot;xx&quot; and &quot;yyy&quot; are the first two

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Most people do not know what
    WYLBUR edit format is: It is a compressed form of character data.
    You must look at a file's DCB characteristics to determine whether
    it is in WYLBUR edit format.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If the file has RECFM=U and an

    BLKSIZE=6233, or LRECL=7476 and BLKSIZE=7476, or occasionally
    with LRECL=0), the file is in WYLBUR edit format. Such files
    must be converted to variable format prior to transfer. (Note:
    Load module libraries also use RECFM=U and LRECL=0.)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">To convert a data set (sequential
    or partitioned) from WYLBUR edit format to variable format, use
    TSO's ISPF option 3.4 to display a list of data sets. Enter <B>%UNPRESS</B>
    next to the name of each data set to be converted. (You will
    not &quot;hurt&quot; anything if you try to &quot;unpress&quot;
    a file which is not in WYLBUR edit format.)</FONT></P>

    quota, correct the problem before using %UNPRESS.)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">(Note: Due to the compression
    of WYLBUR edit format files, such files always contain both character
    and binary data. If you transfer a WYLBUR edit format file as
    character, the binary data will be corrupted. If you transfer
    the file as binary, the character data will be corrupted. Hence,
    you must convert a WYLBUR edit format file to variable format
    and then transfer the variable format version.) </FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Very few people have VSAM files.
    These are files containing records which can be accessed by key

    is used to create such files. If you are unsure whether a particular
    file is in VSAM format, use TSO's ISPF option 3.4 to display
    a list of files. VSAM files will be annotated with the phrase
    *VSAM* for a volume serial number or may have question marks
    (?) in place of the LRECL BLKSIZE, or RECFM.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">VSAM files cannot be transferred

    formats for ftp.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You should also consider whether
    to retain trailing blanks when transferring a fixed format file.
    Records in fixed format files often contain blanks at the end of
    one or more records. To retain trailing blanks, specify the ftp

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is easy to transfer sequential
    data sets via ftp; however, you must remember to reformat (if
    needed) the data set before transfer and to use the correct <B>binary</B>
    or <B>ascii</B> ftp command. If you fail to do this, the sequential
    data sets will successfully transfer but will be unusable. Consequently,
    you should verify the data on the target system after transfer
    is complete.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Additionally, you should organize
    your data in some fashion on the target system. This can be most

    Sets</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is easy to transfer all members
    of a partitioned data set via ftp; however, you must remember
    to reformat (if needed) the data set before transfer and to use
    the correct binary or ascii ftp command. If you fail to do this,
    the members will successfully transfer but will be unusable.
    You should verify the data on the target system after transfer
    is complete.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Additionally, you should organize
    your data in some fashion on the target system. This can be most
    easily done by creating a separate sub directory on the target
    system for each partitioned data set and then changing to the
    appropriate sub directory prior to transferring the members.
    This avoids problems with members having duplicate names.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The above example illustrates
    transferring members from one partitioned data set. You could

<A NAME="archived files"></A>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Archived Files</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You must restore archived files
    to disk before they can be transferred via ftp. After an archived
    file has been restored to disk, it can be transferred in the
    same manner as any other disk file.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Use TSO's ISPF option 3.4 to
    perform any operation (e.g., edit, browse) on the archived file.
    The system will automatically prompt you with 3 questions: do
    you want to restore the file (answer Y for yes); do you want
    an immediate or deferred restore (answer I for immediate); do
    you want to wait (answer N for no). Press enter after answering
    each question and after seeing a prompt of three asterisks (***).
    Ignore any error message you may receive and blank out the original
    command you used for the file. You may proceed to do other work.
    Automatic notification will be sent to your terminal after the
    restore is complete. If the restore complets while you are in
    ISPF 3.4, you need to exit the display list menu and then re-enter
    it before the restored file can be accessed.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When working with archived files,
    it is usually easier to work with a few files at a time rather
    than restore all files at once, particularly if you are already
    using most of your disk quota. (You also need sufficient disk
    space on the target system to receive transferred files.)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Note: The act of restoring a
    file does not update its date of last access. If you restore
    many files and do not access all of them prior to the weekend,
    any unaccessed files will be rearchived. </FONT></P>

<A NAME="tape files"></A>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Tape Files</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Tape files cannot be transferred

    can occur. After a tape file has been copied to disk, ftp can
    be used to transfer the file in the same manner as any other
    disk file.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You can use your own jobs for
    copying tape files to disk, or you can use some sample jobs available
    in TSO. To access the sample jobs you must edit a file, then
    on the command line enter the following two commands; the latter
    command also requires a target (an A or B in the line number
    field) to indicate after/before which line the sample job should
    be inserted.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">For a large tape file which exceeds
    your disk quota, you can use UNIT=FTP instead of UNIT=RESRCH
    for copying the tape file to a temporary disk, which does not
    count against your disk quota; however, you should then move
    the file from the temporary disk to the target system that same
    day since the temporary disk is erased each night.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you've forgotten what files
    or how many files you have on tape (provided the tape is labeled),
    you can run the following job to create a tape map. (Tape maps
    cannot be created for non-labeled tapes. For non-labeled tapes,
    you should refer to any written documentation you've kept regarding

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Disk space is measured in tracks
    for MVS and in megabytes for UNIX. For an approximate conversion
    between the two units of measure, use the formula &quot;1 track

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This formula will actually provide
