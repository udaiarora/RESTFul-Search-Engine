The academic profiles of Barrett students are comparable         to students at our nation&#8217;s most selective institutions. With three         Rhodes Scholars since 1995, nine Marshall Scholars since 1991, and students         holding many other prestigious awards, Barrett students are among the         most outstanding in the nation.</p>      <p> This model will be expanded at ASU in two principal ways. First, as         a university-wide program, the Barrett Honors College will be enhanced,         expanded, and refined. Second, we plan to build a new complex of buildings         for Barrett on our main campus, a new residential college that will consolidate         the learning environment and unique identity of Barrett. As a residentially-based         learning environment, Barrett will become second to none, and offer the         best and brightest students in Arizona a place to call their own. <br>      </p></td>    <td align="center" valign="top"> &nbsp;<BR> </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
