          <h2>USC&rsquo;s Love takes charge as ASU&rsquo;s athletics director </h2>
          <p> <img src="campus_images/love1.jpg" width="216" height="257" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right">ASU President Michael Crow has selected Lisa Love of the University of Southern California (USC) to serve as the new vice president for university athletics. </p>
          <p> Love, who becomes ASU&rsquo;s 21st athletics director, will take over for Christine Wilkinson, a senior vice president for the university who has been serving as interim athletics director since April 8. Former athletics director Gene Smith left the university April 8 for a similar post at Ohio State University. </p>
          <p> Love, who will begin her new role July 1, has served as the senior associate athletics director at USC since 2002. She handles day-to-day supervision of eight sports &ndash; including women&rsquo;s basketball, volleyball, tennis, and men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s swimming and diving &ndash; and monitors all women&rsquo;s sports at the university. She is active in the department&rsquo;s strategic planning, gender equity, civil rights and NCAA certification issues, and she serves on the NCAA Management Council. Love led a very successful volleyball program as USC&rsquo;s head volleyball coach. She also served two stints (1992 &ndash; 1993 and 2001 &ndash; 2002) as vice president of the Pac-10 Conference. </p>
          <p> Crow says Love brings qualities and experience that will carry ASU&rsquo;s athletics department to championships and excellence. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;We conducted an extensive search through an excellent pool of national candidates and interviewed many candidates including several sitting athletics directors of BCS Conference schools,&rdquo; Crow says. &ldquo;Lisa was our first choice. Lisa has the energy, competitiveness and drive to move ASU&rsquo;s athletics department into the next level. Her philosophy for success will be instrumental in building ASU&rsquo;s athletics department through student achievement, community engagement and winning.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Love says her experience &ndash; and Crow&rsquo;s vision for the university &ndash; will serve as her foundation as she steps into her new role at ASU. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been involved for the past 15 years in turning around the athletics program at USC,&rdquo; Love says. &ldquo;I know what it takes to build a champion. Acknowledging the importance of fundraising, student achievement while complying with the appropriate rules and the pursuit of winning championships are all key factors to having a successful athletics program.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Love plans to establish model programs at ASU by embracing the traditions of ASU and aggressively pursuing championships. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Having been involved with a competitor of Arizona State University, I am well aware of the talented people who work in the athletics department and the tradition they bring to this university&rsquo;s sports program,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;To make this an ideal program, we will need the leadership of our master teachers &ndash; our coaches &ndash; and the achievement, on the field and in the classroom, of our student-athletes.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Community members, university representatives and athletic opponents applauded the selection of Love as ASU&rsquo;s new vice president of athletics. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great selection, and she has been a strong contributor to the success of USC,&rdquo; says Pete Carroll, head football coach at USC. &ldquo;She really understands the world of coaching and she has played a key role in the success of our program.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Arizona State made a great pick,&rdquo; says Mike Garrett, USC&rsquo;s athletics director. &ldquo;Lisa will knock everyone&rsquo;s socks off. I see nothing but success for her at Arizona State. She&rsquo;s a great communicator and a real people&rsquo;s person. She&rsquo;ll pick great coaches and employees and she&rsquo;ll manage that department in a way that people will feel very good about being at Arizona State.&rdquo;</p>
