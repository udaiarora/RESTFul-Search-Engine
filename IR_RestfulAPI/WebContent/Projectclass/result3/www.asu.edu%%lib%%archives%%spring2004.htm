  <p>The programs shared the expense for a non-profit organization; the American

    its ASU banner; and some very generous people came to spend a delightful
  day and help promote ASU Indian programs.
  <p>
  On display was Wicazo-sa Review: Journal of American Indian Studies (now edited
  and produced at ASU), and the Journal of American Indian Education, which is
  produced by the Center for Indian Education.

  Some 220 individuals stopped by the booth to pick up handouts and brochures
  describing the various programs at ASU. Many showed an interest in Nursing,
  while others asked questions about admissions, class schedules, and more. A
    number
were
interested in attending ASU. Some 80 individuals signed up for a free raffle
of four books donated by professors
  Peter Iverson and Laura Tohe.

<p>He noted that &#8220;Father Schwarz&#8217;s photographs provide rare visual
  documentation of Catholic missionary activities among Arizona Indians in the
  first half of the twentieth century. They will be of interest to anthropologists,
  ethnohistorians, and historians of religion and archetecture in the American
  Southwest . . . Mission to Arizona should serve as a model for archivists seking
to make their visual collections more widely known and accessible.&#8221;

  Back in 1992, an ASU survey showed that Valley residents had little knowledge
  of ASU, its programs, and its importance to the community. President, Lattie
  Coor, came up with the idea of the &#8220;Sneaker Tours&#8221; in order to
  increase awareness and develop lasting relationships with members of the community.<p>
  The Office of Public Affairs, Community and Constituent Relations, is responsible
  for scheduling. That office sends invitations to local leaders and offers tours
  of selected schools/departments on campus. Public Affairs provides guides,
  and following tours, lunch and a round-table discussion.<p>
  For example, the Center welcomed participants from the HOPE VI PROJECT, City
  of Phoenix, which included he Mayor of Queen Creek; Commander, Phoenix Police
  Department; a columnist from the Arizona Republic; and representatives from
  the Morrison Institute of Public Policy. <p>
  At the Center we discuss its mission to support the numerous programs at ASU
  and the importance of libraries and archives to Native people. We always include
examples of our books, manuscripts, and photographs.</p>
