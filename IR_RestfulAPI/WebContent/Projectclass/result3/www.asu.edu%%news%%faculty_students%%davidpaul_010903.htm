      <h2>Accessible education - Group helps blind student navigate through degree 
        program</h2>
      <p> For David Paul, each day is filled with learning and discovery. The 
        computer science engineering freshman can see a world of opportunity before 
        him, despite the fact he is completely blind.</p>
      <p>Paul is one of two visually impaired students working toward a degree 
        in computer science engineering, in a special program designed to create 
        a paperless interactive classroom environment. The program, iCARE (information 
        technology Centric Assistive &amp; Rehabilitative Environment), is led 
        by Engineering Professor Sethuraman Panchanathan and a team of others 
        from throughout the university, using a blend of technology, low-tech 
        concepts and support to make the degree path more accessible.</p>
      <p>To date, no visually impaired student has completed a computer engineering 
        degree at ASU, due in part to the intense reading, math and hands-on skills 
        needed for the degree.</p>
      <p>"If you think about it, there is a lot that goes on visually in the program," 
        says Terri Hedgpeth, student support specialist, senior, with ASU Disability 
        Resources for Students (DRS). "Computer science is primarily symbolic 
        and visual, so there are a lot of obstacles for a student who is blind 
        to navigate."</p>
      <p>Paul, however, is becoming accustomed to obstacles. The biggest came 
        on Thanksgiving Day in 1998, while returning to the Valley from Las Vegas. 
        His car veered across the center lane and collided with an 18-wheeler. 
        No alcohol or drugs were in his system, and he believes he just fell asleep. 
        He suffered a severe head injury in the visual cortex of his brain that 
        caused blindness and injuries to both legs that resulted in amputation.</p>
      <p>After several months in a coma and a year of hospital stays and visits, 
        Paul started to move forward again with his life. He learned to read Braille 
        with his mother and attended a local training program that taught him 
        a computer program that converted text into audio and used key commands 
        in place of a mouse.</p>
      <p>In fall 2000, Paul enrolled in the College of Business, although he wasn't 
        sure what he wanted to pursue. While at ASU, he began working with DRS 
        and Hedgpeth. She saw that Paul had incredible will and was determined 
        to succeed, so she recommended him as the first student for Panchanathan's 
        program.</p>
      <p>"It was such an opportunity, I would have been crazy to pass it up," 
        Paul says. "When the accident first happened, I wasn't sure what I would 
        be able to do. Now, every day is fantastic."</p>
      <p>Panchanathan, director of the Research Center for Ubiquitous Computing 
        and interim department chairman of computer science engineering, had his 
        team of researchers and students develop a fully accessible, wireless 
        laptop for Paul. With it, he can access all of his course materials and 
        notes on a dedicated server. The laptop has software to convert all of 
        its text to audio, so Paul can listen to it through headphones in class. 
        The team is working toward adding a refreshable Braille display. Also 
        in the works is a "reader" that when pointed at any text and will either 
        output audibly or through a Braille keypad.</p>
      <p>Panchanathan also partners with Hedgpeth and DRS, along with Paul's instructors 
        to make the program work. The group meets regularly to discuss any obstacles 
        in providing notes or presenting visual aids created for sighted students 
        in a form Paul can access. Paul's parents, Carol and David, who help guide 
        Paul to and from class, also attend the meetings.</p>
      <p>Most charts and graphs needed for his classes are printed on a special 
        paper, that when heated, produces raised bumps in areas of text or shading. 
        In other cases, instructors such as Cynthia Bolton in philosophy have 
        made homemade diagrams using lima beans to denote shading.</p>
      <p>The program has helped transform Paul into part guinea pig, part pioneer. 
        As he goes through it, Paul is able to help Panchanathan understand what 
        works best and make suggestions for future improvements. Panchanathan 
        intends for Paul to be helping develop new devices for the program by 
        the time he is a junior.</p>
      <p>For Panchanathan, helping the visually impaired has become his new mission, 
        wrapped around a challenging research question. He says his research focus 
        has centered on processing digital images for those with sight. But the 
        idea of processing those images for someone who is blind makes for an 
        even greater challenge.</p>
      <p>"It is a great opportunity to do something difficult and to help people," 
        he says. "I've always felt if my technology is not useful to people, it's 
        not really worth it."</p>
