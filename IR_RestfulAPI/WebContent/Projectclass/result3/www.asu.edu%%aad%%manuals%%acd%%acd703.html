The Human Resources Department will expedite the final payroll check and insurance claim by assisting the family and department in the preparation of necessary forms.  To reduce confusion, units are requested to coordinate all assistance with the Human Resources Department.  For advice on matters such as life insurance and retirement benefits, the family should be referred to the Human Resources Department.<P>If death occurs as a result of an accident during the course of employment, the unit chair/director should confer with the director of Human Resources and file an Industrial Commission Accident Report form for workers&#146; compensation.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Death of a Family Member</B></FONT><P>In the event of the death of a member of the immediate family of a faculty member or academic professional, the unit chair/director or division head should notify the President&#146;s Office.<P>&#160;<P><HR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">ACD</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="acd001.html">contact</A> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="provost.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
