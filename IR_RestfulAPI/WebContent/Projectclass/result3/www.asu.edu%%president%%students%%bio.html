  <h1>Who is Michael Crow? </h1>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Michael Crow became president of Arizona State University on July 1, 2002.  He is guiding the transformation of ASU into one of the nation&rsquo;s leading public metropolitan research universities, one that is directly engaged in the economic, social, and cultural vitality of its region.  Under his direction the university pursues teaching, research, and creative excellence focused on the major challenges and questions of our time, as well as those central to the building of a sustainable environment and economy for Arizona.  He has committed the university to global engagement, and to setting a new standard for public service. </p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Since he took office, ASU has marked a number of important milestones, including the establishment of major interdisciplinary research initiatives such as the Biodesign Institute; the International Institute for Sustainability; and MacroTechnology Works, a program integrating science and technology for large-scale applications, including the Flexible Display Center, a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Army.  Under his direction ASU has initiated a dramatic research infrastructure expansion to create more than one million square feet of new research space, and has announced naming gifts endowing the W. P. Carey School of Business, the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, and the Virginia G. Piper Center for Creative Writing. </p>
  <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Prior to joining ASU, he was executive vice provost of Columbia University, where he also was professor of science and technology policy in the School of International and Public Affairs.  As chief strategist of Columbia&rsquo;s research enterprise, he led technology and innovation transfer operations, establishing Columbia Innovation Enterprises (now Science and Technology Ventures), the Strategic Initiative Program, and the Columbia Digital Media Initiative, as well as advancing interdisciplinary program development. </p>
  <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">He played the lead role in the creation of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, and helped found the Center for Science, Policy, and Outcomes (CSPO) in Washington, D.C., a think tank dedicated to linking science and technology to desired social, economic, and environmental outcomes.  In 2003 CSPO was reestablished at ASU as the Consortium for Science, Policy, and Outcomes. </p>
  <p style="margin-top:0;">Dr. Crow has been a senior adviser to the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce on matters of science and technology policy in areas related to intelligence and national security.  He is the author of books and articles relating to the analysis of research organizations, technology transfer, science and technology policy, and the practice and theory of public policy.</p>
