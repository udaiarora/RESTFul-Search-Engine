      <h2><B>ASU to Host Discussion on the Politicization of Science </B></h2>
      <p>Stem cell research&hellip;. climate change&hellip;. genetically-modified organisms&hellip;. nanotechnology&hellip;. Lately, science is more at home in the political section of the newspaper than on the science pages.</p>
      <p>It is a rare thing indeed for science policy to be high on the national political agenda, but the ongoing controversy over the politicization of science in the Bush Administration has received significant coverage in the national media.&nbsp; Do politics have a larger impact on science under the current administration than under previous ones? Is scientific purity possible - or desirable - when the political stakes are high? </p>
      <p>To explore the origins and meaning of this controversy, the Arizona State University&rsquo;s Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes and the Center for the Study of Law, Science, and Technology will host a panel discussion on<B> Wednesday, October 13</B> in conjunction with the third and final presidential debate, which is being held at ASU&rsquo;s Tempe Campus. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;<B>Science Defiled - Or Politics as Usual?</B>&rdquo; will highlight a panel of experts and policy makers from inside and outside the Beltway on the role of science in the political arena.<B> The free public event is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. in Armstrong Hall Room 116. </B></p>
      <p>The panel of science policy experts and policy makers includes: </p>
      <p>Charles Arntzen, Director of the Center for Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology in the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, and Florence Ely Nelson&nbsp; Presidential Chair, Arizona State University; Member of the President's Council of Advisors on Science &amp; Technology</p>
      <p>Shelley Fidler, Principal, Van Ness Feldman; Former Chief of Staff to the President&rsquo;s Council on Environmental Quality and Principal Deputy at the White  House Climate Change Task Force</p>
      <p>Henry Miller, Research Fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Former Director of the Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s Office of Biotechnology</p>
      <p>Roger Pielke, Director, Center for Science and Technology Policy Research, University of Colorado </p>
      <p>This interactive discussion will be moderated by Robert Melnick, the Director of ASU&rsquo;s Morrison Institute for Public Policy. </p>
      <p>The event is free and open to the public. To RSVP, email <a href="mailto:cspo@asu.edu">cspo@asu.edu</a> or call 480-727-8787. Press interested in attending the conference should call 480-727-8787 in advance to arrange for interviews. For more information visit <a href="http://www.cspo.org">www.cspo.org</a> or contact the Consortium at 480-727-8787 or cspo@asu.edu.</p>

      The mission of the<B> Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes</B> at Arizona State University is to ensure that science and technology move forward in harmony with broader public goals and aspirations. CSPO aims to enhance the contribution of science and technology to society's pursuit of equality, justice, freedom, and overall quality of life. The Consortium creates knowledge and methods, cultivates public discourse, and fosters policies to help decision makers and institutions grapple with the immense power and importance of science and technology as society charts a course for the future. www.cspo.org </p><p>The<B> Center for the Study of Law, Science, and Technology</B> seeks to contribute to the legal system's response to the pervasive and increasing challenges posed by new scientific discoveries and their technological applications. The Center seeks to improve the quality of law and public policy affecting science and technology and supports work in an important reciprocal vein: the scientific study and understanding of law, legal institutions and legal process. The Center encourages interdisciplinary research; promotes development and review of the College of Law curriculum; and provides service for law students, attorneys and others.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.law.asu.edu/?folderid=2720"

      <p>The<B> Center for Biology and Society</B> promotes research on the conceptual foundations of the biosciences and their interactions with society, through the exploration of Bioethics, Biopolicy, Biology and Law, History and Philosophy of Science, and Sociology of Science. We bring together dispersed research and outreach activities relating to the interactions of the life sciences and society, providing a dynamic locus that expands opportunities for intellectual ferment and increased visibility and funding by creating synergistic collaborations and communication.<U> <FONT color=#0000ff>&lt;<A

      <p><B>Past Comments by Panel Participants:</B> </p>
      <p>Politicians increasingly claim that&nbsp; policies and decisions need to be based on &ldquo;sound science,&rdquo; but panelist Roger Pielke notes that &ldquo;putting the onus of problem resolution onto science brings all the messy realities of politics into the practice of science. Rather than making politics more scientific, this approach, in fact, makes science more political.&rdquo; </p>
      <p><B>Henry Miller, Hoover Institution, Stanford University</B> says: &ldquo;There appears little likelihood that in the foreseeable future science policy will become less politicized or more rational and progressive.&nbsp; There is no important constituency for sound science policy.&nbsp; On the contrary, politicization often represents merely pandering to the fears, which sometimes verge on superstition, of a scientifically illiterate and statistics-phobic public.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The politicization of science has been much criticized lately; however, Miller notes that &ldquo;these critics seem to have experienced overnight epiphanies.&nbsp; Not one of them was publicly censorious of the Clinton administration&rsquo;s blatant and heavy-handed perversion of science.&rdquo;</p>
      <p><B>Charles Arntzen</B>&nbsp; notes: &ldquo;In academic science, we pursue absolute truth and don't like to draw hard conclusions until we get very close to that goal.&nbsp; In contrast, science-based business decisions often need to be made on the basis of incomplete data in order to get a product to the marketplace.&nbsp; Political science policy making is even farther away from the academic model; legislators have to accept large uncertainties on risks and benefits of technology and still make decisions on regulation, taxation or funding of science.&nbsp;&nbsp; One result is a lot of &lsquo;second guessing&rsquo; that is rarely of much constructive value.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>      <B>Roger Pielke</B> has said: &ldquo;Assessing the significance of science for policy requires a clear distinction of policy analysis from political advocacy.&rdquo;</p>
