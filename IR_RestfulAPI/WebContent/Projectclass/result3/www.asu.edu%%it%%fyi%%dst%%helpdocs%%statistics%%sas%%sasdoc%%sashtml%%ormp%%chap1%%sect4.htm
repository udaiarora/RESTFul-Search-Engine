<H2>PROC NETFLOW  </H2>
<P>Constrained network models describe a wide variety
of real-world applications ranging from production, inventory, and
distribution problems to financial applications.
These problems can be solved with the NETFLOW procedure.
<P>These models are conceptionally easy since they are
based on network diagrams that represent the problem pictorially.
This procedure accepts the network specification in a
format that is particularly suited to networks. 
This not only simplifies 
problem description but also aids in the interpretation of
the solution.
<P>Certain algebraic features of networks are exploited by a specialized
version of the Simplex method so that solution times are reduced.
Another class of optimization algorithm, the Interior Point algorithm,
has been implemented in PROC NETFLOW and can be used as an alternative to the Simplex
algorithm to solve network problems.
<P>Should NETFLOW detect there are no arcs and nodes in the model's data,
(that is, there is no network component),
it solves a linear programming (LP) problem.
The Interior Point algorithm is automatically elected to perform the optimization.
NETFLOW's ability to solve LP problems is an important ability new for the
Version 7 release of the SAS System.
<P><H3><I>Networks and the Simplex Network Algorithm</I></H3>
PROC NETFLOW's network Simplex algorithm 
solves pure network flow problems and
network flow problems with linear side constraints.
The side constraints can have variables directly related to the
network (called <I>arc variables</I>) as well as variables 
(called <I>nonarc variables</I>) that have nothing to do with the
network.
The procedure accepts the network specification in a 
format that is particularly suited to networks.
Although network problems could be solved by PROC LP, the
NETFLOW procedure generally solves network flow problems more
efficiently than PROC LP.
<P>Network flow problems, such as finding the minimum cost
flow in a network, require model representation in a format
that is simpler than PROC LP. 
The network is represented in two data sets: 
a node data set that names the nodes in the network and
gives supply and demand information at them, and 
an arc data set that defines the arcs in the network
using the node names and gives arc costs and capacities.
In addition, a side-constraint data set is included that gives any side constraints
that apply to the flow through the network.
Examples of these are found later in this chapter.

<P><A NAME="idxint0008">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxint0009">&#13;</A>The constraint data contains constraints that are not 
network flow conservation constraints.
These can be specified in either the
sparse or dense input formats.
This is the same format that is used by PROC LP so that any 
of the model building techniques that apply to models for PROC LP
also apply for network flow models having side constraints.
<P>The NETFLOW procedure saves solutions in four data
sets. Two of these store solutions
for the pure network model, ignoring the restrictions imposed
by the side constraints.
The remaining two data sets
contain the solutions to the network flow problem when the
side contraints apply.
<P><H3><I>Network and Linear Programs solved by the Interior Point algorithm</I></H3>
The Simplex algorithm, developed shortly after World War II, was the 
main method used to solve Linear Programming problems.
Over the last decade, the Interior Point algorithm has been 
developed to also solve Linear Programming problems.
From the start it showed great theoretical promise, and considerable 
research in the area resulted in practical implementations that performed 
competivitely with the Simplex algorithm.
More recently, Interior Point algorithms have evolved to become
superior to the Simplex algorithm, in general,
especially when the problems are large.
<P>The Interior Point algorithm has been implemented in PROC NETFLOW.
This algorithm solves Linear Programs, as well as
network problems. When PROC NETFLOW detects
that the problem has no network component, it automatically envokes 
the Interior Point aglorithm to solve the problem.
The data required by PROC NETFLOW for a Linear Program resembles
the data for nonarc variables and constraints for
constrained network problems.
It also is similar to the data required by PROC LP.
<P>The LP is represented in one or two data sets:
a data set that defines the variables in the LP
using variable names and gives objective function coefficents 
and upper and lower bounds.
In addition, a constraint data set can be includedthat gives any constraints.

<P><A NAME="idxint0011">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxint0012">&#13;</A>When solving a constrained network problem, indicate that
the Interior Point algorithm is to be used by specifying 
the INTPOINT option. The input data is the same
whether the Simplex or Interior Point method is used. 
In other aspects of how PROC NETFLOW is used, there are only minor changes.
The output, particularly the CONOUT data set where the solution is sent,
is similar no matter which
optimizer is used.
The Interior Point method is often faster when problems have many side 
constraints.
