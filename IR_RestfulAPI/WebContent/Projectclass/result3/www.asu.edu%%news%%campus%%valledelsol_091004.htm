      <h2>Five ASU alumni honored by Valle del Sol </h2>
      <p>Five ASU alumni are being honored at this year&rsquo;s Profiles of Success awards ceremony. The annual celebration, sponsored by Valle del Sol, recognizes remarkable leadership service in the Hispanic community.</p>
      <p>State Sen. Peter R&iacute;os will receive the Hall of Fame award. He received his bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degrees from ASU.</p>
      <p>R&iacute;os overcame great personal hardship to become the first Hispanic to serve as president of the Arizona State Senate. During his time as a legislator, he has helped provide countless programs, including much-needed funding for rural emergency services.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;(I came) from 14 children &hellip; wasn&rsquo;t supposed to graduate from the university and wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be a state senator for 20 years,&rdquo; R&iacute;os says. &ldquo;I am greatly honored by the recognition.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The Hispanic Leadership Awards Celebration, scheduled for Sept. 10 at the Phoenix Civic Plaza, also will honor Sandra Zapien-Ferrero. </p>
      <p>Zapien-Ferrero, an Exemplary Leadership Award recipient, was the first Latina elected to the Scottsdale Unified School District Board. She received her bachelor of arts degree in elementary education from ASU. She serves as president of the district board, where she fights to ensure funding for the needs of Latino students in the Scottsdale area.</p>
      <p>Carlos Duarte Herrera is a Ph.D. candidate at ASU in social and cultural anthropology. He will be honored with the Latino Advocacy Champion Award for his work as a community organizer for the United Union of Roofers. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;I have been very successful in my work, thanks to my academic preparation at ASU,&rdquo; Herrera says. &ldquo;It has helped me to be much more effective.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Herrera has mediated negotiations between union workers and their companies, and he also has improved the leadership of the local union.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You develop leaders so they can stand for themselves,&rdquo; he says.</p>
      <p>Anita Favela Luera was the first woman to serve as the news director of a Phoenix news station. She received her bachelor of arts degree in broadcasting at ASU in 1977. For her work in the Hispanic community, she will receive the Rosa Carillo Torres Humanitarian Award. Luera says the award is particularly sentimental, because she worked with Torres for several years at the Univision station affiliate in Phoenix.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It was definitely an honor and a challenge,&rdquo; Luera says. &ldquo;I wake up every day and ask myself, &lsquo;What am I doing to carry on her spirit in the community?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
      <p>Janey Pearl graduated in May from ASU with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in interdisciplinary studies. She will be recognized with the Manuel L. Ortega Youth Leadership Award. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;The work I&rsquo;ve done is because of the people who have inspired me, the people who have taught me,&rdquo; Pearl says. &ldquo;What keeps me going is knowing there&rsquo;s a lot more work to be done &hellip; fights to still be fought.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> Pearl &rsquo;s passion for changing lives and educating others about diversity, equality and respect is showcased in her leadership with various community organizations. She is attends ASU as a non-degree student, continuing her advocacy work. </p>
