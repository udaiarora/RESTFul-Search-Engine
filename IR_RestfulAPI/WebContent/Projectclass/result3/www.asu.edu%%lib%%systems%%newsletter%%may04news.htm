              ERR Meeting Summary</h3>
            <p> Fred opened the meeting with an announcement that III will be 
              upgrading to Millennium Silver in June. He also said we will be 
              installing advanced keyword searching on the webOPAC during the 
              summer intersession. This will require at least a day to create 
              the new indexes, during which time keyword searching in the catalog 
              will be unavailable. Then Marc Mason briefly discussed Illiad, the 
              new ILL system that will replace CLIO and WebZap.<br>
              <br>
              Regarding the web site redesign, Heather reported that the Web Development 
              and Management Team has divided into two working groups, the Technology 
              group and the User Interface group. The Technology group is working 
              to identify or develop a suitable content management system (CMS) 
              for the new site, while the User Interface group is planning the 
              organization, navigation, and look of the site. Both are hoping 
              to finish their initial efforts by the end of June, at which point 
              the Technology group will begin implementing the new CMS to create 
              a test site. </p>
            <p>Steve Tanner gave a brief presentation explaining what content 
              management is and the benefits of changing from our current static 
              site to a dynamic site. (View the presentation at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/list/lib-web-management.ppt">http://www.asu.edu/lib/list/lib-web-management.ppt</a>.) 
              Jennie Duvernay then talked about the User Interface group&#8217;s 
              efforts, and showed the <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/">UC 
              Berkeley library site</a> as an example of some design/navigation 
              ideas they are considering. She also suggested that pagemasters 
              go through their directories and delete whatever files are no longer 
              needed, to facilitate the migration of existing content to the new 
              content management system in the future.</p>
            <p>Finally, Heather discussed the <a href="http://www.westernwater.org/">Western 
              Waters Digital Library</a>, a grant-funded project managed by the 
              Greater Western Libraries Alliance. ASU Libraries will be purchasing 
              ContentDM software to participate in the Western Waters project, 
              and LIST plans to harness the software&#8217;s exciting features 
              for other digitization projects as well. You can browse other libraries&#8217; 
              ContentDM projects at <a href="http://www.contentdm.com/customers/index.html">http://www.contentdm.com/customers/index.html</a>.

          <div align="left"> 
            <p>Several LIST staff members have changed locations recently. Yuwu 
              Song can now be found in room 107. Matt Harp and Heather Knowles 
              have both relocated to Room 110. And Bill Gertz&#8217;s cube is 
              now in C2. Everyone&#8217;s telephone number remains the same as 
              before.</p>

          <p align="left"><strong>Q. <em>&quot;Will the upgrade to advanced keyword 
            searching require a catalog outage? What system features will be affected?&quot;</em></strong></p>
          <div align="left"> 
            <p><strong>A.</strong> Here&#8217;s what you need to know about the 
              outage required to perform the upgrade: </p>
            <p>ALL staff must be logged out of ALL functions by 1:50PM on Friday 
              May 14, 2004. The INNOPAC/Millennium system will be unavailable 
              from 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM on Friday May 14, 2004. During this time, 
              Innovative Interfaces will be loading additional software and removing 
              the keyword indexes from the system. When the system comes back 
              up at 4:00PM, all functions except keyword searching will be available. 
              The keyword indexes will be rebuilt over the weekend (May 14-16) 
              and Advanced Keyword searching will be implemented on the online 
              catalog on Monday 5/17/04. The new search feature will have the 
              same properties as <a href="http://sabio.arizona.edu/search/X">U 
              of A&#8217;s advanced search page</a>.</p>
            <p>From 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM Friday May 14, 2004 there will be no access 
              to any functions on the INNOPAC/Millennium system:<br>
              1. Circulation activity must be handled manually.<br>
              2. Records cannot be added, accessed, updated or deleted from the 
              system (Acquisitions, Cataloging, Circulation, Serials).<br>
              3. Any electronic resources directed through the Web Access Management 
              system (proxy server) will be unavailable. This includes off-campus 
              access to all electronic resources, as well as on campus use of 
              electronic course reserve, video courses and streaming audio.</p>
            <p>Any questions regarding the system outage or Advanced Searching 
              can be directed to: <a href="mailto:fred.mcilvain@asu.edu">fred.mcilvain@asu.edu</a><br>
