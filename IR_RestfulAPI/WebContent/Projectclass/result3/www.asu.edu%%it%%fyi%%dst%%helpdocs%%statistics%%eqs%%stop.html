Question:<br>
After I execute a program interactively as follows, I see the word STOP at 
the system prompt.  Although the program seems to run just fine.  Any 
ideas how to get rid of it?

Response:<br>
This is a feature of EQS and it is suppose to print "STOP" after each run.  
Currently there isn't a way to suppress the output.
