The apparent activation energy of 90 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> ± 16 kJmol<sup>-1</sup>over the range of temperature from 873 to 1073 K is significantly lower than that typically measured in commercial or development-scale hot wall reactors.  The reaction rate exhibits a first order dependence on TEOS pressure.  Film deposition proceeds without a nucleation-induced incubation period.  Interpretation of deposited film profiles in high aspect ratio trenches through rigorous ballistic transport-reaction simulation reveals that deposition most likely occurs through a heterogeneous mechanism in which strong readsorption of the byproducts of TEOS decomposition inhibits silicon dioxide deposition.<p><i>J.
