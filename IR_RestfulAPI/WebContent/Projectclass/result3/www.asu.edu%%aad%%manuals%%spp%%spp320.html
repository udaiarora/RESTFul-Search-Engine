Each notice of appointment for service professionals shall incorporate this policy by reference and shall provide that acceptance of the notice of appointment constitutes recognition that this policy constitutes the conditions of employment. The board shall not be bound by, nor does it adopt or incorporate herein, the interpretations, policies, or recommendations of other organizations.<P><B>Authority</B><P>The board is charged by law to exercise control and supervision of the state universities and their property. Any authority delegated by the board is always subject to the ultimate authority of the board. The board retains the right of periodic review and modification of all aspects of governance of the universities, and the right to enact such rules, regulations, policies, and orders as it deems proper.<P><B>Dual Appointments</B><P>Individual service professionals may hold dual appointments, only one of which may be to a position subject to the <I>Conditions of Service Professional Service.</I><P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Appointments</B></FONT><P><B>Approvals</B><P>The <A HREF="spp002.html#president">president</A> shall establish procedures for securing recommendations for appointment to service professional positions.

Appointments and reappointments shall not be for more than one fiscal year. There is no limit to the number of appointment periods to which a person employed under a year-to-year contract may be appointed. No oral or written communication made prior to or after the execution of a notice of appointment that is inconsistent or in conflict with the <I>Conditions of Service Professional Service</I> shall become a part of the conditions of employment.<P><B>Appointments Dependent on Nonstate Funding</B><P>Appointments that are dependent for continuation on funding from a specific source other than state appropriations shall so state in the notice of appointment and may terminate when the funding is no longer available.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Compensation</B></FONT><P><B>Salaries</B><P>The president may set individual salaries.  Salary rates for reappointments will depend upon available funding.  Merit raises may be allocated by the president within the limitation of available funds.<P><B>Fringe Benefits</B><P>Certain fringe benefits are made available to all state employees and are subject to change by the legislature, the board, or the university.<P><B>Outside Activities and Supplementary Compensation</B><P>Policies governing outside activities and supplementary compensation are administered by the university.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Employment-Related Board Policies</B></FONT><P>The board has adopted various policies that may be a part of the employment relationship depending upon the terms of the particular policy.  Among these policies are the patent policy, Medical Service Plan, royalty policy, and leave policy.  Changes to existing policies may be made by the board and such changes will normally become effective at the beginning of the first appointment period following the period in which a change is adopted.  Additional policies may be added to be effective as determined by the board.<P>Each university shall maintain a compilation of such policies and shall take reasonable steps to inform the service professionals of the existence of such policies.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Duties and Responsibilities</B></FONT><P><B>Assignment by the President</B><P>Duties and responsibilities of a service professional shall consist of those assigned by the president.

The decision of the president not to reappoint is final.<P><B>Continued Employment</B><P>A service professional has no expectation of continued employment and shall not be entitled to a hearing following or prior to a decision of nonreappointment.  A service professional whose appointment is not renewed shall not be entitled to a statement of reasons for that action.  It is strongly recommended that reasons be given orally.  If requested by a service professional, reasons may be given in writing with the approval of the appropriate vice president and after review by University General Counsel.<P><B>Notification of Nonrenewal</B><P>Service professionals shall be given at least a 90-day written notification of nonrenewal within the period of the appointment.  If notice of nonrenewal is given within the appointment period but less than 90 days prior to the end of a service professional&#146;s appointment period, the employee shall be entitled to continuation of salary for 90 days from the date of notification.<P>Failure to provide a service professional with notice of nonrenewal within the period of appointment will result in automatic renewal of appointment.<P>During the period between notifying a service professional of nonrenewal and the end of the appointment period, the service professional may:<P><OL><LI>continue to work in the current position</LI><P><LI>be assigned to work in another position (any such reassignment must be approved by the responsible vice president)</LI><P><LI>be released from duties with pay (see <A HREF="spp302.html">SPP 302</A>, &#147;<I>Conditions of Administrative Service</I> at ASU&#148;)<P>or</LI><P><LI>voluntarily resign in lieu of nonrenewal (see <A HREF="spp1011.html">SPP 1011</A>, &#147;Involuntary Termination&#148;).</LI></OL><P>In addition, outplacement services may be made available through Human Resources to assist the service professional with finding alternative employment.

Service professional employees who are terminated for cause (or resign in lieu of termination) will not be considered eligible for rehire, absent an administrative determination made by Human Resources in consultation with the terminating department.<P><B>Suspension with Pay</B><P>A service professional may be suspended with pay pending a hearing, if the president determines that the continued presence of the service professional on the campus may constitute a substantial interference with the orderly functioning of the university or of a substantial area, unit, college, or department of the university.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Dismissal</B></FONT><P>When a service professional is recommended for suspension or dismissal, the employee shall be subject to the procedures set forth herein except in:<P><OL><LI>decisions relating to advancement/promotion and leaves</LI><P><LI>decisions relating to nonreappointment of service professional employees on year-to-year appointments<P>and</LI><P><LI>decisions relating to release from employment due to financial emergency or reorganization.</LI></OL><P>The procedures are not judicial.
