Its <a href="http://www.cob.asu.edu/mba/asu_mba_exe.cfm">MBA         for Executives program</a>, for example, has been ranked eighth among         public programs by<em> Business Week</em>, and it boasts many other distinguished         programs. <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>, for example, named <a href="http://asumbaonline.asu.edu/">ASU&#8217;s         MBA Online Program</a> the best online business program in the nation.         Corporate clients include Deere and Company, Lucent Technologies, Intel         Corporation, and ChevronTexaco.</p>      <p> But the internationalization of our business school will be critical         to its further ascent. Our business school must provide students with         a global perspective, informing teaching and research with an awareness         of the world economy and business opportunities. The school already offers         an innovative program in partnership with Motorola in Beijing. Based in         Beijing, the <a href="http://www.cob.asu.edu/mba/asu_mba_china.cfm">ASU         MBA High Technology in China Program</a> brings together the strengths         of our business school and the ASU <a href="http://www.eas.asu.edu/">College         of Engineering and Applied Science</a>. The program offers an immersion         in high technology and international management.</p>      <p> Global engagement by the college means more than initiating exchange         programs. We must assume a leadership position in international finance         and economics, collaborating with peer institutions across the Pacific,         across the Atlantic, and across the Gulf of Mexico. The ASU Center on         Asian and Pacific Rim Trade and Economic Development will be relevant         to the new international focus of the college. We must conduct research         that will enable Arizona companies to devise internationally competitive         growth strategies. We must reflect the world in which we live, and the         way in which business is conducted around the globe. </p>      <p><br>      </p>      <p><br>      </p></td>    <td align="center" valign="top"> &nbsp;<BR> </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
