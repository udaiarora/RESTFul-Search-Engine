			<h2>Residential Life Computing Policies</h2>
			
			<p>It is the policy of the university to maintain access to local, national, and international networks for the purpose of supporting its fundamental activities of instruction, research, outreach, and administration. Users of the Residential Computing Network (ResNet) are to take necessary measures to safeguard the operating integrity of the systems they access and the accessibility of those systems to other users. This policy covers all persons accessing computer or network resources through any Residential Life facility. The following policies govern the use of the Residential Life computing network:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>All uses of the network are expected to be consistent with all local, state, and federal laws and all university policies including the Student Code of Conduct and ACD 125: Computer, Internet, and Electronic Communications, which can be found at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html">www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html</a>;</li><br />
    <li> Residential Computing network services and wiring may not be modified or extended beyond the area of their intended use. This applies to all network wiring, hardware, in-room jacks and extension of such via wireless hub/switch devices. Use of a wireless hub/switch in a residential room is prohibited. The residential network may not be used to provide ASU network or Internet access to anyone outside of the university community for any purpose. Under no circumstances may users give others access to university systems;
    </li><br />
    <li> The provision of network services from user computers (e.g. BBS, Chat, DHCP, DNS, FTP, IRC, NNTP, POP2/POP3, IMAP, SMTP, Telnet, WINS, etc.) is prohibited. Users who have a documented academic need to provide such services from their personal computer must have prior written authorization from ResNet administration prior to activating any such service(s) on the ResNet network. 
    </li><br />
    <li> The residential network is a shared resource. Network use or applications that inhibit or interfere with the use of the network by others is not permitted. For example, applications that require an unusually large portion of the bandwidth for extended periods of time (e.g. peer-to-peer network file sharing applications such as KaZaA, Gnutella, IMESH, WinMX, Audiogalaxy, etc. and network game servers such as Quake (I, II or III), Unreal Tournament, etc.), and applications designed to send repeated email messages or mass email messages ("email spam" or "bulk mailers") are not permitted; 
    </li><br />
    <li> The residential network may only be used for legal purposes and to access only those systems, software, and data for which the user is authorized. Sharing access to copyrighted software or other copyrighted material (including MP3 files from copyrighted music media and digitized video from copyrighted motion pictures, etc.) on the network is prohibited;
    </li><br />
    <li> The use or employment of remote administration tools on othersâ?? computers via the network (SubSeven, Netbus, Back Orifice, etc.) is prohibited; 
    </li><br />
    <li> The use of port scanning or network administration software by anyone other than authorized network administrators is prohibited. Violations will result in referral to the Office of Student Life for disciplinary action. Prosecution under state and federal laws may also apply;
    </li><br />
    <li> Respecting the rights of other users, including their rights as set forth in other university policies for students, faculty, and staff is required at all times on the network. These rights include but are not limited to privacy, freedom from harassment, and freedom of expression; 
    </li><br />
    <li> Users are required to know and obey the specific policies established for the systems and networks they access; 
    </li><br />
    <li> The residential network is provided for use consistent with the academic mission of the institution. The network may not be used for commercial purposes or for unsolicited advertising.
    </li><br />
    <li> Users may not provide open access to files/folders on their computers that contain anything that is protected by copyright (this includes MP3 files from copyrighted music media and digitized video from copyrighted motion pictures, etc.), that is of a pornographic nature, or anything which would be in violation of the universityâ??s and/or the Residential Lifeâ??s community standards; 
    </li><br />
    <li> Forgery or other misrepresentation of oneâ??s identity via electronic or any other form of communication is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct and will be referred to the Office of Student Life for disciplinary action. Prosecution under state and federal laws may also apply. This includes the use of an IP address not specifically assigned by the university to the individual using it and the use of a forged or false identity when using certain email or other electronic communications programs (i.e., mail clients such as Eudora, Netscape, Outlook, Outlook Express and IRC/chat programs such as AOL Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, and ICQ); 
    </li><br />
    <li> Administrators of the network have the responsibility to protect the rights of users, to set policies consistent with those rights, and to publicize those policies to their users. They have authority to control or refuse access to the network to anyone who violates these policies or who threatens the rights of other users. Administrators have the authority to temporarily suspend network access without notice for a user/computer that is believed to have been the source of an alleged violation pending investigation of the violation and satisfactory resolution of the complaint;
    </li><br />
    <li> Using or traversing the ResNet network constitutes FULL agreement with and understanding of this Acceptable Use Policy and any future modifications thereto; and
    </li><br />
    <li> Residential Life reserves the right to modify, change, and reformat this document as it deems necessary without permission or consent of its network users.</li><br />
