If you are a researcher or student with experience in multiple linear      regression and want to learn about logistic regression, Logistic
Regression Using the SAS System: Theory and Application is for you!        Informal and nontechnical, this book both explains the theory behind
logistic regression and looks at all the practical details involved in     its implementation using the SAS System.  Several social science
real-world examples are included in full detail. This book also explains   the differences and similarities between the many generalizations of the
logistic regression model.  The following topics are covered:  binary      logit analysis, logit analysis of contingency tables, multinomial logit
analysis, ordered logit analysis, discrete-choice analysis with the PHREG  procedure, and Poisson regression.  Other highlights include discussions
on how to use the GENMOD procedure to do loglinear analysis and GEE        estimation for longitudinal binary data. Only basic knowledge of the SAS
DATA step is assumed.
