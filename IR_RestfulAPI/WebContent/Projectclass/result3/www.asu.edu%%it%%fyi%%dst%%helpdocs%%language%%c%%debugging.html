Debugging
</center></h2>
<p>
Unix has several powerful debuggers.  The most popular on research.asu.edu
(IBM) is dbx; a similar debugger exists on stats.asu.edu (HP) where its name
is xdb; both servers have another common debugger named adb.  dbx and xdb are
source level debuggers which let you refer to variables by their symbolic name
as given in the source code.  To use them, you must compile your program with
the -g flag.  If your program fails and produces a coredump, you can then
examine it by typing something like:
<p><blockquote>
dbx a.out coredump
</blockquote><p>
For more information on dbx or xdb, consult the man pages.

<p>
Another utility named "lint" checks C language source code for coding and
syntax errors, and for inefficient or non-portable code.  It tries to "clean
up the fluff" in your C program by pointing out features that are likely to be
either bugs or wasteful.  It also finds unreachable statements, loops not
entered at the top, automatic variables declared and not used, logical
expressions whose value is constant, and errors with function arguments and
return values.  It checks variable typing more strictly than the compilers.
<p>

To use lint, type:
<p><blockquote>
lint source.c
</blockquote><p>
More information about lint is available in the man pages: man lint
