	    <h1>Faculty Cross-Talks<br />

		Spring 2007</h1>

		<h3><em>From Origin of Life to Emergence of Modern Humans: What do DNA Clocks Tell Us? </em></h3>

		<h4>with  Professor Sudhir Kumar,<br />
		  Biology, School of Life Sciences. <br />
		  
        <a href="http://ame.asu.edu/">Director of the Center for Evolutionary Functional Genomics </a></h4>
		<h5><span class="style1">Tuesday, April 10, 2007</span><br />

		12-1:30pm, MU 215 (Pinal Room)</h5>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ³molecular clock² idea was born in the early 1960s with the observation that genes accumulate changes (mutations) continuously, making species that emerged recently to be more similar (genetically) to each other<br />
		  than to those that diverged a long time ago.   This proportionality of<br />
		  genetic difference between species and the timing of their divergence has provided us with a device used for measuring time, because fossil records are only available for a fraction of the species that live on earth today.<br />
	    Here, I provide a glimpse into the history of molecular clocks and outline how their development has been intertwined with our efforts to time the ancient and recent evolutionary events leading to the emergence of humans. A molecular timeline of human evolution that begins with the origin of life and concludes with the divergence of major human populations will be presented.  The emphasis will fall on discussions of findings that ASU researchers have made over the years using the ever-growing genome datasets.</p>
		<p>Attendance is limited to 25 participants, lunch will be provided.<br />
		Participants  <strong>must register</strong> online by clicking <a href="http://issrweb.asu.edu/intergroup/rsvp.aspx">here</a>.

		<h3>Dr. Sudhir Kumar </h3>

		<p> Is an interdisciplinary scientist bringing the problem-solving skills from his undergraduate engineering background together with his knowledge of evolutionary genetics from his doctoral work to tackle long-standing problems in functional genomics and evolutionary biology.  Dr. Kumar is a renowned expert in the field of evolutionary bioinformatics, receiving an Innovation Award in Functional Genomics from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund in 2000. In 2004, he joined the elite ranks of most-cited researchers, earning a place among the top ten in the world in terms of number of citations in the field of computer science over the last decade. Among his more than 70 papers and books are three &quot;Hot Papers,&quot; which were cited among the most of any in their fields.  Dr. Kumar also co-authored the text Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics (2000).<br />
          <br />
          Dr. Kumar¹s interdisciplinary team has made pioneering efforts in developing bioinformatics tools and databases for the analysis of gene expression patterns from early stages of fruit fly development (<a href="http://www.flyexpress.net">www.flyexpress.net</a> ). He has also conducted breakthrough work using protein molecular clocks to illuminate the Evolutionary Timescale of Life (<a href="http://www.timetree.net">www.timetree.net</a> ). Over the last decade, Dr. Kumar has led the team that developed the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software in order to make useful methods of comparative sequence analysis available and easily accessible to the scientific community for the purposes of research and education (<a href="http://www.megasoftware.net">www.megasoftware.net</a> ). Dr. Kumar¹s research is funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, among other agencies.<br />
          <br />
        Dr. Kumar is a Professor of Life Sciences at Arizona State University, where he teaches undergraduate-level evolutionary biology and graduate-level evolutionary genomics classes. He is a member of the editorial boards of Molecular Biology and Evolution, Genome Research, and Evolutionary Bioinformatics Online.  Additionally, Dr. Kumar is currently the webmaster for the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution and the American Genetic Association. He received his B.E. in Electrical/Electronics Engineering, his M.Sc. in Biological Sciences from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science in India (BITS, Pilani), and his Ph.D. in Genetics from Pennsylvania State University in USA (with Dr. Masatoshi Nei).</p>
