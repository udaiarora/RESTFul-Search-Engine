    <p>Information Technology provides various services to give faculty the technology support they need to provide the best instructional materials.</p>
    
    <h2>Office of Classroom Management (Classroom Support) </h2>

    <p>The mission of the Office of Classroom Management is to provide outstanding support to the university community through the effective management and design of the university classrooms and computing sites. OCM works to enhance teaching and learning by improving the quality of services and facilities through design, operation and maintenance of classrooms and sites; classroom scheduling and resource analysis; and development and support of computer networks and multimedia technology. Check out the <a href="http://asu.edu/classroomsupport/">Office of Classroom Management</a> Web pages for more information.</p>

    <h2>Technology Instruction Support Group </h2>
    <p>The Information Technology Instruction Support Group provides ongoing assistance to faculty and instructors who incorporate technology into their work. Located on the second floor of the Computing Commons Building, the Instruction Support Lab assists in the development of instructor-designed teaching and research-oriented projects. The IS Lab offers courses designed for faculty, instructors, and education technology support professionals. These hands-on workshops on the effective use of technology are sequenced to accommodate a wide range of skill levels. Currently we offer courses on how to use the myASU online course management system, understanding online pedagogy, using digital video for communication and research, database design and management, as well as an introduction to web development tools such as Macromedia Flash.  Each workshop incorporates an applied focus on enhancing and extending accessibility for all users. Our course offerings can be customized, or new classes developed, to meet your department or organization's objectives, content focus, and/or the application of specific technologies. For more information see the <a href="http://dmit.asu.edu/islab/islab.html">Instruction Support Lab</a> Web pages. </p>
