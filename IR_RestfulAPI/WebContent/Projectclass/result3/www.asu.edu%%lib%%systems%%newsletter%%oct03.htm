        <h3>LIST Helps ADA with HP</h3>
        Recently, Hewlett Packard profiled the Library ADA department&#8217;s 
        participation in its Library Technology Access (LTA) initiative, which 
        helps provide assistive technology to students who need it. The article, 
        at <a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/accessibility/partnerships/ala/lta_arizona_state.html">http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/accessibility/partnerships/ala/lta_arizona_state.html</a>, 
        quotes several library staffers, including our own Kirk Manegold, who 
        has been serving as LIST&#8217;s technology liaison to ADA for several 
        months now.

        <h3>New Site Showcases Collaboration between Library Departments</h3>
        <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
          <tr>
            <td width="29%"><img src="home_65-news.jpg" width="280" height="285"></td>
            <td width="71%"><p>LIST and DAM staff have worked together on a number 
                of online exhibitions over the years. The latest example of this 
                collaboration is &#8220;<a href="/lib/archives/gilbert">Dorothy Gilbert and the Phoenix Mountains 
                Preserve</a>,&#8221; a web site presenting primary and secondary source 
                material documenting the grassroots effort to save the Phoenix 
                Mountains.</p>
              <p>Rose Minetti, from the Department of Archives and Manuscripts, 
                selected documents to provide a glimpse of the Gilbert Collection&#8217;s 
                content, and wrote the site&#8217;s explanatory text. Sue McNamara, 
                also of Archives, digitized the documents. LIST&#8217;s Heather 
                Knowles designed and produced the web site. </p>
              <p>The site presents over 100 historically significant documents 
                from the Dorothy Gilbert Collection, in a time line dating from 
                1960 to 1997. The manuscripts trace steps taken by local citizens 
                to protect the Phoenix mountains, which resulted in the creation 
                of the 7,000-acre Phoenix Mountain Preserve enjoyed by local residents 
                today. </p>

        <p> <u><strong>Forum of Federations</strong></u><br>
          The Forum of Federations serves as a clearinghouse for information and

        <i>Please send questions on any library technology topic to Heather Knowles 
        to be answered in future columns.</i> <p> <b>Q. &nbsp; &nbsp; </b><strong>&quot;Our 
          department has a new employee &#8211; how can s/he get a computer account, 
          and what training resources are available?&quot;</strong> 
        <p> <strong>A.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; New employees need to do two things 
          to get computing access at ASU &#8211; first, self-subscribe for an 
          ASURITE account (info at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/accounts/obtaining.html">http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/accounts/obtaining.html</a>), 
          then request an Outlook/Exchange account from the Computer Accounts 
          office (more about Outlook at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/email/clients/outlook_pc.html">http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/email/clients/outlook_pc.html</a>). 
          HR provides additional instructions about obtaining computer accounts 
          at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/hr/new_employee/computer_accounts.html">http://www.asu.edu/hr/new_employee/computer_accounts.html</a>. 
        <p> HR also provides a variety of training resources, both in the classroom 
          and online via Knowledgenet. See <a href="http://www.asu.edu/hr/training/index.html">http://www.asu.edu/hr/training/index.html</a>
