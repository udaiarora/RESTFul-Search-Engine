<h2>
Purpose</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The need for higher education is growing every day, and yet balancing work, family, and learning can be challenging. To help students fit higher education into their busy schedules, the university provides additional access to quality education through the ASU College of Extended Education. The college provides flexible scheduling, innovative technologies, and a vast network of off-campus sites that makes it more convenient for students to pursue their education. Programming includes credit classes, degree programs, certificates, and continuing education. </p>
<p>
For more information, access the Web site at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/xed">www.asu.edu/xed</a>
 or call 480/965-3986.</p></div>
<h2>
<a id="a98610"></a>Organization</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The university-wide College of Extended Education provides an interactive link between ASU and the diverse communities it serves. The college assesses lifelong learning requirements and works in partnership with ASU campuses, colleges, and the community to serve learners using a network of locations, programs, schedules, and technologies. The college is composed of the following departments: Academic and Professional Programs, American English and Culture Program, Communications and Marketing, Distance Learning and Technology, Downtown Center and Property Administration, Extended Campus Programs, and Planning and Business Services.</p></div>
<h3>
Credits, Tuitions, and Fees</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Academic credits earned off-campus are equivalent in all considerations as those credits earned on-campus, and the credits are recorded on students&#8217; permanent records. Courses are published each fall and spring semester in the ASU Schedule of Classes and on the Web at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/xed">www.asu.edu/xed</a>
 and 
<a href="http://asuonline.asu.edu">asuonline.asu.edu</a>.</p>
<p>
Tuition and fees for off-campus credit courses are the same as those offered on a campus. (See resident and nonresident rates in the latest Schedule of Classes.) Before the 21st calendar day of the each semester, any combination of on-campus and off-campus resident credit courses resulting in a combined registration of seven or more semester hours requires that the student pay full-time tuition. Off-campus credit courses and programs that commence on or after the 21st calendar day of the start of each semester require full-time and part-time students to pay tuition separate from (but in addition to) those courses starting before the 21st calendar day of the semester.</p></div>
<h1>
<a id="a52356"></a>Schedule Options</h1>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Through the College of Extended Education, students have many opportunities to pursue their educational goals. A variety of scheduling options are available for credit courses offered by the university&#8217;s academic departments. Convenient times and locations, and innovative technologies, make it easier for students to earn degrees.</p>
<p>
As a convenience to students, courses are conducted off campus in locations throughout the state, on campus in the evening, via the Internet and television, and during Winter Session. Academic credits earned off campus are equivalent in all considerations with credits earned on campus, and the credits are recorded on students&#8217; permanent records. Courses are published each fall and spring semester in the <i>
ASU Schedule of Classes</i>
 and on the Web at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/xed">www.asu.edu/xed</a>
