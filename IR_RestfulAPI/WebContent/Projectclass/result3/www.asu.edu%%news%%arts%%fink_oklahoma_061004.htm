      <h2>Country mouse, city mouse reunite to see 'Oklahoma!' </h2>
      <p>Bert Fink grew up in Rhode Island living a rural lifestyle near beaches with plenty of outdoor entertainment. </p>
      <p>Fink often found himself wanting to trade places with his older cousin Jonathan, who grew up in a suburb of New York City. </p>
      <p>"Jon and I definitely had a relationship similar to the tale of 'The Country Mouse and the City Mouse,'" Fink says. "When Jonathan would visit us, he would be picking up star fish along the beach and talking about where they came from. All I wanted to know was whether he had been to any Broadway shows and what life in the big city was like." </p>
      <p>Fink grew up to become the vice president for Public Relations at The Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein (R&amp;H) Organization, where he serves in a variety of promotional, archival and production capacities for the organization. His cousin Jonathan is ASU's vice president for Research and Economic Affairs. </p>
      <p>"It's amazing to see where we've ended up," Fink says. "I've always looked up to him (Jonathan) and I still do. I think we were lucky to be brought up getting exposed to many educational experiences." </p>
      <p>Fink discovered his love for musical theater at five years old, but it wasn't until ninth grade that he got a taste for life on the stage. </p>
      <p>"I played Grumpy the Dwarf in a school production of 'Snow White,'" he says. "I knew I didn't want to be an actor; however, I still wanted to learn about musical theater, because I really felt that was where I needed to be. So I pursued it." </p>
      <p>Fink continued toward his dream, eventually joining R&amp;H in 1989. Since then he has spearheaded several long-term projects including the centennial campaigns for Oscar Hammerstein II and Lorenz Hart in 1995 and Richard Rodgers in 2002; and the 50th Anniversary cast reunion for "South Pacific" in 1999. </p>
      <p>Fink is traveling with the national tour of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's musical "Oklahoma!," coming to ASU's Gammage Auditorium June 8-13. Based on the Lynn Riggs' play "Green Grow The Lilacs," "Oklahoma!" was Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's first collaboration, written in 1943. Set in the territory of Oklahoma at the turn of the 20th century, "Oklahoma!" is the story of the farm girl Laurey and the two rivals for her affection, the cowboy Curly and Jud, the brooding farmhand. </p>
      <p>While in Tempe Fink will meet with students of the Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts. </p>
      <p>"This is my first time visiting ASU, so I am very excited to be speaking with these students," he says. "Musical theater is a very tough business and I pride myself in being able to share my experiences and enlighten anyone who is interested in the musical arts. I enjoy learning from them as much as I hope they learn from me. " </p>
      <p>Fink will also participate in ASU's Camp Broadway, the premier performing arts summer program for children ages 10-17, which runs June 7-11 at Gammage Auditorium. </p>
      <p>"The best thing that parents can do is expose their children to as many fields and kinds of opportunities - sports, cooking classes, fine arts, you never know what's going to click," says Fink, who will serve as a judge of Camp Broadway's "Family Finale." "I can only plead and hope that fine arts is included in school curriculums, because I think it's crucial. The arts is what defines us as humanity and the American musical is our gift to the rest of the world." </p>
