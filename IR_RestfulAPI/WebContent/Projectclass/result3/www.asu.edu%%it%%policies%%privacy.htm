			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

			<p><strong>Privacy Statement</strong></p>
			
			<p>ASU provides online information and services to students, employees
			and the public to supplement services provided on campus. This privacy
			statement provides information required by Arizona law about privacy,
			confidentiality and related policies for individuals who use our
			websites and online services. Individual websites may provide additional
			information about
			privacy. <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html">ACD 125</A> (ASU Computer, Internet 
			and Electronic 	Communications Policy) provides additional information about the use of
			computing and communications systems at ASU and is available at <a
			href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html">http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html</a>.</p>
			
			<p>The ASU website contains links to external websites. ASU is not responsible for the privacy
			practices or policies of those sites not housed on ASU servers.</p>
			
		
			<p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED BY ASU</strong></p>
				
			<p>In addition to information actively provided by individuals
			using ASU websites, the ASU web servers routinely record the following
			information each time the sites are used:</p>
		
			<ul>
			<li>Internet address of the computer being used</li>
			<li>Web pages requested</li>
			<li>Network software access</li>
			<li>Referring web page</li>
			<li>Browser used</li>
			<li>Date, time and duration of activity</li>
			<li>Passwords and accounts accessed</li>
			<li>Volume of data storage and transfers</li>
			<li>Server space used for e-mail.</li>
			</ul>
		
			<p>ASU uses this information to monitor 
			and preserve the functioning and integrity of the system.</p>
			
		
			<p>In cases of suspected violations of ASU policies, especially unauthorized access to 
			computing systems, the system administrator concerned may authorize detailed session 
			logging. This may involve capturing and retaining a complete keystroke log of an entire 
			session. In addition, a system 	administrator for the equipment involved may authorize 
			limited searching of user files on individual or networked computers to gather evidence 
			on a suspected violation.</p>
			
		
			<p>Cookies are short pieces of information used by web browsers to remember information 
			provided by the user, such as passwords and preferences from past visits. Additional 
			information on cookies is available at the Cookie Central web site 
			<a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/">http://www.cookiecentral.com/</a> 
			and in this publication from the Department of Energy Computer Incident Advisory Center: <a
			href="http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml">http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml</a>. 
			Some ASU websites, such as the Interactive Registrar's Web Site, use cookies to store service 
			information.  Some web-based services require cookies for access.</p>
			
		
			<p><strong>ALTERNATIVES TO WEBSITE TRANSACTIONS</strong></p> 
				
			<p>ASU websites provide access to information and services for students, employees and members 
			of the public. If you prefer not to provide any
			information to the university online, you may cancel the transaction and
			contact the administrative unit responsible for the service to learn about
			available options for conducting business in person, by mail or by telephone.</p>
			
		
			<p><strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong></p> 
				
			<p>ASU does not sell or distribute confidential information it collects online to individuals 
			or entities not affiliated with the university, except in the very limited circumstances 
			described below. Non-confidential information may be sold or distributed pursuant to 
			Arizona Public Records law.</p>
			
		
			<p>University and Arizona Board of Regents 
			policies protect the confidentiality of student educational records and employee personnel 
			information. These policies explain what information may be shared with the public or anyone 
			who requests it. They also explain what information is protected as confidential; confidential 
			information will not be disclosed without the consent of the student or employee, except under 
			subpoena or court order or in case of an emergency.</p>
			
		
			<p><strong>Student records.</strong> Student records 
			are protected by the federal Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), Arizona law,
			and university policy. Information about student access to education
			records and protection of education records is available in <a
			href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/sta/sta105-01.html">STA 105-01</A>
			(Release of Student Information): <a
			href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/sta/sta105-01.html">http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/sta/sta105-01.html</a>.
			That policy also provides information on a student&#8217;s right to
			limit access to otherwise public directory information. The ASU Office
			of General Counsel (OGC) briefing paper on FERPA also provides general
			information: <a
			href="http://www.asu.edu/counsel/brief/ferpa.html">http://www.asu.edu/counsel/brief/ferpa.html</a>.</p>
			
		
			<p><strong>Chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups.</strong> ASU
			does not routinely retain logs or copies of chat rooms, forums, message
			boards or news groups available to its users. Information disclosed in
			these areas is public, however. Academic chat rooms and discussions
			conducted in connection with ASU classes may be logged but may be
			treated as confidential educational records under FERPA.</p>
			
		
			<p><strong>Employee records.</strong> Employee records are protected by Arizona
			Board of Regents policy <A HREF="http://www.abor.asu.edu/1_the_regents/policymanual/chap6/6-912.pdf">6-912</A>, by university policies, <a
			href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd811.html">ACD 811</A> (Access
			to and Release of Official Personnel Records Information: <a
			href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd811.html">http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd811.html</a>)
			and <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/spp1101.html">SPP 1101</A> (Personnel Records: <a
			href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/spp1101.html">http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/spp1101.html</a>)
			and by Arizona law.</p>
			
		
			<p><strong>Public records law.</strong> Under the Arizona Public Records Law,
			ASU may be required to provide information in university records to a
			third party. Commercial users may purchase public record information,
			such as non-confidential lists of students and employees. Confidential
			information protected by FERPA or by other laws or Board policy will not
			be disclosed in response to a public records request. Additional
			information about Arizona public records law is available in an OGC
			briefing paper: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/counsel/brief/pubrecs.html">http://www.asu.edu/counsel/brief/pubrecs.html</a>.</p>
			
		
			<p><strong>Contractors.</strong> 
			From time to time, individuals or companies under
			contract with the university may have access to confidential information
			in the course of the service they provide to the university, but those
			entities are not permitted to use or re-disclose that information for
			unauthorized purposes. No other entities are authorized to collect
			information through ASU&#8217;s sites.</p>
			 
		
			<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p> 
				 
			<p>Although every effort is made to secure network communications, ASU cannot ensure the 
			privacy of online communications. Individuals using online services
			should also take steps to protect personal information, such as closing the web
			browser when finished using the site.
			Failure to do so may result in personal information being viewed by
			someone else using the same computer.</p>
			
		
			<p>ASU accepts credit card payments online for a variety of goods and services. Unless
			otherwise noted on the site, all university credit card transactions are
			encrypted. Confidential
			information entered to complete a transaction will not be used by ASU for any
			other purpose unless the purpose is described on the site.</p>
			
		
			<p>Under the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html" class="nodecor">
			Computer, Internet and Electronic Communications
			Policy</A>, university-owned computers and equipment may be examined by authorized
			individuals to detect illegal software and to evaluate the security of
			the network.</p>
		
			<p><strong>Contact Information</strong></p>
			
			<p>If you have additional questions about online privacy or security, you can contact 
			Jake Kupiec via e-mail to <a href="mailto:jake.kupiec@asu.edu">jake.kupiec@asu.edu</a>, 
			by phone (480) 965-4995, or you can send an inquiry by mail to PO Box 872803, 
			Tempe, AZ 85287-2803.</p>
