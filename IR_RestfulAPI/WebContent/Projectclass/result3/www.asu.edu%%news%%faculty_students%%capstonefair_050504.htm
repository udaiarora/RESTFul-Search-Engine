      <h2>Capstone Fair features fellows' projects </h2>
      <p>Printmaking graduate student Kathryn Pinto is devoting several months to producing a portfolio on the art of storytelling with other artists in a creative collaboration. </p>
      <p>Pinto's innovative project is one of several she has undertaken as a fellow in the Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) program, which combines teaching, research and service projects and encourages fresh thinking and planning in preparation for careers in the professoriate. She is one of about 30 fellows who will take part in this year's PFF Capstone Fair. </p>
      <p>PFF fellows from various fields - from the arts and public affairs to nanotechnology - and their work in the program will be featured at the 2004 PFF Capstone Fair and Graduation Reception from 3:30 - 6 p.m., April 30, in the Arizona Room at the Memorial Union. </p>
      <p>Pinto's project involves faculty and graduate students at ASU, the University of Tennessee and the University of Georgia. But the artists are not meeting, and instead are relying only on communication via e-mail and written instructions to create an edition of prints from woodcuts, etchings and screen prints. The project is in production now. By fall, the portfolio will be on exhibit at each campus. </p>
      <p>"The challenge for this portfolio was to structure the project so that the art making was collaborative, even though the collaborators would not be able meet in person during the project," Pinto says. "The beauty of the project is that we are fairly certain that, being artists, no one is going to follow the instructions to the letter, which will allow plenty of room for interpretation." </p>
      <p>Currently, there are 100 doctoral and master of fine arts students enrolled in the PFF program who aspire to faculty positions at the nation's colleges and universities. Fellows say the program teaches them about the challenges and responsibilities of a career in academia. They receive both training and mentoring. </p>
      <p>During their first year, students learn about faculty roles in public and private universities and community colleges, as well as teaching strategies and job search techniques. The second year, students learn through application - teaching, researching and engaging in service projects with faculty mentors and peers from other institutions. Another of Pinto's projects, for example, used art to teach Internet skills to single mothers at <br>
  the YWCA Haven House shelter in Phoenix. </p>
      <p>"Some of the most rewarding projects were the ones that a year ago I would have dismissed because I was too busy with my thesis work," Pinto says. "One of the most valuable things about my PFF experience was the chance to work with faculty outside of ASU." </p>
      <p>PFF is a national program. ASU's Graduate College, in collaboration with the Council of Graduate Schools and the Association of American Colleges and Universities, and with the initial support from The Pew Charitable Trusts, was one of five major research institutions tapped to develop the program. Today, 10 years after its inception, ASU is one of more than 40 institutions in the nation to offer the PFF program. </p>
