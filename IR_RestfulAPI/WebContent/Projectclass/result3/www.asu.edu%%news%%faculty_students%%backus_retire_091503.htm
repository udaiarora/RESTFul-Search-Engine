      <h2>Happy trails - 'Creative force' of ASU East Backus to retire in June
        2004</h2>
      <p>        <img src="facstudents_images/backus_091503.jpg" width="216" height="289" align="right">After three decades of dedicated service that has helped transform ASU,
        particularly at ASU East, Chuck Backus, university vice president and
      provost, announced plans to retire June 30, 2004.</p>
      <p>Backus has been responsible
          for ASU East's development from the campus's inception to its current
          period of dramatic physical and programmatic
          growth. He became provost prior to the campus opening in 1996, after
          serving 26 years in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences
        as both a professor and administrator. </p>
      <p>"By next year at this time, I'll
          be 67, and that's the time one should be thinking about retiring. I
        want to exit when we are at a peak and
          someone else can come in and take us to the next peak." said Backus.
          "From a campus point of view, we've brought ASU East up to a respectable
          level of development and set a positive course of direction, and it's
          time to bring in new leadership and new views to take the campus to
        the next level."</p>
      <p>Under Backus's tenure, ASU East's enrollment has increased
          by at least 20 percent every year and the number of academic programs
          has grown from
          8 to 24. The campus's enrollment has grown from 1,016 in 1996 to more
        than 3,550 today.</p>
      <p>"Provost Backus established the vision for a great
          new ASU campus in the East Valley. His energy and decisiveness has
        served the community
          and the university well," said ASU President Michael Crow. </p>
      <p>"Chuck leaves
          a great legacy and tall boots to fill," said Milton Glick, ASU executive
          vice president and university provost. "He had a great
          deal to do with achievements in the College of Engineering in his early
          years, and in recent years, he has been the creative force, as well
        as the soul, of ASU East.</p>
      <p>"He has advocated for an East Valley ASU presence
          for many years, and I believe that the extraordinary progress ASU East
          has made is in large
          part due to Chuck's commitment. And we all owe him a debt of gratitude
        for that," Glick said.</p>
      <p>ASU will conduct a national search for Backus's
          replacement. Glick said the polytechnic focus that Crow has established
          for the campus will not
        change with the new leadership. </p>
      <p>Backus holds a master's and doctoral
          degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Arizona and a
        bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering
          from Ohio University. He has focused his research on solar energy,
        and is one of the founders of the photovoltaics field, having secured
        more
          than $2.5 million in research and sponsored projects. He has published
        more than 90 papers, articles and books on solar energy. </p>
      <p>While at the
          ASU engineering college, he was responsible for building ASU's strength
          in solid state electronics, specifically fine tuning solar
          cells to make them more efficient. He also created the Photovoltaics
          Testing Laboratory, one of three such research facilities in the world
          that conducts applied research and certification of solar panels. The
          only U.S. lab is now located on the East campus and it serves 70 percent
        of the world's solar panel market.</p>
      <p>He is a fellow of the Institute of
          Electrical and Electronic Engineers and is a member of such prestigious
          scientific organizations as the American
          Association for the Advance of Science, American Nuclear Society, American
          Society for Engineering Education and the American Society of Mechanical
        Engineering. </p>
      <p>Backus and his wife, Judy, are also active members of the
          East Valley community, serving on numerous organization boards. He
        is also committed
          to land preservation efforts, serving as president of the Superstition
          Area Land Trust, an organization devoted to preserving open lands in
          the Superstition Mountains area. Backus is the owner and operator of
          the historic Quarter Circle U Cattle Ranch, located east of Apache
        Junction, and another ranch near Pinetop.</p>
      <p>Backus said he plans to continue working
          on his ranches after retirement. He also plans to dedicate himself
        to activities in the public service
        sector, using the skills he developed while at ASU.</p>
      <p>"This has been a great
          culmination of my career at ASU," said Backus. "I have a great sense
          of satisfaction and accomplishment because I've
          had a chance to make a major impact on many people's lives, whether
        student, faculty, staff and the community, and helped set the stage for
        a much
        greater impact in the future for our institution." </p>
