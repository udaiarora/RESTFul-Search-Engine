 <h2><a name="Mission" id="Mission"></a>Mission</h2>  	
<p>One of the principal goals at Arizona State University is to build the international, linguistic, and intercultural competencies of both our university and the broader Arizona community. The Center for Latin American Studies (CLAS) serves to fulfill this mission by providing our students, faculty, staff, the business sector, and residents of Arizona, with the requisite skills necessary to enter into partnerships with the diverse nations and peoples of the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Building such crucial economic, political, and personal relationships is an investment in the future of Arizona; precisely because of Arizona's geographic location, the state has a strategic position from which to link with Mexico and the rest of Latin America. In a spirit of hemispheric partnership, the Center for Latin American Studies stands ready to prepare our university and larger Arizona community for the opportunities and challenges of relations with Latin America in the years to come.</p>

<div id="horizontalboxdecoration"></div>
<h2><a name="History" id="History"></a>History</h2>

<p>Cognizant of our state's rich historical, socio-cultural, and economic ties to Latin America, the Board of Regents established  the Center for Latin American Studies at Arizona State University, the first area center at ASU, in 1965.</p>

<p>Since its inception, the Center for Latin American Studies has provided oversight and coordination of undergraduate and graduate education in Latin American Studies. The CLAS offers an interdisciplinary certificate in Latin American Studies in conjunction with the academic or professional degree in the student's major field of study. With the advent of the Barrett Honors College, CLAS has also helped to direct many undergraduate theses on subjects related to Latin America. The Center has also facilitated and promoted research and the dissemination of knowledge about the Inter-American region within the university and the community at-large.</p>

<p>The CLAS serves as the focal point and principal catalyst for Latin American scholarship at Arizona State University, with over 87 ASU faculty members affiliated with the Center, encompassing teaching and research areas as diverse as the humanities, the social sciences, the natural sciences and the professional schools. In addition, the CLAS is commits considerable resources to local, regional, state, national and international activities with the aim of furthering Latin American Scholarship.</p>

<div id="horizontalboxdecoration"></div>
<h2 align="left"><a name="Activities" id="Activities"></a>Activities 	</h2>
<p>    Principal activities of the Center include:
      <ul>* Coordinating student exchange programs throughout Latin America</ul>
      <ul>* Organizing seminars and research conferences on the region</ul>
      <ul>* Sponsoring events featuring Latin American arts and culture</ul>
      <ul>* Initiating and facilitating research about the Inter-American region</ul>
</p>

<div id="horizontalboxdecoration"></div>
<h2><a name="Community" id="Community"></a>Community Outreach</h2> 	
<p>The Center for Latin American Studies also seeks to enter into partnerships with community 
organizations and the Arizona business community with an interest in Latin America.  Our state's economy is increasingly tied to international trade. 
Of this overall trade, Arizona businesses are trading more with Latin American countries than ever before.</p>

<p>Mexico has overtaken Japan to become Arizona's primary trading partner. Arizona exports to Brazil 
have made a dramatic 700% increase in the last few years- growing from $17 million in 1993 to about 
$125 million through 1997. The copper mining industry in our state is similar to Chile's primary economic 
activity. High technology industries in Arizona are finding more and more markets throughout Latin America.</p>

<p>There is also heightened interest in the sub regional trading blocs such as MERCOSUR in the Southern 
Cone, the Andean Pact countries comprised of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, the Central American 
Common Market and of course, the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>

<p>The hemispheric goal of creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas will increase economic contacts 
between Arizona and the rest of this hemisphere in the years ahead. The CLAS can serve as a focal point 
for identifying programs that provide opportunities for partnerships for our larger Arizona community 
in the areas of language acquisition, socio-cultural exchange, and economic development opportunities.

<h2><a name="Friends" id="Friends"></a>Friends of the Center</h2>
<p>The CLAS outreach efforts includes the Friends of the Center for Latin American Studies. This 
association comprised of community and business leaders who have an interest in the people and nations 
of Latin America. It was organized to help identify and plan activities for the community at large. 
The Friends hold numerous social, cultural and business events to further link Arizona State University 
and the non-campus community. Through their annual Festival Latino, the Friends raise funds for 
students' scholarships, faculty research and other programs of the Center.</p>
