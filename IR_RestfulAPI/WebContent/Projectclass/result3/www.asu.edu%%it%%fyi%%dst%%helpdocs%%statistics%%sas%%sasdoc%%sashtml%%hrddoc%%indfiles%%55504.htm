Attention all medical researchers, biostatisticians, and anyone involved   with survival analysis!  Discover new avenues of exploration with SAS
software.  Alan Cantor approaches survival analysis with numerous SAS      programming macros, and his detailed illustrations guide you through
each example.  Presented in an informal task-oriented manner, this book    speaks to the seasoned statistician and the SAS software user who works
with medical research data.  The main areas of concentration include the   nature of survival data, Kaplan-Meier estimation, the log-rank test and
its variants, Cox regression, the Mantel-Byar method, sample size and      power calculations, and parameter (including cure rate) estimation.
Read it from cover to cover or turn directly to the topic that interests   you!  Take a journey with Cantor through the evolving scientific
environment of medical research in the computer age.
