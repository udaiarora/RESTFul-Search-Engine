      <h2>Mark Jacobs becomes Barrett Honors College dean </h2>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/MarkJacobs.jpg" width="180" height="241" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Mark 
        Jacobs, a leading scholar, teacher and administrator from top-ranked Swarthmore 
        College, has been named dean of ASU's Barrett Honors College, effective 
        Aug. 1.</p>
      <p>Jacobs, 53, brings to ASU a strong scientific background, as well as 
        a deep personal philosophy steeped in the ethical and human side of scientific 
        research. Swarthmore College is known for challenging its students to 
        look beyond the sheer science to explore, practically and ethically, how 
        that science is going to be used. </p>
      <p>"Arizona State University has scored a major coup in attracting a scholar 
        and academic administrator of the quality of Mark Jacobs," said ASU President 
        Michael M. Crow. "Whereas Swarthmore College is a mature, private, stand-alone 
        institution located in the Northeast, Barrett Honors College is still 
        in its infancy, is public and is embedded in a comprehensive research 
        university located in the Southwest. What the two have in common is that 
        both are liberal arts colleges of the highest quality."<br>
        Established only 15 years ago, the Barrett Honors College has become a 
        force that has helped shape the ASU student body. The typical honors college 
        freshman at ASU is in the top six percent of his or her high school class, 
        has SAT scores of 1300 or above, and has a high school grade-point average 
        of 3.8.</p>
      <p>The college, which enrolls more than 2,600 students, is also a powerhouse 
        in national scholarship competitions, and has helped make ASU a top school 
        in the number of National Merit Scholars enrolled, with ASU vaulting from 
        only four National Merit Scholars in 1988 to 350 this year. In the past 
        12 years, ASU students have won 13 Truman Scholarships, 11 Marshall Scholarships, 
        24 Goldwater Scholarships and three Rhodes Scholarships.</p>
      <p>Currently, Jacobs is the Centennial Professor of Biology at Swarthmore, 
        which is ranked among the handful of best liberal arts colleges in the 
        nation. He has served as chairman of the biology department and associate 
        provost at Swarthmore, and director of the college's Howard Hughes Medical 
        Institute program. He has been research mentor to more than 40 students 
        in formal projects.</p>
      <p>"Drawing on his many achievements at Swarthmore, including his deep commitment 
        to student success, Mark is the ideal person to take Barrett to new heights 
        of academic excellence," said Crow.</p>
      <p>Jacobs succeeds Ted Humphrey, founding dean of the Barrett Honors College, 
        who will return to the ASU faculty as the first Barrett Professor.</p>
      <p>Jacobs said, "It's such a privilege to have been picked to lead the Barrett 
        Honors College, which has been built by Ted Humphrey into one of the best 
        honors colleges at a public university in the country. It's a fantastic 
        job. I'm really excited by the ASU leadership in place. They're stimulating 
        people with excellent ideas."</p>
      <p>At Swarthmore, Jacobs had many years of experience working with excellent 
        undergraduate honors programs and earned a reputation as a highly effective 
        administrator. As an adviser to Swarthmore's biology majors, 50 percent 
        of whom go on to Ph.D. programs, he is familiar with the kind of training 
        students need to get into top graduate schools. </p>
      <p>A Guggenheim Fellowship recipient, Jacobs is the author of more than 
        50 publications, including papers in Science and PNAS (Proceedings of 
        the National Academy of Sciences), and for 12 years was associate editor-in-chief 
        of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, an international plant science journal. 
        He also serves as vice chairman of the Commission on Higher Education, 
        Middle States Association, which determines accreditation for colleges 
        and universities.</p>
      <p>Jacobs has been a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania, 
        Cambridge University, the University of California Santa Cruz and Universitat 
        Freiburg in Germany, where he held a NATO postdoctoral fellowship.</p>
      <p>Jacobs, who graduated magna cum laude from Harvard and earned his Ph.D. 
        at Stanford University in biological sciences, said one of his goals will 
        be to expand the college's academic programs and facilities, and increasing 
        the number of faculty who are affiliated with the college. </p>
      <p>"We are delighted that we were able to attract Mark Jacobs to ASU," said 
        Milton Glick, ASU executive vice president and provost. "He was chosen 
        from an extraordinary pool of applicants. Mark has distinguished himself 
        both as a teacher and a scholar in one of the nation's leading liberal 
        arts colleges, and will bring much to ASU and to Arizona.</p>
      <p>"The Barrett Honors College, under the leadership of Ted Humphrey, has 
        established itself among the best honors programs in the nation's public 
        universities. Mark has a keen sense of what will make it an exemplar program 
        in the nation, and how it can enhance the education of all of our students."<br>
