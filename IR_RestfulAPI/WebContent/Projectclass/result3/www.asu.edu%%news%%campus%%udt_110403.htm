      <h2>Design Team continues discussion of ASU's future evolution</h2>
      <p>The University
          Design Team (UDT) was appointed at the start of the spring 2003 semester
          and was asked to examine a set of issues within the context
            of preparing a five to 10 year "road map" to accommodate increasing
            numbers of students. <br>
        In its initial report, the University Design Team envisioned ASU
            as a single research university with multiple campuses sharing the
            ASU identity. </p>
      <p>The second phase is to determine how the various university services
          should be provided. Should support services be centrally organized
        and managed or should they be decentralized? How much autonomy should
        each
          campus have in the various service areas? Should the roles of the Graduate
          College, College of Extended Education, and the Office of Vice President
          for Research and Economic Affairs be revised? How should we manage
        enrollment within and among campuses?</p>
      <p><strong>University College</strong><br>
        The team suggests that the proposed University College target students
          who are in transition, whether they are new undeclared students, highly
          qualified students seeking to explore the many disciplines of the university,
          students leaving a major and in search of another, or students seeking
          to move between campuses.<br>
        Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (BIS) Program</p>
      <p>The UDT believes that
          BIS students at ASU Main would be served best by the creation or designation
          of an academic home (e.g., school or department)
          for the program, students, and faculty. Similar programs at ASU West
          (Integrative Studies) and ASU East (BIS) already reside in academic
        units. </p>
      <p><strong>Graduate College</strong><br>
        First and foremost, the team recommends that the Graduate College be
          re-established as a single administrative unit with university-wide
            responsibility (Main, East, West, and Downtown campuses) headed by
            a dean that reports
          to the University provost. Underlying its key role as an academic service
          unit, the Graduate College should provide strategic direction for the
          development of graduate education.</p>
      <p>This includes fostering differentiation
            and diversity among campuses as well as development of the ASU brand
            of graduate education through appropriate new program development
        and program review processes. The team also suggests the Graduate College
            should be an academic service unit that serves and advocates for
        prospective
            and current graduate students and that offers varying levels of service
            to academic departments/units to assist them in recruiting and retaining
            the best students. </p>
      <p>The UDT also believes that the Graduate College should
          continue to coordinate programmatic initiatives such as Preparing Future
          Faculty, Preparing
          Future Professionals, and Integrative Graduate Education and Research
          Training programs.</p>
      <p><strong>Extended Education</strong><br>
        Extending programs and services beyond the boundaries of the four campuses
          is essential to implementing "ASU as a force, not just a place." </p>
      <p>The
            UDT suggests the primary goal of an extended education organization
            ought to be identifying new markets and facilitating service to those
            markets. The range of products ought to include programs and courses
            for credit and/or non-credit, including training programs for specific
            populations.</p>
      <p><strong>Enrollment Management</strong><br>
        Consistent with recommendations in the Phase I report
            of the UDT, admission standards to the university should continue
            to be the same at all campuses,
            with variations in the standards and requirements among programs
            and schools. </p>
      <p>Also, the UDT suggests there should be a single administrative
          office within the university responsible for undergraduate admissions. </p>
      <p>Open
          forums have been added to discuss the report of the University Design
          Team. The sessions for Main Campus are noon - 1 p.m., Nov. 4, MU Ventana
          AB, room 226, and 1 - 2 p.m., Nov. 7, MU, Ventana AB, room 226. For
        ASU West, noon - 1 p.m., <br>
        Nov. 18, La Sala Ballroom. For ASU East, noon - 1 p.m., Nov 19, Williams
          Campus Union Ballroom. And for Downtown Center, noon - 1 p.m., Nov.
          25, C368/370. </p>
