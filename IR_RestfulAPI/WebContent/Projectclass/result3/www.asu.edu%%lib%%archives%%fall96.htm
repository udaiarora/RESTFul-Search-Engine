<h2>The Labriola Center</h2>      
The Labriola National American Indian Data Center, part of ASU Libraries, is a research library that
contains and disseminates information on American Indian/Alaska Native tribes.  It provides access to this
information through the use of computer databases, the Internet, and CD-ROM.  The collection is national
in scope and brings together in one location current and historic information on government, culture, religion
and world view, social life, customs, tribal history, and information on individuals from the United States,
Canada, and Sonora, Mexico.
<p>
<b>HOURS:</b>
   The Center is open from 1 p.m. until 5 p.m. Monday-Friday to assist
 researchers in the use of
the non-circulating collection.  Patrons 
seeking help outside these hours may visit the Luhrs Reading Room
on the fourth level of Hayden Library or leave a message on the Center's
 Voice Mail at 480/965-6490.
<p>
Patricia A. Etter, Curator, may be

We announced the upcoming publication by Gale Research, of a new reference
 work, <i>First Americans
Firsts</i>.  Ph.D. candidates, AnCita Benally
 (Navajo) and Kathy Kingfisher (Cherokee), are working on the
project under the direction of Editor-in-Chief, Karen Gayton Swisher.  
<p>

</table>
They are compiling short biographies of Native Americans from 
North, Central, and South America, who
have  made significant first
 achievements and received recognition both nationally and 
internationally. 
Publication is expected in late spring, 1997.

<p>
The students  are compiling information from many sources for the ambitious project.  The Labriola Center
collections have provided numerous resources for their work.  Some are:
<p>
<b><i>The Native North American Almanac</b></i> (Gale Research, 1994).  The volume provides historical and
contemporary information about the Native peoples of North America. It contains chronology, demographic
and distribution descriptions and histories, discussions of religion and religious change, art, music, theater,
film, traditional arts, history, economy, administration, and law and legal issues. Special efforts were made
to gather experts on numerous aspects of U.S. and Canadian Native life, including Native authors.
<p>
<b><i>Native Americans in the Twentieth Century: An Encyclopedia</b></i> (Garland Publishing, Inc., 1994). 
Included in this volume are signed articles by historians, anthropologists, and other specialists representing  a
wide range on the political spectrum.  The encyclopedia covers important aspects of Native American life in
the United States during this century. 
<p>
<b><i>Notable Native Americans</b></i> (Gale research Inc., 1995).  Here is an extensive compilation of biographical
and bibliographical information on more than 265 notable Native North American men and women
throughout history, and from all fields of endeavor.  Seventy percent of the narrative essays focus on
contemporary or twentieth-century individuals.
<p>
<b><i>Biographical Dictionary of Indians of the Americas</b></i>, 2nd ed. (American Indian Publishers, Inc.,
1991), 3 volumes.  The second edition contains close to 2,000 biographies and 1,000 portraits of Native
Americans in the Western Hemisphere from the earliest times to the present.
<p>
<b><i>American Indian and Alaska Native Newspapers and Periodicals</b></i>, 3 volumes, 1826-1985
(Greenwood Press, 1986).  These are guides to American Indian and Alaska Native newspapers and
periodicals edited or published by American Indians or Alaska Natives and those whose primary purpose
was to publish information about contemporary Indians or Alaska Natives.
<p>
<b><i>American Indian Lives</b></i> (Facts on File, 1994), 7 volumes.  The multi-volume series introduces readers to
some of the most extraordinary figures in Native American history.  Volumes cover: Spiritual Leaders;
Political Leaders and Peacemakers; Artists and Craftspeople; Performers; and Athletes.
<p>
<b><i>Chronology of Native North American History From Pre-Columbian Times to the Present</b></i>
(Gale Research Inc., 1994).  The <i>Chronology</i> presents a comprehensive listing of historical and cultural
events about the Native peoples of North America and Canada.  Emphasis is given to recent historical
events although there is considerable historical information about the many cultures that lived before
Columbus landed in 1492.
<p>
<h2>Susan LaFlesche Picotte Honored</h2>
A new exhibit in the Labriola Center honors the first Native American woman physician, Susan LaFlesche
Picotte.  Picotte was born on the Omaha Indian Reservation in 1865 to Joseph LaFlesche, the last traditional
chief of the Omaha Tribe, and to Mary Gale.  
<p>
She graduated from Hampton Institute in Virginia in 1887, then from Women's Medical College in
Philadelphia in 1889 at the head of her class.  She returned to Nebraska, and won a government
appointment as physician for the Omaha Agency, the first such post to be occupied by a Native American
woman, and among the first to be filled by any Native American.
<p>
In 1913, she realized a lifelong goal--the opening of a hospital to serve both the Omaha and whites  near her
new home in Walthill, Nebraska.  The hospital was built on a hilltop. One side had a screened-in porch, with
hammocks and beds, where patients could recover in fresh air and sunshine.
<p>
Members of the Western History Association visited the hospital in October 1996.  Now known as the
Picotte Memorial Hospital and home of the Susan LaFlesche Picotte Center, it was dedicated a National
Historic Landmark on April 19, 1993. Many individuals have donated both money and time to renovate the
Center.  The National Park Service also provides some financial support.
<p>
The Center now hosts an after-school program for children, houses Red Feather/Native American Youth
Services, and provides counseling for families.  Susan LaFlesche Picotte Day is celebrated during the third
week of September in Walthill.

<h2>Commemorative Stamps</h2>
The National Museum of the American Indian celebrated the unveiling of the U.S. Postal Service's new
stamp series, "American Indian Dances," with an outdoor presentation of Native dance and song on June 12
at the Heye Center in New York City.  The five stamps in the series represent intertribal dances--three
enjoyed in contemporary powwows.
<p>
The stamps have been framed and are on view in the Labriola Center.  Also available at the Center is a CD-ROM, which has been produced to accompany the stamps.  It features the Cedartree Singers, who perform
ten songs and includes <i>The Fancy Dance Song, Hoop Dance Song, Women's Southern Cloth, the Butterfly
Dance, Sidewinder</i>, and <i>Miss Indian USA Honor Song</i>.
<p>
<h2>RidingIn Leads Historians to Sacred Site</h2>
The Western History Association met in Lincoln, Nebraska in October for its annual meeting.  A special
treat was the chance to visit the most sacred of the Pawnee holy sites, led by Dr. James RidingIn, Assistant
Professor of Justice Studies at Arizona State University.  
<p>
Pahuk means headland or promotory, and is located on a heavily wooded bluff overlooking the Platte River
north of Cedar Bluffs, Nebraska.  The 150-acre site was purchased by Dr. Louis Gilbert and his wife and
when they discovered that Pahuk was a sacred site, they petitioned to have it placed on the National
Register of Historic Places and began work in 1974 to restore it to native prairie.  They also set out to
develop a master plan for forest and prairie management and restoration.  Finally, they negotiated a
preservation easment with the Nebraska State Historical Society, which ensures that the Pahuk Historic
Natural Area will never be disturbed.
<p>
The Gilberts learned that Pahuk was the most important of the five Pawnee religious sites.  They learned
that a huge cave said to be below the bluff was the dwelling or meeting place of the Nahu-rac,
supernaturally endowed animals which were the servants and messengers of Ti-ra-wa, who could intervene
in the affairs of men and from whom the medicine men of the Pawnee gained their skills.
<p>
<h2>Manuscripts Added to the Labriola Collection</h2>
<b><i>The Charles Newton Letters:</b></i>  The collection contains 35 holograph letters from Dr. Charles
Newton to his wife between Decemgher 25, 1901 and May 5, 1903.  These were written from the Western
Navajo Training School at Algert, Arizona and Tuba City, Arizona.  The Doctor describes his life,
vicissitudes of travel,  and activities in a then-remote part of northern Arizona.
<p>
