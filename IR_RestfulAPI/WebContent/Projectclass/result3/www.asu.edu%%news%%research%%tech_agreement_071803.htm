      <h2>Technology transfer agreement gives ASU researchers tools for developing
        new weapons to fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria </h2>
      <p>Developing new weapons against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungi
        is the goal of Arizona State University researchers working with technology
        donated from Hercules, Inc., Wilmington, Del., a global manufacturer
        of chemical specialties used to make a variety of products for home,
        office and industrial markets.</p>
      <p>Peter Slate, CEO of Arizona Technology Enterprises, the technology commercialization
        company for ASU, today announced that Hercules has signed an agreement
        to transfer to ASU patents and know-how related to new microbiocides
        for developing potential new biotechnology products. </p>
      <p>"Acceptance of this donation is a reflection of ASU's commitment to
        advancing cutting-edge research, both through university efforts as well
        as in partnership with industry," said Slate.</p>
      <p>"This technology package from Hercules is exciting because it is a new
        approach to microbiocides that gives broad-spectrum control of many species
        of bacteria and possible other microorganisms," said Charles Arntzen,
        world-renowned plant biologist and holder of the Florence Ely Nelson
        Presidential Chair at ASU. "The products that could be developed may
        provide alternatives to antibiotics in several markets," he said.</p>
      <p>Stopping the growth of microbes, such as bacteria or fungi, has wide
        application in health care, agriculture, and environmental decontamination.
        Antibiotics have been successful products for the pharmaceutical industry,
        but their enormous benefits must also be balanced against emerging problems
        of microbial resistance. Overuse of antibiotics in agriculture and aquaculture
        have led to calls for newer, better alternatives.</p>
      <p>Current sales of antibiotics and other biocides in the global animal
        health industry are estimated to be $12-$15 billion annually, and biocide
        use in aquaculture is valued at more than $1 billion per year and growing
        rapidly, according to the World Health Organization. </p>
      <p>Ed Birge, professor of microbiology at ASU, said ASU's active research
        in related areas of microbiology will help broaden the opportunities
        for using the donated technology to develop other marketable products.
        "There are potential opportunities to utilize new microbiocides in the
        consumer product markets, such as in the areas of antibacterial soaps
        and creams," he said.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Fink, vice president for Research and Economic Affairs at ASU,
        said, "It's gratifying that this leading U.S. corporation recognizes
        ASU's research capability and has entrusted us with a technology portfolio
        that will have very substantial value when the products are validated
        by further research."</p>
      <p> <br>
        Richard Sujdak, director of Central Research Services at Hercules, said,
          "We are proud of our biotechnology research team that originally discovered
          the novel antimicrobials that are the subject of the patents. However,
          since the microbiocide uses for these chemicals fall outside our corporate
          business interests, we are pleased to donate them to an outstanding
          research university for further development. Given ASU's research expertise
          in this area, the university is an obvious choice for the donation."</p>
      <p>The new technology area will be incorporated into programs of the Arizona
        Biodesign Institute at ASU. The Arizona Biodesign Institute, under the
        leadership of world-renowned researcher, scholar and science policymaker
        George Poste, is focused on improving human health and quality of life
        through use-inspired biosystems research and effective multidisciplinary
        partnerships. </p>
