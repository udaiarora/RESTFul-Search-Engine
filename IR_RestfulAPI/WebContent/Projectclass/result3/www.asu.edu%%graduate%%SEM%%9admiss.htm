<p><b>Cost of Attending ASU</b>
<p>The Graduate College web site has information on what it costs to attend ASU.&nbsp; 
  Expenses are based on 2002-03 budget figures and estimates the cost of tuition 
  and fees, books and supplies, room and board, personal expenses and transportation. 
  You can visit that web site at:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/financial.html">http://www.asu.edu/graduate/financial/costs.htm</a>
<p><b>Financial Aid</b>
<p>Financial aid for graduate study can come from the department, from
other university resources or from external resources.
<p><b>Financial Support Awarded by the Program</b>
<p>Until the Admissions Committee admits a student to the program, no consideration
is given for financial aid.&nbsp; Almost all students who are admitted,
however, will receive some type of financial aid.&nbsp; The most common
source of financial aid is research and teaching assistantships.
<p><b>Research Assistantships</b>
<p>Research assistantships are awarded on a competitive basis by the program
as "entering support" or by a program faculty member as "faculty support."
<p><i>Program Supported Research Assistantships</i>: Program supported
research assistantships involve working as an interns in a multi-user materials
laboratory or facility.&nbsp; Research assistants work a minimum of 20
hours per week on assignments designed to increase the student<font face="Times New Roman,Times">í</font>s
knowledge of basic research methods. These positions are intended to give
the entering student time to concentrate on the required foundation courses.&nbsp;
The assistantships carry a modest stipend for living expenses.&nbsp; Research
assistants who are not Arizona residents are awarded waivers of non-resident
tuition as part of the financial aid package.&nbsp; In addition, all research
assistants who are hired 50% time, are provided with free major medical
health insurance. Research assistants must enroll for a minimum of 6 credits
(maximum of 12) of general SEM course work per semester.
<p><i>Faculty Supported Research Assistantships</i>:&nbsp; During their
first in the program and while students are being supported by the program,
students are encouraged to meet with faculty of the program to learn about
their research work.&nbsp; The student is expected to make a transition
from program support to faculty support.&nbsp; The student should choose
a faculty member who will become their dissertation advisor and who will
support the student through the faculty member<font face="Times New Roman,Times">í</font>s
research grants.&nbsp; Stipends vary among research groups, but are usually
higher than the stipend awarded entering the program.
<p><b>Teaching Assistantships</b>
<p>The interdisciplinary nature of the program involves the participation
of related departments.&nbsp; The departments of Chemistry and Physics
and the Center for Solid State Science each allocate a teaching assistantship
each year to an entering student in the SEM Program.&nbsp; These teaching
assistants work a minimum of 20 hours per week supporting the instruction
of a lower division undergraduate chemistry or physics course or work in
the Center for Solid State Science Visualization Center, which supports
materials teaching.&nbsp; The TA will work under the supervision of the
instructor assigned to the course.&nbsp; Duties of the TA may include lecturing,
leading discussion groups, serving as assistants to laboratory classes,
and grading tests and papers.
<p>International students whose native language is not English must show
proof of English proficiency in order to be allowed to TA.&nbsp; The university
requires that international students take and pass the Test of Spoken English
(TSE) or the ASU SPEAK test before they can be awarded a teaching assistantship.
Stipends for teaching assistantships vary with the department awarding
the TA.&nbsp; As with research assistantships, TAs also receive free health
insurance and non-resident tuition waivers.
<p><b>Graduate Academic Scholarship (GAS)</b>
<p>This scholarship pays for resident tuition. Awarded to graduate students
with outstanding academic records.
<p><b>Graduate Tuition Scholarship (GTS)</b>
<p>This scholarship pays for non-resident tuition.&nbsp; Allows non-resident
graduate students with outstanding academic records to pay tuition at the
resident rate.
<p><b>Other Sources of Campus Financial Aid</b> 
<p>The Graduate College web site has information on other types graduate financial 
  assistance on their website: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/financial/index.htm">www.asu.edu/graduate/financial/index.htm</a>
