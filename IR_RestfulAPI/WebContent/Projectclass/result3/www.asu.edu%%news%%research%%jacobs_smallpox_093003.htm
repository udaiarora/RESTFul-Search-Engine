      <h2>ASU virologist developing practical smallpox vaccine</h2>
      <p>Smallpox is one of humanity's oldest horrors and is still one of our
        greatest menaces, but, paradoxically, it is fear itself that keeps us
        from protecting ourselves against it. </p>
      <p>We live in fear of a potentially devastating release of the virus by
        terrorists because our current smallpox vaccine, though very effective
        in providing immunity, relies on using the live vaccinia (once called
        "cowpox") virus that is itself deadly dangerous to small percentage of
        the people that would be vaccinated. Though mass vaccination would make
        us safe from this greatest of all bioterrors, the risks and the real
        cost in human lives has kept us from taking this step.</p>
      <p><img src="research_images/Jacobs_093003.jpg" width="180" height="277" align="right">Arizona State University virologist Bertram Jacobs thinks he may have
        a way to end the worry. Jacobs has received a $5.5 million, five-year
        grant from the National Institutes of Health's Biodefense Partnership
        program to develop and test a modified smallpox vaccine that is expected
        to be identical in effectiveness to the current vaccine while being "treatable"
        for dangerous reactions.</p>
      <p>Jacobs' partners in the grant are Dr. Jeffrey Jacobson at New York's
        Beth Israel Hospital and NYU; Dr. Alfred Prince, Dr. Mohamed Tarek Shata
        and Linda Andrus at the New York Blood Center; and Virax Holdings Limited,
        an Australian biomedical corporation. ASU will develop the modified vaccinia
        virus and do preliminary animal testing; Virax will create a clinical-grade
        vaccine from ASU stocks; the New York Blood Center and Beth Israel Hospital
        will do further animal testing and then human clinical trials.</p>
      <p>The project aims to sidestep a problem that has prevented weaker, less
        dangerous vaccinia strains from being used as smallpox vaccines: they
        can not be tested for effectiveness because smallpox no longer exists
        in human populations and exposing humans to it for testing is too dangerous
        and morally unacceptable.</p>
      <p>"The problem with making a safer vaccine is that you have to prove that
        it works, and you can't do that, because smallpox isn't out there anymore
        to use a vaccine against," Jacobs said. "What we're talking about is
        a vaccine that, when you don't treat it, is identical to the vaccine
        that we know works. All we've added is the capability of treating it."</p>
      <p>Working with a strain that is known to be highly effective against smallpox,
        Jacobs' team aims to add genes to the virus that will give it a hidden
        weakness: susceptibility to a common, widely tolerated antibiotic or
        anti-viral drug. The modifications will not change the virus's effectiveness
        in immunizing against smallpox, but will give doctors a sure and effective
        way to treat it in rare cases where it causes serious illness.</p>
      <p>"The current vaccine works, we know that, but some people come down
        with complications, and when they do, there's not much you can do to
        treat them," Jacobs explained.</p>
      <p>"We know enough about the molecular biology of vaccinia virus that we
        think we can create a 'backdoor' to the virus - make it sensitive to
        some very common drug so that if someone comes up with a complication,
        you can treat it. It's a way of putting a leash on a virus that is really
        useful but can sometimes get out of control," he said.</p>
      <p>Among the drugs that the team is examining as a potential vaccinia "leash"
        are tetracycline, a commonly used antibiotic, and acyclovir, a widely
        tolerated drug used to control the herpes simplex virus.</p>
      <p>"If we can engineer the virus to be sensitive to one of these drugs,
        we can treat with a drug that is currently taken every day by millions
        of people with virtually no complications," Jacobs noted. </p>
      <p>A long-time vaccinia researcher, Jacobs is enthusiastic about the project
        because he believes it represents the best opportunity for a vaccine
        that will be acceptable for non-crisis use in large populations. If all
        goes well, the grant calls for the vaccine to be through clinical trials
        and ready for government approval in five years, thus effectively ending
        the danger of smallpox being used as a weapon of bioterror.</p>
      <p>Jacobs points out that the research may also be important for other
        medical research involving live viruses, including gene therapy and the
        use of viruses in combating bacterial infections.</p>
      <p>&quot;This is a way of putting a leash on a virus, and it provides a
        solution to a big problem in viral research," he said. "For example,
        we're very interested in trying to treat cancer patients with vaccinia
        virus - using the virus to kill cancer cells. It would be really nice
        to have a leash on it, so that if something goes wrong we can treat the
        virus infection. </p>
      <p>"I think it will be much easier to get treatments like this in clinical
        trials if we have a treatable strain of virus." </p>
