<p>The mission of Arizona State University is to provide outstanding programs in instruction, research, and creative activity, to promote economic development, and to provide service appropriate for the nation, the state of Arizona, and the state&#146;s major metropolitan area.

<p>
Arizona State University considers intercollegiate athletics to be an integral part of the university.  Consequently, the intercollegiate athletics program is expected to reflect the same standards of excellence and integrity that characterize the instructional, research, and public service activities of the university as a whole. Within this context, the mission of the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics  (ICA) is to provide opportunities for student-athletes to achieve at the highest levels of academic and athletics excellence, thereby providing them with opportunities for personal growth, offering a unifying force to the campus community, and creating a source of pride among and support from external constituencies of the university.

<p>	
Arizona State University is committed to the institutional control of its intercollegiate athletics program.  The president of Arizona State University  is responsible for, and has final authority in all matters (including personnel) related to, the operation of the intercollegiate athletics program.

<p>
Arizona State University regards the student-athlete primarily as a <a href="acd002.html#student" target="New">student</a>, with academic qualifications, individual rights, personal interests, and aspirations similar to those of all students.   The graduation rates of recruited student-athletes as a group, or of any significant subgroup thereof,  are expected to be at least equal to those achieved by the student body at large.  Moreover, student-athletes are encouraged to integrate fully into the broader community of students, and to utilize the full range of services and opportunities provided by the university for the benefit of all students.

<p>
Arizona State University is committed to the principles of amateurism, gender and ethnic diversity, nondiscrimination, ethical conduct, good sportsmanship, and fair play  in all aspects of its intercollegiate athletics program. 

<p>
Arizona State University is committed to the self-regulation of all aspects of the intercollegiate athletics program according to internal <a href="acd002.html#rule" target="New">rules</a> that are at least as stringent as those imposed by official regulatory bodies.  These internal controls are intended to achieve full compliance with external regulations and to ensure that the intercollegiate athletics program is operated in a manner consistent with the university&#146;s mission and goals.

<p>
Arizona State University values and encourages the support of the intercollegiate athletics program by those within and outside of the university.  All such assistance is expected to conform to the internal and external regulations that govern such activities.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b></font>

<p>
The policies listed below indicate the strength of Arizona State University&#146;s commitment to the philosophy articulated above and illustrate the manner in which certain athletically related issues are addressed. <p>

<p>
<b>Administration</b>

<p>
Institutional control of intercollegiate athletics at Arizona State University provides for appropriate participation in the development of athletics policies by the director of athletics, the faculty athletics representative, the Intercollegiate Athletics (ICA) Board, and any other groups or individuals as may be designated at any time by the president.  Under the direction of the president, appropriate campus constituencies shall have the opportunity to periodically review the extent to which athletics policies and the institutional philosophy described herein are implemented. 

<p>
The university administration and ICA share the responsibility for compliance with all regulations related to intercollegiate athletics, including those imposed by the institution itself, the Arizona Board of Regents, the Pacific 10 Conference, and the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA). 

<p>
Searches for senior athletics administrators and head coaches will be conducted in accordance with ICA Board policies and procedures.  All candidates for such positions are required to have earned at least a baccalaureate degree, have a record of compliance with NCAA legislation, and support the principles contained in this philosophy statement.

<p>
<b>Recruiting</b>

<p>
Each coach and other staff members involved in recruiting are expected to understand and support the university&#146;s philosophy of intercollegiate athletics.  The university&#146;s commitment to the academic, as well as the athletic, success of its student-athletes shall be clearly communicated to all recruited student-athletes by the coaching staff prior to the offer of athletically-related financial aid.  All members of the ICA staff who are involved in recruiting are expected to have full knowledge of institutional, Pacific 10 Conference, and NCAA rules  governing recruiting. 

<p>
The  director of athletics annually will provide notification to all individuals and groups outside the university who contribute to the intercollegiate athletics program of the constraints imposed on recruiting and other athletically related activities by such external individuals or groups.  Those who do not fully comply with these regulations shall be disassociated from the intercollegiate athletics program at Arizona State University.

<p>
<b>Admission</b>

<p>
Admissions standards for student-athletes shall be the same as those applied to other students.  Admissions decisions are made by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (or Division of Graduate Studies, where appropriate) and may be appealed only through procedures available to all students.

<p>
<b>Financial Aid</b>

<p>
Athletics scholarships will be renewed annually provided that student-athletes continue to be team members, comply with the student-athlete code of conduct and team-specific rules, and continue to make satisfactory progress toward graduation. All financial awards and adjustments shall be made in full accordance with institutional,  Pacific 10 Conference, and NCAA regulations.

<p>
<b>Certification of Eligibility </b>

<p>
The responsibility for certification of eligibility is shared by ICA and the faculty athletics representative, with the latter exercising final authority.  However, eligibility appeals related to institutional rules may be heard by the ICA Board, or a designated subcommittee thereof, whose decision in such matters is final. 

<p>
<b>Academic Assistance and Progress</b>

<p>
The academic advising of student-athletes is the joint responsibility of ICA and the deans of the respective colleges, with the latter exercising final authority.  The primary goal of the academic advising program shall be to provide academic support services to assist student-athletes in making academic progress and graduating from the university.

<p>
Academic support services shall be provided by ICA to student-athletes.  Those who have special academic needs (e.g., learning disabilities) shall receive appropriate reasonable accommodation.  Academic support services shall be reviewed periodically by academic authorities outside of ICA.

<p>
The faculty athletics representative and the athletics administrator responsible for academic services continually shall monitor the academic progress of student-athletes toward the goal of graduation.  Academic progress reports for each sports team shall be prepared by the faculty athletics representative and provided to ICA, the ICA Board, the Academic Senate, and the Office of the President.

<p>
The ICA Board shall approve all schedules of competition and may, at its discretion, also approve all practice schedules.  The ICA Board shall consider the time demands associated with both athletic and academic activities, and shall lessen or eliminate conflicts it determines to be inappropriate. 

<p>
<b>Fiscal Responsibility</b>

<p>
The president (or designee) shall approve the ICA budget each year and shall provide for an annual audit of all revenues and expenditures.  The audit shall be conducted by a qualified auditor, selected by the president (or designee), who is not an institutional staff member. 

<p>
<b>Physical Well-Being of Student-Athletes</b>

<p>
Arizona State University is committed to the total well-being of its student-athletes and offers a broad range of services to assist them in their emotional and physical development.

<p>
The university prohibits the use by student-athletes of all illegal and NCAA-banned performance-enhancing substances, and fully supports the NCAA drug testing program.  All student-athletes will be tested for drug and substance abuse in accordance with Arizona State University&#146;s drug testing policies and procedures. 

<p>
Medical care for student-athletes shall be provided under the direction of the head team physician, who reports to the director of the Campus Health Service (SHWC), or external consultants who have been approved by the director of the SHWC.  The director of the SHWC and the director of athletics shall provide for a training room environment conducive to the provision of quality medical care to student-athletes.

<p>
<b>Individual Student-Athlete Responsibility</b>

<p>
Arizona State University endeavors to foster in its student-athletes a sense of personal responsibility and accountability, and an understanding of the efforts required for academic as well as athletic success.  Although ASU has established specific programs to encourage both academic and athletic achievement by student-athletes, the success of each student remains an individual responsibility. 

<p>
<b>Distribution </b><p>

This philosophy statement shall be widely distributed to both on-campus and off-campus constituencies, including faculty, staff, student-athletes, the student body, and the members  of booster organizations.
