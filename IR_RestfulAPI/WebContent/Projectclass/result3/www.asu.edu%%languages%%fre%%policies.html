      <P><span class="style13"><B><U>Placement</U></B>: In order to be successful
          in a language learning environment, a student must place him/herself
          in the appropriate class level.&nbsp; On the first day of class, your instructor will explain
        the Department of Languages and Literatures suggested placement policy
        to you.&nbsp; If you are not a native speaker but have only learned French
        in an informal environment, and if this is your first or second semester
        at ASU, you may take a comprehensive exam to get credit for your knowledge.&nbsp; Ask
        the DLL Testing Supervisor (LL B404) for details on this process.&nbsp; If
        you have taken high school French or some other form of formal instruction
        and are unsure at which level you should be, you may take a computerized
        placement test during the first few days of the course.&nbsp; All students
        currently registered in 101 who have had French before and all 111 students
        will take this exam during their first lab session. </span>
      <P><span class="style13"><B><U>Withdrawals</U></B>: If it becomes necessary for you to withdraw
      from the class, do so <B>as soon as possible</B>.&nbsp; Until the third
      week you do not need the instructor's signature.&nbsp; From the third to
      the eighth week you may withdraw (if you are passing the course) with the
      instructor's signature.&nbsp; After that you must receive a grade for the
      course unless you withdraw from all of your classes at ASU. </span>
      <P><span class="style13"><B><U>Incompletes</U></B>: Incompletes are given
          only under dire circumstances.&nbsp; Do <B>not</B> ask
      for an incomplete unless you have <B>documented</B> proof of a medical
      or family emergency that prevents you from completing the course.&nbsp; You
      must also be passing the course at the time you ask for an incomplete;
      therefore, if you receive a failing grade on midterm report sheets you
      will not be eligible for an incomplete. </span>
      <P><span class="style13"><B><U>Disabled Students</U></B>: If you are a
          disabled student in need of special arrangements for exams and/or homework,
          bring your instructor a letter from the Disabled Student Resources
          office.&nbsp; You may also
      have to meet with the course supervisor to finalize the arrangements. </span>
      <P><span class="style13"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B><U>Student Athletes</U></B>: If you are a student
        athlete in need of special arrangements for exams and/or homework due
        to your participation in official competitions on and off campus, provide
        your instructor with a copy of your sports <U>schedule</U> during the
        first week of class.&nbsp; If you do <B>not</B> make him/her aware of
        your status and possible schedule conflicts at the beginning of the semester,
        your instructor is <B>not</B> required to make special arrangements for
        you after the fact.</FONT>
      </span>
      <P><span class="style13"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B><U>Audits</U></B>: If
            you are auditing the course, talk to your instructor about what is
            expected of you to receive an "X" (successful audit) instead of a "W" (withdrawal)
            as your grade.</FONT>
      </span>
      <P><span class="style13"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B><U>Tutoring</U></B>:
            If you need a tutor, you may sign up for one with the Learning Resource
            Center, located in the Student Services Building A361, as soon as
            possible.&nbsp; The number
          of tutors is limited, and they are assigned on a first-come first-served
          basis.&nbsp; The DLL also has a card index of referrals for people
          who tutor (for a fee)--these listings are provided as a courtesy, and
          the Department of Languages and Literatures does not sponsor or endorse
          these tutors.&nbsp; There is also a bulletin board outside the fourth
          floor B-wing elevators of the LL building on which people post fliers
          for tutoring.&nbsp; Your instructor is <B>not</B> a tutor and will
          be available to help students only during his/her weekly office hours.</FONT>
      </span>
      <P><span class="style13"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B><U>Cheating</U></B>:
            If you are suspected of academic dishonesty by your instructor, you
            will be referred to the TA Supervisor, the French Section Coordinator,
            and the Department Chair.&nbsp; If
          you are found guilty, appropriate disciplinary measures will be taken
          against you.</FONT>
      </span>
      <P><span class="style13"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B><U>Absences</U></B>:
            If you cannot attend class, call your instructor ahead of time at
            the DLL main office (965-6281) and leave a message explaining the
            reason why you cannot attend.&nbsp; Call
          a friend in the class to get the assignment for the next day; late
          homework will not be accepted by most instructors.&nbsp; It is <B>your</B> responsibility
          to get the assignment and missed work from a classmate <B>before</B> you
          attend the next class, and you are expected to be prepared for that
          class as well.&nbsp; During his/her office hours, your instructor will
          be happy to help you understand work that you missed, but s/he should
          not have to spend time looking through his/her grade book to see what
          homework you may have missed.</FONT>
      </span>
      <P><span class="style13"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B><U>Making up incompletes</U></B>:
            If you are attending this class to make up an incomplete, you should
            not have registered again for this class this semester.&nbsp; During the first
          week, you must inform your instructor of your status, since your name
          will not appear on the roster.&nbsp; Let your new instructor know who
          your former instructor was and what conditions you need to fulfill
          in order to make up the course.&nbsp; These arrangements should have
          been specified in the written agreement signed by the student and the
          original instructor at the time the incomplete was given.</FONT>
