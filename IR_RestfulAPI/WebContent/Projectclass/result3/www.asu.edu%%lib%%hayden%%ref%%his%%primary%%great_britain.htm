CALL NUMBER: Center for Research Libraries (Request at Interlibrary Loan). NUMBER OF REELS/FICHE: INDEX OR GUIDE: Godfrey Davis, Medieval Cartularies of Great Britain: a Short Catalogue (DA 170 .D31x stacks). This work describes the British Library collection of cartularies and many others as well. A complete description appears on the first reel of each part. There is also a listing by locality (provided with Part 4). Request from CRL. SCOPE AND CONTENTS: Filmed from the collection of the British Library. Consists of four parts: 1) Arundel-Cotton Nero; 2) Cotton Otho-Cotton roll, 3) Egerton-Lansdowne; and 4) royal-Add. Roll. Cartularies are registers of deeds and other material pertinent to the property of an estate and are probably the most valuable category of records for the period between the Doomsday Book and the 13th century. The collation and transcription of documents (deeds, charters of privilege and rights( into a volume or roll was the most common way of defining a particular collection of documents of a religious institution or a landholding family until Chancery began enrolments of charter and other documents. Monasteries compiled the earliest ones and the practice spread to secular estate owners. Cartularies provide information on the power of the monasteries and ecclesiastical landowners and give a detailed picture of the accumulation of lands and the growth of influence of the great noble families. They document the rise of the country gentry in the early modern period and also form the main body of evidence for the history of the earlier medieval peasantry. They were often used in court as evidence of title as late as the 19th century and are first rate historical and genealogical sources.
