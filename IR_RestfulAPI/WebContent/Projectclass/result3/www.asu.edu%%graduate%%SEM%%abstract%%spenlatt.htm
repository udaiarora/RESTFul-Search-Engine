AB-Initio Quantum Molecular Dynamics </h2><p></a><i>J. C. H. Spence, Y. M. Huang and O. Sankey</i><br>Department of Physics, Arizona state University, Tempe, AZ 85287, U.S.A.<p><i>Abstract:</i>  This paper describes calculations by ab-initio quantum molecular dynamics methods of the dependence of lattice trapping energies on applied load for cracks running on (111) in silicon. A type of flexible boundary condition is used in which outer atom positions are relaxed using an empirical interatomic potential, while inner atoms are treated ab-initio. The form of the surface reconstruction which results from cleavage is also predicted for both the shuffle and glide cleavages. The fractional range of loads <i>K<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>min</sub></i> in the lattice trapping range (without kinks) is found to be 1.31 and the energy barrier to the advance of a straight crack line along [110] is found to be 0.24 eV per surface atom.<p><i>Acta mettal. mater.
