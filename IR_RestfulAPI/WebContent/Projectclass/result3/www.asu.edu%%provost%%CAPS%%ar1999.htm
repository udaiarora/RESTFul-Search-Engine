<H2><b>Committee on Academic Professional Status
(CAPS)</b></H2>
<font face="arial, helvetica">

<h3><b>Annual Report 1999</b></h3>
<P>
Members:
<ul>
<li>Thomas Keating (Co-Chair)
<li>Molly McCartney (Co-Chair)
<li>Karl Weiss
<li>Ken Furuta
<li>Helen Seaton
<li>Maggie Mangini
</ul>
<P>
The Committee on Academic Professional Status (CAPS) occupied itself with three issues during
the 1998-99 fiscal year:
<P>
<ol>
<li>The first issue was that of  post continuing status review' for academic professioanls.  Several
years ago, a  post-tenure review' process was established for faculty at ASU.  Since then,
questions have arisen as to whether a similar process was needed for academic professionals on
campus.  Over a year ago, this committee became aware of efforts in various units on campus to
develop/apply a  post-continuing status review' process.  In responding to these efforts, CAPS
requested that the Provost's Office either 1) announce that there was to be no  post-continuing
status review' process; or 2) authorize CAPS to draft a University-wide process to serve as a
guideline for individual units.  The Provost's Office authorized us to pursue the second course of
action.  The committee spent several months discussing this issue among its memeers and with
members of the Provost's Advisory Committee on Academic Professional status (PACAPS).  We
held two open meeetings with interested academic professionals.  As a result, a <a
href="postcont.htm">draft policy and
process</a> was unanimously approved by CAPS and submitted to the Provost's Office. 
Following
this, two members of CAPS (Thomas Keating and Karl Weiss) met with the Council of Deans to
discuss our recommendations.  At this meeting, some deans suggested that there was no pressing
need for such a policy.  The outcome of the meeting was that any further action on this matter will
be held in abeyance pending further discusssion.
<P>
<li>A second task undertaken by CAPS in 1998-99 was to review the constitutions and by-laws
of all ASU colleges with academic professionals in their ranks.  The purpose of this review was to
evaluate the position and participation accorded to academic professsionals, and determine
whether colleges wire in compliance with relevant university policies in this regard.  We
concluded that all colleges except two (Public Programs and Law) were in compliance with
unviersity policies regarding the role and responsibilities of academic professionals.  We will be
forwarding specific recommendations for bringing these two colleges into line with university
policies.
<P>
<li>CAPS also examined the composition and selection process for membership on peer-review
committees used to evaluate academic professionals for promotion and continuing status.  This
Committee found that some peer-review committees were elected by academic professionals
within the college, while others were appointed.  It is the recommendation of CAPS that all
college-level peer-review committees used to evaluate academic professionals for continuing
status and promotion be elected by academic professionals within that college.
</ol>
