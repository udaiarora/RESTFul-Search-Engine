      <h2><strong>Marshall Lecture Presents an Economist Not Afraid to Speak His Mind </strong></h2>
      <p>You probably know Paul Krugman for the widely syndicated opinion pieces that he writes for the <em> New York Times</em>, where he is one of the paper's (and the country's) most read columnists.&nbsp; If you have read Krugman, you also know that he wields a sharp pen and is no fan of the current administration, but don't let that make you dismiss him as just another political pundit. </p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/Krugman.jpg" width="180" height="261" align="right">Unlike most political commentators,&nbsp; Krugman really knows a great deal about what he "rants" about, particularly when the topic is economics.&nbsp; He's more than just a journalist - he's a distinguished professor of economics at Princeton University and ranked as one of the world's top international economists by <em>The Economist </em>magazine. </p>
      <p>Krugman will be in the Valley on <strong>September 22 </strong> to deliver <strong>Arizona State University's 11 th annual Jonathan and Maxine Marshall Distinguished Lecture at Gammage Auditorium at 7:30 p.m </strong>. The topic of his talk is "The Great Unraveling." The lecture is free and open to the public (but tickets are required - see information at the end of this release). </p>
      <p>Krugman is the author or editor of 20 books and more than 200 papers in professional journals and edited volumes. According to his biography in the <em>New York Times</em>, "his professional reputation rests largely on work in international trade and finance; he is one of the founders of the 'new trade theory,' a major rethinking of the theory of international trade." </p>
      <p>As an economist, Dr. Krugman has won a variety of awards, including the John Bates Clark medal in 1991, a prize given every two years by the American Economic Association to the "economist under forty who is adjudged to have made a significant contribution to economic knowledge." His current academic research is focused on economic and currency crises. </p>
      <p>Krugman is currently professor of Economics and International Affairs at Princeton University. He has taught at Yale, MIT and Stanford. At MIT he became the Ford International Professor of Economics. He received his B.A. from Yale University in 1974 and his Ph.D. from MIT in 1977. </p>
      <p>He joined <em>The New York Times </em> in 1999 as a columnist, but he has written for the broader public in many venues. Some of his recent articles on economic issues, originally published in <em>Foreign Affairs, Harvard Business Review, Scientific American </em>and other journals, are reprinted in <em>Pop Internationalism </em> and <em>The Accidental Theorist</em>. </p>
      <p>Over five years and close to 500 <em>New York Times </em> columns, Krugman has developed a legion of devoted followers who sometimes refer to themselves as "Krugmaniacs." As one might guess from reading his printed words, Krugman is also a passionate and articulate speaker, with a gift for relating global economic events to his audiences, and committed to speaking the truth as he sees it in the most compelling terms. In his newest book, <em>The Great Unraveling, </em> Krugman describes how the United States lost its way, economically and politically, and recommends a road map for getting the country back on track. </p>
      <p>The lecture is free, but reservations are required and space is limited. To reserve seats, call 480-965-0051 or email clasevents@asu.edu &lt; <a href="mailto:clasevents@asu.edu">mailto:clasevents@asu.edu </a>&gt;, specifying the Marshall Lecture, your name, and how many seats are desired. Tickets are also available at all ASU Bookstores and at Changing Hands Bookstore, located at the southwest corner of Guadalupe and McClintock Roads in Tempe. </p>
      <p>The Marshall Lecture series is funded by grants from Jonathan and Maxine Marshall, retired publishers of <em>The Scottsdale Progress </em>, and by the Marshall Fund of Arizona. Free parking for the event is available in all ASU parking structures. </p>
