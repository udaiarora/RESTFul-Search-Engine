          <h2>Record number win prestigious scholarships to study abroad</h2>
          <p> Breaking last year&rsquo;s stellar record, more ASU students than ever before will be studying abroad next year on prestigious national scholarships. Six more students have won Fulbright Scholarships, raising the number of ASU Fulbrights to 15, and nine undergraduates have won National Security Education Program (NSEP) awards to study overseas.</p>
          <p> It has been an amazing six weeks for the university and its Office of National Scholarship Advisement, as notifications of the competitive awards have accumulated. This places ASU among the top public universities in the country for the awards.</p>
          <p> Faculty members have been particularly instrumental in guiding talented students to apply and in helping them shape solid project proposals, according to Janet Burke, associate dean of the Barrett Honors College and director of the scholarship advisement office. And as last year&rsquo;s overseas scholars report back to campus, they encourage others to apply, building on their success.</p>
          <p> &ldquo;To have 23 ASU students studying overseas next year is wonderful, and it fits perfectly with the new global efforts President Michael Crow has been encouraging, enhancing the ability of ASU to look outward,&rdquo; Burke says. &ldquo;These students are communicating with others back here and offering exceptional insights. And in part because of their unusual experiences, those students go on in great numbers to very prestigious graduate schools and enviable employment opportunities. This kind of success can only help raise the visibility and prestige of ASU.&rdquo;</p>
          <p> Fulbright students apply for a particular country and find specialists who are willing to work with them on their chosen course of study, receiving full travel, living and academic expenses for an academic year. The NSEP awards provide up to $20,000 for a year&rsquo;s study in countries outside Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. They provide a base of future leaders for the United States who understand less familiar languages and cultures.</p>
          <p> Two of the Fulbright Scholars will study in Mexico. Michelle Elliot, a doctoral student in anthropology, will do research on human and climatic influences on Mesoamerican landscapes. Yolanda Serrano-Gehman, a master&rsquo;s student in global technology and development will study sustainable development through technology. </p>
          <p> Eric Lund, a recent graduate in philosophy, religious studies and history, will analyze the impact of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa. Elizabeth Strahan, a recent BIS graduate, will teach English in South Korea and also study handcraft product design. Benjamin Coats, a recent master&rsquo;s graduate in religious studies, plans to look at religion as a component of nationalism in Macedonia.</p>
          <p> A Fulbright award also went to Scott MacIntyre, an outstanding 19-year-old blind pianist who graduated in May after having been named a Marshall Scholar and a USA Today Scholar this year. MacIntyre was picked to study in England , the most competitive location of all, but he already is headed to England on the Marshall Scholarship. </p>
          <p> For the NSEP awards, Nicole Cevette, biochemistry major, and Cara Steiner, anthropology major, will be going to Egypt. Two students will study in Romania: Megan McGinnity, majoring in political science and economics, and Andrew McKenna, majoring in economics and East European Area Studies.</p>
          <p> Lee Anne Shaffer, finance major, will study in China, one semester in Beijing and one semester in Shanghai. Ann Jensby, sociology major, will go to South Africa; Katherine Kelberlau, majoring in history and world religions, will study in Morocco; Adam Pierce, an economics major, is headed to Armenia; and Kimberly Hill, majoring in molecular biology and political science, will study in Russia.</p>
