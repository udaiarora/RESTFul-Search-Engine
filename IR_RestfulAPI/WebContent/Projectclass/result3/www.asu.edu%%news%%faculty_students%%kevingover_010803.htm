      <h2>Kevin Gover to join ASU's College of Law faculty</h2>
      <p>Kevin Gover, assistant secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs under 
        former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, will join the faculty of the 
        College of Law in July 2003.</p>
      <p>"Kevin is enormously well respected in Washington by leaders of both 
        parties and by tribal leaders throughout the country," says ASU President 
        Michael Crow. "He is a gifted lawyer who brings a singular wealth of experience 
        and wisdom to ASU."<br>
        Gover won nationwide praise in Indian Country when he made an eloquent 
        and moving apology to the nation's Indian communities for the wrongs done 
        to them by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in the past, during the 
        175th anniversary of the bureau's founding.</p>
      <p>Gover, 47, is a member of the Pawnee Tribe and was reared in Lawton, 
        Okla. He later attended Princeton University where he majored in public 
        and international affairs. (Princeton also awarded Gover an honorary doctor 
        of laws last year.) After graduation, Gover worked as a specialist for 
        the American Indian Policy Review Commission, a research group chartered 
        by Congress to study a wide range of issues important to Native Americans.</p>
      <p>Gover received his law degree from the University of New Mexico School 
        of Law in 1978. Private practice followed, first with a large firm in 
        Washington, D.C., and then, forming a firm in New Mexico with two other 
        highly regarded Indian lawyers. <br>
        In 1996, former Arizona Governor and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt 
        asked Gover to serve as assistant secretary of the Interior for Indian 
        Affairs. He served until the end of the Clinton Administration in January 
        2001. As assistant secretary he concentrated on upgrading Indian law enforcement, 
        rebuilding decrepit Indian schools, reforming trust services and overhauling 
        the Bureau of Indian Affair's management system. </p>
      <p>"The addition of Kevin to our Indian Legal Program is a great event," 
        said Patricia White, dean of the College of Law. "He will join Rebecca 
        Tsosie, Robert Clinton and Paul Bender to form a faculty of unprecedented 
        strength in Indian law."<br>
        Gover comes to the College of Law from Steptoe and Johnson, a national 
        law firm with offices in Washington, D.C., and Phoenix, where he headed 
        the Indian Practice Group. </p>
      <p>"This is an extraordinary hire for our law school and one that will bring 
        a unique and important dimension to our existing program," said Tsosie, 
        Lincoln Professor of Native American Law &amp; Ethics and executive director 
        of the Indian Legal Program.<br>
        Clinton, Barry Goldwater Chair of American Institutions at ASU, has known 
        Gover since he was in law school. </p>
      <p>"The breadth and depth of his practical experience will enrich and enliven 
        the intellectual lives of students and faculty alike," Clinton said.</p>
      <p>ASU's Indian Legal Program currently has an enrollment of 50 including 
        38 Native American students representing 25 tribal nations. The program, 
        which was established in 1988, also provides legal education, scholarship 
        and public service to tribal governments.</p>
