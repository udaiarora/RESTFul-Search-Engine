                <p>Cultural resources?the physical remains of historic sites, landscapes, buildings, structures, historic districts, and artifacts comprise a valuable archive of information for historians. In this course we will examine the theories that underlie the discovery, analysis, treatment, interpretation, and preservation of cultural resources. This course will provide needed background for students contemplating careers in resource management, and museums. The students will investigate, based on readings and guest lectures, innovative and interdisciplinary approaches for evaluating and interpreting various kinds of material culture. </p>

                <p><strong>HST 591 ? Seminar: 20 TH Century Western Politics<br>
                </strong><strong>W, 12:40-3:30PM, COOR 4581<br>
                </strong><strong>Professor: <a href="mailto:p.vander.meer@asu.edu">Philip Vandermeer </a></strong></p>
                <p>This seminar will examine the intersecting transformations of American politics and the West during the last century. The substance of national political debates changed dramatically ? as foreign policy shifted to and then from the Cold War, and while domestic policy debates moved from topics like land grants to labor rights to education (to mention only a few). The structure and practice of politics changed because of developments in areas like communications (from radio to the internet) and transportation (from trains to cars to planes). Just as the subjects of political debate have changed, so too have the roles, careers, and influence of politicians.</p>
                <p>All areas of the nation experienced these changes, but social and economic conditions in the West changed more rapidly and substantively, yielding major changes in Western politics. Using the first half of the century as backdrop, this course will focus on the dramatic acceleration of change after WWII. The elements of that transformation include </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>--a shift from resource-based politics to ideological politics;<br>
                    --the rising power of cities, accelerated by the apportionment revolution of the 1960s;<br>
                    --the transformation of political and governmental institutions;<br>
                    --changes in the franchise, and the rising political importance of persons of color;<br>
                    --changing perspectives on the environment;<br>
                    --the military-industrial complex;<br>
                    --the emerging suburban society;<br>
                    --struggles over controlling urban growth;<br>
                    --the changing nature of political careers.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                <p>One can examine these topics in various ways, for example, by focusing on government institutions, political parties, or public policy. This course encourages but is not limited to studies of the careers, actions, and statements of politicians. This course will address the strengths and weaknesses of biography and specifically political biography, focusing on questions of leadership, electoral competition, and administrative ability. Finally, given the importance of Arizona politicians, the availability of sources, and the relative lack of written histories, students will be encouraged (but not required) to focus on Arizona politicians and politics. </p>

                <p><strong>HST 591 ? Seminar: Traditions and Transitions in the Modern North American West<br>
                </strong><strong>W, 9:40AM-12:30PM, COOR 4581<br>
                </strong><strong>Professor: <a href="mailto:PETER.IVERSON@asu.edu">Peter Iverson </a></strong></p>
                <p>There is a story told about a person traveling through some rugged country some years ago. He came upon a single building out in the middle of nowhere. In front of the building someone had posted a sign, which provided the name of this newly established community and an initial count of its residents, which the sign suggested totaled 150,000. When the traveler asked about this remarkable number of people, the town's founder replied, &quot;Oh, it's accurate. They're just not all here yet.&quot;</p>
                <p>That sense of possibility and opportunity has long informed the history of this region. Many new towns and cities in the West seemed determined to duplicate Des Moines . But architectural historian Chris Wilson in The Myth of Santa Fe: Creating a Regional Tradition, reveals that the city's prevailing architectural styles helped make Santa Fe into a more unique place. Today Santa Fe calls itself &quot;The City Different&quot; rather than &quot;Des Moines West&quot; and tourists and residents embrace an image that does not entirely mirror Santa Fe 's actual past.</p>
                <p>A century ago American conventional wisdom declared that Indians in the West were about to disappear. Photographer Edward Curtis created an image of a group of Navajos on horseback which he entitled &quot;The Vanishing Race.&quot; But Indian nations usually did not disappear. In fact today there are more Navajos than there were Indians in 1906 and historians often now write about victories as well as victimization. In Boundaries Between: The Southern Paiutes, 1775-1995, ethnohistorian Martha Knack explains how one indigenous group fought on a variety of 20th century battlefields to deny assimilation and to achieve continuation. Navajo poet Luci Tapahonso says her people believe in old values and new ideas. During the course of the semester we will ponder how traditions may be established and incorporated, how communities find ways to continue, and how the status of a community may change dramatically from one generation to the next.</p>
                <p>Our class will begin by a reading these two books, plus a third to be chosen from a list assembled by the instructor Our discussion of these works will furnish a foundation for the main assignment: the completion of a 20 to 25 page research paper related to the main theme of the class. Along the way invited guest contributors, films, and field trips will provide additional insights.</p>

                <p>This is a research seminar for graduate students working in the fields of intellectual or cultural history, in all eras of European history. The first part of the course will address methodological issues, via a reading of Mark Bevir's The Logic of the History of Ideas and a set of shorter texts: the goal is to get a sense of the wide range of approaches in this sub-discipline, from the traditional &quot;history of ideas,&quot; to more contemporary forms of contextual intellectual history, discourse analysis (Foucauldian and otherwise), &quot;deconstruction&quot; and ?New Historicism,? and so on. From there, we turn in the second part of the course to a series of case studies, looking at a series of major recent works in intellectual history in chronological order - medieval, early-modern, modern, and postmodern; the precise selection of these texts will depend on the sub-fields and interests of the students taking the course. Finally, every student will be expected to produce and present to the seminar a research paper in their own field or area of work. </p>

                <p><strong>HST 598 ? Special Topics: Transnational Borders<br>
                </strong><strong>T, 6:40-9:30PM, COOR L1-34<br>

                <p>In the first section of this course, the concept of borders will be analyzed as regards territory (17th century); as regards inclusion and exclusion into states and nations (19th century); and as regards identities (19th and 20th centuries). The perspective will be global for the 17th-19th centuries and subsequently, for the 19th and 20th centuries, will focus on Europe and the Americas . The aspect of territoriality will be connected to constructions of administrative belonging (invention of the passport) and identificational belonging, inclusion or exclusion (&quot;national identity&quot; vs. &quot;minority status&quot;).</p>
                <p>In a second step, the permeability of borders in terms of migration and cultural as well as economic exchange will be discussed. While the starting point will again be European societies, attention will shift to North America: Canada - United States - Mexico . Incorporating the results of the &quot;Internationalization of U.S. History&quot;-project of the Organization of American Historians, the debate will trace cultural and socio-economic interpenetrations between societies and polities.</p>
                <p>In a further step, aspects of the exchanges along the Mexico-U.S. and the Canada-U.S. borders will be researched as well as public discourse about the borders. Memory of borderlines-borderlands will be evaluated critically. Are borders lines of separation or interaction? Does cultural distinctiveness or transnational exchanges characterize neighboring polities/ societies? Does the concept of &quot;transnationalism&quot; cover the scope of exchanges or would a concept of &quot;transculturalism&quot; provide more differentiated perspectives?</p>
                <p>Note: As with any comparative and global history, more than one language is necessary to understand historic developments and incorporate historiographies outside of the English-language realm. For this course French and Spanish are of particular importance. </p>

                <p>This course focuses on the creation of European identities within Europe itself. We will explore how geography, language, religion, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality formed the templates on which European social and political structures were founded and continually reforged over the course of the last two millennia. For example, moving beyond the traditional Italy-to-England axis of European history, we examine how ? Europe ? was variably defined to include different geographic areas at different times. Readings range from ?classics? in European historiography to some of the latest theoretical work exploring the ways in which categories of ?otherness? function politically and culturally to create social identities. </p>

                <p>This readings course will focus on how pre-modern European societies dealt with their poor. Weekly readings and written work will range over the countries of Western Europe and examine similarities and differences in their theories and treatment of the poor and sick. Although the focus will be on Europe, we will pay attention to how European attitudes and institutions were carried to the New World and there reshaped by ethnicity and religion. </p>

                <p>In recent years, memory has become an increasingly popular lens through which historians have interpreted historical events and their meaning. This course will explore the use of memory by historians of modern European history. We will begin by reading some of the most influential theorists of the relationship between memory and society (such as Maurice Halbwachs and Pierre Nora). We will then explore the historiography of history and memory by examining three case studies: the French Revolution, World War I, and the Holocaust. While the readings will focus on European history, students in any area of history who wish to explore the use of memory by historians are encouraged to enroll, and will be permitted to focus on any geographic area and/or chronological period in writing their final paper. </p>

                <p>Since its inception in the 1970s women's history in the U.S. has produced a vast array of studies and insights that changed the way we think about history and conceptionalize our research. The readings in this course will introduce students to current research and foundational works on core topics in women's history: work and family, social movements and politics, feminisms and sexualities. They will reflect on historiographical challenges in the field, the use of gender as a category of analysis, and will recognize the diverse and heterogeneous forms of women's existence in a global and post-colonial perspective. </p>

                <p>This course is the first part of our two-course sequence in training for college teaching. This course is recommended for all graduate students in the Ph.D. program, and is also required for any student wishing to teach classes for the ASU History Department. The History Department is concerned with the training (and placement) of graduate students and with the instruction of undergraduates. Teaching skills and experience have become increasingly important in obtaining academic employment. The department regularly hires graduate students to teach and seeks to make this a useful experience. The faculty&nbsp;? as well as the university and the public&nbsp;? also seek to improve the quality of undergraduate instruction. This course and the subsequent course, HST&nbsp;700 Issues in College Teaching, provide excellent grounding in teaching methods, with expert help on such matters as: book selection, syllabus preparation, how to lecture, how to grade, how to integrate technology into your teaching.</p>
                <p>Who should take this course? Because the department considers this training so important, participation is required of every student before he or she will be hired to teach history classes at ASU. Students who expect to teach elsewhere will also find the course extremely valuable, and a useful addition to their vitas. </p>
