      <h2><strong>ASU and the </strong><strong>W.</strong><strong></strong><strong>P.</strong><strong></strong><strong> Carey </strong><strong></strong><strong>School</strong><strong> celebrate Nobel Prize winner</strong></h2>
      <p>Trumpets flared as Edward C. Prescott became the first ASU faculty member to receive a Nobel Prize during a formal ceremony at Stockholm&rsquo;s Concert Hall Dec. 10. </p>
      <p>Thousands of miles away at the W. P. Carey School of Business, more than 100 members of the ASU community who were watching the live web-cast broke into applause as Sweden&rsquo;s King Carl XVI Gustaf placed the Nobel diploma and medal into Prescott&rsquo;s hands. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;The honor was given context by the ceremony. You could not watch it without gaining a very personal feeling for the grand tradition, prestige and history of the Nobel Prize,&rdquo; said Arthur Blakemore, chairman of the department of economics. &ldquo;As we watched, we were proud to be associated with him.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>Others in the audience agreed.</p>
      <p> &ldquo;Seeing Ed Prescott receive the Nobel Prize made me very proud to be part of the business school,&rdquo; said Mary Lou Bessette, director of the Center for the Advancement of Small Business. &ldquo;The ceremony reminded me anew of the power and promise of this very special place.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>John Robinson, a finance doctoral student, also was inspired. &ldquo;The Nobel is the pinnacle of academic achievement,&rdquo; he told a reporter. &ldquo;I want to do work and contribute to society the way Prescott has done.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The excitement began two months ago when Prescott was notified by the Nobel Committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences that he had been chosen to receive the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. He shared the honor with collaborator Finn Kydland of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of California at Santa Barbara. They were honored &quot;for their contributions to dynamic macroeconomics: the time consistency of economic policy and the driving forces behind business cycles,&quot; according to the Nobel Committee&rsquo;s announcement.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We were very happy for Ed. This is an honor that is well deserved as he has fundamentally transformed the way modern macroeconomics is studied,&rdquo; Blakemore said.</p>
      <p> Prescott joined the economics faculty at the W. P. Carey School in October 2003. He is also a senior monetary advisor at the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, where he spends approximately half of the year. </p>
      <p>The economics department has been pursuing a building initiative designed to attract top scholars made possible by resource investments by the W.P. Carey School and by ASU President Michael Crow's targeted initiative for excellence in the Department of Economics. These investments, Blakemore said, made ASU attractive to Prescott, and sets the stage for continued academic achievements.</p>
      <p> &ldquo;Having a faculty member receive a Nobel prize is a&nbsp;rare event for any&nbsp;school, and ASU never would have received this recognition without the hard work of the entire economics faculty over the previous decade,&rdquo; said Philip Regier, deputy dean of the W. P. Carey School.</p>
      <p>Prescott and his family spent a week in Stockholm attending the banquets and dinners that precede the awards ceremony. He delivered his Nobel Lecture to an audience of economists on Dec. 8. </p>
      <p>The Nobel Prize Award Ceremony featured orchestral selections and solos, and speeches by presenters on a stage framed with floral arrangements. The Swedish royal family was seated on the stage, as were members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the newly selected laureates.</p>
      <p>Following the ceremony, the laureates and their families were guests at the Nobel banquet at Stockholm City Hall. In a speech at the banquet, Prescott talked about what it was like for him and Kydland when their new theory &ldquo;suddenly slapped us in the face and commanded us to pay attention.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Known for his devotion to students, Prescott ended his speech with a message to them. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;They may not realize it now, but they are making history with their research and they will be the future Nobel Laureates. Their sense of wonder is a continual source of inspiration and never fails to energize me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some of those students will stand in this beautiful banquet hall some day and tell their own stories about how theory knocked some sense into them. I know it has knocked a lot of sense into me, and I look forward to many more such surprise discoveries.&rdquo;</p>
