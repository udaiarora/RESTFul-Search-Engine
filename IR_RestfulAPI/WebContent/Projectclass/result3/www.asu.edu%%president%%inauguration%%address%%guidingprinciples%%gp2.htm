If you are not active as a scholar, if you are not contributing         new knowledge to your discipline, if you are not developing new approaches         to pedagogy, your teaching will inevitably suffer. If you are not testing         your ideas by putting them out there in the marketplace of ideas where         others can evaluate your ideas and respond to them, in turn allowing you         to respond and enter into a dialogue, the value and viability of your         ideas is diminished.</p>      <p> There is no single conception of scholarship. It varies significantly         between and among the different disciplines and intellectual cultures         that make up the university. Scholarship takes as many forms as there         are spheres of inquiry. For a scientist, scholarship is the discovery         of a new chemical mechanism, the mapping of a new molecule, the discernment         of an unknown aspect of a 500-year-old quest to determine whether or not         planets orbit stars anywhere other than our solar system. For an artist,         it is the creation of a new painting to express a personal vision, or         the completion of a novel that addresses a complex ethical problem, or         the orchestration of a new composition. For the literary critic it may         be a reevaluation of a short story by Sandra Cisneros, and for an art         historian the translation of a treatise on artists&#8217; materials and         studio techniques in seventeenth-century Holland. All forms of scholarship         in the new American university are equal, and all forms of scholarship         are considered significant expressions of the human spirit.</p>      <p>Scholarship is the means by which the institution is continually reinvigorated,         but we engage in scholarship with the principal objective of being better         teachers. You cannot teach chemistry unless you have the capacity to understand         how chemistry is advancing, and you cannot understand that process unless         you are helping to advance chemistry as a subject in and of your own right.         We are better teachers if we are contributing to the knowledge base of         our field. In fact, this is a crucial distinction that separates the university         form of education from all others. University teachers are by definition         scholars. The university is a setting for scholar-teachers to advance         scholarship in given fields and to utilize their research as a primary         form of teaching. There are obviously other forms of teaching in which         scholarship is not a necessary component of the teaching process, but         in a university environment, scholarship is an essential component. <br>      </p></td>    <td align="center" valign="top"> &nbsp;<BR> </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="bottom"><a href="gp1.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="../images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="gp3.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="gp3.htm"><img src="../images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>    <td align="center" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
