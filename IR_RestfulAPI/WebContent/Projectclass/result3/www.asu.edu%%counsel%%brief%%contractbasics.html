<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Contracting Basics</STRONG></FONT><STRONG></STRONG></P>


<P>
<OL Type=I><STRONG>I.	The Elements of a Contract</STRONG></P>

<OL Type=A>
<P>	A.	Offer--a promise to do or forbear from doing something within a certain time
period.</P>

<P>	B.	Acceptance--an acceptance of an offer through either a promise or performance.</P>

<P>	C.	Consideration--there must be a legal and adequate inducement given in exchange
for the promise to do something that one is not legally required to do or to
forbear from doing something that one is legally allowed to do.</P>


<P>	D.	Form of the Contract--the contract must be in a form as may be required by law--e.g., Statute of Frauds--certain contracts must be in writing; (e.g., a contract to
sell goods with a value over $500 (unless there was partial performance); an
agreement in excess of one year, sale of real property, a commitment to loan
money in excess of $250,000 and not made in connection with personal, family
or household purposes. (See <a href=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/44/00101.htm>A.R.S. Section 44-101</a>).</P>


<P>	E.	Capacity to contract--the parties to a contract must have the legal capacity and
competency to contract.  In addition, a representative of a corporation,
partnership or organization must have the authority to bind the corporation,
partnership or organization.  (See <a href=http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/pur/pur201-01.html>PUR 201-02</a> and <a href=http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/pur/pur201-02.html>202</a>).</P>


<P>	F.	Legality of the contract matter--the subject of the contract must be legally
permissible and not against public policy.</P>

</ol>
</ol>
<OL Type=I>
<P><STRONG>II.	Barriers to Formation of a Contract</STRONG></P>

<ol type=A>
<P>	A.	Mutual mistake or ambiguity with respect to material terms.</P>


<P>	B.	Revocation or expiration of offer.</P>


<P>	C.	Lapse of time.</P>


<P>	D.	Death or incapacity of offeror.</P>


<P>	E.	Lack of formality--e.g., letters of credit and other negotiable instruments must
contain certain matters.</P>
</ol>
</ol>
<OL Type=I>

<P><STRONG>III.	Enforcement of the Contract</STRONG></P>

<ol type=A>
<P>	A.	Is the contract valid, void, voidable or unenforceable?</P>

<ol type=1>

<P>		1.	A valid contract has the elements listed in I. above and is legally
enforceable.</P>

<P>		2.	A contract that is void is not legally enforceable and the parties thereto
are not legally obligated to each other.  Generally, contracts are void
because the subject matter is not legal or one of the contracting parties
does not have the competency to contract.  For example, a contract to
commit a crime is void and cannot be enforced.</P>


<P>		3.	A contract that is voidable is otherwise a valid contract but the
obligations can be avoided for certain reasons permitted by law (e.g.,
duress, lack of capacity).  The party with the capacity to void the contract
can choose to ratify the contract and perform the obligations thereunder.
For example, a party can argue that the other party coerced it to enter into
a contract for delivery of certain services at a very low rate; that it did so
under duress.  In this case the coerced party can argue that the contract
is voidable.  Unlike a void contract which cannot be enforced, the
coerced party can choose to perform an otherwise voidable contract.</P>


<P>		4.	An unenforceable contract is generally a valid contract but is not
enforced because of public policy or law.</P>

</ol>
<P>	B.	Breach of Contract Terms--failure to perform either fully or adequately the
obligations provided in the contract.</P>


<P>	C.	Remedies for Breach--the nonbreaching and performing party may be provided
relief for the breaching party's failure to perform its obligations.</P>
<ol type=1>
<P>		1.	Damages--are generally designed to compensate the nonbreaching party
for the benefit of its bargain. Damages may be compensatory,
consequential, punitive or nominal.  The nonbreaching party generally
has an obligation to mitigate its damages.  Liquidated damages are
allowed so long as they are not designed as penalties.  Liquidated
damages must be agreed to at the time of contract, must be a reasonable
estimate of damages and the damages must have been considered at the
time of contracting as being difficult to estimate in case of breach.</P>


<P>		2.	Specific Performance--the nonbreaching party may seek an order to force
the breaching party to perform in accordance with contract terms.  This
remedy is generally granted only if money damages are inadequate as a
remedy (e.g., sale of land).</P>


<P>		3.	Rescission and Restitution--the remedy of canceling a contract and
making restitution to the parties.</P>


<P>		4.	Reformation--this is an equitable remedy that allows the parties to rewrite or reform the contract as originally created in order to reflect what they
intended.</P>

</ol>
<P>	D.	The nonbreaching party may waive its right to enforce a remedy.  Generally
contracts provide that waiver of one event of default does not mean waiver of
any future defaults.</P>


<P>	E.	If permitted by law, the contracting parties can limit the type and amount of
remedies provided to the nonbreaching party.</P>

</ol>
</ol>
<ol type=I>
<P><STRONG>IV.	Other Sources of Authority for Formation and Enforcement of a Contract</STRONG></P>

<ol type=A>
<P>	A.	The Uniform Commercial Code governs transactions related to among other
things, secured transactions, sales, and negotiable instruments.</P>


<P>	B.	State and Federal Law</P>
</ol>
</ol>
<ol type=I>

<P><STRONG>V.	Contracting with The State and State Universities</STRONG></P>

<ol type=A>

<P>	A.	All procurement with the State of Arizona must be in accordance with A.R.S.
Section <a href=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/41/02501.htm>41-2501 <U>et</U>  <U>seq</U></a>., except for certain procurement activities conducted
with the Universities, the Judiciary, the State Lottery, the Arizona Health Care
Cost Containment System, Arizona Industries for the Blind, Arizona Correctional
Industries, the State Transportation Board, the Department of Transaction, the
Arizona Highways Magazine and the Secretary of State.  The heads of these
governmental units must adopt procurement policies and procedures in
accordance with <a href=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/41/02501.htm> A.R.S. Section 41-2501 <U>et</U> <U>seq</U></a>.  The Universities conduct their
procurements in accordance with Arizona Board of Regents Policy Number <a href=http://www.abor.asu.edu/1_the_regents/policymanual/index.html#3>3-801 <U>et</U> <U>seq</U></a>.</P>

<P>	B.	Generally, procurements of $25,000 and more must be competitively bid with
different procedures for procurements between $10,000 and $25,000.  Exceptions
are made for sole source and emergency procurements.  In addition, State
agencies subject to A.R.S. Section 41-2501 may procure services and materials
not in excess of $25,000 according to rules promulgated by the Director of the
Department of Administration.  (See <a href=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/41/02535.htm> A.R.S. Section 41-2535</a>.)</P>

<P>	C.	Contracts generally cannot be in excess of 5 years.</P>

<P>	D.	State Agency Provisions--certain contractual provisions are mandated by the
State Constitution and/or state statutes and are generally not negotiable.  These
<a href=http://www.asu.edu/counsel/brief/clauses.html>provisions</a> are incorporated into contracts entered into with Arizona State University.</P>
