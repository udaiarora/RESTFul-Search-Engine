      <h2>Cronkite School students win top awards in national contests</h2>
      <p>        Students from ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism &amp; Mass Communication
        have continued their winning ways in several major journalism contests.
        The school's students were honored by the Broadcast Education Association,
        the William Randolph Hearst Journalism Awards and the Society for Professional
      Journalists.</p>
      <p>Cronkite students scored four first-place finishes in the
          2002 national student news competition for the Broadcast Education
        Association (BEA).
          In all, the Cronkite School won six of the 18 possible Student News
        awards. Junior William Pitts won the top award for Radio News reporting
        for a
          story he produced on a mock terrorism drill at Sun Devil Stadium. Junior
          Josh Davis was a first-place winner for Radio Feature reporting on
        a story about local auditions for Fox's "American Idol." </p>
      <p>ASU swept the
          Radio Feature category with Josh Davis finishing second on a profile
          of legendary television journalist Walter Cronkite and William
          Pitts receiving a third-place award for a story about trumpeter Jesse
          MacGuire. Senior Holly Naylor snagged a first-place award for TV Feature
          reporting on a story about radio and television announcer Charlie Van
        Dyke and his ordination as a Catholic minister.</p>
      <p>Former student Dan Bubany
          won first place for Sports Reporting for the story of last year's three-way
          quarterback battle for the ASU Sun Devil
        football team.</p>
      <p>Davis received special recognition for his "American Idol"
          radio story. It was judged to be the "best of the best" radio story
        of the BEA Festival,
          which included entries from around the world. Davis walked away with
          another award - a prestigious National Association of Broadcasters
        (NAB) scholarship. </p>
      <p>"The BEA competition is one of the emerging competitions
          in the country," said Joe Foote, director of the Cronkite School. "For
          ASU to do so well
          is another mark of excellence for the School. For Josh Davis to win
        an NAB scholarship and 'Best of Festival' award is remarkable."</p>
      <p>Three students
          in the Walter Cronkite School made it to the semi-final competition
        of the William Randolph Hearst Journalism Awards. The Hearst
          Journalism Awards program is described as the "Pulitzer Prize" of collegiate
        writing competitions.</p>
      <p>Finishing third nationally were students Joe Watson
          for Newspaper Feature reporting; Holly Naylor for TV Feature Reporting;
          and William Pitts for
          Radio News Reporting. Students who score a top-five finish nationally
          move into the semi-final round.<br>
        Other ASU students were recognized by the Hearst Awards: Josh Davis
          placed 7th in Radio Feature Reporting, Sara Thorson finished in 9th
          place for
          Column/Opinion Writing, Katie Orr placed 14th in Radio News Reporting
        and Cameron Eickmeyer scored a 15th place tie for Sports Writing.</p>
      <p>ASU
          finished number six nationally in the Intercollegiate Broadcast News
          Competition. The final rankings for Intercollegiate Broadcast News
        Competition were based on the results from two radio and television writing
        competitions.</p>
      <p>For
          the third straight year and fifth time in six years, the Cronkite School
          finished first in the Society For Professional Journalists' (SPJ)
          regional writing contest. ASU is in region eleven which includes California,
          Nevada, Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. The Sweepstakes Award is given
          to the school with the most accumulated points in print, television,
        radio and web reporting competitions.</p>
      <p>ASU had 51 total points, more than
          twice that of its nearest competitor, including nine first-place finishes,
          10 second places, seven third places
        and two honorable mentions.</p>
      <p>The nine first-place winning students from
          ASU will compete nationally with other regional winners from across
        the country. Results for the
          second phase of the SPJ National Mark of Excellence competition will
        be announced this summer.</p>
