Rossetti is revealed more through his writings than most. &quot;Not one
of his biographers will lead us so deeply into his secret as he does himself&quot;
(38). Most of the information in Sharp's essays is the result of personal

Ancient and Modern</I>. 1st ed. London: Longman, 1865. Contains threee
contributions by Christina Rossetti. Inscribed: &quot;Frances M. L. Rossetti
from C. G. R. 'Her children arise and call her blessed.' 23rd November
1864.&quot; Also overleaf in pencil by Christina: &quot;This contains Charles
Bagot Cayley's translation of my Father's 'O Forza Irrisistible'.&quot;
Signed on flyleaf: &quot;W. M. Rossetti from Christina's books, 1894. In
original brown cloth with blind stamped covers and gold stamped oval on
front cover; yapped edges. According to the editor, he had more poems than
space in his two previous volumes, Lyra Eucharistica and Lyra Messianica,
and so decided to publish the extra poems and a few new additions in the
present work. He thought that a &quot;Miscellaneous Collection of Religious
Poetry, which should be written by the Contributors who secured the popularity
of the former Lyr&aelig;,&quot; would find favor with his readers. Shipley
goes on to say that the &quot;Title ?Mystic' was chosen as indicative of
the mystical interpretation which has been given in many of the Poems in
the following pages to the Sacred or Legendary Events, or to the doctrinal
Statements of Holy Scripture, or to the other Subjects upon which the Hymns
and Verses were composed.&quot; The work contains an index of the first
lines of the hymns and also excerpts from reviews from the previous two
volumes. PRB-123</P>

<P>Short, Ernest Henry. <I>Watts</I>. 1st ed. London: Allan, 1924. Original
red cloth. Ownership signature of G. Stroud Read, March 13th, 1929 on front
flyleaf. The author maintains that the art of Watts may be understood only
by relating the &quot;artist to the pulsing life and thought of his age.&quot;
Short goes on to say that &quot;the interest and significance of George
Frederic Watts areise from the fact that he is the latest of Britain's
poet-painters. In deed and word, his aim was ever to identify his work
with ?all that is good and great in every creed and utterance, and with
all that is inspiring in every record of heroism, of suffering, of effort
and of achievement.'&quot; The work is divided into four chapters: biographical
and personal, external influences, style and subjects, and the quality
of the artist. There are also two appendices: a list of Watt's pictures
and a bibliography. PRB-101</P>

<P>Solomon, Simeon. <I>A Vision of Love Revealed in Sleep</I>. London:
Printed for the author, 1871. Original blue cloth binding with gold stamping
on front cover; cover designed by author. Prospectus for this book (1 leaf)
laid in. Simeon Solomon was one of the more fascinating members of the
Pre-Raphaelite circle, but after his legal conviction for pederasty in
1873, he was no longer mentioned in discussions of the brotherhood. He
showed unusual early promise, becoming a student of the Royal Academy Schools
when he was fifteen and entering his first picture for exhibition at eighteen.
A Vision of Love Revealed in Sleep was published by the author and is an
allegorical fragment, possibly suggested by Rossetti's Hand and Soul. PRB-133</P>
