      <h2>Social insects point to non-genetic origins of societies <br>
        <em>Social structures form through group dynamics, not trait selection </em></h2>
      <p>Humans are social animals, but does our social organization result from
        our genetic makeup or does it come from something much more fundamental?</p>
      <p>From her work studying social insects, Arizona State University biologist
        Jennifer Fewell believes that these remarkable animals suggest an alternate
        cause behind the development of complex societies. In a viewpoint essay
        in the September 26 issue of the journal Science, Fewell argues that
        complex social structures like those seen in social insect communities
        can arise initially from the nature of group interactions -- the inherent
        dynamics of networks.</p>
      <p>The ability of certain animals to form complex social systems -- particularly
        humans and social insects like bees, ants and termites -- is considered
        by many biologists to be one of the pinnacles of biological adaptation
        and complexity. Social organization allows organisms to share labor,
        to specialize in tasks and to coordinate efforts. Through organization,
        social animals accomplish remarkable things - they build colonies supporting
        millions of individuals, maintain multi-layered social systems, manage
        complex farming and food production systems, and build elaborate designs
        and constructions, from giant self-cooling termite towers to skyscrapers.</p>
      <p>The development of social systems is often assumed to be driven by species
        modifications arrived at through natural selection. Social characteristics
        such as caste systems and complex behaviors have been thought to be traits
        programmed by genes, created through evolutionary processes. Though insect
        social systems are in many ways as complex as human societies, Fewell
        contends that the relative simplicity of the insects themselves argues
        against the systems being created solely by the evolutionary development
        of biocomplexity in the individual organisms.</p>
      <p>"We look at human groups and we think we have these elaborate systems
        of interaction because we are elaborate beings, but when you look at
        an ant, you know that it is not an elaborate being," she said. ", When
        you see how elaborate their societies are, you realize that there is
        another answer to the question of how these arise. And if there's another
        answer for them, there might be another answer for us too." </p>
      <p>Network dynamics, Fewell argues, can create organized social structures
        when relatively simple connections between various individuals in a group
        create patterns of behavior of increasing complexity, much the same way
        as relatively simple mathematical rules can create mathematical patterns
        of great intricacy. </p>
      <p>"How do termites know how to build this huge chimney that allows a colony
        to thermoregulate?" Fewell asked. "The answer is that they don't - it's
        an emergent property of simple interactions - one termite puts a piece
        of dirt there and the other termite comes along and smells that a termite
        put her piece of dirt there, so she does too, instead of somewhere else.
        At first it's random and termites are putting their dirt in different
        places, but then one place becomes the dominant location and the structure
        goes from there."</p>
      <p>In the same way, organized societies themselves can be created by patterns
        developed through simple interactions in a network of individuals.</p>
      <p>"The patterns are things that we call emergent properties - colony-level
        behaviors or structures that can be explained by looking at interactions,"
        Fewell said. "The one that I am most interested in is division of labor,
        in which different individuals perform different tasks and specialize
        on different activities. </p>
      <p>"This happens, for example, when you put a group of students together.
        Give them an assignment and they start organizing -- somebody will start
        note-taking, and someone will structure the discussion, and someone will
        go up to the board, and someone will just sit there and let everyone
        else do the work. Similar division of labor happens in a social insect
        colony, though social insects are much simpler animals."</p>
      <p>Though social networks are commonly thought of as evolutionary adaptations,
        Fewell turns this idea on its head by proposing that the network forms
        first, following the logic and pattern of group connections, then adaptation
        follows to strengthen the pattern. Social organization, seen in this
        light, is essentially an emergent property that comes from the network's
        geometry - a natural pattern to which organisms adapt. </p>
      <p>"Social insects are interesting because you can follow them ,individually
        mark them and see the patterns form," she said. "Humans are affected
        by the same kinds of emerging properties. If you look at global patterns
        of social organization, you can see networks shaping what is going on.
        You are --in part-- what your social environment makes you."</p>
