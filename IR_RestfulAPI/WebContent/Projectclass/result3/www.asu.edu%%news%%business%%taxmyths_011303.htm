      <h2>Tax and spending myths</h2>
      <p>Findings reported in "Public Finance in Arizona," an objective review 
        of government finance in Arizona by the Center for Business Research at 
        Arizona State University, suggest that several popular fiscal conceptions 
        should be re-examined.</p>
      <p>Tom R. Rex, the center's research manager, cites the following myths:</p>
      <p>1. The tax burden in Arizona is high. Historically, the combined state 
        and local government tax burden in Arizona ranged from a little above 
        the national average during recessions to a little below average at other 
        times. Over the last decade, however, the tax burden has fallen considerably 
        to well below average. State government revenues relative to the size 
        of the Arizona economy are the lowest on record.</p>
      <p>2. Government spending in Arizona is high. Relative to other states, 
        Arizona's state and local government spending is considerably below the 
        national per person average. Because of its population growth and demographic 
        profile, Arizona's spending needs to be above average to provide a service 
        level equal to the national average. State government expenditures relative 
        to the size of the Arizona economy are nearly the lowest on record.</p>
      <p>3. Government taxing and spending continues to rise in Arizona. After 
        adjusting for inflation and population increases, state and local government 
        revenues and expenditures have continued to rise, but at a pace much less 
        than the state's economic growth and much less than the national average. 
        On an inflation-adjusted per person basis, state government revenues in 
        the current fiscal year are not higher than in fiscal year 1991.</p>
      <p>4. The rainy day fund has not worked, so it should be abolished. The 
        fund has not served its purpose of providing revenues during a downturn 
        because of inadequate funding during the strong growth years of the 1990s 
        and because the fund was used for other purposes. If the rainy day fund 
        had been fully funded based on the original 1990 statute, state government 
        would be faced with little, if any, deficit beyond that covered by transfers 
        from the rainy day fund.</p>
      <p>5. Tax cuts in Arizona have increased economic growth and government 
        revenues. Empirical evidence to support this statement has not been found. 
        Strong government revenues during the late 1990s resulted from stock market 
        capital gains that enhanced revenues throughout the nation. The state's 
        current economic slump (just as deep and long as the national average) 
        and the large decline in government revenues over the last two years suggest 
        that tax cuts had little if any effect.</p>
      <p>6. Taxes are a major business expense. State and local government taxes 
        are less than 2 percent of operating income for the typical business - 
        less than officers' compensation.</p>
      <p>7. Taxes remove money from the economy. Tax revenues are spent in much 
        the same way as private-sector revenues, such as to pay employee wages 
        and to purchase materials from the private sector. The in-state multiplier 
        effect likely is larger for public-sector spending.</p>
      <p>8. All tax cuts are good for the economy. Taxes are the price paid for 
        government services, many of which are valued by the private sector, and 
        need to be evaluated relative to the public programs they fund.</p>
      <p>9. All tax cuts are good for government revenues. The idea that every 
        tax cut will result in greater government revenues is a distortion of 
        supply-side economics, which was popularized by the Laffer Curve. According 
        to the Laffer Curve, any cuts in tax rates that are below the optimum 
        rate will result in lesser government revenues.</p>
      <p>10. The size of government should shrink during recessions. Businesses 
        experience a decline in demand for their products or services during a 
        recession, resulting in general reductions in private-sector business 
        activity, including job losses. However, the public sector does not experience 
        lowered demand for its services. Most government programs serve residents, 
        who continue to increase in number. Demand for public welfare, such as 
        unemployment benefits, is countercyclical, rising during recessions.</p>
      <p>11. Taxes should not be increased during a recession. A tax increase 
        is no more harmful than public spending cuts, which damage the economy 
        by reducing government purchases from the private sector and by diminishing 
        consumer expenditures due to losses in spending by laid-off government 
        workers.</p>
