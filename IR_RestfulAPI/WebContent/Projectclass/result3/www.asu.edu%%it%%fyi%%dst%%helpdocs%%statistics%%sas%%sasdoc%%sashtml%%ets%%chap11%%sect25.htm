<A NAME="idxexp0097">&#13;</A><H3><I>The SPLINE Method</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxexp0099">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxexp0098">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxexp0101">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxexp0100">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxexp0103">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxexp0102">&#13;</A>The SPLINE method fits a cubic spline curve to the input values.
A cubic spline is a segmented function
consisting of third-degree (cubic) polynomial functions
joined together so that the whole curve and its
first and second derivatives are continuous.
<P>For point-in-time input data, the spline curve is constrained to
pass through the given data points.
For interval total or average data,
the definite integrals of the spline over the input intervals
are constrained to equal the given interval totals.
<P>For boundary constraints, the <I>not-a-knot</I> condition is used 
by default.
This means that the first two spline pieces are constrained to be
part of the same cubic curve, as are the last two pieces.
Thus the spline used by PROC EXPAND by default is not the same 
as the commonly used natural spline, which uses zero 
second-derivative endpoint constraints.
While DeBoor (1981) recommends the <I>not-a-knot</I> constraint
for cubic spline interpolation,
using this constraint can sometimes produce anomalous results at
the ends of the interpolated series.
PROC EXPAND provides options to specify other endpoint
constraints for spline curves.
<P>To specify endpoint constraints, use the following form of the
METHOD= option.
<P><DL>
<DT CLASS="ssbten"><B CLASS="ssbten">METHOD=SPLINE( <SPAN CLASS="ssieleven"><I>constraint</I></SPAN> [, <SPAN CLASS="ssieleven"><I>
constraint</I></SPAN>] )</B></DT>
<DD CLASS="sasop"><A NAME="idxexp0096">&#13;</A>The first constraint specification applies to the lower endpoint, and
the second constraint specification applies to the upper endpoint.
If only one constraint is specified,
it applies to both the lower and upper endpoints.
<BR><BR>The <I>constraint</I> specifications can have the following values:
<BR><BR><B><I>NOTANOT</I></B> <BR>specifies the not-a-knot constraint. This is the default.
<BR><BR><B><I>NATURAL</I></B> <BR>specifies the <I>natural spline</I> constraint.
The second derivative of the spline curve is constrained to be
zero at the endpoint.
<BR><BR><B><I>SLOPE= value</I></B> <BR>specifies the first derivative of the spline curve at the endpoint.
<BR><BR><B><I>CURVATURE= value</I></B> <BR>specifies the second derivative of the spline curve at the endpoint.
Specifying CURVATURE=0 is equivalent to specifying the NATURAL option.
<BR><BR>For example, to specify natural spline interpolation,
use the following option in the CONVERT or PROC EXPAND statement:
<BR><BR><PRE>
         method=spline(natural)
</PRE>
<BR><BR>For OBSERVED=BEGINNING, MIDDLE, and END series, the spline knots are placed
at the beginning, middle, and end of each input interval, respectively.
For total or averaged series, the spline knots are set at
the start of the first interval, at the end of the last interval,
and at the interval midpoints,
except that there are no knots for the first two and last two midpoints.
<BR><BR>Once the cubic spline curve is fit to the data,
the spline is extended by adding linear segments 
at the beginning and end. 
These linear segments are used for extrapolating values beyond the
range of the input data.
<BR><BR>For point-in-time output series, the spline function is evaluated
at the appropriate points.
For interval total or average output series,
the spline function is integrated over the output intervals.
<BR><BR></DD>
</DL>
<H3><I>The JOIN Method</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxexp0105">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxexp0104">&#13;</A>The JOIN method fits a continuous curve to the data by connecting
successive straight line segments.
(This produces a linear spline.)
For point-in-time data, the JOIN method connects
successive nonmissing input values with straight lines.
For interval total or average data,
interval midpoints are used as the break points,
and ordinates are chosen so that the integrals of the
piecewise linear curve agree with the input totals.
<P>For point-in-time output series, the JOIN function is evaluated
at the appropriate points.
For interval total or average output series,
the JOIN function is integrated over the output intervals.
<P><H3><I>The STEP Method</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxexp0107">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxexp0106">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxexp0109">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxexp0108">&#13;</A>The STEP method fits a discontinuous piecewise constant curve.
For point-in-time input data,
the resulting step function is equal to the most recent input value.
For interval total or average data,
the step function is equal to the average value for the interval.
<P>For point-in-time output series, the step function is evaluated
at the appropriate points.
For interval total or average output series,
the step function is integrated over the output intervals.
<P><H3><I>The AGGREGATE Method</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxexp0111">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxexp0110">&#13;</A>The AGGREGATE method performs simple aggregation of time series
without interpolation of missing values.
<P>If the input data are totals or averages,
the results are the sums or averages, respectively, of the input values for
observations corresponding to the output observations.
That is, if either TOTAL or AVERAGE is specified for the OBSERVED= option,
the METHOD=AGGREGATE result is the sum or mean of the input values
corresponding to the output observation.
For example, suppose METHOD=AGGREGATE, FROM=MONTH, and TO=YEAR.
For OBSERVED=TOTAL series,
the result for each output year is the sum of the input values 
over the months of that year.
If any input value is missing, 
the corresponding sum or mean is also a missing value.
<P>If the input data are point-in-time values,
the result value of each output observation equals
the input value for a selected input observation
determined by the OBSERVED= attribute.
For example, suppose METHOD=AGGREGATE, FROM=MONTH, and TO=YEAR.
For OBSERVED=BEGINNING series,
January observations are selected as the annual values.
For OBSERVED=MIDDLE series,
July observations are selected as the annual values.
For OBSERVED=END series,
December observations are selected as the annual values.
If the selected value is missing, the output annual value is missing.
<P>The AGGREGATE method can be used only when the
FROM= intervals are nested within the TO= intervals.
For example, you can use METHOD=AGGREGATE when FROM=MONTH and TO=QTR
because months are nested within quarters.
You cannot use METHOD=AGGREGATE when FROM=WEEK and
TO=QTR because weeks are not nested within quarters.
<P>In addition, the AGGREGATE method cannot convert between point-in-time
data and interval total or average data.
Conversions between TOTAL and AVERAGE data are allowed, but
conversions between BEGINNING, MIDDLE, and END are not.
<P>Missing input values produce missing result values for METHOD=AGGREGATE.
However, gaps in the sequence of input observations are not allowed.
For example, if FROM=MONTH, you may have a missing value for a variable
in an observation for a given February.
But if an observation for January is followed by an observation for
March, there is a gap in the data, and METHOD=AGGREGATE cannot be used.
<P>When the AGGREGATE method is used, there is no interpolating curve, 
and therefore the EXTRAPOLATE option is not allowed.
<P><H3><I>METHOD=NONE</I></H3>
The option METHOD=NONE specifies that no interpolation be performed.
This option is normally used in conjunction with the 
TRANSFORMIN= or TRANSFORMOUT= option.
<P>When METHOD=NONE is specified, there is no difference between the 
TRANSFORMIN= and TRANSFORMOUT= options; if both are specified, 
the TRANSFORMIN= operations are performed first, 
followed by the TRANSFORMOUT= operations.
TRANSFORM= can be used as an abbreviation for TRANSFORMIN=.
<P>METHOD=NONE cannot be used when frequency conversion is specified.
