ABOUT THIS RELEASE


NEW FEATURE

VirusScan Wireless version 2.1 adds an on-access
scanner to the stand-alone scanner that resides 
on your Palm handheld device. You can configure
the on-access scanner to search for viruses on
your Palm device, and configure what action 
you want the scanner to take when it detects 
a virus. For detailed information, see 
"Configuring the On-Access Scanner" later 
in this file.

This version of VirusScan Wireless replaces 
the VirusScan.PRC file on your Palm device. 
VirusScan.PRC is the VirusScan application 
that contains the on-demand scanner and the 
new on-access scanner.


FILES INCLUDED WITH THIS RELEASE

This release consists of a package called 
P2104123.ZIP, which contains the following files:

   VIRUSSCAN.PRC = 
        VirusScan application for the Palm device
   VSDAT.PDB     =
        Virus definition file


________________________________________________

To use VirusScan Wireless 2.1, you must have

to your Palm device.

Devices:

- Palm OS 3.0 or higher

INSTALLATION STEPS

Installing VirusScan 2.1 consists of two
simple steps: 

1.  Open the VirusScan Wireless 2.0 application
    on your PC (Start, Programs, McAfee VirusScan
    Wireless, Palm OS Configuration) and click
    "Update" to open the AutoUpdate window. 
    Verify that the Update Site information is 
    correct, then click "Update Now." 

    The new version of the stand-alone scanner
    is automatically downloaded to your PC.

2.  Perform a HotSync operation between
    your PC and Palm handheld device.

    The new stand-alone scanner, including 
    the new on-access scanner, is automatically
    installed on your Palm device.

    When the HotSync operation is complete,
    this message appears on your Palm device:

         Enabling the On-Access scanner 
         requires a reset. Enable now?

                Yes         No

    - Tap "Yes" to enable the on-access
      scanner and reset the Palm device.

    - Tap "No" if you want to enable
      the on-access scanner at a later time. 
      See "Configuring the On-Access Scanner"
      for detailed information.



________________________________________________
CONFIGURING THE ON-ACCESS SCANNER

Follow these steps to configure the way the 
on-access scanner checks for viruses and the 
actions it takes when it detects a virus.

1.  Open the VirusScan application on your 
    Palm device: tap the Home (or Application) 
    icon, then tap "VirusScan."

    The main VirusScan screen displays a message 
    indicating whether the on-access scanner is 
    enabled or disabled. 

2.  Tap "Settings," then tap "On-Access" to 
    display the On-Access Settings screen. 

    NOTE:
    You can also view the On-Access Settings
    screen by tapping the menu, and selecting
    "Configure On-Access" from the Options
    menu.

4.  Make sure "Enable On-Access scanning" is
    selected. 

3.  Under "When virus is found," tap the 
    triangle to select the action you want 
    the scanner to take when it detects 
    a virus:

    - Prompt user for action

    - Prevent launching infected files

    - Clean infection automatically

    - Delete infection automatically

4.  Select the checkbox for any of these 
    options:

    - "Enable file scan caching" 
      Tells the scanner to avoid scanning 
      applications and data known to be 
      uninfected. 

    - "Sound warning"
      Enables the audible warning when a
      virus is detected.

    - "Log infections found" 
      Records the the scan results in a 
      log file.

5.  Select "Compatibility mode" for greater
    reliability when running certain third-party 
    applications or certain Palm OS devices. 

    NOTE:
    Some applications and some devices cannot 
    properly respond when denied access to 
    an infected application or database. The
    "Compatibility mode" ensures that these
    applications and devices continue to 
    operate when an infection is detected. 
    See  "Known Issues" for more information.

6.  When you have made your selections, 
    tap "Done."


For detailed information on using VirusScan on
the Palm device and the PC, and for information
on updating your virus definition files, see 
the Product Guide that accompanied the version 
2.0 product release.


________________________________________________
KNOWN ISSUES

1.  DISABLE THE ON-ACCESS SCANNER BEFORE 
    REMOVING THE APPLICATION

    If you want to delete the VirusScan
    application from your Palm device, first 
    make sure that the on-access scanner is 
    disabled. 

    If you try to delete VirusScan from the 
    Palm device when the on-access scanner is 
    enabled, the on-access scanner is 
    automatically disabled and this message 
    appears on your Palm device: 

      The On-Access scanner has been disabled.
      It is now safe to delete VirusScan.

    Simply select VirusScan again, and tap 
    "Delete."


2.  WHEN THE ON-ACCESS SCANNER DETECTS AN
    INFECTED FILE

    If you selected "Prompt user for action"
    in the On-Access Settings screen, and the 
    scanner detects an infected file during a
    HotSync or when files are beamed to your
    Palm device, your available choices 
    are either:

        Clean     Delete     Deny Access

    or

        Clean     Delete     Acknowledge

    "Acknowledge" only appears under these
    three conditions:
     - You selected "Compatibility mode"
     - An infected database attempts to open
     - It is safe for the database access to
       continue

    Selecting "Acknowledge" allows the
    infected item to be accessed, but does
    not present a risk of further infection, 
    because the on-access scanner does not
    allow an infected item to be executed.

    NOTE:
    If you select "Acknowledge" when a virus
    is detected, the infected item remains
    on your Palm device. McAfee recommends 
    that you handle the infection promptly by
    running an on-demand scan and selecting 
    either "Clean" or "Delete." 


3.  USING OLDER VERSIONS OF PALM OS

    On some older versions of the Palm OS,
    when "Compatibility mode" is enabled and
    the On-Access scanner takes action on an
    infected item, you may see an error
    message that prompts you to reset the
    device.


4.  INSTALLING A NEW VERSION OF VIRUSSCAN 
    OVER 2.1

    Once you have installed VirusScan Wireless
    2.1 on your Palm device, make sure that
    the on-access scanner is disabled before
    trying to install a new version of the
    software.
    
    If you perform the HotSync without first
    disabling the on-access scanner, the
    synchronization disables the on-access
    scanner, displays a message on the Palm, 
    and stops. To continue, first make sure 
    that the Palm Install Tool lists 
    VIRUSSCAN.PRC (the VirusScan Wireless 
    application for the Palm device). If it 
    does not, add it manually. Then repeat the 
    HotSync operation to download the files 
    from your PC to your Palm device.
