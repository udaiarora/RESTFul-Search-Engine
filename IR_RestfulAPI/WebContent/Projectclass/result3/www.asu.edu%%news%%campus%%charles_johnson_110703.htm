      <h2>Award-winning author Johnson to give ASU Centennial Lecture</h2>
      <p><img src="campus_images/charles_johnson.jpg" alt="Charles Johnson" width="179" height="201" align="right">The prolific
          and wide-ranging intellect of Charles Johnson, one of America's leading
          writers of novels, short stories and essays, will energize the
          ASU community during his residency at the Barrett Honors College Nov.
          16 - 21.</p>
      <p>Johnson will present the 2003 Centennial Lecture on "Mindfulness
          and the Beloved Community" at 7:30 p.m., Nov. 19, in the Carson Ballroom
          of Old Main. Tickets are required for the free lecture and are available
          at ASU Bookstores, Borders Books and Changing Hands Bookstore.</p>
      <p>He won
          the National Book Award in 1990 for "Middle Passage," a novel which
        embodies his controversial version of black literature as a "fiction
          of increasing artistic and intellectual growth, one that enables us
        as a people - as a culture - to move from narrow complaint to broad celebration."</p>
      <p>His
          perspective on mindfulness is evident in story lines from his novels,
          which also include "Dreamer" and "Oxherding Tale," and in the careful
          crafting of all his works. He will discuss the impact mindful thoughts,
          words and actions can have on any community.</p>
      <p>Johnson's balance of philosophy
          and folklore has been praised since the publication of his first novel,
          "Faith and the Good Thing," in 1974.
          He was named by the University of Southern California as one of the
        10 best short story writers in America.</p>
      <p>Having begun his career as a cartoonist,
          Johnson also will be featured in a panel discussion on black humor
        and its political ends at 5:30 p.m.,
          Nov. 20, in Agriculture 250, along with ASU English Professor Neal
        Lester and David Hemphill, executive director of Phoenix Black Theatre
        Troupe.
          In addition to speaking to classes as guest lecturer and meeting with
          faculty and students, he will participate in a brown-bag discussion
        at 11:30 a.m., Nov. 21, in the Memorial Union Mohave Room. Johnson's
        outspoken
          views on the direction of black literature have been criticized as
        being unfair to such authors as Alice Walker and Toni Morrison, whose
        works
          challenge racism more directly. </p>
      <p>He has been a practicing Buddhist since
          1980, and says his work is informed by both Eastern and Western philosophical
          traditions.</p>
      <p>He has received
          both a National Endowment for the Arts grant and a Guggenheim Fellowship,
          and his collection of short stories, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"
          was one of five finalists for the PEN/Faulkner Award. He has written
          more than 20 screenplays and continues to draw and publish cartoons.
          Johnson is the Pollack Professor of English at the University of Washington
          in Seattle.</p>
      <p>He also will speak on Buddhism and writing at 7 p.m., Nov.
          17, at Changing Hands Bookstore, 6428 S. McClintock Dr., Tempe.</p>
