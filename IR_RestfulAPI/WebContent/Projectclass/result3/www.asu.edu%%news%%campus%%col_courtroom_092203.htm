      <h2>Courtroom vaults College of Law Into 21st Century</h2>
      <p>        <img src="campus_images/Courtroom-Fourm2.jpg" width="288" height="174" align="right">The ASU College of Law can now offer its students and area lawyers a
          place to polish their skills and learn how to better incorporate technology
        into their court trials with its new 21st Century Courtroom. </p>
      <p>The facility,
            established with a gift from Chip Harris in memory of his late son
            Ryan, includes a PC-based integrated control system, a state-of-the-art
          presentation lectern, customized counsel tables, and a touch-screen
        annotation system, much like the one used by sports commentators to draw
        on television
          screens.</p>
      <p>The college plans to showcase the new courtroom with an open
          house from 3:30 to 5 p.m., Sept. 29.</p>
      <p>Catherine O'Grady, law professor and the college's
          executive director of clinical programs, coordinated the project.</p>
      <p>"The courtroom will prepare
          students to practice in the technological environment that exists today,"
          she says. "That's the challenge for all
          of us, as lawyers. As technology develops, we have to incorporate it
          as part of the 'lawyering' process. We're extremely grateful to all
        those who helped bring this great resource into being for our students." </p>
      <p>The
          automated systems were designed and integrated by Integrated Courtroom
          Technology, Inc., a leading provider of courtroom technology design
        and installation services, also known as Courttech. Additional funding
        for
          the project came from University resources, a donation from Courttech
          and a long-term loan of S-video cameras from Wolfvision. </p>
      <p>O'Grady credits
        the courtroom's design team members, including the ASU Facilities Department,
        Dick &amp; Fritsche Design Group and Jerry Davis
        of Jeremiah Associates, for the courtroom's enhanced teaching capabilities.        </p>
      <p>"Jerry and our architects were critical players in the completion of
          this project," she says. "They creatively addressed the college's desire
          to enhance the courtroom's capabilities."</p>
      <p>While the courtroom will provide
          pedagogical advantages, O'Grady believes it also will be a great tool
          for use by the Valley legal community. </p>
      <p>"When
          not in use by the College of Law, attorneys may train on this equipment.
          Also, the courtroom is trial-ready. This is yet another way that the
          knowledge and resource exchange between the college and the community
          works to the benefit of everyone," O'Grady says.</p>
      <p>Phillip "Duke" Argetsinger,
          of Courttech, agrees. For him, the future is now, and the college's
        new courtroom offers a prime example of the
          new technologies rapidly transforming the nation's courts.</p>
      <p>"The 21st Century
          Courtroom is a valuable resource both for the educational mission of
          the College of Law and for the legal community at large. The
          past five years have seen an enormous growth of automation requirements
          in the litigation environment and a major commitment by courts of law,"
          he says. "It's a revolutionary development." </p>
      <p>The courtroom's bench is
          named in memory of Judge James Ackerman, a 1982 College of Law graduate
          and Division I Court of Appeals Judge. </p>

          with the College of Law, can be reached at (480) 965-1689 or (stephen.marlowe@asu.edu).<br>
