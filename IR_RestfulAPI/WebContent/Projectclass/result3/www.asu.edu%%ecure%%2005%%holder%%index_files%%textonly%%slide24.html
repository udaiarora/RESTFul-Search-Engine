        <p>During Phase II, the co-project managers and Helen taught themselves how to use NVIVO software to code the data from each interview session Â? luckily, I was totally uninvolved with this phase of the project! We also analyzed electronic filing schemes of selected individuals and compared them with their print filing schemes and records schedules (if they had one), and we looked at the technical capabilities of desktop applications and servers used at UNC-CH and Duke and investigated some Electronic Records Management Systems' features (though these last two activities received much less attention than did coding the data from the interviews.) While coding was taking place, we were drawing some preliminary conclusions from the data.</p>
