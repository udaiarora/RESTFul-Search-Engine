      <h2>World's astrobiologists to meet at ASU, give public talks </h2>
      <p>About 500 scientists from around the world, essentially the who's who 
        of researchers in the burgeoning field of astrobiology, will be gathered 
        in Tempe, Arizona for the 2003 NASA Astrobiology Institute General Meeting 
        taking place February 10 to 12 at Arizona State University.</p>
      <p>The meeting, only the second international conference of its kind, will 
        feature a host of presentations on leading edge research from the top 
        figures in its field, activities for educators interested in learning 
        how to bring astrobiology into the K-12 classroom, and two significant 
        lectures on topics of popular interest.</p>
      <p>The lectures, which are free and open to the general public, will include: 
      </p>
      <p>? A presentation on February 11 at 7:30 p.m. in Gammage Auditorium by 
        prominent Mexican astrobiologist Antonio Lazcano, president of the International 
        Society for the Study of the Origin of Life, on &quot;Astrobiology and 
        the Emergence of Life on Earth,&quot; and</p>
      <p>? A presentation on February 12 at 5:30 p.m. in the Ventana Room of the 
        Memorial Union by world-renowned paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, 
        director of ASU's Institute of Human Origins, on &quot;Our Evolutionary 
        Journey: From Darkest Africa to Deepest Space.&quot;</p>
      <p>Antonio Lazcano is a prominent biologist and Distinguished Professor 
        at the National University (UNAM) in Mexico City. An academic committed 
        to public education, he has received several major awards for his contributions 
        to science, scientific journalism and teaching, including the Gold Medal 
        for Biological Research granted by the University of Puebla. He is the 
        author of several books in Spanish, including The Miraculous Bacteria, 
        a collection of scientific essays, The Spark of Life, a popular exploration 
        of the heterotrophic theory of the emergence of life, and The Origin of 
        Life, which has become a best-seller with more than a half-million copies 
        sold. He has been professor-in-residence or visiting professor at universities 
        and research institutes in France, Cuba, Spain, Switzerland, Russia and 
        the U.S. Lazcano has served on many advisory, editorial and review boards, 
        and has been organizer for major scientific meetings in Mexico, the U.S. 
        and Europe.</p>
      <p>Currently, Lazcano is the president of the International Society for 
        the Study of the Origin of Life and is considered among the ten most distinguished 
        Latin American scientists. His research focuses on the study of the deepest 
        branches of the tree of life, with special interest in the last common 
        ancestor of extant life forms and the origin and development of metabolic 
        pathways.</p>
      <p>Donald C. Johanson is probably the best known American paleoanthropologist. 
        His discovery in 1974 of a 3.18 million-year-old hominid skeleton -- popularly 
        known as &quot;Lucy&quot; -- in the Hadar region of Ethiopia has had an 
        extraordinary influence on our understanding of early hominid evolution. 
        His subsequent discoveries have included &quot;The First Family&quot; 
        -- a unique collection of 13 individuals who died in a single geological 
        moment, found in Ethiopia in 1975; the discovery (1986) of a 1.8 million 
        year old partial skeleton of Homo habilis at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania; 
        and the 1992 discovery of the first complete skull of Lucy's species, 
        Australopithecus afarensis. Johanson has carried out field research in 
        Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and Tanzania.</p>
      <p>Johanson is a prolific writer. He wrote the widely read book Lucy (with 
        Maitland Edey; 1981), which won the American Book Award in Science; he 
        has also authored numerous scientific and popular articles. Other books 
        include Blueprints: Solving the Mystery of Evolution (with Maitland Edey; 
        1989), Lucy's Child (with James Shreeve; 1989), Journey From the Dawn, 
        (with Kevin O'Farrell; 1990), Ancestors: In Search of Human Origins (with 
        Lenora Johanson and Blake Edgar; 1994), and most recently, From Lucy To 
        Language (with Blake Edgar, principle photography by David Brill; 1996). 
        The films &quot;The First Family&quot; (1981) and &quot;Lucy in Disguise&quot; 
        (1982) highlight the pioneering work of Johanson and his team in Ethiopia. 
        In 1982 he was also host of the Public Broadcasting Service NATURE series, 
        and narrated the National Geographic Society film &quot;Fossils: Clues 
        to the Past.&quot; Johanson is host and narrator of a 3-part PBS/NOVA 
        series entitled &quot;In Search of Human Origins,&quot; which first aired 
        in February, 1994 and has now been seen by over 100 million viewers worldwide. 
        He is a frequent lecturer at universities and other forums in the United 
        States and abroad. Johanson is an Honorary Board Member of the Explorers 
        Club, a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and </p>
      <p>many other professional organizations; and recipient of several international 
        prizes and awards. </p>
      <p>In 1975, Johanson was appointed curator of physical anthropology at the 
        Cleveland Museum of Natural History and, beginning in 1976, developed 
        a laboratory of physical anthropology that attracted scholars from all 
        over the world. In 1981, Johanson founded the Institute of Human Origins, 
        in Berkeley, California. In 1997, Johanson and his team relocated IHO's 
        headquarters to ASU where he currently serves as director of the institute 
        and professor of anthropology.</p>
      <p>Founded in 1998, the NASA Astrobiology Institute sponsors scientific 
        research in a wide variety of disciplines aimed at asking and answering 
        large and fundamental questions about life in the universe. Astrobiology 
        is an exciting new discipline devoted to the study of life on Earth and 
        elsewhere in the universe - its origin, evolution, distribution, and future. 
        This new area of multidisciplinary study is bringing together the physical 
        and biological sciences to address some of the most fundamental questions 
        of the natural world.</p>
      <p>The NASA Astrobiology Institute is composed of over 700 researchers distributed 
        at more that 130 research institutions across the United States. Its central 
        offices are located at NASA Ames Research Center, in the heart of Silicon 
        Valley, California. Additional information about the NAI can be found 
        at its website: &lt;http://nai.arc.nasa.gov&gt;</p>
