      <h2>Opposition grows as schoolhouse commercialism flourishes and schoolchildren's
        health declines</h2>
      <p>School Commercialism, Student Health, and the Pressure
        To Do More With Less, a report released by the Commercialism in Education
        Research Unit (CERU), finds that while the health of schoolchildren continues
        to decline, corporations are targeting schools to advertise and sell
        products that are the most profitable but not necessarily the most healthful.</p>
      <p> Professor Alex Molnar (Arizona State University), report author and
        CERU director, explains that the increasing political and economic pressure
        on schools to boost student performance and to find external resources
        to fund school programs pushes schools to turn to corporations for help,
        thus encouraging school commercialism.</p>
      <p>Child Obesity Epidemic</p>
      <p> Molnar points out that research has positively identified a relationship
        between the consumption of sugar sweetened drinks and child obesity.
        As soft drink consumption has increased so too has child obesity. In
        October 2002, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported
        that obesity in children has tripled in the last two decades. In addition,
        according to 1999-2000 data, 15 percent of children and teenagers (9
        million) ages 6 to 19 were overweight. In addition, soft drink consumption
        has more than doubled in the past 30 years.</p>
      <p>Schools' Dilemma: Money or Health</p>
      <p> Despite studies linking junk food and soft drinks with obesity, many
        schools, in need of new resources, have turned a blind eye toward corporate
        advertising or even embraced it. Rather than promoting healthy choices,
        Molnar notes, exclusive agreements with bottlers, for example, force
        school districts to increase the number of vending machines in schools
        in order to increase sales. Evidence also suggests that commercializing
        trends in schools is not likely to abate in the future.</p>
      <p>Opposition</p>
      <p> School districts, teachers, parents, and policy makers have begun to
        look critically at corporate marketing and its impact on children's health.
        The report identifies 30 pieces of legislation and three resolutions
        proposed between 1999 and 2003 at the federal and state level that specifically
        addressed health related schoolhouse commercialism issues.</p>
      <p>Litigation</p>
      <p> Concerned parents as well as businesses harmed by exclusive access
        to schools may increasingly turn to the courts for relief. The report
        notes two lawsuits filed in 2003: one in New York by a beverage association
        and taxpayers against the state education commissioner, and the other
        by an Oregon parent against his child's school district.</p>
      <p>Conclusion</p>
      <p> As recently as 20 years ago, there was a broad national consensus that
        public education should be free of commercial pressure on students. As
        this report has documented, however, the pressure on schools to permit
        a broad array of marketing activities is now intense and pervasive. </p>

      <p>The Commercialism in Education Research Unit (CERU) conducts research,
        disseminates information, and helps facilitate a dialogue between the
        education community,
        policy makers, and the public at large about commercial
        activities
        in schools. CERU is the only national academic research center
        dedicated
      to schoolhouse commercialism.</p>
