SAS/QC User's Guide, Version 8
</H1><P>
Look no more for comprehensive information on the procedures in SAS/QC     software.
SAS/QC procedures are available for basic quality
problem solving methods (such as Pareto charts and Ishikawa diagrams),     statistical process control, process capability analysis, reliability
analysis, and design of experiments.  If you are a beginning user you will benefit from the "getting started" sections which introduce the features
you need to learn first with a series of step-by-step examples.  If you    are an experienced user, you will benefit from summary tables of option
which are organized functionally, as well as options dictionaries which    provide complete details.  This title also covers a number of special
topics including gage analysis, short run process control, autocorrelated  and nonnormal process data, as well as methods for creating customized
control charts.  These sections are particularly valuable for applications developers.
