<a name=TRUJILLO><h2>Trujillo Named Director</h2></a>
Octaviana Trujillo has been appointed Director of the Center for Indian 
Education in the College of Education at ASU.
<p>
	The Center for Indian Education, the first of its kind in the United 
States, was established 
in 1959 as a research and service center and will be gearing up to 
celebrate its 40th anniversary during 1999.
<p>
	The Center sponsors the Annual State Conference on American Indian 
Education and 
publishes the refereed <i>Journal of American Indian Education</i> three 
times a year.  According to 
Trujillo, language and culture preservation is a major issue facing 
indigenous peoples today and the 
Center will study the issue as it continues to serve the needs of Arizona?s 
tribal communities.
	
<p>Trujillo, an assistant professor in the College of Education, received 
her doctorate from ASU in 
curriculum and instruction.  Trujillo grew up in Guadalupe, Arizona.  In 
1992, she became the first 
woman to serve as vice chairwoman of the Pascua Yaqui tribe in Tucson. Her 
other accomplishments 
are impressive: she has spent time in India on a Fulbright scholarship; 
participated in the International 
Institute of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France; and was a delegate for 
indigenous women to the Beijing International Forum on Women.

<a name=FIRSTS><h2><i>Native North American Firsts</i></h2></a>

	In previous newsletters, we reported the progress of the above 
book, edited by Karen Gayton 
Swisher, Ed.D. and AnCita Benally.  Swisher (Standing Rock Sioux) is 
former Director of the Center 
for Indian Education at ASU and is now chair of the Teacher Education 
Department at Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence, Kansas.  
AnCita Benally (Navajo) earned her M.A. in history from 
ASU where she is now a doctoral student in the Department of History.
<p>
<b><i>Native North American Firsts</i></b> is now available.  It is 
published by Gale Research, 835 
Penobscot Building, Detroit, Michigan, 48226-4094, 263 Pp.  
ISBN 0-7876-0518-2.<p>  
	The Labriola Center staff got caught up in the project and in addition to providing  research 
materials, members eagerly collected lists of ?Firsts? found in obscure journals and miscellaneous 
sources, to help the editors.
<p>
	Billy Mills (Lakota Sioux), provided the book?s Foreword.  He was the first and still only 
American ever to win the 10,000 meter run in the Olympic Games.  After his 1964 win, his Lakota 
elders gave him his Indian name Makoce Teh?la (Loves-His-Country).  There are hundreds of Native 
Americans so honored in this book representing: the arts; business; culture history;
religious life, Indian Rights and Activism; the 
sciences; literature; media; government, law and the judiciary; and more.  In addition to providing an 
impressive list of ?firsts,? the book makes a good read.

<a name=PARK><h2>Phoenix Indian School Park & 
Native American Cultural Center</h2></a>
	In our fall 1997 newsletter, we announced the planned restoration 
of the Phoenix Indian School by the City of Phoenix Parks, Recreation, 
and Library Department.
<p>
	In connection with this, we have learned that the Arizona American 
Indian Tourism Association (AAITA) is sponsoring the ?Native

the project, please call or write at (520) 523-7320 or PO Box 22218,

<p>
	The Cultural Center will be housed in the Indian School?s old 
dining hall and feature exhibits on the school and Arizona?s Indian 
tribes.  In addition, there will be educational programs, Native American 
traditional and contemporary entertainment, a gift shop, and Native 
American foods.  General information and tour packages to visit Arizona 
Indian reservations will also be offered.

<a name=HOPI><h2>Hopi Learning Center Opens at Scottsdale Hyatt</h2></a>
	The Hyatt Regency Hotel in Scottsdale recently opened the Hopi 
Learning Center, which will be staffed by Hopi cultural interpreters 
to help visitors understand Hopi history, culture, and teachings.
<p>
	Lance Polingyouma graciously gave Curator Etter a tour of the 
small museum and Learning Center, which is adjacent to the hotel lobby.  
Though small, it features some very fine exhibits which include 
photographs, woven mantas, Kachina dolls, silver jewelry, baskets, 
pottery, and more.  
<p>
	Polingyouma reported that future plans include addition of a 
library and interactive computer programs that teach something about 
Native cultures.  In addition, there will be hands-on activities for 
youngsters.  The Center also plans to invite various artists to talk 
about their work.  The Learning Center will also arrange trips with 
guides/interpreters to the various reservations in Arizona.

<a name=PRESS><h2>Hot off the Press!</h2></a>
     The University of New Mexico Press announces publication of <b><i>White 
Man's Medicine: The Navajo and Government Doctors, 1863-1955</i></b> by ASU 
professor of history, Robert A. Trennert.
<p>     
     According to the Press, Trennert writes how the Din&eacute; accepted 
some aspects of Western medicine, but during the nineteenth century most 
government physicians actively worked to destroy age-old healing practices. 
Only in the 1930s did 
doctors begin to work with--rather than oppose--traditional healers.  
Medicine men associated illness with the supernatural and the disruption 
of nature's harmony.  Indian service doctors familiar with Navajo culture 
eventually accepted traditional medicine as a valuable complement to 
their health care.
<p>          
     From the University of Arizona Press comes <b><i>At the Desert's Green 
Edge: An Ethnobotany of the Gila River Pima</i></b>, by  Amadeo M. Rea and 
featuring Sumi-e illustrations by Takashi Ijichi with a Foreword by Gary 
Paul Nabhan.
<p>
     Ethnobiologist Amadeo M. Rea has written the first complete 
ethnobotany of the Gila River Pima from the perspective of the Pimas 
themselves. <i>At the Desert's Green Edge</i> weaves the Pima point of 
view of 
the plants found in their environment with memories of their own history 
and culture, creating a monumental testament to their traditions and way 
of life.
<p>
The book was introduced at an outdoor reception at the Gila River Indian 
Arts and Crafts Center and was hosted by Governor Mary V. Thomas of the 
Gila River Community on November 6, 1997.  After a traditional blessing, 
tribal members who provided source material on the history, plant use, 
language, and traditional culture of the Akimel O'Odham were introduced.
<p>
     Copies of the book were available and after Rea added his signature, 
the artist, Takashi Ijichi, created an original Sumi-e painting in each 
purchaser's book.
