The Complete Guide to the SAS Output Delivery System, Version 8
</H1><P>
Learn how to make the most of your SAS output! Do you want to generate     procedure output that you can view with a web browser or that takes
advantage of the high resolution of a postscript printer?  Do you want to  turn the output of a procedure into a SAS data set?  Do you want to see
part of that voluminous procedure output, but not everything it produces?  Do you want to change the presentation of a procedure's results to suit
your own needs?  How about changing the colors and fonts that SAS uses in  HTML and Printer output?  This book teaches you how to do these things
and more with the results of SAS procedures and of DATA step programs.     New users can quickly learn the basics of ODS from the text or by copying
and modifying the examples. More experienced users can delve into the      complexities of PROC TEMPLATE to produce a truly original look and feel
for their SAS output.
