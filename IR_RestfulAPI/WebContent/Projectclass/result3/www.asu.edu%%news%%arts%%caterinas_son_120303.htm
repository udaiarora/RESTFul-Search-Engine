      <h2>Lyric Opera Theatre premieres 'Caterina's Son'</h2>
      <p>        "The DaVinci Code" is currently a bestselling novel, and a new composer
          is hoping that his musical about Leonardo DaVinci will enjoy the same
          popularity, with a little help from ASU's Katherine K. Herberger College
          of Fine Arts. With a Ph.D. from Stanford University and years as a
          successful engineer behind him, Tak Tarbo has combined his love of
          Broadway musicals and fascination with Leonardo DaVinci to create "Caterina's
          Son," premiering Nov. 21, as part of the Herberger Mainstage Lyric
        Opera Theatre season at ASU. </p>
      <p>The musical focuses on DaVinci as a gifted
            artist who also was the illegitimate son of a peasant woman who gave
            him up for a better life. "Caterina's
          Son" is ultimately a story of redemption that spans DaVinci's life
        from 1452 to 1519 and is set in Renaissance Italy. DaVinci was reunited
        with
          his 65-year-old mother when he was 41 and in Milan working on "The
        Last Supper."</p>
      <p>Tarbo hand-picked the Lyric Opera Theatre program to perform
          the musical and J. Robert Wills, dean of the Herberger College of Fine
          Arts, will
          direct it. Lyric Opera Theatre director William Reber is musical director
          for "Caterina's Son," marking the first collaboration between Reber
        and Wills since they worked together at the University of Texas at Austin
          nearly 20 years ago. Both were fascinated with the unique subject matter
          of the musical.</p>
      <p>"DaVinci is known around the world as the universal man
          and Caterina is his largely forgotten mother," says Wills. "It's a
        wonderful story
          to be told and that's what intrigued me from the beginning." Over the
          past year, Wills has worked closely with Tarbo to develop and refine
          the script, even traveling with him to DaVinci's birthplace in Tuscany
          to do research for the production. </p>
      <p>"No trace of Caterina's family has
          been found in the archives of the old churches in Tuscany, indicating
          that she belonged to a neglected
          class," says Tarbo, who feels that the soul and core of DaVinci's genius
          may be attributed to his mother. "I am interested in Caterina and her
          position in the life of Leonardo." </p>
      <p>Some experts think the model for DaVinci's
          "Mona Lisa" is his birth mother Caterina. <br>
        "I decided to address this unexplored aspect of Leonardo's life and
          propose a new dimension to the universal intrigue of the "Mona Lisa,"
          which means
          also telling the story of Leonardo and Caterina," says Tarbo.</p>
      <p>It is unusual
          for a university music program to premiere an original musical, but
        the Lyric Opera Theatre program, which recently received
          eight AriZoni theatre awards for last season's production of "A Chorus
          Line," is ready for the challenge.</p>
      <p>"Caterina's" ensemble cast of 17 will
          portray nearly 60 characters. Many of the students helped shape the
        musical during rehearsals and in a Broadway Scenes class that met three
        times
          a week from January through May 2003. The experience has been rewarding
          for both students and faculty. </p>
      <p>"Caterina's Son" evokes a cinematic feel
          with large-screen video projections of Da Vinci's work and images of
          Tuscany. Some of the cast will wear
          vintage costumes used in the movie "Becket" with Richard Burton. Esther
          Turner, coordinator for the School of Music's costume shop, borrowed
          the costumes from the local Renaissance Singers performance group. </p>
      <p>"These
          costumes are like works of art," Esther says. "We are helping restore
          them to their original condition." </p>
      <p>More than 70 costumes will
        be used in the production; 10 of them are from "Becket."</p>
      <p>Show times
          for "Caterina's Son" are 7:30 p.m., Nov. 21, 22 and Dec. 3, 5 and 6;
          and 2 p.m. on Nov. 23. Tickets are $12 for seniors, faculty
            and staff, and $5 for students. For information, call (480) 965-6447
          or visit (http://herbergercollege.asu.edu/calendar/mainstage.html).</p>
