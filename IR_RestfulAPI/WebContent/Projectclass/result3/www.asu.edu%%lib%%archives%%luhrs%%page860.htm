<p>Luke, Adolph Liebeman shot a woman. Get Louise vaccinated, 
also herself and Christine. Mrs. Ganz sends her regards.</p>
<br>
<p>Letter 8, June 13th, 1887: When you return, write three or 
four days before you depart. Also send a telegram from New 
York so he will know she is back in this country. Send a 
telegram from Deming so he can meet her in Maricopa. He does 
not go out. He would rather stay home and think of her. He 
could never live without her. His brother Henry never gets in 
before eleven P.M. Write all the details of your trip. 
Tomorrow, June 14th she should arrive at her folks. Bring back 
a new harmonica from Hamburg. Ask her mother if she thought he 
did wrong dedicating himself to his business and not giving her 
and the children enough time. He loves her so much he will be 
more attentive to them when they return. He keeps reading 
the letter she put under the pillow telling him not to work so 
hard or he would get sick. He was so glad that after three and 
a half years their love is growing stronger.</p>
<br>
<p>Letter 9, June 16, 1887: You are 2 days closer to me now since 
I wrote to you last. Herrick went to San Francisco to take 
Kales horses and car. Herrick wanted him to go along, but who 
would run the business.</p>
<br>
<p>Letter 10, June 26, 1887: He can understand how she felt when 
he was working all the time and not giving her any attention. 
It will never happen again. He will not let her go away again, 
without him. He remembers she told him he should never have 
gotten married, and asked for her forgiveness. He did not do it 
intending to hurt her, but thought it would be necessary to take 
care of the family. He did not know how much he loved her. No 
one would ever take her place. What did her parents say about 
the hotel they were building? It will take five hundred thousand 
stones. A Mexican celebration is on. The railroad will come to 
Phoenix July 1, 1887.</p>
<br>
<p>Letter 11, June 27, 1887: Received her letter of July 4th and 
was glad she was well and in good spirit. Their being separated 
showed them how much they meant to each other. He was glad to 
hear Arthur was so well behaved and that people liked him. How 
good it is to know real love. Their children will experience 
peace, united union and love with them, which will enable the 
children to love them and each other better, and they will grow 
into better people. In three or four years they should not have 
to work so hard. The hotel will soon get started. Have received 
four carloads of wood, and Aug. 1, 1887 will start work. When 
she returns they will be on the third floor. He is very busy 
now. What does Heinrich Maas think of Arthur?</p>
<br>
<p>Letter 12, June 29th, 1887: How proud you must be when people 
stop you and admire Arthur and Louise, all dressed up and well
