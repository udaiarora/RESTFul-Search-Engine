<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Spanish classes offered in our Ecuador program will 
use the same texts, standards, and format as the corresponding courses offered on the Arizona 
State University campus.&nbsp; Our instructors have gone through the same training as that 
given to Spanish instructors on campus.&nbsp; There will not however be language labs since we 
will not have that equipment available to us in the Amazonian setting.&nbsp; Here are the 
course descriptions for the standard campus courses which we will use as models for our 
courses in Ecuador:</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Amazonian context will of course make some important 
differences.&nbsp; You will be practicing your Spanish with Amazonian Quichua people who speak 
Spanish as their national language but as a second language.&nbsp; This is analogous to practicing 
English with people native to Arizona whose first language is Navajo.&nbsp; Many of our students 
have found this a helpful environment for practicing their Spanish.&nbsp; Because the Quichua 
people of this community speak Spanish as a second language they tend to speak a little more 
slowly and use a little less complicated vocabulary than do native speakers.&nbsp; It is a very 
nonthreatening environment in which to risk expressing thoughts in a new language.&nbsp; Because 
your Quichua hosts have gone through the process of learning Spanish themselves and have parents 
or grandparents who do not speak Spanish they are very understanding of the mistakes that are 
made in the process of learning a language and they are eager to help students improve.</font>
