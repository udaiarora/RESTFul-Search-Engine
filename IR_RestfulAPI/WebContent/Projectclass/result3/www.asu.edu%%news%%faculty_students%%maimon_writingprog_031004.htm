      <h2>ASU West provost accepts new challenge to head university writing program </h2>
      <p align="center">Having laid the foundation for ASU West's future, ASU West Provost and University Vice President Elaine Maimon has decided to serve Arizona State University in a new way - leading a university-wide effort to make ASU the exemplar comprehensive research metropolitan university in writing across the curriculum. Maimon will complete her work as provost and vice president on June 30, 2004, take a year-long sabbatical, and return to ASU to head the writing across the curriculum program. </p>
      <p>Maimon has accepted an offer from ASU President Michael Crow to become a Distinguished Foundation Professor in Writing Across the Curriculum, a field in which she is a founder and national leader. </p>
      <p>The university is about to complete the first phase of a planning process to determine how ASU will evolve over the next several years and, ultimately, how it will be configured 50 years in the future. State-of-the-art writing instruction across four or more campuses and throughout the university will play an essential role in the new American university. </p>
      <p>Under Maimon's leadership, ASU West has grown from offering only upper-division courses and a few masters programs to a comprehensive campus with a full four years of undergraduate instruction and an expanded number of master's degrees. She has led the campus in applying principles of learner-centered education to classroom-based learning communities. Enrollment has grown 77 percent during Maimon's tenure as provost. </p>
      <p>"Provost Maimon's leadership, dedication, and commitment to excellence has been instrumental in the transformation of the West campus to its full-service status today," says ASU President Michael Crow. "From day one, Elaine has embraced not only the university, but the entire West Valley, which has embraced her as well, illustrating a model university-community relationship that, without a doubt, has been instrumental in the success of the West Campus." </p>
      <p>"Everything we have accomplished to make the West Campus a model of academic excellence and an exemplar of community embeddedness has been in the context of One University," Maimon says. </p>
      <p>"In my eight years as provost of ASU West and Vice President of ASU, I have been deeply gratified to lead a creative and innovative group of faculty, staff and students in the building of ASU West as a comprehensive campus, with full undergraduate offerings, expanded graduate programs, and award-winning partnerships with community colleges," she says. </p>
      <p>"I want to thank the ASU West community for dedication to the highest standards in university education," Maimon says. "Our accomplishments were driven by a strategic vision collectively developed in 1996-97, at the beginning of my tenure as provost. Without this shared vision and hard work of the entire campus, we would not be where we are today." </p>
      <p>Maimon says she is particularly proud of the transformation of the West Campus to a four-year degree offering institution. It was a proud day in August 2001, when ASU West welcomed its first freshman class. Just two years later, in August 2003, ASU West offered residential housing for the first time, opening Las Casas, a state-of-the-art learning and living community. </p>
      <p>ASU Executive Vice President and Provost Milton Glick says, "Elaine has transformed ASU West in ways that have made it an asset to the university, the state and public higher education nationally. We are grateful she is willing to lead an ambitious effort to make ASU the premier comprehensive metropolitan research university in writing across the curriculum." </p>
      <p>Glick commended Maimon's significant administrative accomplishments, which she has done in tandem with enhancing her contributions to the field of rhetoric and composition, most recently with her highly acclaimed book, "A Writer's Resource." </p>
      <p>Maimon says she will continue her leadership in the West Valley through her chairmanship of the WESTMARC Board of Directors and her Valley-wide civic contributions on various boards, including Heard Museum, Sun Health, Challenger Center, United Way and Arrowhead Bank. </p>
      <p>Maimon received all her degrees - B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. in English - from the University of Pennsylvania, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year and later received her Ph.D. with distinction. She then served in a number of increasingly responsible teaching and administrative roles at Haverford College (Haverford, Penn.), Arcadia University (Glenside, Penn.), Brown University (Providence, R.I.), and Queens College (City University of New York). Arcadia University (formerly known as Beaver College), annually presents the Elaine P. Maimon Award in writing to honor her pioneering work in the field. </p>
