<h2>Press Release:<br />
    University Data Under Siege
</h2>

<p>November 2002</p>

<p>&#8220;Bits get to the future one day at a time&#8221;, according to Clifford Lynch of the 
	Coalition for Networked Information, &#8220;but they may not be the bits you intended to 
	send there.&#8221; Given the insecurity of online information systems, those bits may have 
	been replaced with something else by an amused hacker.</p>

<p>An international expert on Internet infrastructure and applications development, Lynch noted 
	that the net &#8220;has become an astonishingly hostile environment in the last five 
	years&#8221;, and that &#8220;the systems at our university campuses are being continually 
	probed for weaknesses&#8221;. As a result university technology and records experts are concerned 
	about their ability to maintain accurate and authentic electronic records for audits, business 
	continuity, and institutional memory.</p>

<p>David Sobel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center noted that student and faculty privacy is 
	another area of concern for universities. &#8220;As more and more information becomes available, 
	becomes accessible, there are more and more entities and individuals who are going to seek access 
	to that information. For that reason, the creators and maintainers of the information are increasingly 
	going to have less and less control over how that information is used.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The huge quantities of data being produced at universities and insecure information systems 
	expand the opportunities for unauthorized or inappropriate use of information. Unfortunately, recent 
	proposals for development of secure computing technologies focus more on rights management for software 
	and entertainment content than for business records and personal information&#8221;, said Rob Spindler, 
	co-chair of <acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym>&nbsp;2002: 
	Preservation and Access for Electronic College and University Records.</p>

<p>Colleges and universities across the nation must balance access and academic freedom with security. 
	Educational institutions work to actively defend their information systems, but like any large business 
	it is difficult to secure all the systems all the time, especially when sensitive content is retained 
	in desktop machines not managed by professionals. &#8220;We&#8217;ve turned our faculty members and our 
	graduate students into systems administrators in their copious spare time&#8220; said Lynch.</p>

<p>Representatives of several colleges and universities shared strategies for balancing security and access 
	at <acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym>&nbsp;2002. Now in its 
	fourth year, <acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym> has many related 
	presentations on its website at <a href="www.asu.edu/ecure">www.asu.edu/ecure</a>. The fifth 
	<acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym> conference will be held 
	March&nbsp;1&nbsp;-&nbsp;3&nbsp;2004, on the Arizona State University campus at Tempe,&nbsp;Arizona.</p>
