<h2>Press Release:<br />
<acronym title="Preservation and Access for Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym>
2004 Investigates Research Data, Patriot Act</h2>

<h4>September 2004</h4>

<p>There was good news and bad from presenters this year at ECURE 2004. The e-records conference provided updates on progress 
in data access and management, and bad news about new challenges â?? and now you can read about it and see it online! Video-streamed 
keynote speeches and presentation slides for the ECURE 2004 conference have been added to the ECURE Website Archives at 
<a href="/ecure/">www.asu.edu/ecure/</a>. ECURE 2004 was made possible by generous support from this yearâ??s sponsors, Adobe Systems, Inc., ProQuest 
Information and Learning, and the Coalition for Networked Information.</p> 
 
<p>The fifth ECURE conference hosted by Arizona State University provided attendees with an invigorating mix of theory, practice, 
insight, and the wisdom that can only be gained from experience. Warning flags were raised concerning government policies for 
data access in the post-9/11 environment. New inspiration was offered from the four corners of the continent and Antarctica. 
Top information professionals from the United States and Canada presented issues in preserving digital research records, risk 
management for Web resources, considerations in implementing a multi-university federated search system, the arguments for and 
against digital signature preservation, combining resources to build an integrated digital repository, and ILM storage challenges.</p>  
 
<p>In his pre-note address, David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, described "serious 
implications" of the PATRIOT Act for the privacy of student records and other university records systems.  The PATRIOT Act expands 
the government's ability and authority to obtain a wide range of information, and "limits the role of the courtsâ?¦in overseeing what 
the government is accessing and what it's doing with it," Sobel said.</p>

<p>The Electronic Privacy Information Center and other organizations are "trying to provide some measure of accountability into the 
process of government data collection," Sobel said. They have been frustrated by the gag order provision of the Patriot Act that 
makes it difficult "to have a real sense of how broadly this authority might be used," and by censorship of the information that 
has been released in response to their requests.</p> 
 
<p>Anti-war free speech at a student conference at Drake University prompted the serving of an investigative subpoena, which the school 
has been fighting, Sobel said. The CAPPS II system developed by the Transportation Security Administration enables computerized 
profiling and background checks of airline passengers, with no apparent provisions for appeal or error correction.</p>

<p>Clifford Lynch, Executive Director of the Coalition for Networked Information, presented an update and overview of emerging issues 
including data management requirements of funding agencies and the convergence of data management, recordkeeping, publishing and 
archiving. The National Institutes of Health have now established data management and public accessibility requirements for all 
grants exceeding $500,000, according to Lynch. "I think that what we're seeing here in some sense is a convergence of sort of 
traditional records concerns, the movement of a lot of the teaching and learning processes to digital form, the real transformation 
of how we're doing scholarshipâ?¦Itâ??s getting real hard to tell what's a record, what's research, what's teaching and learning."</p>
 
<p>A call for presentation proposals for ECURE 2005 is now open at <a href="/ecure/">www.asu.edu/ecure</a>. 
The next ECURE conference will expand the theme introduced in 2004, exploring the topic of academic research activity and its 
interaction with the access and management of electronic data and resources. Information on the call for presentations, which 
closes Nov. 1, 2004, can be found on the <a href="/ecure/proposals.html">ECURE Web site</a>.</p>
