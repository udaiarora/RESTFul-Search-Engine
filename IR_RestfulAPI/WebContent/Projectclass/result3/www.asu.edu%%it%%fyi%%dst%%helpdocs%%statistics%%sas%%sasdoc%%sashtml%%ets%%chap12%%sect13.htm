<H2>Forecasting Methods  </H2>
<P>This section explains the forecasting methods used by PROC FORECAST.
<P><H3><I>STEPAR Method</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxfor0069">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0068">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0071">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0070">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0073">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0072">&#13;</A>In the STEPAR method, PROC FORECAST first fits a time trend model to the
series and takes the difference between each value and the estimated trend.
(This process is called <I>detrending</I>.)
Then, the remaining variation is fit using an autoregressive model.
<P>The STEPAR method fits the autoregressive process to the residuals of
the trend model using a backwards-stepping method to select parameters.
Since the trend and autoregressive parameters are fit in sequence rather
than simultaneously, the parameter estimates are not optimal in a
statistical sense; however, the estimates are usually close to optimal,
and the method is computationally inexpensive.
<P><H4><I>The STEPAR Algorithm</I></H4>
The STEPAR method consists of the following computational steps:
<P><OL>
<LI> Fit the trend model as specified by the TREND= option using
ordinary least-squares regression. This step detrends the data.
The default trend model for the STEPAR method is TREND=2,
a linear trend model.
<LI> Take the residuals from step 1 and compute the autocovariances to the
number of lags specified by the NLAGS= option.
<LI> Regress the current values against the lags,
using the autocovariances from step 2 in a Yule-Walker framework.
Do not bring in any autoregressive parameter that is not significant
at the level specified by the SLENTRY= option.
(The default is SLENTRY=0.20.)  Do not bring in any autoregressive
parameter which results in a nonpositive-definite Toeplitz matrix.
<LI> Find the autoregressive parameter that is least significant.
If the significance level is greater than the SLSTAY= value,
remove the parameter from the model.
(The default is SLSTAY=0.05.)
Continue this process until only significant autoregressive parameters remain.
If the OUTEST= option is specified, write the estimates to the OUTEST= data set.
<LI> Generate the forecasts using the estimated model
and output to the OUT= data set.
Form the confidence limits by combining the trend variances with the
autoregressive variances.
</OL>
<P>Missing values are tolerated in the series;
the autocorrelations are estimated from the available data and
tapered if necessary.
<P>This method requires at least three passes through the data:
two passes to fit the model and a third pass to initialize
the autoregressive process and write to the output data set.
<P><H4><I>Default Value of the NLAGS= Option</I></H4>
If the NLAGS= option is not specified,
the default value of the NLAGS= option is chosen based
on the data frequency specified by the INTERVAL= option
and on the number of observations in the input data set,
if this can be determined in advance.
(PROC FORECAST cannot determine the number of input observations
before reading the data when a BY statement or a WHERE statement is used
or if the data are from a tape format SAS data set or external database.
The NLAGS= value must be fixed before the data are processed.)
<P>If the INTERVAL= option is specified,
the default NLAGS= value includes lags for up to three years plus one,
subject to the maximum of 13 lags or one third of the
number of observations in your data set, whichever is less.
If the number of observations in the input data set cannot be
determined, the maximum NLAGS= default value is 13.
If the INTERVAL= option is not specified, the default is NLAGS=13
or one-third the number of input observations, whichever is less.
<P>If the Toeplitz matrix formed by the autocovariance matrix at
a given step is not positive definite, the maximal
number of autoregressive lags is reduced.
<P>For example, for INTERVAL=QTR, the default is NLAGS=13
(that is, <SPAN CLASS="mathfont">4&times;3+1</SPAN>)
provided that there are at least 39 observations.
The NLAGS= option default is always at least 3.
<P><H3><I>EXPO Method</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxfor0075">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0074">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0076">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0077">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0078">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0079">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0080">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0081">&#13;</A>Exponential smoothing is used when the METHOD=EXPO option is specified.
The term <I>exponential smoothing</I> is derived from the
computational scheme developed by Brown and others
(Brown and Meyers 1961; Brown 1962).
Estimates are computed with updating formulas that are
developed across time series in a manner similar to smoothing.
<P>The EXPO method fits a trend model such that the most recent data are
weighted more heavily than data in the early part of the series.
The weight of an observation is a geometric (exponential) function of the
number of periods that the observation extends into the past relative
to the current period.  The weight function is
<P>
<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="76"
 SRC="images/foreq10.gif"
 ALT="w_{{\tau}}={\omega} (1-{\omega})^{t-{\tau}}"></DL>
<P>where <IMG WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/foreq11.gif"
 ALT="{\tau}"> is the observation number of the past observation,
<I>t</I> is the current observation number, and <IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/foreq12.gif"
 ALT="{\omega}"> is the
weighting constant specified with the WEIGHT= option.
<P>You specify the model with the TREND= option as follows:
<P><UL>
<LI> TREND=1 specifies single exponential smoothing
(a constant model)
<LI> TREND=2 specifies double exponential smoothing
(a linear trend model)
<LI> TREND=3 specifies triple exponential smoothing
(a quadratic trend model)
</UL>
<P><H4><I>Updating Equations</I></H4>
The single exponential smoothing operation is expressed by the formula
<P>
<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="74"
 SRC="images/foreq13.gif"
 ALT="S_{t}={\omega}x_{t}+(1-{\omega})S_{t-1}"></DL>
<P>where <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S</I><sub><I>t</I></sub></SPAN> is the smoothed value at the current period,
<I>t</I> is the time index of the current period, and
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>x</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN> is the current actual value of the series.
The smoothed value <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S</I><sub><I>t</I></sub></SPAN> is the forecast of
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>x</I><SUB><I>t</I>+1</SUB></SPAN> and is calculated as the smoothing constant <IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/foreq12.gif"
 ALT="{\omega}">
times the value of the series, <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>x</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>, in the current period
plus (<IMG WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/foreq14.gif"
 ALT="{1-{\omega}}">) times the previous smoothed value
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S</I><sub><I>t</I>-1</sub></SPAN>,
which is the forecast of <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>x</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN> computed at time <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>t</I>-1</SPAN>.
<P>Double and triple exponential smoothing are derived by
applying exponential smoothing to the smoothed series,
obtaining smoothed values as follows:
<P>
<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="82"
 SRC="images/foreq15.gif"
 ALT="S_{t}^{[2]}={\omega}S_{t}
+(1-{\omega}) S_{t-1}^{[2]}"></DL>

<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="82"

 ALT="S_{t}^{[3]}={\omega} S_{t}^{[2]}
+(1-{\omega}) S_{t-1}^{[3]}"></DL>
<P>Missing values after the start of the series are replaced with
one-step-ahead predicted values, and the predicted value is then
applied to the smoothing equations.
<P>The polynomial time trend parameters
CONSTANT, LINEAR, and QUAD in the OUTEST= data set
are computed from <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"> <I>S</I><SUB><I>T</I></SUB></SPAN>,
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"> <I>S</I><SUB><I>T</I></SUB><SUP>[2]</SUP></SPAN>,
and <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"> <I>S</I><SUB><I>T</I></SUB><SUP>[3]</SUP></SPAN>,
the final smoothed values at observation <I>T</I>,
the last observation used to fit the model.
In the OUTEST= data set, the values of
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"> <I>S</I><SUB><I>T</I></SUB></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"> <I>S<SUP>[2]</SUP></I><SUB><I>T</I></SUB></SPAN>,
and <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"> <I>S<SUP>[3]</SUP></I><SUB><I>T</I></SUB></SPAN>
are identified by _TYPE_=S1, _TYPE_=S2, and _TYPE_=S3, respectively.
<P><H4><I>Smoothing Weights</I></H4>
<I>Exponential smoothing forecasts</I> are forecasts
for an integrated moving-average process; however, the
weighting parameter is specified by the user rather than
estimated from the data.  Experience has shown that good
values for the WEIGHT= option are between 0.05 and 0.3.
As a general rule, smaller smoothing weights are appropriate for series
with a slowly changing trend,
while larger weights are appropriate for volatile series with
a rapidly changing trend.
If unspecified, the weight defaults to
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont">(1- .8<SUP>1/<I>trend</I></SUP>)</SPAN>,
where <I>trend</I> is the value of the TREND= option.
This produces defaults of WEIGHT=0.2 for TREND=1,
WEIGHT=0.10557 for TREND=2, and WEIGHT=0.07168 for TREND=3.
<P><H4><I>Confidence Limits</I></H4>
The confidence limits for exponential smoothing forecasts
are calculated as they would be for an exponentially weighted
time-trend regression,
using the simplifying assumption of an infinite number of observations.
The variance estimate is computed using the mean square of the
unweighted one-step-ahead forecast residuals.
<P>More detailed descriptions of the forecast computations
can be found in Montgomery and Johnson (1976) and Brown (1962).
<P><H3><I>Exponential Smoothing as an ARIMA Model</I></H3>
The traditional description of exponential smoothing given in the
preceding section is standard in most books on forecasting,
and so this traditional version is employed by PROC FORECAST.
<P>However, the standard exponential smoothing model is, in fact,
a special case of an ARIMA model (McKenzie 1984).
Single exponential smoothing corresponds to an ARIMA(0,1,1) model;
double exponential smoothing corresponds to an ARIMA(0,2,2) model; and
triple exponential smoothing corresponds to an ARIMA(0,3,3) model.
<P>The traditional exponential smoothing calculations can be viewed as
a simple and computationally inexpensive
method of forecasting the equivalent ARIMA model.
The exponential smoothing technique was developed in the 1960s
before computers were widely available and before ARIMA modeling
methods were developed.
<P>If you use exponential smoothing as a forecasting
method, you might consider using the ARIMA procedure to forecast the
equivalent ARIMA model as an alternative to the traditional version of
exponential smoothing used by PROC FORECAST.
The advantages of the ARIMA form are:
<P><UL>
<LI> The optimal smoothing weight is automatically computed as the
estimate of the moving average parameter of the ARIMA model.
<LI> For double exponential smoothing, the optimal pair of two smoothing
weights are computed. For triple exponential smoothing,
the optimal three smoothing weights are computed by the ARIMA method.
Most implementations of the traditional exponential smoothing
method (including PROC FORECAST) use the same smoothing weight
for each stage of smoothing.
<LI> The problem of setting the starting smoothed value is
automatically handled by the ARIMA method.
This is done in a statistically
optimal way when the maximum likelihood method is used.
<LI> The statistical estimates of the forecast confidence limits
have a sounder theoretical basis.
</UL>
<P>See <A HREF="../chap7/index.htm">Chapter 7, &#34;The ARIMA Procedure,&#34;</A> for information
on forecasting with ARIMA models.
<P>The Time Series Forecasting System provides for exponential
smoothing models and allows you to either specify or optimize 
the smoothing weights.  See <A HREF="../chap23/index.htm">Chapter 23, &#34;Getting Started with Time Series Forecasting,&#34;</A> for details.
<P><H3><I>WINTERS Method</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxfor0083">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0082">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0085">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0084">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0087">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0086">&#13;</A>The WINTERS method uses updating equations similar to
exponential smoothing to fit parameters for the model
<P>
<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="74"
 SRC="images/foreq17.gif"
 ALT="x_{t} = ( a + b t ) s(t) + {\epsilon}_{t}"></DL>
<P>where <I>a</I> and <I>b</I> are the trend parameters, and
the function <I>s</I>(<I>t</I>) selects the seasonal parameter
for the season corresponding to time <I>t</I>.
<P>The WINTERS method assumes that the series values are positive.
If negative or zero values are found in the series,
a warning is printed and the values are treated as missing.
<P>The preceding standard WINTERS model uses a linear trend.
However, PROC FORECAST can also fit a version of the WINTERS
method that uses a quadratic trend.
When TREND=3 is specified for METHOD=WINTERS,
PROC FORECAST fits the following model:
<P>
<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="76"
 SRC="images/foreq18.gif"
 ALT="x_{t} = ( a + b t + c t^2 ) s(t)+{\epsilon}_{t}"></DL>
<P>The quadratic trend version of the Winters method is often
unstable, and its use is not recommended.
<P>When TREND=1 is specified, the following constant trend version is fit:
<P>
<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="113" HEIGHT="74"
 SRC="images/foreq19.gif"
 ALT="x_{t} = a s(t) + {\epsilon}_{t}"></DL>
<P>The default for the WINTERS method is TREND=2,
which produces the standard linear trend model.
<P><H4><I>Seasonal Factors</I></H4>
The notation <I>s</I>(<I>t</I>) represents the selection of
the seasonal factor used for different time periods.
For example, if INTERVAL=DAY and SEASONS=MONTH, there
are 12 seasonal factors, one for each month in the year,
and the time index <I>t</I> is measured in days.
For any observation, <I>t</I> is determined by the ID variable
and <I>s</I>(<I>t</I>) selects the seasonal factor for the month
that <I>t</I> falls in. For example, if <I>t</I> is 9 February 1993
then <I>s</I>(<I>t</I>) is the seasonal parameter for February.
<P>When there are multiple seasons specified, <I>s</I>(<I>t</I>) is the
product of the parameters for the seasons.
For example, if SEASONS=(MONTH DAY), then <I>s</I>(<I>t</I>) is the
product of the seasonal parameter for the month corresponding to
the period <I>t</I>, and the seasonal parameter for the day of the
week corresponding to period <I>t</I>.
When the SEASONS= option is not specified, the seasonal
factors <I>s</I>(<I>t</I>) are not included in the model.
See the section &#34;Specifying Seasonality&#34;
later in this chapter for more information on specifying
multiple seasonal factors.
<P><H4><I>Updating Equations</I></H4>
This section shows the updating equations for the Winters method.
In the following formula,
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>x</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN> is the actual value of the series at time <I>t</I>;
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>a</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN> is the smoothed value of the series at time <I>t</I>;
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>b</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN> is the smoothed trend at time <I>t</I>;
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>c</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN> is the smoothed quadratic trend at time <I>t</I>;
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>s</I><SUB><I>t</I>-1</SUB>(<I>t</I>)</SPAN> selects the old value of the seasonal factor
corresponding to time <I>t</I> before the seasonal factors are updated.
<P>The estimates of the constant, linear, and quadratic
trend parameters are updated using the following equations:
<P>For TREND=3,
<P>

 ALT="a_{t}={\omega}_{1} \frac{x_{t}}{s_{t-1}(t)}
+(1-{\omega}_{1}) a_{t-1}"></DL>
<P>In this updating system, the trend polynomial is always centered
at the current period so that the intercept parameter of the
trend polynomial for predicted values at times after <I>t</I> is
always the updated intercept parameter <I>a</I><SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>.
The predicted value for <IMG WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="74"
 SRC="images/foreq26.gif"
 ALT="x_{t+{\tau}}=(a_{t}+b_{t}{\tau}) s_{t}(t+{\tau})"></DL>
<P>The seasonal parameters are updated when the season changes in the data,
using the mean of the ratios of the actual to the predicted values
for the season.
For example, if SEASONS=MONTH and INTERVAL=DAY, then,
when the observation for the first of February is encountered,
the seasonal parameter for January is updated using the formula
<P>
<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="373" HEIGHT="114"
 SRC="images/foreq27.gif"
 ALT="s_{t}(t-1)={\omega}_{3} \frac{1}{31} \sum_{i=t-31}^{t-1}{\frac{x_{i}}{a_{i} } } + (1-{\omega}_{3}) s_{t-1}(t-1)"></DL>
<P>where <I>t</I> is February 1 of the current year
and <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>s</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB>(<I>t</I>-1)</SPAN> is the seasonal parameter for January updated with the
data available at time <I>t</I>.
<P>When multiple seasons are used,
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>s</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB>(<I>t</I>)</SPAN> is a product of seasonal factors.
For example, if SEASONS=(MONTH DAY)
then <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>s</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB>(<I>t</I>)</SPAN> is the product of the seasonal factors for
the month and for the day of the week:
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>s</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB>(<I>t</I>) =  <I>s</I><SUP><I>m</I></SUP><SUB><I>t</I></SUB>(<I>t</I>) <I>s</I><SUP><I>d</I></SUP><SUB><I>t</I></SUB>(<I>t</I>)</SPAN>.
<P>The factor <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"> <I>s</I><SUP><I>m</I></SUP><SUB><I>t</I></SUB>(<I>t</I>)</SPAN> is updated at the
start of each month using the preceding formula,
and the factor <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"> <I>s</I><SUP><I>d</I></SUP><SUB><I>t</I></SUB>(<I>t</I>)</SPAN>
is updated at the start of each week using the following formula:
<P>
<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="359" HEIGHT="114"
 SRC="images/foreq28.gif"
 ALT="s^d_{t}(t-1)={\omega}_{3} \frac{1}7 \sum_{i=t-7}^{t-1}{\frac{x_{i}}{a_{i} } } + (1-{\omega}_{3})
 s^d_{t-1}(t-1)"></DL>
<P>Missing values after the start of the series are replaced with
one-step-ahead predicted values, and the predicted value is
substituted for <I>x</I><SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>i</I></SUB></SPAN> and
applied to the updating equations.
<P><H4><I>Normalization</I></H4>
The parameters are normalized so that the seasonal factors for
each cycle have a mean of 1.0.
This normalization is performed after each complete cycle
and at the end of the data.
Thus, if INTERVAL=MONTH and SEASONS=MONTH are specified, and a series begins
with a July value, then the seasonal factors for the series
are normalized at each observation for July and at the last observation
in the data set.
The normalization is performed by dividing each of the seasonal
parameters, and multiplying each of the trend parameters,
by the mean of the unnormalized seasonal parameters.
<P><H4><I>Smoothing Weights</I></H4>
The weight for updating the seasonal factors, <IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/foreq12.gif"
 ALT="{\omega}"><SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN>,
is given by the third value specified in the WEIGHT= option.
If the WEIGHT= option is not used,
then <IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/foreq12.gif"
 ALT="{\omega}"><SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB>3</SUB></SPAN> defaults to 0.25;
if the WEIGHT= option is used but does not specify a third value,
then <IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 SRC="images/foreq12.gif"
 ALT="{\omega}"><SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>.
The weight for updating the linear and quadratic trend parameters,
<IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/foreq12.gif"
 ALT="{\omega}"><SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN>,
is given by the second value specified in the WEIGHT= option;

then <IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/foreq12.gif"
 ALT="{\omega}"><SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB>2</SUB></SPAN> defaults to <IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/foreq12.gif"
 ALT="{\omega}"><SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>.
The updating weight for the constant parameter, <IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/foreq12.gif"
 ALT="{\omega}"><SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN>,
is given by the first value specified in the WEIGHT= option.
As a general rule, smaller smoothing weights are appropriate for series
with a slowly changing trend,
while larger weights are appropriate for volatile series with
a rapidly changing trend.
<P>If the WEIGHT= option is not used,
then <IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/foreq12.gif"
 ALT="{\omega}"><SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB>1</SUB></SPAN> defaults to (<SPAN CLASS="mathfont">1- .8<SUP>1/<I>trend</I></SUP></SPAN>),
where <I>trend</I> is the value of the TREND= option.
This produces defaults of WEIGHT=0.2 for TREND=1,
WEIGHT=0.10557 for TREND=2, and WEIGHT=0.07168 for TREND=3.
<P>The Time Series Forecasting System provides for generating
forecast models using Winters Method and allows you to
specify or optimize the weights.  See <A HREF="../chap23/index.htm">Chapter 23, &#34;Getting Started with Time Series Forecasting,&#34;</A>
for details.
<P><H4><I>Confidence Limits</I></H4>
A method for calculating exact forecast confidence limits for
the WINTERS method is not available.
Therefore, the approach taken in PROC FORECAST is to assume that the
true seasonal factors have small variability about a set of fixed
seasonal factors and that the remaining variation of the series
is small relative to the mean level of the series.

<P>The exponential smoothing confidence limits are based on
an approximation to a weighted regression model, whereas the preceding
Winters confidence limits are based on an approximation to
an ARIMA model.  You can use METHOD=WINTERS without the SEASONS=
option to do exponential smoothing and get confidence limits for
the EXPO forecasts based on the ARIMA model approximation.
These are generally more pessimistic than the weighted regression
confidence limits produced by METHOD=EXPO.

<P><H3><I>Choice of Weights for EXPO, WINTERS, and ADDWINTERS Methods</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxfor0099">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxfor0098">&#13;</A>For the EXPO, WINTERS, and ADDWINTERS methods, properly chosen smoothing
weights are of critical importance in generating reasonable results.
There are several factors to consider in choosing the weights.
<P>The noisier the data, the lower should be the weight given to the most
recent observation.
Another factor to consider is how quickly the mean of the time series is changing.
If the mean of the series is changing rapidly, relatively more weight
should be given to the most recent observation.
The more stable the series over time, the lower should be
the weight given to the most recent observation.
<P>Note that the smoothing weights should be set separately for each
series; weights that produce good results for one series may be poor
for another series. Since PROC FORECAST does not have a feature to
use different weights for different series, when forecasting multiple
series with the EXPO, WINTERS, or ADDWINTERS method it may be desirable
to use different PROC FORECAST steps with different WEIGHT= options.
<P>For the Winters method, many combinations of weight values
may produce unstable <I>noninvertible</I> models, even though all three
weights are between 0 and 1.
When the model is noninvertible, the forecasts depend strongly on
values in the distant past, and predictions are determined largely
by the starting values.
Unstable models usually produce poor forecasts.
The Winters model may be unstable even if the weights are optimally
chosen to minimize the in-sample MSE.
Refer to Archibald (1990) for a detailed discussion of the unstable region
of the parameter space of the Winters model.
<P>Optimal weights and forecasts for exponential smoothing models
can be computed using the ARIMA procedure.
For more information, see &#34;Exponential Smoothing as an ARIMA Model&#34;
earlier in this chapter.
<P>The ARIMA procedure can also be used to compute
optimal weights and forecasts for seasonal ARIMA models similar to the
Winters type methods.
In particular, an ARIMA(0,1,1)<SPAN CLASS="mathfont">&times;</SPAN>(0,1,1)S model may be a good alternative
to the additive version of the Winters method.
The ARIMA(0,1,1)<SPAN CLASS="mathfont">&times;</SPAN>(0,1,1)S model fit to the logarithms of the series
may be a good alternative to the multiplicative Winters method.
See <A HREF="../chap7/index.htm">Chapter 7, &#34;The ARIMA Procedure,&#34;</A> for information on forecasting with ARIMA models.
<P>The Time Series Forecasting System can be used to automatically
select an appropriate smoothing method as well as to optimize the 
smoothing weights.  See <A HREF="../chap23/index.htm">Chapter 23, &#34;Getting Started with Time Series Forecasting,&#34;</A> for more information.
<P><H3><I>Starting Values for EXPO, WINTERS, and ADDWINTERS Methods</I></H3>
The exponential smoothing method requires starting values
for the smoothed values <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S<SUb>0</SUb></I></SPAN>,
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S<SUp>[2]</SUp></I><sub>0</sub></SPAN>,
and <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S<SUp>[3]</SUp></I><sub>0</sub></SPAN>.
The Winters and additive Winters methods require starting values
for the trend coefficients and seasonal factors.
<P>By default, starting values for the trend parameters are computed
by a time-trend regression over the first few observations for the series.
Alternatively, you can specify the starting value for the trend
parameters with the ASTART=, BSTART=, and CSTART= options.
<P>The number of observations used in the time-trend regression for
starting values depends on the NSTART= option.
For METHOD=EXPO, NSTART= beginning values of the series
are used, and the coefficients of the time-trend regression are
then used to form the initial smoothed values
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S<SUb>0</SUb></I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S<SUp>[2]</SUp></I><sub>0</sub></SPAN>,
and <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S<SUp>[3]</SUp></I><sub>0</sub></SPAN>.
<P>For METHOD=WINTERS or METHOD=ADDWINTERS,
<I>n</I> complete seasonal cycles
are used to compute starting values for the trend parameter,
where <I>n</I> is the value of the NSTART= option.
For example, for monthly data the seasonal cycle is one year,
so NSTART=2 specifies that the first 24 observations
at the beginning of each series are used for the time trend regression
used to calculate starting values.
<P>The starting values for the seasonal factors for the WINTERS and ADDWINTERS
methods are computed from seasonal averages over the first few
complete seasonal cycles at the beginning of the series.
The number of seasonal cycles averaged to compute starting seasonal factors
is controlled by the NSSTART= option.
For example, for monthly data with SEASONS=12 or SEASONS=MONTH,
the first <I>n</I> January values are averaged to get
the starting value for the January seasonal parameter,
where <I>n</I> is the value of the NSSTART= option.
<P>The <I>s</I><SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB>0</SUB></SPAN>(<I>i</I>) seasonal parameters
are set to the ratio (for WINTERS) or difference (for ADDWINTERS)
of the mean for the season to the overall mean for the observations
used to compute seasonal starting values.
<P>For example, if METHOD=WINTERS, INTERVAL=DAY, SEASON=(MONTH DAY),
and NSTART=2 (the default),
the initial seasonal parameter for January is
the ratio of the mean value over days in the first two Januarys
after the start of the series (that is, after the first nonmissing value),
to the mean value for all days read for initialization of the seasonal factors.
Likewise, the initial factor for Sundays is the ratio of the
mean value for Sundays to the mean of all days read.
<P>For the ASTART=, BSTART=, and CSTART= options,
the values specified are associated with the variables
in the VAR statement in the order in which the variables are listed
(the first value with the first variable,
the second value with the second variable, and so on).
If there are fewer values than variables, default starting
values are used for the later variables.
If there are more values than variables, the extra values are ignored.
