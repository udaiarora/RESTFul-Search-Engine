<p>This two volume work is divided into Spring flowers in volume 1 and
summer flowers in volume two.&nbsp; Each flower has a written description
on the left-hand page with its illustration on the right-hand page.&nbsp;
The descriptions give information about the meaning of the name, the parts
of the flower, size and color of blooms, and calendar month in which the
flower blooms.&nbsp; The preface to this edition notes that the first volume
"contains a notable collection of engravings of spring flowers which are
now established favourites, but many of which had only been introduced
towards the close of the sixteenth and during the early years of the seventeenth
century."&nbsp; In order to explain this statement, la history of the tulip
is given, noting that nothing is know of its
<br>history before 1550.
