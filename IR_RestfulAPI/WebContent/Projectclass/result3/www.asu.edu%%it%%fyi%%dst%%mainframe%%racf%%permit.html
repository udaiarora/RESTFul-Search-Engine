HELP PERMIT

FUNCTION
          5740-XXH  (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 1987

  The PERMIT command authorizes specific users or groups to a resource
  profile.  It also has the capability of copying authorization
  information from one profile to another.

  In order to change the authorization to a profile:
        - You must be the owner of the resource, have the SPECIAL
          attribute, or for data sets only, your userid must match the
          first-level qualifier of the data set, or
        - You must have group-SPECIAL authority in the group and (1)
          the resource must be owned by the group or by a user owned
          by the group or (2) the resource's high-level qualifier must
          be the group name or a userid owned by the group, or
    (for discrete profiles only)
        - If you are explicitly authorized to the resource you must
          have ALTER authority, or
        - If your current connect group is explicitly authorized to
          the resource, the authority must be ALTER, or
        - The universal access must be ALTER.

  If the from keyword is specified, the same authorization rules apply
  to that resource.

   REQUIRED - profile-name-1
   DEFAULTS - ACCESS(READ) CLASS(DATASET) FCLASS(value from class
              keyword)
   ALIAS    - PE
   NOTES    - The ACCESS and DELETE keywords are ignored if the ID
              keyword is not specified.


OPERANDS

  profile-name-1 - The name of the profile whose access list is to be
                         modified.

  CLASS(profile-name-1-class)
      The name of the class to which profile-name-1 belongs (e.g.,
      DATASET, DASDVOL, TAPEVOL, TERMINAL).

  VOLUME(volume-serial)
      The volume serial on which the data set to be changed (or its
      VSAM catalog) resides.  This operand is required only if more
      than one data set with the same name has been defined to RACF,
      and is ignored if class is not data set, or if profile-name-1 is
      a generic name.

  GENERIC
      Indicates that profile-name-1 should be treated as a generic
      name, even if it does not contain any generic characters.

  ID(name...)
      The list of ids which have their authorizations added to,
      altered in, or deleted from the access list.

  ACCESS(ALTER | CONTROL | UPDATE | READ | NONE)
      Specifies the access to be associated with the names specified
      in the ID keyword.

      The valid subfields are:

            ALTER   - ALTER access authority
            CONTROL - CONTROL access authority
            UPDATE  - UPDATE access authority
            READ    - READ access authority
            NONE    - No access authority

  DELETE
      The names specified in the ID keyword will no longer be
      authorized to the data set.  If WHEN is also specified, the
      names specified on the ID keyword will be deleted from the
      conditional access list, rather than the normal access list.  An
      asterisk (*) may be only specified together with DELETE (above).

  RESET(STANDARD | WHEN | ALL)
      Specifies that RACF is to delete one or if program-name (below)
      is specified as *, all program entries will be deleted.

  WHEN(PROGRAM(program-name...|*))
      Specifies that the indicated access authority should only apply
      to the given users or groups, when executing one of the
      specified programs.  When specified together with delete, this
      operand indicates that entries are to be deleted from the access
      list.  An asterisk may only be specified together with DELETE
      (above).

  RESET(STANDARD/WHEN/ALL)
      Specifies that RACF is to delete one or both of the profile's
      access lists.  If RESET or RESET(ALL) is specified, both the
      standard and the conditional access lists are deleted.  If
      RESET(STANDARD) is specified, only the STANDARD access list is
      deleted.  If RESET(WHEN) is specified, only the conditional
      access list is deleted.

  FROM(profile-name-2)
      The name of a profile whose access list is to be copied to
      profile-name-1.

  FCLASS(profile-name-2-class)
      The class to which profile-name-2 belongs (e.g., DATASET,
      DASDVOL, TAPEVOL, TERMINAL).

  FVOLUME(volume-serial)
      The volume serial on which the data set specified in the from
      keyword (or its VSAM catalog) resides.  This operand is required
      only if more than one data set with the same name has been
      defined to RACF, and it is ignored if FCLASS is not DATASET, or
      if profile-name-2 is a generic name.

  FGENERIC
      Indicates that profile-name-2 should be treated as a generic
      name, even if it does not contain any generic characters.

  ICH06001I name ALREADY AUTHORIZED TO RESOURCE - ACCESS UNCHANGED

            Explanation:  The indicated name (userid or group name) in
            the FROM resource's access list is already on the access
            list of the TO resource.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            name in the FROM resource's access list.

  ICH06002I name NOT AUTHORIZED, DELETE IGNORED

            Explanation:  The indicated name (userid or group name) is
            not on the access list of the specified resource and the
            delete is ignored.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            option.

  ICH06003I NOT AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE PERMIT

            Explanation:  You are not defined to RACF and cannot issue
            the PERMIT command, or RACF is not active.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH06004I entity-name NOT DEFINED TO RACF

            Explanation:  The specified resource name (entity-name) is
            not defined to RACF.

  ICH06005I COMMAND ENDED DUE TO ERROR

            Explanation:  A RACF manager error occurred.  This message
            is accompanied by a message explaining the error.

  ICH06006I NOT AUTHORIZED TO entity-name

            Explanation:  You are not authorized to alter or copy the
            access list of the resource indicated by entity-name.

  ICH06007I name NOT DEFINED TO RACF

            Explanation:  The indicated name (userid or group name) is
            not defined to RACF and cannot be authorized access to the
            resource.

            System Action:  Command processing continues with the next
            name specified on the command.

  ICH06008I INSTALLATION EXIT FAILED PERMIT REQUEST FOR data-set-name

            Explanation:  The command preprocessing exit routine
            ICHCNX00 issued a return code of 4, indicating that RACF
            should fail the PERMIT request for the data set indicated
            in the message.

            System Action:  If the command attempted to modify the
            access list of the data set, the command terminates.

            If the command attempted to copy the access list of the
            data set (whose profile is specified on the FROM operand),
            only processing of the PERMIT command associated with the
            ID operand is performed.

            User Response:  Report this message to the system
            programmer.

  ICH06009I RESET OPTION IGNORED, CONFLICTS WITH DELETE REQUEST

            Explanation:  Both the DELETE and the RESET options were
            specified.

            System Action:  RACF accepts the DELETE option and ignores
            the RESET option.

  ICH06010I (GENERIC | FGENERIC) INVALID, GENERIC COMMAND PROCESSING
            IS INACTIVE&gt;

            Explanation:  Because the generic command processing
            facility is inactive, the GENERIC and FGENERIC operands
            are invalid.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH06011I RACLISTED PROFILES FOR class-name WILL NOT REFLECT THE
            UPDATE(S) UNTIL A SETROPTS REFRESH IS ISSUED

            Explanation:  The changes to the profiles will not become
            effective until the SETROPTS command is issued with the
            REFRESH and RACLIST operands.
