<p>William Turner is often called the Father of English Botany, because
his was the first original botanical work in English to have a scientific
basis.&nbsp; All previous English botanical works were based on European
plants exclusively.&nbsp; To remedy this, Turner's first publication in
1538, Libellus de re herbaria novus (The New Little Book about Plants)
described plants from Northumberland which had never before been mentioned
in any botanical texts.&nbsp; Because Turner refused to accept the teachings
of the Church of England and became a vocal spokesman for the Reformation,
he was jailed for two years.&nbsp; Later he was exiled to the Continent
and all his published works were destroyed.&nbsp; He made the most of his
time spent in exile, meeting with botanists in Europe as he travelled,
and gathering botanical specimens.&nbsp; Following the death of Henry VIII
he returned to England and was appointed physician and chaplain to the
Lord Protector Edward Duke of Somerset.&nbsp; He published the first part
of his herbal in 1551, dedicating it to the Duke.&nbsp; When Edward VI
died, Mary I, a Catholic, became Queen.&nbsp; She had no tolerance for
those sympathetic to the Reformation and once again Turner's books were
banned.&nbsp; As a result, complete copies of the first part of Turner's
New Herball, issued separately, are almost never found; most of them were
destroyed.&nbsp; When Turner was exiled again, he continued his study of
European plants while preparing the second part of his herbal.&nbsp; After
five years in exile he was once again able to return to the English court.&nbsp;
He published the second part of his herbal in Cologne, in 1562, rather
than in England, partly because he no longer trusted the English, and partly
because Birckman, his publisher in Cologne, had access to the woodcuts
used by Fuchs.&nbsp; Turner finished part three of his herbal only a few
months before his death in 1568.&nbsp; Turner describes more than 200 species
native to England, thereby adding plants "whereof is no mention made neither
of ye old Grecianes nor Latines."&nbsp; The arrangement of the herbal is
alphabetical, under each plant's Latin name, without any attempt to show
relationships.
