Want to learn SAS Software but you don't know where to start?  This        friendly easy-to-read guide gently introduces you to the most commonly
used features of SAS software plus a whole lot more!  Topics cover the     gamut of Base SAS concepts, an introduction to SAS/STAT, and getting
your data into SAS (including PROC IMPORT and PROC EXPORT).  You'll find   a generous amount of information addressing:  basic SAS concepts (such
as DATA and PROC steps); using the SAS windowing environment; working      with permanent and temporary SAS data sets; inputting, and reading data;
modifying data; introduction to the Output Delivery System (ODS) which     enables you to generate HTML files for viewing with an internet browser;
introduction to macros; debugging SAS programs (including the DATA step    debugger); and appendices to help programmers of other software
languages become comfortable with the SAS programming language.  Each      topic is divided into a easy-to-use self-contained two-page layout
complete with examples and graphics. This format enables new users to      get up and running quickly, while the examples allow you to type in the
program and see them work!  More seasoned programmers will find this       guide a useful reference to have on hand.
