Finally... a book addressing the various needs, concepts and approaches    for SAS users who work with meta-analytic procedures!  Wang and Bushman
introduce the reader to the important concepts in meta-analysis and how    to use SAS software for this specific type of analysis.  The authors
thoroughly describe how meta-analysis can be used in "data-mining"         projects to discover meaningful relations among variables in a
collection of studies. In addition, the following concepts are covered     in detail:  how to present your results in graphical format, how to
combine effect-size estimates based on categorical and continuous data,    vote-counting procedures to show the statistical significance of
results, how to combine effect-size estimates and vote-counts, how to      deal with fixed- and random-effects models, how to combine dependent or
correlated effect-size estimates using multivariate procedures, and how    to report the results and conduct the data analysis portion of a
meta-analysis.
