<font size=+1><b>Graduate Advisement</b></font>

<p>
Supportive, accurate advisement is essential to a successful graduate experience.  The Division of Graduate Studies maintains an advising office to serve all graduate students, but especially those who pursue nondegree studies. Services of the Division of Graduate Studies Advising Office complement and reinforce advisement provided by faculty and staff advisors in academic areas. Students may meet with an advisor to discuss personal, academic, and career goals, to explore opportunities available in academic programs, or to gain information about university policies, procedures, and services.

<p>
Advisors are ready to discuss the admission requirements of the Division of Graduate Studies and particular degree programs, and often refer students to appropriate academic advisors.  Division of Graduate Studies advisors can also help students make better use of ASU&#146;s many resources, acquainting them with various campus services and programs.

<p>
Nondegree students are especially encouraged to visit the Division of Graduate Studies Advising Office to learn more about opportunities and resources available to them at ASU.  Division of Graduate Studies advisors can also direct nondegree students to <a href="acd002.html#facultymember" target="New">faculty members</a> who can help them with course selection and registration.

<p>
To meet the needs of graduate students who find it difficult to reach campus during business hours, the office is open until 6:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday of the academic year.  It is best to schedule an appointment, but advisors also see students who drop by, as appointments allow.

<p>
<b>Location and Telephone</b>

<p>
The Division of Graduate Studies Advising Office is located in the central lobby of Wilson Hall and can be reached at 480/965&#150;3521.
