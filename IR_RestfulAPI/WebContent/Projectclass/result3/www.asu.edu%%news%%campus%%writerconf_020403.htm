      <h2>Conference shows Arizona's writing depth </h2>
      <p>Phoenix is a magical place for writers, having in one place the introspective 
        mysticism of the desert, the energy of the city, the rugged individualism 
        of the west and the quirkiness of a largely immigrant population. It's 
        all material for the book that so many people here seem to want to write.</p>
      <p>And write they do, but after you have written, what do you do with it? 
        It's a question most, if not all writers have at some point in their career.</p>
      <p>"What Phoenix has needed is a world-class writer's conference," said 
        novelist and Arizona State University Professor of Creative Writing Jewell 
        Parker Rhodes. "While there has been a lot of attention given locally 
        to readers, to people who love literature, there has been less public 
        attention given to creating a major place for people who want to become 
        better writers - and for those who want to become published writers -- 
        to come together. Arizona's writers are ready for an annual professional 
        meeting. "</p>
      <p>So, at the urging of Liberal Arts and Sciences Dean David Young, she 
        started one. After a little more than a year of planning, ASU will host 
        the state's first full fledged conference, "Desert Nights, Rising Stars," 
        March 13-15, 2003 at the Wyndham Buttes Resort.</p>
      <p>The conference will feature a faculty of 39 distinguished writers and 
        literary figures, covering the genres of fiction, non-fiction and poetry. 
        It will also offer forums with experts from the world of literary publishing, 
        including notable editors, publishers and agents. Though the conference 
        faculty were recruited nationally, Rhodes discovered later that a large 
        number of them had strong Phoenix and Arizona connections.</p>
      <p>"We set out to find a diverse and distinguished group of writers in order 
        to bring the national writing world to Phoenix. I was surprised myself 
        to discover how many great writers out there had already been here," said 
        Rhodes.</p>
      <p>"In the world of writing, there's always been this East Coast bias. That's 
        what people generally think of when they think of great places to go to 
        learn to write. </p>
      <p>"We've been a great place to do that for a long time, but the world still 
        doesn't know about it. It's time to tell them - we need to let the world 
        know what we've grown in our back yard. Phoenix is a city that has come 
        of age. We are bursting with energy; we are -- and always have been - 
        a magnet for creative writers, and so are other cities in the state. We 
        have an impressive number of the nation's top-ranked creative writers 
        here in one small state."</p>
      <p>The conference faculty include virtually all of the distinguished fiction 
        writers and poets from the teaching faculty of ASU's highly ranked creative 
        writing program, and also a host of well-known national names in poetry, 
        non-fiction, and almost all genres of commercial fiction. (see list and 
        biographies at: &lt;http://www.asu.edu/clas/english/creativewriting/conference/participants/&gt; 
        )</p>
      <p>Conference session topics include roundtables on agents, editors, publishing, 
        and literary career development. Classes will cover a broad range of topics 
        in all genres, including character and story development, mystery and 
        suspense fiction, historical fiction, biography, travel literature, personal 
        development literature, and several topics in poetry.</p>
      <p>"This conference will provide emerging writers with access to the experience 
        and artistic advice of some established writers, who are also very talented 
        teachers, but it's not just about learning the skill of writing," noted 
        Rhodes. "This is also a rare opportunity for emerging writers to have 
        access to publishers, to agents, and to editors who can help people make 
        the dream of being a writer come true."</p>
      <p>The registration fee for Desert Nights, Rising Stars is $275, including 
        all classes, panels, forums, readings, and breakfast and lunch meals, 
        but not including airfare or accommodations. A limited number of scholarships 
        are available for high school students. Call 480-965-0051 for more information, 
        to order a conference brochure, or email clasevents@asu.edu &lt;mailto:clasevents@asu.edu&gt;.
