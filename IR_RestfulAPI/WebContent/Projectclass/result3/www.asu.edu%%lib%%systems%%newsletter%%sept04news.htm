            LIST's Newsletter<br>
            September, 2004 </p>
          <div align="left"> 
            <h3><br>
              After-hours System Support</h3>
            <p> Now that the Libraries are open 24 hours a day, five days a week, 
              technical issues such as problems connecting to databases may get 
              noticed at all hours of the night. Since LIST was not funded to 
              provide 24-hour support to coincide with the new library hours, 
              and is not staffed to do so, we would appreciate it if everyone 
              would continue to report system problems of this kind to the SOS 
              desk at 5-9093. After the hours that the desk is staffed, please 
              leave a message and we&#8217;ll address the problem as soon as possible 
              -- which most often will be first thing in the morning. True systems 
              emergencies are very rare, and when they do occur they generate 
              automatic notifications to the appropriate staff member via pagers 
              24/7.</p>
            <h3>System Outage to Affect Libraries</h3>
            <p> On Saturday, October 16, 2004, IT will be upgrading equipment 
              in the ECA and ECB computer rooms. The ASU Library Catalog and the 
              Video Streaming servers are housed in the ECA computer room. These 
              systems will go down at 6:00PM on Saturday October 16, and are expected 
              to be back online by midnight.</p>
            <p>The following functions will be offline from 6:00PM to midnight:<br>
              &middot; Online Catalog<br>
              &middot; Electronic Journals and Indexes <br>
              &middot; My Account<br>
              &middot; All Staff functions (Circulation, Tech Services, etc.)<br>

                  <p>The public workstations&#8217; printing dialog was confusing 
                    many patrons by requesting a user name and password. This 
                    has now been improved so as to inform the patron that they 
                    simply need to invent a name and (if desired) a password for 
                    their job, as shown at right.</p></td>
