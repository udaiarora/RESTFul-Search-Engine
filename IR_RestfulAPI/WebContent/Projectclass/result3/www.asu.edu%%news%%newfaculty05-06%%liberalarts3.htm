<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ian Miller<br>
</strong><em>Assistant Professor, Department of History</em><br>
Dr. Miller received his doctorate in 2004 from Columbia University in modern Japanese history. His research examines the social construction of modernity at Japan&rsquo;s first zoological garden that opened in 1882. He studies the interaction of government officials, scientists, publishers, and patrons that transformed the artificial world of the zoo into the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; foil of modern metropolitan life in Japan . By the 1930s, millions streamed into the zoo to participate in the pageantry of fascist expansionism. The symbolic power of the zoo was deployed in the service of diverse political, social scientific, and diplomatic ends as Japan modernized. His approach is comparative and interdisciplinary. He breaks down such essentialized dichotomies as nature and culture, ideology and practice, and science and society. His study of modern Japanese history is complemented by work in Japanese literature, Chinese history, and Korean history. His teaching interests include colonialism in East Asia , Japanese popular culture, Japanese intellectual history, and comparative environmental history. </p>
