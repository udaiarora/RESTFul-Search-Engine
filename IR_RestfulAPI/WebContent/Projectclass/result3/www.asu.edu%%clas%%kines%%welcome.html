      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>What is Kinesiology?</b> 
		Kinesiology is the study of all of the body?s organ systems in response 
		to movement, muscle contraction or exercise, and exercise training.&nbsp; 
		Kinesiology involves research into the control of movement by the 
		central nervous system, including how the CNS develops (motor behavior), 
		the molecular, biochemical, and physiological responses of all the 
		body?s organ systems to exercise and exercise training (exercise 
		physiology), and the interaction of the mind and body related to health 
		and exercise (exercise/health psychology).</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The Department of Kinesiology 
		has undergone many changes since it joined the Division of Natural 
		Sciences and Mathematics in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. 
		This transformation involves a significant realignment of our mission. 
		This realignment is consistent with the transformation of Arizona State 
		University into a research institution with important components of both 
		graduate and undergraduate education.&nbsp; The Mission of the Department of 
		Kinesiology is:</font></p>
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">1.&nbsp; To promote the creation of new knowledge of the how all of the 
		organ systems of the human body<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial">respond to movement, exercise or muscle contraction, 
		or exercise training.</font><p><font face="Arial">2.&nbsp; To use this new knowledge to create an invigorating learning 
		environment for undergraduate and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; graduate students.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">3.&nbsp; Through 
		education and research to better the health of society.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>Research</b> - There is a 
		strong interdisciplinary research emphasis on the ASU campus, and the 
		Kinesiology Department is no exception. Faculty in the Department 
		collaborate with faculty from Bioengineering, the School of Life 
		Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and the BioDesign Institute.&nbsp; 
		Within the Phoenix metropolitan area, other collaborations include those 
		at the Carl Hayden VA Hospital, BannerHealth, Barrow Neurological 
		Institute, and the Mayo Clinic. In addition, many of the faculty have 
		active collaboration with other researchers in the US and the 
		international community. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>The Learning Experience &amp; 
		Teaching</b> -The commitment to excellence in learning and teaching 
		extends from undergraduates to highly selected graduate students and 
		postdoctoral fellows, and from freshman advisement to graduate 
		mentoring.&nbsp; The emphasis on research provides numerous opportunities for 
		students at all levels to learn in the laboratory, and cutting edge 
		knowledge produced by our faculty is translated directly into an 
		enhanced learning environment. The Department recognizes annually 
		outstanding students with a series of awards.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>The Faculty</b> - The 
		Department is committed to a faculty who are nationally and 
		internationally recognized and honored for the creation of scientific 
		knowledge. We invite you to visit the web pages of the individual 
		faculty members to learn more about their research and teaching 
		activities.</font></td>
