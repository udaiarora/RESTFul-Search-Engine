        at ASU from March 31 through April 3. All concerts are free and open

        office for more information, 480-965-5348.</p>
      <p>Jazz Week, has been held every spring for more than 20 years. It is
        sponsored by the Herberger College School of Music's Jazz Studies Program.
        The annual, multi-day event is coordinated by Professor of Music Chuck
        Marohnic, who is director of the program. &quot;Jazzweek is a chance
        for the School of Music and the Jazz Studies Program to focus on jazz,
        America's true art form, by offering a week of free nightly concerts
        to the student body and community at large,&quot; says Marohnic. &quot;We
        do our best to bring in some of the biggest and brightest stars in the
        world to interact with our music students through performances with their
        ensembles, daily master classes, clinics and workshops.</p>
      <p>&quot;The benefit to the students is incalculable,&quot; notes Marohnic. &quot;Students
        get a chance to 'hang out' and experience these wonderful artists on
        a personal level. They see them as people and also as fellow musicians,
        not unapproachable 'stars'. The impressions left on the students are
        deep and they are often left with life long memories. The benefits to
        the Phoenix community are tremendous. People get to hear musicians that
        they might never get to hear. This is attributed to the simple fact that
        we concentrate on the artist and their work, not their commercial appeal.&quot;</p>
      <p>Clare Fischer, a native of Durand, Michigan, is heralded as &quot;an
        uncommonly versatile musician, a master with many muses.&quot; Trained
        in the classics, inspired by jazz artists, healed by the rhythms of Latin
        and Brazilian music, his eclectic sound finds expression in every chart
        and instrument he touches. A veteran studio musician and a composer of
        rare quality, Fischer began his studies in high school. After receiving
        his master's degree in composition from Michigan State University, he
        traveled extensively with &quot;The Hi-Lo's&quot; as pianist-conductor
        for five years. About the same time, his musical ascension began with
        his critically acclaimed arrangements for Dizzy Gillespie's &quot;A Portrait
        of Duke Ellington.&quot; Fischer's influences, absorbed along the way,
        are as distinct as his music: Stravinsky and Shostakovich, Bartok and
        Berg, Dutilleux, boogie-woogie pianist Meade Lux Lewis, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole,
        Duke Ellington, Bud Powell and early Lee Konitz - Fischer's self-expression
        knows no boundaries. &quot;I relate to everything,&quot; he explains. &quot;I'm
        not just jazz, Latin, or classical. I really am a fusion of all of those,
        not today's fusion, but my fusion.&quot;</p>
      <p>In 1983, classical concert artist Richard Stoltzman commissioned Fischer
        to write a symphonic work using Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn themes.
        The resulting composition, &quot;The Duke, Swee'pea and Me,&quot; features
        Stoltzman on clarinet, and is performed with symphony orchestras around
        the world. More recently Fischer was commissioned by Stoltzman to write
        a &quot;Sonatine for Clarinet and Piano&quot; in three movements, which
        he has recorded with RCA on his album, American Clarinet, and is being
        published by Advance Music in Germany. In 1986, Fischer won his second
        Grammy Award - this one for his album, Free Fall, the first having been
        won in 1981 for his album, Salsa Picante plus 2 + 2. Since that time
        he has spent more time as a jazz educator, performing solo piano concerts
        and conducting clinics and master classes in universities and music conservatories
        in Scandinavia, Europe and throughout the U.S. In the last few years,
        Fischer has appeared in Paris, Finland, Norway and Germany with the WDR
        Big Band, in Holland with the Metropole Orchestra, in Austria at the
        Vienna Konzerthaus and in Mexico City at the Ollin Yol&iacute;tzli Concert
        Hall in a concert commemorating the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim on
        the anniversary of his death in December 1996. In October 1998, Fischer
        performed at the Choro Festival with H&eacute;lio Delmiro in S&aacute;o
        Paulo, Brazil and returned in July 2000 for a three-city tour in that
        country with Delmiro. In May 2001, Fischer completed a European tour
        teaching master classes and performing solo piano concerts in four countries.</p>
      <p>In addition to Dizzie Gillespie, Fischer has written for Cal Tjader,
        George Shearing, Diane Schuur, Natalie Cole, Chaka Khan and Rufus, The
        Jacksons, Earl Klugh, Prince, Robert Palmer, Paul McCartney, Michael
        Jackson, Spike Lee, Jo&atilde;o Gilberto, Paula Abdul, and most recently
        Brian McKnight, Regina Belle, J. Spencer, Norman Whitfield, Branford
        Marsalis, Tori Amos, Terry Trotter, the French group - &quot;Charts,&quot; a
        Japanese group - &quot;Sing Like Talking,&quot; Vanessa Williams, Brandy,
        Tony! Toni! Ton&eacute;! and many others. Since beginning his professional
        career, Fischer has recorded more 45 albums as leader and has arranged,
        composed and/or played on another 100 plus albums for other recording
        artists. His discography reads like a &quot;Who's Who&quot; of the recording
        industry. Recent releases include Clare Fischer's Jazz Corps, a big band
        album made up of 20 brass and six woodwinds, plus rhythm; and Symbiosis,
        recorded with H&eacute;lio Delmiro on unamplified Brazilian guitar and
        Fischer on digital piano. In January 2001, he produced his first classical
        CD, After the Rain, made up entirely of his own symphonic works. In December
        1999, the Michigan State University School of Music conferred an Honorary
        Doctorate of Fine Arts Degree on Fischer in recognition of his &quot;creativity
        and excellence as a jazz composer, arranger and performer.&quot;</p>
      <p>Gary Foster is a graduate of Kansas University. He lives in Los Angeles
        where he is a freelance musician performing on clarinet, saxophone and
        flute. He has performed and recorded with jazz groups led by Clare Fischer,
        Warne Marsh, Cal Tjader, Shelly Manne, Moacir Santos and Poncho Sanchez.
        He can be heard on Toni Tennille's More Than You Know and All of Me,
        the Broadway Albums of Barbara Streisand, Mel Torme's Reunion and Live

        recent recordings are with Michael Feinstein, Rosemary Clooney, Diane
        Schuur, Melissa Manchester, Joao Gilberto, Johnny Mathis, Barry Manilow,
        Michael Legrand, Milt Jackson, Kenny Rogers, Dionne Warwick and Manhattan

        and Grand Cru Clas&eacute; (Revelation), Imagination and Beautiful Friendship
        (RCA Japan), Warne Marsh Meets Gary Foster (Toshiba EMI) and Starbright-Duo
        and Whose Woods Are These? with Clare Fischer (Discovery). Most recent

        Alan Broadbent on Concord Jazz. White Heat and One From the Heart are
        with the Jazz at the Movies Band on Discovery.</p>
      <p>He has received the Most Valuable Player award for woodwind doubling
        from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Since 1984
        he has been the Rose Ann Millsap visiting professor at the University
        of Missouri at Kansas City. Foster was a member of the television orchestras
        for Matlock, Diagnosis Murder, Love and War, Murder She Wrote, Perry
        Mason and The Simpsons. Motion picture soundtracks on which he played
