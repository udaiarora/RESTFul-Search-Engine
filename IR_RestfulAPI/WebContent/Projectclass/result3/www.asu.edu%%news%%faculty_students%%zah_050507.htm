          <h2>ASU pays tribute to Zah&rsquo;s advocacy for Native Americans </h2>
          <p>Peterson Zah, who is considered one of the 100 most important Native Americans in the last century and a key leader in Native American government and education, will receive an honorary degree from ASU on May 12. </p>
          <p align="left"> Amid the dignified pageantry of a procession of more than two dozen tribal leaders from around the nation, the former president of the Navajo Nation will be draped with a hand-woven leadership blanket after receiving the honorary doctorate from ASU President Michael Crow. </p>
          <p align="left"> The ceremony will be part of ASU&rsquo;s spring commencement at 10 a.m. in Wells Fargo Arena. </p>
          <p align="left"> Zah was elected the first president of the Navajo Nation, the largest tribe in the United States, in 1990. Earlier he had been chairman of the Navajo Tribal Council, leading the movement to restructure and modernize their governmental system. Throughout his career he has made education his first priority. </p>
          <p align="left"> <img src="facstudents_images/zah-horse.jpg" width="288" height="283" align="right">As an adviser to the ASU President on American Indian Affairs for 10 years, he has helped double the university&rsquo;s Native American student population from 672 to 1,237 and increase retention from 43 percent to 78 percent, among the highest of any major college or university in the country. Last fall he received a lifetime achievement award from the National Indian Education Association. </p>
          <p align="left"> &ldquo;Peterson Zah is the living national treasure of the Navajo Nation, a senior statesman to all Native Americans and one of </p>
          <p> Arizona &rsquo;s most prominent citizens,&rdquo; Crow says. &ldquo;He is also one of ASU&rsquo;s most distinguished alumni.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Zah&rsquo;s respect for the value of education is rooted in his own story. Born in 1937 and raised in the middle of the Navajo Reservation at remote Low Mountain , Ariz. , he had little contact with the outside world in his early years. But when Navajo soldiers returned after World War II with new ideas, he resolved to get an education and return to help his people.</p>
          <p> &ldquo;In my family there were eight of us, but my mother always stressed the importance of education,&rdquo; Zah says. &ldquo;She told us she wanted us to be able to function in both societies, but never forget we were Navajo. She said appreciating our own heritage would help us understand the other side.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> He left his home and family in 1953 to attend the Phoenix Indian School , later enrolling at Phoenix Community College and finally ASU, where he earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in education in 1963. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;I was one of only about 15 Native American students at ASU back then,&rdquo; Zah says. &ldquo;At that time higher education was only a dream for most Native Americans, but I knew there had to be more who wanted to pursue education. So we went out and recruited, and ASU jumped to 21 the following year. That was the beginning of my career in persuading Native Americans to go to college.&rdquo;</p>
          <p> After graduation, he returned to his homeland as a vocational educator, teaching Navajo adults the essentials of carpentry, and then as a field coordinator for VISTA Indian Training Center. </p>
          <p> He quickly proved his leadership abilities and became executive director of DNA-People&rsquo;s Legal Services, a nonprofit legal services program for the Navajo, Hopi and Apache people. He helped them with legal matters, set up widespread community education programs and championed native consumer rights. Zah was elected chairman of the Navajo Tribal Council in 1982. </p>
          <p> Tall and silver-haired, Zah now meets with ASU students, presents guest lectures and represents ASU in meetings with American Indian communities, as well as federal and state governments. He was chosen as the 2003 &ndash; 2004 Graduate Mentor of the Year by the ASU graduate student body. </p>
          <p> He also helped create ASU&rsquo;s Native American Achievement Program, a partnership with tribes that provides scholarships, mentoring and advising to students. Students often are found in his office, listening to his soft-spoken words of advice. </p>
