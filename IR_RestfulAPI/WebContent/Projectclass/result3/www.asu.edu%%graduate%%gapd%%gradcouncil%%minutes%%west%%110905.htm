       ANNOUNCEMENTS
       <br>
       <br>
 Dr. Brett announced that she met with representatives from all the colleges and graduate academic units at ASU?s West campus 
 regarding new graduate level degrees.  She stated that it was a very energetic and productive meeting, several promising ideas 
 were discussed and she will keep the council members informed of their progress.  
<br>
       <br>
 <br>
DECISION ITEMS
<br>
       <br>
 
Dr. Zorita discussed the Curriculum Action Proposal from the Master of Social Work program.  Their advance standing program 
currently requires 34 credit hours for completion of the degree.  The program is requesting an increase of the minimum credit 
hours to 37 by requiring students to complete SWG 520 Research and Advocacy.  This course is currently being offered and it is 
part of the standard 60-credit hour program, however, it has not been a requirement of the advance standing program.  Past 
experience has shown that students in the shorter advance standing program have had difficulties with research concepts and 
skills; therefore, this basic research course should help them in the completion of their applied project.  If approve, the new 
requirement will begin with the next pool of students; which will be admitted for the summer 2006 session.  The proposal from the 
MSW program to increase the required course work from 34 credit hours to 37 credit hours was unanimously approved.
<br>
       <br>
 
Dr. Kelley introduced the Curriculum Action proposal requesting the addition of a teacher certification track to the M.Ed. 
Elementary Education program.  This track is aimed at recruiting students who have bachelor?s degrees outside the education 
field and are thinking about changing careers.  This track gives them the ability to complete all the courses required for 
teacher certification in elementary education and a master?s of education degree at the same time.  Four new courses will be 
required to be added to the bank of courses in order to make this program successful.  The first new course listed is RDG 531Teaching 
with Educational Technology is a new course that has been mandated by the Arizona Department of Education.  EED 521, Instructional 
Planning and Management in the Inclusive Classroom, RDG 531 Language and Literacy I, and 532 Language and Literacy II are required 
to complete this track.  Students in this program will complete the coursework for their certification prior to completing the M.Ed. 
degree.  This new track will required a shift in the college?s resources but the resources are available to deliver the program.  
If approved, the new track will begin with the fall 2006 semester.
<br>
       <br>
The Graduate Council at the West campus members voted on the curriculum action proposal as a package; the new track and the four new 
courses.  The proposal was unanimously approved.
<br>
       <br>
 Dr. Kassing introduced the Course Action proposals for seven graduate courses in the Master of Arts Communication Studies program.  
 All the courses are currently being taught; however, the program is seeking to bring the titles and course descriptions up-to-date 
 with what is being offered to the students.  The courses are:
	<br>
       <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Titles							
<br>
COM 515 Ethical Issues in Communication							
<br>
COM 516 Conflict and Negotiation
<br>
COM 520 Communication Campaigns
<br>
COM 532 Relational Dynamics in Communication
<br>
COM 551 Democracy and Power in Organization
<br>
COM 557 Communication and Technology
<br>
COM 565 Communication, Globalization, and Diversification
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposed New Titles or course description
<br>
COM 515 Ethical Issues in Communication Advocacy
<br>
COM 516 Mediation and Dispute Resolution
<br>
COM 520 Communication Campaigns (new course description)
<br>
COM 532 Advocacy in Interpersonal Settings
<br>
COM 551 Democracy and Power in Organization (new course description)
<br>
COM 557 Communication and Technology (new course description)
<br>
COM 565 Globalization and Advocacy
<br>
<br>
The list of course action proposals was voted on as a package.  The members of the Graduate Council at the West campus unanimously approved the proposed course changes from the Master of Arts Communication Studies program.
<br>
<br>
<br>
DISCUSSION ITEMS
<br>
<br>
Dr. Brett informed the members of the Graduate Council that graduate enrollment numbers have decreased over the past five years.  We need to reverse the negative trend.  Dr. Brett will be meeting with the graduate directors on November 18 to discuss a recruiting plan.  It is extremely important that each graduate program develop a recruiting communication flow.  
<br>
<br>
Each college pays $1,000.00 per year for the access to RMS (Recruitment Management System).  RMS is a prospective student database that inquiries coming into the West campus are recorded and stored.  The RMS staff will mail the appropriate brochures to students and keep a record of each contact and the information mailed.  When appropriate, they will also follow up with telephone calls.  We should take advantage of the service they provide.  The office of Graduate Studies has set up a log to capture the necessary information from all prospective students who have been in contact with the Graduate Studies office.  This information will then be given to the RMS staff to be added to their list of contacts for follow-up.  
<br>
<br>
Last year we offered a recruiting event called ?The Masters Open.?  Approximately 200 prospective students attended this event, which turned into a 10% application pool with 6% registering for classes.  We would like to offer this event again but with a smaller budget.  We need to think about what would be a good date; who should receive an invitation, businesses, government, professional organizations, etc?  
<br>
<br>
It was the general consensus of the members that the end of January or fist of February would be a good time to offer the Masters Open recruiting event.  Another suggestion was to mail invitations to our alumni, students who have graduated within the past five years.  Another possible way to advertise is to give invitations to current students who may pass them out at their place of employment.  
<br>
<br>
Dr. Brett announced that a meeting regarding recruiting with the graduate directors and their support staff is scheduled for November 18.  She encouraged everyone to attend and bring their ideas and questions.  
<br>
<br>
The meeting adjourned at 11:17 a.m.
