      <h2>Pac-10 business schools face off for first time; W. P. Carey MBA students
      win Pac-10 Case competition</h2>
      <p>A team of W. P. Carey MBA students swept the
          first-ever business case competition among Pac-10 schools, winning
        the honor of leading the conference
          defense against teams from the Big Ten at the inaugural "Rose Bowl
        of case competitions" coming this January.
      </p>
      <p>The W. P. Carey School organized
          and hosted the Pac-10 competition Oct. 23-25, bringing together teams
          of MBA students from prominent business
          schools within the Pac-10. The W. P. Carey School of Business is also
          staging the next level of challenge: the 2004 Pac-10/Big Ten MBA Case
          Challenge, an academic championship between the three top teams from
        each conference, to be staged at Arizona State University Jan. 15-17.</p>
      <p>"We
          are extremely pleased with the strong interest we had in this event
        from across the Pac-10 conference, and, of course, with the fine showing
          of our W. P. Carey MBA students," said Associate Dean Dennis Hoffman.
          "The Big Ten conference has conducted a case competition for years.
        Now
          that the Pac-10 has a similar structure the two conferences can face-off,
          paralleling the annual football rivalry. The W. P. Carey School of
        Business is proud to host this new tradition." </p>
      <p>Case competitions provide business
          students with a forum to exercise the knowledge and skills acquired
        in class by developing solutions to
          hypothetical business problems within a set time period. Typically,
        students work in teams and present their proposals to a panel of judges.
        Teams
        were given 24 hours to prepare for their Oct. 25 presentations. </p>
      <p>Top finishers
          included first-place Arizona State University, second-place University
  of Washington and third-place University of Southern California. These teams
  will face Indiana University, Purdue and the University of Wisconsin from the
  Big Ten. </p>
      <p>The W. P. Carey team, dubbed Objective Viewpoint, was coached by management
  Professors Amy Hillman and Gerry Keim, and included second-year W. P. Carey
        MBA students
  Talli Brown, Nathan Kennedy, Brian Martin, Chad Meyers and alternate Matt Disbrow.
  The team finished first overall, and collected honors for Best Presenter, Best
  Q&amp;A and Most Innovative Solution. </p>
