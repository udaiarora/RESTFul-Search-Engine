<P><A name="z0761812">&#13;  The result of most SAS/GRAPH procedures
is the graphic display of data in the form of graphics output.  <B>Graphics
output</B> is made up of commands that tell a graphics device how to draw
graphic elements. A <B>graphics element</B> is a visual element of graphics
output - for example, a plot line, a bar, a footnote, the outline of
a map area, or a border.</A>
<P>To generate graphics output, your program uses a device
driver that directs the graphics output to a display device (a graphics monitor
or terminal), a hardcopy device, or a file. Despite the fact that all graphics
devices do not understand the same commands,  SAS/GRAPH software
can produce graphics output on many types of graphics devices. It does so
by producing output in two steps: 
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>It creates a catalog entry made up of graphics
commands in a generic, device-independent format.<P>

<LI>It uses a device driver to translate the commands
from the generic format to commands that a particular graphics device understands.
This is called device-dependent output.<P>
</OL>

<P>Your program controls this process as well as the graphics
environment in which the graphics appear. This section describes this graphics
environment and how you can modify it, how SAS/GRAPH uses
it, and how you can make your programs work for different output devices.
<P><TABLE width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5"><A name="z-modgoa">About the Graphics Output Area</A></FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P><A name="z0761817">&#13; When
SAS/GRAPH software
produces graphics output, it draws the graphic elements inside of an area
called the <B>graphics output area</B>. Characteristics of the graphics
output area are determined by the values of certain device parameters within
the device entry. You can modify some of these characteristics  for a single
graph or an entire SAS session by using graphics options to change the values
of the device parameters. This section describes changes you can make to the
external dimensions, the resolution, the cell size, and the type of units.
For a description of the graphics options and device parameters referred to
in this section, see </A><A href="z0713550.htm">Graphics Options and Device Parameters Dictionary</A>.
<BR><H3>External Dimensions</H3>


<P><A name="z0761818">&#13;The graphics output area is
contained within the device's display
area. The external dimensions of the device's display area are controlled
by the values of the XMAX and YMAX device parameters.  XMAX sets the maximum
horizontal dimension; YMAX sets the maximum vertical dimension. The <B>orientation</B> of the graphics output area, that is, whether it is landscape
or portrait, is determined by whether the larger value is XMAX (orientation
is landscape) or YMAX (orientation is portrait).</A>
<P>The external dimensions of the graphics output area
are controlled by the values of the HSIZE and VSIZE device parameters.
<P>Typically, the default dimensions of the graphics output
area are the same as the dimensions of the device. This is usually true for
display devices. For those devices, the default value of HSIZE and VSIZE is
0. However, for hardcopy devices, the XMAX, YMAX values represent the external
boundaries of the output medium (such as a sheet of paper). If these devices
need a margin, HSIZE, VSIZE and HORIGIN, VORIGIN are assigned default values
and the default graphics output area is somewhat smaller than the device's
display area. <A href="#z0747390">Default Dimensions of the PSCOLOR Device</A>
illustrates such a device. 
<P>
<B><I><A name="z0747390">Default Dimensions of the PSCOLOR Device</A></I></B><BR>


<P><IMG border="0" src="./images/01329072.gif" vspace="12" alt="[IMAGE]">
<P> 
<P>Note
that HORIGIN and VORIGIN define the left margin
and bottom margin, respectively. The right margin and top margin are calculated
by the device driver as follows:
<P>
<TABLE cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2">
<TR valign="top"><TD>
<I>right-margin</I> = XMAX - (HSIZE + HORIGIN)
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<TABLE cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2">
<TR valign="top"><TD>
<I>top-margin</I> = YMAX -(VSIZE
+ VORIGIN)
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>You cannot specify values for <B>right-margin</B>
and <B>top-margin</B>.
<P>You can change the dimensions of the graphics output
area for a SAS session or for a single graph with the HSIZE= and VSIZE= graphics
options.  Changing the size of the graphics output area does not change the
dimensions of the device's display area or affect the resolution. The values
of HSIZE= and VSIZE= cannot exceed the maximum dimensions for the device as
specified by XMAX and YMAX.  Furthermore, you cannot specify values for graphics
options HSIZE= and VSIZE= that exceed the HSIZE and VSIZE values in the device
entry.
<BR><H3>Device Resolution</H3>


<P><A name="z0761824">&#13; The resolution of a device is the number of pixels per inch.
It is determined by the values of the device parameters XMAX, YMAX, and XPIXELS,
YPIXELS, and is calculated by dividing the number of pixels by the corresponding
external dimension. For example,</A>
<P>
<TABLE cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2">
<TR valign="top"><TD>
<I>x-resolution</I> = XPIXELS / XMAX
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>Therefore, the X resolution of the
PSCOLOR device illustrated
in <A href="#z0747390">Default Dimensions of the PSCOLOR Device</A>
is 300dpi (dots per inch).
<P>Ordinarily, you do not want to change the device resolution
because changing it may distort your image. However, you may want to change
the size of the display area. To do so without changing the resolution, use
the GOPTIONS statement to change the values of only XPIXELS= and YPIXELS=,
or the values of only XMAX= and YMAX=. Then SAS/GRAPH will
automatically calculate the correct value for the unspecified parameters so
that the device retains the default resolution.
<P>If you do want to change the device resolution (usually
for image files or graphs that are displayed online), specify values for both
XMAX= and XPIXELS= (horizontal resolution) or both YMAX= and YPIXELS= (vertical
resolution), or all four. In these cases, SAS/GRAPH changes
the dimensions  and recalculates the device resolution. <A href="#z1263747">Interactions of Graphics Options That Affect Resolution</A> summarizes the interaction
of these options.

<P><A name="z0761843">&#13; 
 Within the graphics output area,
SAS/GRAPH software
defines an invisible grid of rows and columns. This grid is made up of <B>character cells</B> as shown in
</A><A href="#zavalues">Rows, Columns, and Cells in the Graphics Output Area</A>.
<P>The size and proportion of these cells affects the size
and appearance of graphic elements that are drawn using units of CELLS. The
attributes of the cells are determined by both the external dimensions of
the graphics output area (controlled by HSIZE and VSIZE) and the number of
rows and columns. The number of rows is controlled by the LROWS (if orientation
is landscape) or PROWS (if orientation is portrait) device parameter. Similarly,
the number of columns is controlled by the LCOLS (landscape) or PCOLS (portrait)
device parameter.
<P>You can change the number of rows and columns in the
grid with the HPOS= and VPOS= graphics options.  HPOS= overrides the value
of LCOLS or PCOLS and sets the number of columns in the graphics output area.
VPOS= overrides the value of LROWS or PROWS and sets the number of rows in
the graphics output area.
<P><A href="#zavalues">Rows, Columns, and Cells in the Graphics Output Area</A>

that determine the dimensions of the graphics output area and those that determine
the number of character cells within the graphics output area.

<P>Usually, you should not change the number of rows and
columns from the default for your device.  However, if you must change them
to make a graph fit, note that the size of text in the graphics output will
change <B>if</B> you specified text size using units of CELLS.  If the
cells are large (that is, HPOS= and VPOS= have small values), the text may
not fit.  If the cells are too small, the text may be too small to read. In
this case, you can adjust the size of the text with the HEIGHT= statement
option or the HTEXT= graphics option.
<P>To change all the attributes of the graphics output

<P><A name="z0761864">&#13;  By
default,
most graphic elements are drawn using units of CELLS to determine their size.
For example, the default character height for the TITLE1 definition is two
cells; for all other text the default height is one cell.</A>
<P>Changing the cell size to control the size of one element,
such as text, may distort other parts of your graph.  Instead, you may want
to change the type of units that SAS/GRAPH uses
to control the size of the graphic elements. In addition to CELLS and other
absolute units such as inches (IN), centimeters (CM), and points (PT), you
can often use units of percent of the graphics output area (PCT). This unit
specification allows the height of the graphic elements to change in proportion
to the size of the graphics output area.
<P>You can specify the type of unit for individual graphic
elements or you can use the GUNIT= graphics option to set the default units
that will be used for most height specifications.

SAS/GRAPH cannot
fit one or more graphic elements on the graph. This can happen if an element

if you have too many elements to fit in a given space (for example, a bar
chart has too many bars). In these cases, SAS/GRAPH either </A>

fit but it does not drop bars in order to produce a readable bar chart. If
you get unexpected results or no graph, check the SAS log for notes, warnings,

<P><A name="z0761879">&#13;  When you want to write a program that will produce the same
graphics output on two different devices, you can use features in SAS/GRAPH software
to simplify the process: </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Use percent of the graphics output area (PCT)
as the unit of measure when specifying sizes of text and other graphics to
make sure that text is proportional in size across devices.  A one-inch-high
title may be appropriate on a standard piece of paper, but it is almost all
of the display area of a slide.  To make units of percentage the default for
size specifications, use the GUNIT= graphics option:  



<PRE>goptions gunit=pct;</PRE>
<P>You can also specify PCT anywhere you specify a size:
 



<PRE>axis1 label=(height=3 pct 'Year');</PRE>
<P>See <A href="zt-gunit.htm">GUNIT</A>
for a complete description of the GUNIT= graphics option.<P>

<LI>Compare colors and patterns for the devices you
will use and use the colors of  the device that has the fewest colors, With
a slide camera, for example, you can choose from over 16 million colors, but
some graphics monitors display only four or eight colors at a time.
<P>If you want to generate a graph on both a color device
and a black-and-white device, such as a laser printer or a monochrome graphics
monitor, all colors are remapped to black, white, or scales of gray, depending
on the device.  However, with the PATTERN statement, you can substitute line-patterns
for colors.<P>

<LI>Preview the appearance of the output on a different
device with the TARGETDEVICE= graphics option. For example, to see how the
output will look on a color PostScript printer, specify  



<PRE>goptions targetdevice=pscolor;</PRE><P>
