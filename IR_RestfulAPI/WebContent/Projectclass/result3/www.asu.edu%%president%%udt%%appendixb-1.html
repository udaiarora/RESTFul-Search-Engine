      <h1><strong>APPENDIX
            B-1<br>
      </strong><strong>SUMMARY OF THE PRESIDENT&rsquo;S RESPONSE TO THE UNIVERSITY
    PROVOST&rsquo;S RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY DESIGN TEAM </strong></h1>
      <p><font size="2">Implementation of the design process initiated by the
          University Design Team and further refined and enhanced by the University
          Provost&rsquo;s
        Recommendations will include the following:</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">1)&nbsp; ASU will implement and develop a &ldquo;college/school-centric&rdquo; model
        of academic organization and advancement;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">2)&nbsp; ASU colleges and schools will be located on
          four campuses in the Phoenix metropolitan area, including development
          of a new Capital Center campus;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">3)&nbsp; Each campus will have a different mission that
          unites the design and activities of the colleges and schools located
          on that campus;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">4)&nbsp; Moving to the new Capital Center campus in downtown
          Phoenix are: </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The College of Nursing, which will also
          offer programs on the ASU Polytechnic campus in the East Valley and
          the ASU West campus;</li>
        <li>The redesigned Public College (formerly the
            College of Public Programs) will be comprised of the School of Public
            Affairs; the School of Community Development and Service; the School
            of Social Work; and the Morrison Institute for Public Policy; </li>
        <li> KAET (Channel 8), ASU&rsquo;s PBS television
        station; </li>
        <li>The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism
          and Mass Communication, which will become a stand-alone school and
          have facilities contiguous with KAET; </li>
        <li> The School of Health Management
            and Policy; </li>
        <li>The new University College that will house
          a new School of Interdisciplinary Studies, the Community College Alliance,
          the Extended Education programs, and will sponsor or offer relevant
          programs in education, business and communications.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2">5)&nbsp; In addition, several colleges and schools on
          the Tempe campus will expand their programs to other campuses: </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The College of Architecture and Environmental Design will offer select
          programs to students on other campuses on a distributed basis;</li>
        <li>The Herberger College of Fine Arts will develop an arts presence
          on the Capital Center campus and on the Polytechnic campus. </li>
        <li>The Del E. Webb School of Construction will continue to be headquartered
          on the Tempe campus within the Ira. A. Fulton School of Engineering;
          the school will offer a construction management program on the Tempe
          campus, and a construction technology program on the Polytechnic campus. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2">6)&nbsp; Enhancements to the Polytechnic campus include:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A general engineering program will be developed on the Polytechnic
          campus; </li>
        <li>The Real Estate program will be moved there from the Tempe campus;</li>
        <li>The Physical Education Program will relocate to the Polytechnic campus; </li>
        <li>A School of Industrial Administration will be developed on the Polytechnic
          campus. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2">7)&nbsp; Enhancements to the West campus include:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Criminal Justice &amp; Criminology Department at the West campus
          will become the School of Criminal Justice &amp; Criminology with administrative
          responsibility for applied programs in criminal justice; </li>
        <li>The Recreation
            and Tourism Management Program will be enhanced at the West campus;</li>
        <li>The
            College of Education on the West campus will be renamed the College
            of Teacher Education and Leadership to reflect its mission and strengths,
            including teacher preparation and school administration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2">8)&nbsp; ASU will redesign existing colleges and schools or create new
        ones focusing on the following areas:&nbsp; anthropology and social change;
        earth sciences; social inquiry; global studies; global health and technology;
        sustainability; and family and human development. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">9)&nbsp; Other significant decisions include:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The College of Law will continue to explore alternate program opportunities.&nbsp; It
          should also consider opportunities for its existing programs as part
          of the planning and development of the Capital Center campus;</li>
        <li>The Hugh
            Downs School of Human Communications will remain on the Tempe campus.&nbsp; With
            the relocation of the College of Public Programs to the Capital Center
            campus, the school will become part of the College of Liberal Arts
            and Sciences;</li>
        <li>Justice Studies on the Tempe campus will become the School of Social
          Inquiry and will decide if it should relocate to the Capital Center
          campus or become part of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences on
          the Tempe campus.</li>
