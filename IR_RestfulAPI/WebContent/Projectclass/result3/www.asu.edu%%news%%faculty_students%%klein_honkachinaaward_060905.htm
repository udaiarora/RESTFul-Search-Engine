          <h2><strong> </strong>Hon Kachina Council rewards ASU graduate for volunteer work</h2>
          <p> <img src="facstudents_images/Courtney-Klein.jpg" width="180" height="244" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">In the Hopi culture, kachinas represent benevolent spirits. The &ldquo;Hon&rdquo; kachina, denoted as a warrior in a bear mask, symbolizes courage, strength and healing. Those traits and more are present in recent ASU graduate Courtney Klein, who will be receiving the prestigious Hon Kachina Volunteer Award at an awards dinner in September. </p>
          <p> The annual award is given by the Hon Kachina Council, which recognizes individuals with an exemplary commitment to volunteering. Klein is just the fourth ASU student to win the award in its nearly 30-year history. </p>
          <p> Klein, a nonprofit management and communications major who graduated magna cum laude in May, is involved in numerous volunteer projects. One of those is the Manos de Ayuda Medical Clinic in Puerto Pe&ntilde;asco, a nonprofit collaboration of professional health care volunteers that conducts free monthly clinics for children in one of Mexico &rsquo;s poorest communities and provides food and other vital supplies to the population. It began as an effort to relieve Mexican residents after Hurricane Nora struck in 1997, and Klein helped build the project up into a self-sustaining program that helps about 360 people each month. </p>
          <p> In addition to her work with Manos de Ayuda, Klein also spent a summer in Yucat&aacute;n , Mexico , repairing houses, building a school and securing clean water supplies. Klein was touched by the compassion and thankfulness she found in the community. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;You meet some of the most gracious people doing this,&rdquo; Klein says. &ldquo;They have nothing, but they give you everything.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Klein says she prefers to lend her time to rural communities that seldom receive the same help as big cities, but she is no stranger to volunteering close to home. </p>
          <p> Klein is a mentor with Maggie&rsquo;s Place, a Phoenix organization that houses pregnant women without a home or who are going through a crisis situation. Among the roughly 40 women Klein has mentored, two of them applied to college with Klein&rsquo;s help. She also began an Army pen pal campaign, which enlisted the help of Valley schoolchildren, many from the Tempe Thomas J. Pappas School for the Homeless, to write 5,000 soldiers serving in Iraq who were not receiving letters. </p>
          <p> While at ASU, Klein founded the Go NGO program as her honors thesis project. The project provides Web site templates for charitable organizations throughout the developing world that otherwise would not have the means to use the Internet. Klein hopes the program will help those organizations enhance their volunteer resources and increase their community impact. </p>
          <p> These and countless other volunteer efforts contributed to Klein&rsquo;s acknowledgment by the Hon Kachina Council. The award consists of a cash prize of $500 and a kachina figurine. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s humbling to be so young and to be in the company of people who have been volunteering their entire lives,&rdquo; Klein says. &ldquo;As a volunteer, you don&rsquo;t expect recognition. I just hope the way I lead my life affects people.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Klein is focused on a program she founded called the Youth Re:Action Corps. The project educates high school students about international communities, cultures and economic situations. Students then are encouraged to develop practical solutions for a particular community and present their plan to community members and business investors to garner the resources necessary to put those plans into action. </p>
          <p> Klein, who began volunteer work at an early age, describes volunteering as a lifestyle, not just as an occasional activity. For example, her car is a roving humanitarian station. In it, she keeps a stockpile of bread to give to the homeless and a supply of blankets to hand out in the winter. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;People around me know this is who I am,&rdquo; adds Klein, who admits that her inability to say no tends to spread her time thin for other things in her life. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lucky that the people in my life have been very supportive. Somehow my passion to do it is what keeps me motivated.&rdquo; </p>
          <p>Price, with Marketing &amp; Strategic Communications, can be reached at (480) 965-9690 or (mbprice@asu.edu).</p>
