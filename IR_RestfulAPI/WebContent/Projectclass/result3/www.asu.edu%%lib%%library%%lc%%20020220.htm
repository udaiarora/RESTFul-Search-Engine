                  <br>
                  <p align="center"><b>February 20, 2002</b> </p>
                  <p>Meeting called to order at 3:03 PM                   
                  <p>                <p>Chair: John Barnard<br>
  Secretary: Mimmo Bonanni<br>
  A quorum was present.
                <p>                <h2>I. Approval of Minutes</h2>
                <H3>&nbsp;</H3>
                <p>Minutes of September 19, 2001 meeting were approved as written.
</p>
                <p>&nbsp;                  </p>
                <h2>II. Dean's Report</h2>
                <H3>&nbsp;</H3>
                <p>Dean Schmidt informed council that Senate has passed a budget bill, which includes raises for government employees. Because the House has not passed the bill, it is still to early to determine the status of the budget. The Dean also announced that the cost of living pay increases for APs in the mid-salary ranges would be reflected with the current paycheck.
                  </p>
                <br>
                 
                  <P>Sherrie gave Council a picture of the budget in the recent past and in the upcoming months. She mentioned that the libraries has "returned" over $200,000 in lapsed salaries, and, the libraries will have to reduce monies from the salary lines in the future. The Dean will consult with Council over which salary lines to consider, but she will make the final decision. Currently, the Dean and Administrative Council are examining several points of service within the libraries. In the long run, we may need to demonstrate that we are returning monies, roughly 5%, an option being considered to reevaluate points of service to reduce library costs. The Dean mentioned a way to reduce library costs would be to merge public service desks. Sherrie will let council know by the middle of March which options are being considered.                   
                  <P>                <h2>III. Chair & Executive Committee Report</h2>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>The Chair announced that there would be a Librarians' Council meeting in March to discuss some revisions made by the Personnel Committee to the handbook. John also mentioned that there would be a guest speaker at next month's meeting. Daniel Jankowski, Self Study Coordinator at the Graduate College, will give a 20-minute presentation on the topic of continuing accreditation.

                  <h3>Revisions to Librarians' Handbook sections E.2, E.3, G.2.1, G.2.2, I.1 (Personnel Committee)</h3>
                  <br>
                
                  <P>Personnel Committee was asked by the Review Committee to look at section I.1: Sabbatical Leave clarifying the duration of sabbatical leave for an academic professional. The committee added a paragraph, using the language of the ACD (Academic Affairs & Procedures Manual), to emphasize the length of time of a "sabbatical year." Scott asked council to look at the section and to be prepared to discuss and vote on the revision at the next Librarians' Council.</p>
<br>
<P>The Review Committee also asked Personnel to look at handbook sections used by probationary librarians to create their annual reviews, in particular the sections that emphasized employee contributions and the sections that emphasize service. The sections examined were: E.2: Criteria, E.3: Requirements, G.2.1: Probationary Evaluation, G.2.2: Continuing Appointment/Promotion. Scott asked council to look at the revised sections and to be prepared to discuss and vote on the revisions at the next Librarians' Council. The revisions are currently available on the Librarians' Handbook Web site.</p>
<br>
<P>For section E.2, under the SERVICE heading, the committee added a few sentences. Scott suggested some minor last minute changes. The group accepted the motion. A motion from the floor was to replace the word "serving" with perhaps, "attending." Another motion was to replace the word "serving" with, "participating on." Council voted replacing "serving" with, "participating on." The vote did not pass. Another suggestion from the floor was to replace the word, "serving" to, "membership in." There was a vote and it did pass. Personnel will make the change.</p>
<br>
<P>For section E3, Scott mentioned that the committee moved paragraphs within the section, and they added subheading to make the section easier to read overall. Scott suggested some minor last minute changes. The group accepted the motion. In the first paragraph, the committee would add a sentence, "In addressing ..." Under JOB PERFORMANCE, in the second sentence, "Job performance will be judged on elements that may include consistency&hellip;" The group accepted the changes.</p>
<br>
<P>For section G.2.1, under the heading, THE PROBATIONARY ACADEMIC PROFESSIONAL, the committee added three additional paragraphs. The committee also added links to the, "Marion Librarian ..." section of the handbook. Scott suggested some minor last minute changes. The group accepted the motion. The committee suggested to revise the first sentence in the third paragraph under the heading, THE PROBATIONARY ACADEMIC PROFESSIONAL to read, "The letter should be evaluative, establishing how well&hellip;" The group accepted the change.</p>
<br>
<P>For Section G.2.2, under THE ACADEMIC PROFESSIONAL heading section D, the group added a clarifying sentence that maintains the language consistency between different sections of the handbook.</p>
<br>
<P>The committee will add revisions made during the meeting and they will be available for viewing on the Librarians' Council Web site.</p>
  

  
                  <H4>&nbsp;</H4>
                  <h3>Nominations for candidates for Academic Senate (Nominations and Elections Committee)</h3>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Pat mentioned that the Nominations and Elections Committee has met and that they currently have two candidates for Academic Senate, Deborah Koshinsky and Diane Moore. Pat asked for nominations from the floor. There were no nominations. Nominations and Elections Committee will send out a ballot for Academic Senator with candidates Deborah Koshinsky and Diane Moore. Pat thanked George for his outstanding service as acting as Academic Senator for the council over the last six years.
