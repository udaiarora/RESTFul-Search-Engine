    This is an open invitation to anyone who is in the job market who would like to do a practice job interview, for your benefit and for the students in PFF 3 who will watch and then discuss the experience afterward with you. We only do this once or twice a year, so your opportunities are limited. Unfortunately, so is the time frame. The day and time set aside for this exercise is next Friday Nov 18 from 1:40-3:30pm. Are any of you available and willing? You can select a job for which you would like to apply and I will recruit a faculty ?interview committee? to fit that job description. We (the faculty committee) will pretend to be from that institution and you will pretend to be on a campus interview. The other details will be worked out after you contact me. Francinne Valcour did this last year and I think the experience was beneficial for everyone involved. If you are interested, please contact me as soon as possible so we have plenty of time to identify a job and compose an interview committee. Thanks. <br>

  By Gode Davis and James M. Fortier </p>
