The ancient regalia&#8212;the caps and gowns and hoods&#8212;serve         to remind us that universities are enduring institutions. These emblems         of scholarship have served to mark moments in the lives of academic institutions         since the Middle Ages. It is a time for considering accomplishments, taking         stock, and looking ahead.</P>      <P>At the same time that we look ahead, we must pause to consider the efforts         and contributions of those who came before us. To express that sense of         indebtedness, Sir Isaac Newton likened himself to a dwarf standing on         the shoulders of giants, a metaphor he borrowed from a twelfth-century         humanist and philosopher, Bernard of Chartres. As we look ahead, I must         look back and acknowledge the contributions of all those who over the         course of more than a century have worked to build a great university         here in metropolitan Phoenix.</P>      <P>I must look back and acknowledge the contributions of my predecessors         in the office of the president, beginning with those who guided the evolution         of a territorial teachers&#8217; college to a state college, and those         who led a state college to become a university. I must express the appreciation         of the entire university community to President Lattie Coor, the dynamic         leader who dramatically accelerated the development of ASU as a major         research institution, and articulated its vital significance to the city         and state. Not the least of his contributions over the course of twelve         years has been the fostering of a close-knit ASU family. Arizona State         University would not be the institution it is today without his inspiration         and commitment. </P>      <P>Nor would Arizona State University be what it is today without the dedication         and effort of more individuals than can possibly be named. Many here today         have been partners in building this great institution. On behalf of the         entire university community, I must express my appreciation to those many         individuals who have given generously of their time, wisdom, and means         to advance Arizona State University: civic leaders and state legislators,         leaders in business and industry, directors of foundations and benefactors,         and our colleagues from institutions worldwide. There are the students         and faculty of the university today, and the alumni and emeriti for whom         Arizona State University will always play an essential role. There are         many whose lives have been shaped by this institution, and all of you         have played a part in this noble endeavor. We are all a part of this journey.       </P>      <P>Arizona State University has been integral to the social and cultural         fabric of Arizona since 1885, and will play an even more important role         in the development of our state as it assumes an increasingly important         national and international role. Today Arizona State University is poised         to become a world-class institution in what is emerging as a dynamic and         vibrant world city&#8212;the two are inextricably intertwined. Arizona         State University has established the capacity to become the leading public         metropolitan research university for the twenty-first century, known for         its excellence in teaching and research, its innovative interdisciplinary         programs, and its direct social engagement. </P>      <P>As we begin a new chapter in the history of this institution, I would         like to look beyond its current success. I would like to talk to you about         transformation, and the further evolution of the American research university&#8212;what         I want to call the new American university&#8212;and why Arizona State         University is uniquely positioned to become such an institution. </P></td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td align="left" valign="bottom"><a href="index.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br>      </strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="b1.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="a1.htm"><img src="images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
