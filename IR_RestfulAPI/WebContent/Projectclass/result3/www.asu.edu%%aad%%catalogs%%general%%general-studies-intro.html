In addition to depth of knowledge in a particular academic or professional discipline, students should also be broadly educated and develop the general intellectual skills they need to continue learning throughout their lives. Thus, the General Studies requirement complements the undergraduate major by helping students gain mastery of critical learning skills, investigate the traditional branches of knowledge, and develop the broad perspective that frees one to appreciate diversity and change across time, culture, and national boundaries.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1012990"></a>Critical learning skills include proficiency in the use of language, mathematics, and quantitative methods as tools for acquiring, renewing, creating, and communicating knowledge. A broad education includes an understanding of the methods and concerns of traditional branches of knowledge&#8212;the arts and humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. Developing perspective requires historical, global, and cross-cultural examination of knowledge of all kinds.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1012992"></a>To help students achieve these educational goals, the General Studies Program includes five<i class="Italic"> core areas</i> and three <i class="Italic">awareness areas.</i> The five <i class="Italic">core areas</i> help students acquire critical lifelong learning skills and guide their exploration of the traditional branches of knowledge:</p><ol><li class="List-Num-1-lead"><a name="pgfId-1013252"></a>1. literacy and critical inquiry;</li><li class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-1013259"></a>2. mathematics studies;</li><li class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-1013264"></a>3. humanities, fine arts, and design;</li><li class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-1013267"></a>4. social and behavioral sciences; and</li><li class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-1013278"></a>5. natural sciences.</li></ol><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1013001"></a> The three <i class="Italic">awareness areas</i> promote appreciation of cultural diversity within the contemporary United States, develop an international perspective, and foster an understanding of current human events through study of the past:</p><ol><li class="List-Num-1-lead"><a name="pgfId-1013002"></a>1. cultural diversity in the United States;</li><li class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-1013003"></a>2. global awareness; and</li><li class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-1013004"></a>3. historical awareness.</li></ol><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1013006"></a>The courses approved by the General Studies Councils for meeting the General Studies requirement are noted in the <a href="general-studies-table.html#31934" class="XRef"> General Studies Courses</a> table; in the course descriptions; and in the <i class="Italic">Schedule of Classes</i> each academic term.</p><p class="FM-A-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1013015"></a><a name="40139"></a>Meeting the General Studies Requirement</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1013017"></a>All students enrolled in a baccalaureate degree program must successfully complete a minimum of 35 semester hours of approved General Studies courses.
