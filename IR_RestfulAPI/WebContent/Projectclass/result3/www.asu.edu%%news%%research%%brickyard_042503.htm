      <h2>ASU creates new computer, information sciences institute</h2>
      <p>ASU has created the Institute for Computer and Information Sciences
        and Engineering (ICISE) to centralize the university's key academic and
          research programs in computer science, and to help build its computer
        science department to world-class stature. </p>
      <p>The new institute will be
          housed in leased space at the Brickyard complex on Mill Avenue in Tempe.
          The move to the Brickyard will give the university
        an additional 130,000 square feet of academic and research space for
        its computer science &amp; engineering department (CSE) and provide the
        facilities ASU needs to create a top-ranked program. </p>
      <p>"ASU intends to
          build a host of worldclass academic and research programs as we pursue
          our goal of creating the new American University," said
          ASU President Michael Crow. "The Institute for Computer and Information
          Sciences and Engineering is our newest initiative, joining others including
          the Arizona Biodesign Institute and the Center for the Study of Religion
          and Conflict."</p>
      <p>The creation of the institute and approval of the lease
          was on the agenda for the Arizona Board of Regents meeting April 24
        in Tucson. </p>
      <p>Peter Crouch,
        dean of the College of Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences
        (CEAS), said, "Establishing ICISE and moving the department of computer
        science &amp; engineering to the Brickyard are very exciting developments,
        made possible by the shared vision of President Crow and the faculty
        in the College of Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences for a top 25 School
      of Engineering.</p>
      <p>"Our presence in downtown Tempe reinforces the college's
          commitment to strengthening its relationship with the local community
          and the broader
        industrial community in Arizona," Crouch said.</p>
      <p>Creation of the institute
          at the Brickyard location accomplishes several immediate objectives:        </p>
      <p>. It centralizes the CSE department, with 45 faculty members and approximately
            1,850 undergraduate and graduate students, in one location with all
            of its classes, labs and related activities. Classes and offices
        for the
            department are now spread throughout several engineering buildings
            on the Main Campus, which limits many projects.<br>
        . The institute and its new facilities will help attract top computer
            science faculty to ASU. <br>
        . Filling the vacant Brickyard office space with ASU faculty and
            students will benefit the retail establishments in downtown Tempe.</p>
      <p>The Aug. 1 move
          of ICISE to the Brickyard, is one of several initiatives ASU has launched
          to solve its critical and immediate need for high-quality
          academic and research space. ASU will officially break ground April
        29 on a $69-million Phase 1 facility for the Arizona Biodesign Institute
          (AzBio) at the corner of Terrace and McAllister. Phases 2, 3, and 4
        of
          AzBio will be built if a legislative bill authorizing an additional
        $400 million for research facilities at Arizona's three state universities
          is approved. The bill, which was submitted to the state legislature
        April
          16, will provide ASU with $185 million to complete construction of
        all phases of the Arizona Biodesign Institute, as well as a facility
        for
          the university's new School of Life Sciences and research facilities
        at ASU East, ASU West and ASU's Downtown facility near the TGen site.</p>
      <p>ICISE,
          the primary tenant of the Brickyard, will be developed with a model
        similar to that of AzBio, with numerous core research programs,
          working together with a common goal, in this case to foster interdisciplinary
        research, education and entrepreneurship in computing. </p>
      <p>"A strong computer
        science department is critically important if we are to help train a
        technology-savvy workforce, which we have committed to
        doing in return for our Proposition 301 funding," said Jonathan Fink,
      ASU's vice president for Research &amp; Economic Affairs.</p>
      <p>At the core
          of the institute, which will be a part of the CEAS, is the strong academic
          program of the CSE department. The department and the
          institute will be led by Computer Science Professor Sethuraman Panchanathan,
        who is currently the interim chairman of the department.</p>
      <p>"The department
          has really been strapped for space," said Panchanathan. "This will
        provide the leverage and catalyst we need to grow. Our department
          is already strong, but this will strengthen us tremendously. We are
        extremely excited about this opportunity to elevate the prestige and
        ranking of
        the department and the college."</p>
      <p>Along with CSE, the institute will include
          the Consortium for Embedded and Inter-Networking Technologies (CEINT),
          the Partnership for Research
          In Stereo Modeling (PRISM), the Research Center for Ubiquitous Computing
          (CUbiC), Information Integration, Information Assurance, Bioinformatics,
        and the ASU Software Factory.</p>
      <p>Panchanathan says the structure of the institute
          will allow for additional collaboration with other computer-related
        centers on campus. Additional
          efforts will be aimed at encouraging collaboration with individual
        researchers throughout ASU in a variety of disciplines with either projects
        related
        to or interest in computer sciences.</p>
      <p>ASU Executive Vice President for
        Administration &amp; Finance Mernoy
        Harrison said the lease of the Brickyard makes sense for the university
      on a variety of levels, the biggest of which is a need for space.</p>
      <p>"We
          need space and we need it fast," said Harrison. "By acquiring the Brickyard,
          we get high quality space 1 1/2 years faster and for less
        than if we had to build it."</p>
      <p>The terms of the lease call for 130,000
          square feet in the Brickyard, Orchid House and Artisan Courts at $23
          per square foot, over a five-year
            term, with two additional five-year options, a tenant improvement
        allowance of $1.9 million, 3 months of free rent and free parking for
        the first
          year. </p>
      <p>ASU will use the tenant improvement allowance to offset much of
          the first year lease cost. Tenant improvements of $7 million and related
          costs
          will be funded from previously issued certificates of participation
        for a project that has been postponed. The debt service for the tenant
        improvements
          in FY 2004 will be approximately $350,000 and funded from funds already
          included in the ASU operating budget. Lease expenses in subsequent
        fiscal years will be covered by a combination of tuition, local funds
        and indirect
          cost recovery.<br>
