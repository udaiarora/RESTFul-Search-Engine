               <p> The inherent danger during a major power outage is panic; therefore, all university personnel should attempt to remain calm. In the event of a major, campus-wide outage, ASU has emergency generators that will immediately provide power to some areas of the campus. To report a minor, localized power outage, call Facilities Management at (480) 965-3633 or the ASU Police Department at (480) 965-3456.</p>

               <p> Keep flashlights and batteries in key locations throughout your work areas.</p>

               <p><strong> IN CASE OF A MAJOR, CAMPUS-WIDE POWER OUTAGE: </strong></p>

               <ul>

                 <li> Remain calm. </li>

                 <li> Follow directions from the ASU Police Department for immediate action. </li>

                 <li> If evacuation of a building is required, see &ldquo;<strong>EVACUATION</strong>&rdquo; section of this guide. </li>

                 <li> Laboratory personnel should secure all experiments and unplug electrical equipment prior to evacuating. All chemicals should be stored in their original locations. If safe to do so, provide natural ventilation by opening all windows and/or doors. If this is not possible, or natural ventilation is inadequate, evacuate the laboratory until the power is returned. </li>

                 <li> Do not light candles or other type of flame for lighting. </li>

                 <li> Unplug all electrical equipment (including computers) and turn off light switches. </li>

               </ul>

               <p><strong> IF PEOPLE ARE TRAPPED IN AN ELEVATOR: </strong></p>

               <ul>

                 <li> Tell passengers to stay calm and that you are getting help. Instruct passengers to pick up the emergency phone in elevator so they can provide direct information to the emergency responders. </li>

                 <li> Notify the ASU Police Department at (480) 965-3456 </li>

                 <li> Stay near passengers until police or other assistance arrives, provided it is safe to stay in the building. <br>
