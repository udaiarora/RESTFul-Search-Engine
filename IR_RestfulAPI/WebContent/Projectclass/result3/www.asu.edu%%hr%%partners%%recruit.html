				one, I have been allowed to try new things. I have had my share of "teachable
				moments." They come with support from my colleagues and supervisors. I think
				that ASU makes it easy to grow and develop. What more could you ask for? I love
				coming to work EVERY day!"</P>

				Satisfying employment is available in a quality education/research/business
				environment with interesting and intelligent people. ASU is a diverse,

				arts, sports, lectures, entertainment and a beautiful campus. It's a daily
				"life package" that surely beats just getting a paycheck." </FONT></P>
