<BR>
3.A  Senate President's Report (William Davey).<BR>
<BR>
During the past few weeks many of us have participated in the legislative budget hearings, as well as discussions with our elected officials concerning issues relative to the university, including budgets, the whistle-blower policy, and privacy rights.  I was told the other day by a senator's secretary that they have received over 1,000 bits of communication from university affiliated people.  While we did what we could in terms of asking you to contact your elected officials, and we asked you to let us know if you did contact them that, it sounds like many of you called, sent e-mails or wrote letters and it really did make a difference.  Senator Gnant made a comment about how powerful the university lobbying efforts were.  Thank you all who participated.  At the Senate budget hearings there were approximately 250 supporters from the universities.  While none of us were allowed to speak, it was clear that the gallery was supportive of the universities and the Senate Committee did not really want to hear more supportive comments. Presidents Likins and Lovett and Dr. Glick gave quite conservative yet substantive speeches to the Senate outlining the impact of the proposed budget cuts.  <BR>
<BR>
3.B  University President/Provost's Report (Milton Glick).<BR>
<BR>
As you have just heard from Dr. Davey, you have been heard downtown.  The chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee said that Dwight Eisenhower warned us about the military/industrial complex and that he believes the universities have become the military/industrial complex of the nineties.  At the end of our Senate budget hearing, there were a number of people that asked to speak and the chairman of the committee asked, is there anyone here that wishes to speak against the universities?  Hearing none, he decided he did not need to hear from any of the supporters of the universities.  They already had the message.  It was an interesting budget hearing to say the least.  NAU's president was praised for keeping her faculty so busy that they didn't have time to write legislators.  The UofA's president was critiqued for his aggressive statements.  We shared with them the successes ASU has achieved in the last few years, that we felt that we were doing better on undergraduate education, as shown by a variety of indicators, that we needed the tools to do it better, as well as the tools to allow us to enhance our research enterprise in ways that would make life better for the valley and the state.   <BR>
<BR>
As you may recall, the JLBC recommended we reduce the universities budget by 5% of the faculty payroll, to increase faculty productivity.  We reduced all of the universities' budget by 1/2 the budgeted expenditure for out-of-state travel, and we were urged to reduce the universities budget by a fraction of the Law School's budgets in order that they move toward self-sufficiency over three years.  We urged that those cuts be restored and that, in addition, there be some decision packages for critical needs.  We are cautiously optimistic about the former and still working on the latter.   We are more optimistic at this point but we need to keep watch carefully toward the end of this week.  They will try to complete the budget by Friday.  The chairman of the Senate committee did say that he would not ask any questions due to the number of letters he had received saying that he did not feel that hearing had much purpose at this point.  Nevertheless, people did listen but they did not ask questions.  <BR>
<BR>
We are also very concerned about building renewal funding.  Last year, when we received 100% of the formula, for building renewal, we were able to make some progress in our building needs.  We assumed that was a signal for the future, especially inasmuch as the state agreed to pick up the capital needs for K-12.  The governor has recommended 50% of the formula.  The present legislative recommendation is only 23% of the formula.  We hope to at least to get the governor's number and hopefully beyond that.  From the student's point of view it is especially important that we are now completing a draft of a plan, which over five years would bring every classroom up to par.  At this time, we believe that about 60% of our classrooms are not furnished, conditioned and equipped appropriate to their task.  This is the first time we have had a multi-year plan that has looked at every classroom and decided what is appropriate to that classroom.   <BR>
<BR>
The governor recommended 2.5% merit effective December 1, for each of the next two years.  There is now in the legislative recommendation 2.5% merit for each of the next two years effective April 1.  We are urging that this be effective January 1.  Whatever happens, we are going to have a two-year pay package that is merit based and we have not heard rumors of TIP.  <BR>
<BR>
On a different note, the number of National Merit semi-finalists who have listed ASU as their first choice exceeds by 50% any year in our history; that is a reflection of the efforts that the faculty and staff of this university have made to improve the attractiveness of this institution for talented students.  We should all take real pleasure in that.  <BR>
<BR>
3.C  ASASU President's Report (Paul Frost).         <BR>
<BR>
The student lobbying effort was effective.  We had a rally down at the state capitol and we sent over 2,500 postcards that said, &quot;Don't pull the plug...&quot; into the legislature.  We look forward to further discussion about the budget, as far as the student perspective goes.  That is something I will take up with Provost Glick.<BR>
<BR>
This next weekend at the Board of Regents meeting in Tucson, the students on the ASA Board of Directors will be doing interviews for the new Student Regent and that student will be selected from the University of Arizona.  I believe there are six applicants for that position.  <BR>
<BR>
The ASASU election process has begun.  The primary will be next Tuesday and Wednesday and then that will limit the presidential race to four candidates and then they will runoff against each other.  The final election will be at the end of March.<BR>
 <BR>
3.D  ASUW Senate President's Report (In(s Chisholm).<BR>
<BR>
We now have at West, a Bachelor of Applied Science degree.  There are of five students enrolled now but the program will officially take effect in the fall.  The Bachelor of Applied Science degree will facilitate students coming in from the community colleges with an AA degree and going through the ASUW program and getting their bachelor's degree in a timely manner.  Their 60 credits of an AA degree are automatically accepted as part of the Bachelor of Applied Science degree.  <BR>
<BR>
The other event taking place on our campus right now is a campus-wide discussion of student competency.  What is it that makes our graduates unique; what is it we want our students to look like when they graduate as ASUW students?  We are looking at which good practices of teaching and learning we will commit to as an institution.  Therefore, we have begun the dialogue, which will go on for several more months and possibly into the fall term.<BR>
<BR>
<B>4.  Open Forum.</B><BR>
<BR>
Dr. Davey introduced Richard Satterlie from the Department of  Biology.  <BR>
Dr. Satterlie: I wanted to let the senators know that the Parents Association Professorship award is going to be open again this next year.  The award will be for two years and involves five thousand dollars to the individual, more or less no strings attached, plus five thousand dollars per year to the individual for support of a student assistantship.  You should nominate individuals that you feel have excellence in classroom instruction, although involved in activities that demonstrate creative ability in research.  We have not worked out all the details of the criteria yet, but the general umbrella is &quot;excellence in classroom instruction at the undergraduate level.&quot;  March 1 would be a good time to get your applications in.  There will be two meetings of the committee in March, and then the award will be presented in April.  There will be a recognition dinner.  I want to encourage you all to nominate somebody that you feel fits the criteria.  This award is one of the few that are university-wide that really emphasize classroom instruction at the undergraduate level.<BR>
<BR>
<B>5.  Unfinished Business (Motions from Senate Committees). </B><BR>
<BR>
5.A   Executive Committee (William Davey).<BR>
<BR>
5.A.1  Senate Resolution #16: The Executive Committee recommends that the Academic Senate endorse the 1998 revision of the ASU Philosophy on Intercollegiate Athletics.  The Executive Committee also asks that we suspend the rules and give the document a second reading.  What we have been asked by the president to do is to ratify this document.  This means we do not amend it, we examine the document as a whole and decide whether we believe in it or do not believe in it.  We either vote it up or down.  We will also communicate to the president our reasons for our decision.  Milt Sommerfeld, Chair of the Intercollegiate Athletics Board is present to answer any questions relative to the philosophy.  There is a motion and a second on the floor.  Is there discussion of the 1998 revision of the ICA philosophy document?  The chair hearing no further discussion suggests that we move to a vote.  <BR>
Following a voice vote, the chair ruled that the resolution passed.  Copies of this document may be obtained by calling the Academic Senate Office (965-9245/Darby Shaw).  <BR>
<BR>
5.B  Personnel Committee (William Davey for Ronald Hoffmeister).<BR>
<BR>
5.B.1  Senate Motion #13: The Personnel Committee recommends the Academic Senate approval of the ASU Whistleblower Policy, Senate II draft which includes the amendments that were approved at our January 25 meeting and the special meeting of February 15.  You have all received the revised copy of this document through the mail and over email.  What we are doing today is considering this document as a whole.  <BR>
<BR>
There is a motion to approve the document and a second on the floor.<BR>
We are ready for discussion of the Senate II version of this document as amended by this body.  Is there further discussion of this policy?  <BR>
<BR>
Senator Mingolet: Looking at line 67 of the document, why does it say &quot;demotion with salary reduction&quot;?  <BR>
<BR>
Mary Stevens: This statement was provided from the classified staff policy (SPP Manual).  A demotion for a classified staff member does involve a salary reduction.  You cannot demote a classified staff member without a salary reduction.  In the whistle-blower policy, we are trying to look at all adverse actions that can occur to faculty or staff, to any employee of the university.<BR>
<BR>
If you have your salary reduced, it is considered as a demotion.  That is the way it is for classified staff right now; we do not have that same rule for faculty.  <BR>
<BR>
Senate President Davey: Is there further discussion?  Seeing no discussion, the chair will move to a vote.  <BR>
<BR>
Following a voice vote (two nays were duly recorded), the chair ruled that the motion passed.  Copies of this document may be obtained by calling the Academic Senate Office (965-9245/Darby Shaw).<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to everyone in the house who reviewed of this policy.  As you can see there have been seven revisions of this draft document.  They all have made this policy better as we moved forward.  The one meeting we had was pretty tough on all of us, but that meeting helped crystalize the thinking and make this policy one that does protect people.  I will suggest to you that at Arizona State University, there have only been six whistleblower cases from 1990-1998.  There have been five at NAU and 16 at the UofA.  That is the scope of the issue.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>6.  New Business (Reports/Motions from Senate Committees).</B><BR>
<BR>
6.A  Executive Committee (William Davey). No report.<BR>
<BR>
6.B  Committee on Committees (Timothy Karcher).<BR>
<BR>
The Committee on Committees is at the point in their work where they need to have the cooperation of the various departments.  If you are a senator who is going off the Senate, we would appreciate it if you contacted your unit and made sure that the selection process in your unit is carried out so that the Committee on Committees may have the list of new senators that will be arriving for this coming academic year.<BR>
<BR>
6.C  Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee (Linda Johnson) (No report).<BR>
<BR>
6.D  Personnel Committee (Ronald Hoffmeister)(No report).<BR>
<BR>
6.E  Student-Faculty Policy Committee (John Crawford)(No report).<BR>
<BR>
One of the things that continue to come up periodically is the idea of moving the university to a 12-point grading system.  We passed the will of the Senate about eight years ago, suggesting that was our will.  It was never actually implemented for various technical reasons, as well as some economic considerations.  We are now in the process of putting together a major new computer-based management system for this university, and as a function of going in that direction with millions of dollars being invested, Provost Glick has asked us to do another, more thorough sampling of the faculty to find out the degree of strength for making that a mandatory component of the new computer program.  To that end, I have approached Dr. Bill Lewis at Information Technology and he will set up what will be the first email ballot to all faculty and lecturers and people that have a teaching function.  We will be actually be trying to send an email and asking you to respond to that with a fairly straight forward &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; on whether you would like to see the implementation of a 12-point grading system.  It seems that is something that touches all of us on a very personal level, and it ought to be as close to a pure democratic input as we can arrange.  That is the way that we are going to proceed, to get a reassessment of where we are on those issues.  <BR>
<BR>
Senator Chisholm: Will the East and West faculty also be a part of that survey?<BR>
<BR>
Senator Crawford: I have not planned to have the faculty at East and West polled because I don't think that an action of that sort on this campus automatically involves you. I do not think that you have to do what we do on a grade point.  Although considering the interchange of students between campuses, that might be a very appropriate thing to consider.  <BR>
<BR>
Senator Chisholm: I would like to see you include West and East campus in this survey.<BR>
<BR>
Senator Crawford: I will pass that information along to Bill Lewis.<BR>
<BR>
Senator Grossman: Have there been negative comments on this that you can share?<BR>
<BR>
Senator Crawford: I have heard from others that it tends to exacerbate grade inflation.  It tends to increase conflict between student and teacher because the student that gets the B+ whines to get the A-, etc.  There is more of that kind of activity.  Those are the main things.  In the past a concern was since we do our grades by hand and they are transcribed, the number of errors that would be in the transcription system would be multiplied.  It would be more difficult.  The new system will allow us to enter the grades directly through the computer, and that tends to go away as one of the arguments.  It is something that we need to go as a group on.  Individual faculty could reject having the plus/minus system in their classroom, but that tends to estrange you in some fashion from your colleagues.  It seems to me that either it is something in all university systems that you go with, or you do not.  That is why we want to ask the will of the individual faculty.  <BR>
<BR>
Senator Grossman: Will you present both pro and con arguments on the ballot?  <BR>
<BR>
Senator Crawford: We are going to do it is that we will announce that this is coming up through the Academic Senate Newsletter; we will send out an announcement that it will be coming out on a ballot, and in that announcement there will be a list of pros and cons for faculty that will take the time to read it.  Then when we actually send the ballot out, it will be a very brief, email message that identifies this as a ballot, and asks people to respond.  We are hoping to get an 80% return, which we have never approximated before.  This is an attempt to get a large percentage response.  <BR>
Senator Escobar: Do you have any idea of a timeline when all this will take place?  <BR>
Senator Crawford: I believe we will do it in March (the Newsletter will be coming out).  The ballot will go out soon after that.  <BR>
<BR>
Senator Grossman: If you are aiming for an 80% response, given that is unprecedented, do you have any other criteria for what might constitute the will of the faculty?  In other words if you get a 60% return, will that be enough?<BR>
<BR>
Senator Crawford: That would be over double what we have received before so we probably would be very happy with that as well.  We are going to make this a simple process and hope to achieve a high response rate.  With your help, we may be able to accomplish this.  Encourage the entire faculty in your units to look forward to it and then participate in it.  <BR>
<BR>
Senator Brown (B): If the faculty affirms the 12-point grading system, when can we hope to have it put into effect?<BR>
<BR>
Senator Crawford: If it is an affirmative vote, we will then tell SAP that it is a &quot;must have&quot; component in the new system, and to make sure it is up and running when they roll that system out, which should be within the next two years.  <BR>
<BR>
Senator Burg: What will you consider, 51% of those voting as a simple majority?<BR>
<BR>
Senator Crawford: I guess if it is pure democracy, it would have to be a simple majority.  I do not think we have the right to declare a supermajority.  We are not trying to make this an odious thing.  We just want to make sure that we have the will of the faculty.<BR>
<BR>
Senator Rich: Will the Senate then approve the results?<BR>
<BR>
Senator Crawford: I think we will bypass the representative body; that would be my understanding of Roberts Rules as well.  We will go with the will of the faculty.  Please understand we are going to try to include the lecturers.  We think that anyone having a direct teaching relationship has a right to describe their will, in terms of the most important thing they do, practically.  <BR>
<BR>
Senator Mingolet: What would be the highest grade, an &quot;A+&quot; or an &quot;A&quot;?  <BR>
<BR>
Senator Crawford: The highest generally is an &quot;A&quot; in these systems, then A-, B+, B, B-, C, C-...<BR>
<BR>
Senate President-Elect Burstein: How many of our faculty actually grade on a 60-100 grading system, where 90-100 is an A, 80-90 a B?   You are not grading on that system, you are grading on a 4.0 system.  Whether you know it or not, when you give a 4.0, that is an A, when you give a B it is a 3.0...whatever you think you are doing, that in fact is what the system does.  <BR>
<BR>
Senate President Davey: I would suspect that a resolution would come back from the Student-Faculty Policy Committee.  We would have another chance to look at that; the SFPC would then be the representative body.  <BR>
<BR>
6.F  University Services and Facilities (Rodney Rogers) (no report).<BR>
<BR>
Senate President Davey: I want to announce two ad hoc committees that we will be appointing.  According to our bylaws, every four years we have to do a complete review of our bylaws.  As parliamentarian a few years ago, I chaired that committee and we made over 250 changes to our constitution and bylaws at that time.  I am appointing a committee to review the bylaws again.  I have several members on that committee already, but if there are senators; who wish to participate, please let me know.  I am particularly in need of having some members from the College of Engineering and from the physical and biological sciences.  <BR>
With the help of Mernoy Harrison, the Vice Provost for Administrative Services, we have put together a committee to deal with health insurance issues.  This committee is made up of faculty, staff, retirees, and Disability Resources personnel and Human Resources personnel.  They are looking at the form and scope of our health packages. They are looking at some of the major issues, such as the decline in the number of doctors, the lack of Blue Cross indemnity type systems, and other issues.  Jon Rose has agreed to chair that group and they will have their first meeting on March 4.  They will be asking you also to provide some comments in terms of your positions on our insurance issues.  You may email him at jonathan.rose@asu.edu.  Please feel free to contact him.       <BR>
<BR>
Senator Moore: Can you list the members of the Committee and provide that to the members of the Senate?<BR>
<BR>
Senate President Davey: I will be happy to do that.  I will also send them to the Senate listserve in the near future.<BR>
<BR>
(On February 25, 1999, the senators received by email the names of the members of the Ad Hoc Health Insurance Committee: Dick Murra - retiree; Tedde Sharf - Disability Resources; Brian Crandall - Student Health, classified staff; John Heenan - Human Resources, assigned as staff to AHHIC; Kathy Prewitt, Mathematics, Ira Ellman, Law, Jon Rose, Law - faculty.)<BR>
<BR>
