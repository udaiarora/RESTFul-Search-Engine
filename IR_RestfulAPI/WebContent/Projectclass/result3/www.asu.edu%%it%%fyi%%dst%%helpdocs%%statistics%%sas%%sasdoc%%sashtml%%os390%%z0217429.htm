<P>PROC RELEASE can be used with most sequential
or partitioned data sets, not just with a SAS data library that contains SAS
data sets. However, it cannot be used to release unused space from:
<P>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>the SAS WORK data
library<P>

<LI>extended partitioned data sets (PDSEs)<P>

<LI>ISAM or VSAM data
sets<P>

<LI>multivolume disk-format SAS data libraries<P>

<LI>external multivolume disk-format data
sets.<P>
</UL>

<P>If you delete some members from a SAS data library (using
the DATASETS procedure, for example), you can use the RELEASE procedure to
release the unused space at the end of the last member. You cannot use RELEASE
to release embedded space.  That is, you can release only unused space that
follows the highest track or block that is currently in use, as indicated
by the CONTENTS or DATASETS procedure.
<P>In order to use PROC RELEASE on a SAS data library,
the data library must be closed.  If the library is open, SAS generates an
error message. If you have assigned a libref to the data library and have
used some members of that library in your SAS session, the library will be
open. To close it, issue a LIBNAME statement of the following form:
<P>
<TABLE cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2">
<TR valign="top"><TD>
LIBNAME <I>libref</I> CLEAR;
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>Then
issue a new LIBNAME statement for the data library
and immediately run PROC RELEASE. As an alternative to issuing a second LIBNAME
statement, you can simply specify the data library's name (enclosed in quotes)
as the value of the DDNAME= option in the PROC RELEASE statement, instead
of using a libref.
<P>In the control language, you can release unused space
by using specifications such as SPACE=(,,RLSE) in the DD statement (in batch
mode), or you can use the RELEASE operand of the TSO ALLOCATE command. However,
releasing unused space with PROC RELEASE offers several advantages over methods
provided by the operating environment. For example, with PROC RELEASE, the
user, not the operating environment, controls when unused space is released.
 This advantage is especially applicable to TSO users.
<P>Another advantage of PROC RELEASE is that you can use
PROC RELEASE options to specify exactly how many tracks you want to keep or
release. There is no danger of erasing all or part of a data set because PROC
RELEASE frees only unused space. PROC RELEASE returns unused space to the
pool of available space on the disk volume. Once released, the space is still
available for allocation to the data set, provided a secondary space allocation
is given for the data set in the control language or SAS statement, and provided
all free space on the volume is not subsequently allocated to other data sets.

<DL>
<DT><A name="z0552991">&#13;DDNAME=<B>file-specification</B></A></DT>
<DD>specifies either an physical file name (enclosed
in quotes) or a fileref that refers to the physical file from which to release
unused space.  DDNAME= is required.<P></DD>

<DT><B>options</B></DT>
<DD>specify how much unused space to keep or
release, and specify the unit boundary on which the data set should end. 
<P>
<DL>
<DT>TOTAL=<B>number</B> | TRACKS=<B>number</B></DT>
<DD>specifies the total number of tracks that
the data set should contain after unused space is released, that is, after
PROC RELEASE has executed. For example, the following statement releases all
but ten tracks for the data set that is referenced by the fileref SURVEY:
 



<PRE>proc release ddname=survey total=10;</PRE>
<P>The procedure calculates the amount of space to release
as follows:
<P>
<TABLE cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2">
<TR valign="top"><TD>
amount of space allocated- (value of TOTAL= option) =
amount of unused space released
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>If the value that you specify is smaller than the amount
of used space in the data set, then SAS releases only the unused space at
the end of the data set.<P></DD>

<DT>UNUSED=<B>number</B></DT>
<DD>specifies the number of tracks of unused
space that the data set should contain after PROC RELEASE has executed. The
procedure calculates the amount of unused space to release as follows:
<P>
<TABLE cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2">
<TR valign="top"><TD>
amount of space allocated- (used space + value of UNUSED=
option) = amount of unused space released
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>If the value that you specify is greater than the amount
of unused space at the end of the data set, then no space is released at the
end of the data set.<P></DD>

<DT>RELEASE=<B>number</B></DT>
<DD>specifies how many tracks of unused space
to release. If the value that you specify is greater than the amount of unused
space at the end of the data set, then SAS releases all the unused space at
the end of the data set.<P></DD>

<DT>EXTENTS | EXTENT | EX</DT>
<DD>tells SAS to release only the space that
is allocated to completely unused secondary extents. After the procedure releases
unused space from the data set, the size of the data set is the sum of the
primary extent plus all used secondary extents.<P></DD>
</DL>

<P>If you do not specify one of these options in the PROC
RELEASE statement, then all unused space at the end of the data set is released.
<P> Use the following option to specify the unit boundary
on which the data set should end: 
<P>
<DL>
<DT>BOUNDARY=<B>type</B> | TYPE=<B>type</B></DT>
<DD>specifies whether the data set will end
on a track boundary or on a cylinder boundary.
<P>After the total amount of space to be retained is calculated,
this amount is rounded up to the next unit boundary. Any remaining space is
then released. Remember that the total amount of space will include the space
that is actually used and may also include unused space that was requested
with other options. BOUNDARY=<B>type</B> then will increase the amount
of unused space that is retained in the data set by the portion of the unit
that is needed in order to reach (or round up to) the next boundary. TYPE
can be one of the following: 
<P>
<DL>
<DT>DATASET | DSCB</DT>
<DD>specifies that the data set will end on
the next track or cylinder boundary depending on how space is currently allocated.
If allocated in tracks, the total amount of space to be retained is calculated,
and remaining unused tracks are released. If allocated in cylinders, the space
to be retained is rounded up to the next cylinder boundary, and remaining
unused space is released. This is the default boundary type.<P></DD>

<DT>CYLINDERS | CYLINDER | CYLS | CYL</DT>
<DD>specifies that space to be retained is rounded
to the next cylinder boundary before remaining unused space is released. This
specification is effective only if the data set is currently allocated in
multiples of cylinders.<P></DD>

<DT>TRACKS | TRACK | TRKS | TRK</DT>
<DD>specifies that unused tracks are to be released.
Because the minimum unit of space that can be released is a track, the space
to be retained is not rounded up.<P></DD>

<DT>ALLOC | DD | JCL</DT>
<DD>specifies that space to be retained is rounded
to the next unit boundary (tracks or cylinders) depending on the allocation
unit that was specified in the JCL statement, TSO ALLOCATE command, FILENAME
or LIBNAME statement, or FILENAME or LIBNAME function. For example, the following,
in combination with BOUNDARY=DD, is equivalent to specifying BOUNDARY=CYL:
 



<PRE>//DD2 DD DISP=OLD,DSN=MY.DATA,
//       SPACE=(CYL,2)</PRE><P></DD>
</DL>
<P></DD>

<P>If the messages in the SAS log indicate
that no space was released from the data set, check to see whether the data
set is allocated to another job or to another user.  When PROC RELEASE is
invoked, the operating environment's disk space management function (DADSM)
must be able to obtain exclusive control of the data set. If it cannot, then
no indication that DADSM does not have control is passed to the SAS System,
no space is released from the data set, and no error message is issued by
the SAS System.
