LIST's Newsletter<br>
August, 2003

</center>
<br>
<br>


This month LIST staff are hard at work making some significant improvements in library services and the online environment. Highlights include changes to the home page, and rolling out both Scholars Portal and the new streaming video service. ?We?re LISTening? is also starting a new feature this month: the ?Ask LIST? column, which will appear at the end of each issue.
<br><br><br>
<h3>
Preview Library Home Page Changes</h3>

On the first day of the Fall semester, several changes will appear on the library home page:
<ul>

<li>Quick Links to ?Course Reserves by Course? and ?by Instructor? will change to one link to ?Course Reserves,? which takes the user to a page designed to provide one-stop shopping for reserve for all branches and campuses. This new page provides students with links to electronic reserve search screens, faculty with links to online submission forms for course reserves, and everyone with links to general reserve information.</li>

<li>A new quick link to ?Video Courses Online,? the digital service replacing videotapes for Distance Learning courses, will take users to a new page with information about the service and links to search for courses.
</li>

<li>News items will be added for the unveiling of Scholars Portal and the Reference move, while the Remote Storage news item will be updated to reflect the operational status of the facility. The new Video Courses Online service will also have a link under News.
</li>

<li>A new button will be added to the home page for ?Multi-Database Search,? a.k.a. Scholars Portal (more information below), which will link users to this exciting new resource.
</li>
</ul> 

You can preview the new page before it goes live next Monday at [preview link replaced with actual home page for online issue]: <a href=http://www.asu.edu/lib>http://www.asu.edu/lib</a>. (Please note that all the links work except links to services that will not be operational before Monday.) 

 <p>

We?ve also made some cosmetic changes: the ?mouseover? color on the links is now a darker gold so it?s easier to read the text, and the fonts are all scalable in the browser for users who want to increase or decrease the font size on library pages. 
<p><br>

<h3>Scholars Portal Goes Live as ?Multi-Database Search?</h3>

After nearly a year of development work, ASU Library is ready to unveil its preliminary version of the Fretwell-Downing Zportal product, otherwise known as Scholars Portal. User testing revealed an overwhelming preference for the name Multi-Database Search, over five other options, because the name clearly indicates what the resource does. 
<p>
The new Multi-Database Search will be accessed from a button on the home page (see the preview above), and it will have its own look and feel based on the ASU Main home page colors. The search engine is being upgraded this week, so we will send out a URL by library-wide email as soon as the system is functional for library staff to try it out. We will also be scheduling a demonstration of the system in the first or second week of school. The initial set of databases searchable through this interface will be limited, and users will be encouraged to provide feedback evaluating this interface.  As more and more electronic resources become MDS-accessible, additional collections will be created and added to the interface.  User licenses will be closely monitored to ensure that limits are not exceeded, and adjustments will be made, as appropriate.  ASURITE IDs are used to authenticate patrons into the portal, using the ?standard? ASURITE authentication web interface. Please send comments on the new Multi-Database Search tool to <a href=mailto:ScholarsPortal@asu.edu>ScholarsPortal@asu.edu</a>.

<h3>Ask LIST</h3>

<i>Please send questions on any library technology topic to Heather Knowles to be answered in future columns.</i>
<p>

<b>Q. &nbsp; &nbsp;  Whenever I have a computer-related problem, I have always called [staffer?s name] in the LIST department.  I just found out that s/he is no longer with the department, and I need to know who in the department I should now call to handle my computer problems?</b>
<p>
 
A. &nbsp; &nbsp;  The most reliable way to get service from LIST is to use the SOS desk. LIST employees have many responsibilities throughout the Libraries and may be away from their desks much of the day, but the SOS desk is staffed at all times. All calls and email reports through the SOS desk are given a tracking number and referred to the most appropriate person in the department for resolution. Using the SOS system ensures that you will receive the most timely and appropriate response to your computer problem.  You can reach the system by calling 5-9093 or by submitting an online SOS ticket at http://sos.lib.asu.edu/form.html.
