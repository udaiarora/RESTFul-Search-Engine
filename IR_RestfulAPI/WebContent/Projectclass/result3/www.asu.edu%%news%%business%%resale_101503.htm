      <h2>Greater Phoenix resale market returns to torrid pace</h2>
      <p>Rebounding from a slowing trend, the Greater Phoenix resale housing
        market returned to a torrid pace setting a record for the month with
        8,185 transactions in September. This brought third quarter 2003 to a
        quarterly record of 20,560 sales, according to data released by the Arizona
        Real Estate Center. </p>
      <p>"Typically the third quarter reveals a slowing pace from the traditionally
        higher levels of activity in the second quarter, which stood at 19,845
        sales for second quarter 2003," said Dr. Jay Q. Butler, director of the
        center. "2003 appears to be repeating the pattern of 2002, which demonstrated
        considerable strength in the latter months of the year. Having established
        this strong pace, the year-to-date total of 55,435 homes sold has already
        topped the 46,850 sales recorded by this time last year."</p>
      <p>Butler explained that even though the median price followed a typical
        pattern by cooling from a record $160,500 in August to $157,500 for September
        2003, the quarterly median price was a record $159,500. Since the Greater
        Phoenix area is so large, the median price can range significantly from
        $365,000 in North Scottsdale to $89,750 in the central western areas
        of Phoenix. For third quarter 2003, 51 percent of all recorded sales
        were for homes priced from $100,000 to $175,000 and 14 percent for homes
        priced over $300,000. </p>
      <p>Butler offered several reasons for the resurgence of the local resale
        housing market. "Although mortgage interest rates have been falling in
        the last few weeks, they have been rising for most of the year," he said.
        "Some people may have wanted to take advantage of still favorable interest
        rate environment to gain homeownership or to improve on their current
        housing. There have been some progressive signs that the economy is finally
        beginning to steadily, but slowly, expand. Even though the job market
        continues to be weak and consumer confidence low, people have not lost
        faith in their live-in investment. However, the key question remains
        as to whether the current levels of activity represent the final vestiges
        of people satisfying their dreams and for the future-- how many people
        are left still seeking their dream."<br>
          <br>
          The resale townhouse/condominium sector followed a typical pattern
          by slowing from 4,165 recorded sales in third quarter 2003 to 3,745,
          but was well ahead of last year's 3,330. For 2003 year to date (YTD),
          the activity stands at 11,125 units, in contrast to 9,990 for 2002
          YTD. The median price slowed slightly from $103,375 in the second quarter
          to $103,000, but was well above last year's $95,000. Since this housing
          sector is a good source of affordable housing, the strong increase
          in median price could be adversely impact the market activity. </p>
      <p>The median square footage for a single-family home recorded sold in
        third quarter 2003 was 1,690 square feet, which is larger than the 1,650
        reported a year ago. In the townhouse/condominium sector, the median
        square footage was 1,145 square feet, which is smaller than the 1,150
