<h2>Press Release:<br />
<acronym title="Preservation and Access for Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym> 
Keynotes Present Diverse Views Of Preservation</h2>

<h4>March 2004</h4>

<p>In March, archivists, technology administrators, records managers, registrars, faculty, 
librarians and university administrators reviewed the state of play in retention and 
dissemination of university research at 
<acronym title="Preservation and Access for Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym> 
2004. Interdisciplinary discussions 
revealed the wide variety of applications and information policies that impact the future 
availability of university research data, administrative records and publications.</p>

<p>David Sobel, General Counsel for the Electronic Information Privacy Center, kicked off 
the event with an informative after-dinner update on the status of the USA Patriot Act 
and other government efforts to acquire personal information for anti-terrorist 
investigations. He noted that despite the efforts of 
<acronym title="Electronic Information Privacy Center">EPIC</acronym> and other concerned 
organizations, "We really don't know more about the operation of the Patriot Act than we 
did a year and a half ago." Sobel underscored the differences between information 
requests authorized by Section 215 of the Patriot Act, National Security Letters, and 
projects like the Transportation Security Administration's CAPPSII program for 
screening airline passengers. He also noted places where the Patriot Act has nullified 
privacy protections of <acronym title="Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act">FERPA</acronym>, 
and government efforts to acquire information about anti-
war demonstrators at Drake University. "What we're seeing is a trend of continuing to 
expand both the government's authority to seek information and also to expand the 
categories of information that can be obtained."</p>

<p>The following morning Clifford Lynch, Executive Director of the Coalition for 
Networked Information, offered his fifth 
<acronym title="Preservation and Access for Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym> 
keynote address over breakfast. <abbr lang="en" title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> 
Lynch focused on the increasing interdependence of teaching, research and scholarly 
communication. Using learning management systems as an example, Lynch said "It's 
getting very hard to tell what's a record, what is research, and what is teaching and 
learning." He also noted that international, inter-institutional and student/faculty 
collaborations are making ownership of intellectual property a much more complex issue 
than before, and that most universities are not addressing these "hard issues".</p>

<p>Lynch continued by citing the recently approved policy of the National Institutes of 
Health that requires recipients of large grants to include a plan for preserving and 
disseminating research data. He noted that some scholarly publishers now require that 
raw data be made accessible as part of the agreement to publish research results. But 
Lynch also recognized that disciplinary repositories and scholarly associations often fund 
data retention through grants and even single bequests. "Government funding is a 
dangerous thing to count on across long periods of time. How are we going to bring 
disciplinary content back into universities when we have funding failures elsewhere?"</p>

<p>Nineteen other speakers from universities and businesses across the United States and 
Canada reviewed a variety of research data management and dissemination issues 
including institutional repositories, metadata creation and management, digital signatures, 
federated databases, student privacy, website preservation and records management for 
learning management systems. Many of the sessions featured examples of direct 
collaborations between information professionals and research faculty. Presenters and 
attendees hailed from prestigious research universities such as Harvard, Yale, and 
Stanford.</p>

<p>Presentation slides from the conference sessions and the videostreamed Sobel and Lynch 
keynotes are being added to the 
<acronym title="Preservation and Access for Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym> 2004 
site archives (<a href="../archives.html">www.asu.edu/ecure/archives.html</a>). 
<acronym title="Preservation and Access for Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym> 2005 
will be held in March at Arizona State University and the <a href="../proposals.html">Call for Papers is 
currently available</a>.</p>
