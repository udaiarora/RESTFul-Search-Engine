SAS Technical Report R-106, The Sweep Operator: Its Importance in Statistical Computing
</H1><P>
Describes how to use Gauss-Jordan elimination for least squares. The       report builds to the description of a completely generalized sweep
operator that computes and stores (X'X)-, (X'X)-X'X, (X'X)-X'Y, and        Y'Y-Y'X(X'X)-X'Y, all in the space of a single upper-triangular matrix.
