<P>Hafiz. <I>The Poems of Shemseddin Mohammed Hafiz of Shiraz, Now First
Completely Done into English Verse from the Persian, in Accordance with
the Original Forms</I>. Introduction by John Payne. 3 v. London: Villon
society by private subscription and circulation only, 1901. Contents: v.1-2
Odes; v.3 Odes, quatrains, couplets, epodes, cinquains, notes. The Pre-Raphaelite
poet, John Payne (1842-1916), dedicates this work to &quot;the memory of
my friend Edward Burne Jones&quot; since the work &quot;owed its completion
to his urgent instance.&quot; In his introduction Payne states that he
is translating the works of the greatest of Persian poets, Shemseddin Mohammed
Hafiz, who lived in the fourteenth century. There are no official records
for Hafiz life, so the &quot;only trustworthy data at our disposal, respecting
the life and career of Hafiz, are those to be gathered from the study of
his poems and from such painstaking and authoritative commentaries upon
the latter as that of the Turkish seventeenth century writer Soudi.&quot;
Payne notes further that Hafiz became a very popular poet among Persian-speaking
peoples, holding much the same esteem as Shakespeare does in Payne's own
society. This three volume work was privately printed and each of the signatures
is folded asymmetrically for a pleasing visual effect. PRB-116</P>

According to the Prefatory these poems were originally published over a
period of fifty years in varous journals and were frequently review by
Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The poems have &quot;a solemn and distinct note,
little confusible with the other notes of the concerted song of poets.&quot;
Hake &quot;writes movingly of dreams and sleep; and his study of these
has added to all or almost all his verse something of the ecstasy of dreams.&quot;

has done a verse translation of Homer. Line numbers are included. According
to Aymer Vallance in his biography entitled William Morris: His Art His
Writings and His Public Life, &quot;Morris gave us a translation of the
entire Odyssey, which, though it missed the Homeric dignity, secured the
eagerness as completely as Chapman's free-and-easy paraphrase, and in a
rendering as literal as Buckley's prose crib, which lay frankly by Morris's
side as he wrote&quot; (211). PRB-115</P>

<P>Horner, Frances. <I>Time Remembered</I>. Includes material on the Pre-Raphaelites,
especially Burne-Jones. London: Heinemann, 1933. Frances Horner has written
about her life, especially as it relates to famous figures of her day.
Of special interest is the information &quot;about that remarkable company
of artists and men of letters whome we call the Pre-Raphaelites. The fame
of these men, like all fame, has passed through an eclipse. They were esteemed
highly by their contemporaries. They were depreciated by the immediate
successors of those who knew them. Now that reaction has spent its force
and there are signs that we are near the time when a just estimate can
be made of the worth of their work, Lady Horner, in this book, helps us
to reach the final judgement&quot; (Preface xiv). PRB-19</P>
