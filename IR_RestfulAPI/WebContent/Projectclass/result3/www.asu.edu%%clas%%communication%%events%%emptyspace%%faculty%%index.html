</a>Jennifer Linde </h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"><img src="images/Linde_001.jpg" alt="Linde" width="150" height="159" align="right" class="textonleft">I am a lecturer in the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication and the Artistic Director of The Empty Space. I have designed and taught performance studies courses relating to communication and creativity, oral interpretation of literature, performance of sexuality, performance of ethnography, performance of literature by women, and performance theory.</p>
<p>In my position as artistic director, I serve as advisor, script consultant, and director of a variety of laboratory performance projects presented by undergraduate and graduate students at The Empty Space. I passionately believe that performance studies offers students a vehicle to demonstrate an embodied understanding of their reactions, realities, and truths, as well as a method to critically evaluate communicative issues of personal and social significance. The laboratory work at the Empty Space is vibrant and complex and I am strongly committed to the students who choose to engage in it. </p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="Davis"></a>Dr. Olga Idriss Davis</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"><img src="images/Davis.jpg" width="114" height="176" align="left" class="textonright">Olga Idriss Davis is Associate Professor of Performance Studies and Women&rsquo;s Studies in The Hugh Downs School of Human Communication. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and is an alumna of The Juilliard School in drama. Professor Davis made her television debut in a recurring role as Student Nurse on the ABC daytime drama, &ldquo;General Hospital.&rdquo; Her stage debut occurred with the late Rock Hudson, Claire Trevor, and Leif Erickson in the bi-centennial production of &ldquo;John Brown&rsquo;s Body&rdquo; directed by John Houseman. As a Rockefeller fellow, she conducted research on the performative and liberatory nature of Black female slave narratives. Her current scholarship extends the role of narrative in the lives of African American survivors of the Tulsa, Oklahoma Race Riot of 1921. Inspired by a graduate course created by Davis that explores survival discourse, the show entitled Performing Survival: Narratives of Cultural Memory, Struggle, and Resistance was directed by Davis and performed by graduate students of the course. The show and course offered a sobering look at the inner experiences of survivors of the Jewish holocaust, Native American boarding schools, Tulsa Race Riot, and Japanese American internment camps.</p>
<p>Davis&rsquo; research interests include ritual and identity in the African Diaspora, womanist theory, and the performance of African American women&rsquo;s rhetorical and performative traditions. Her originally-authored dramatic performance entitled, &ldquo;Standing on the Hyphen: Weaving Threads of African-American Women&rsquo;s Identity, interrogates the racialized and gendered spaces of hyphenated identity through the metaphor of the quilt. A co-edited book with Marsha Houston entitled, Centering Ourselves: African American Feminist and Womanist Studies of Discourse, examines the lived experience of Black women&rsquo;s communication and is now available by Hampton Press.</p>

<h2 align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="Fuller"></a>Dr. Linda Park-Fuller</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"><img src="images/parkfuller.jpg" alt="Fuller" width="150" height="187" align="right" class="textonleft">I consider myself a teacher/artist/scholar. The study and practice of performance as a dynamic mode of human communication comprise both my expertise and my personal passion. I enjoy teaching Performance Studies courses, and especially appreciate the diverse contributions that my students bring to them. I also welcome opportunities to advise student-originated performances and supervise research about performance. Lately, my interests and artistic activities center on the performance of personal narrative through performative writing and Playback Theatre.</p>
<p>Prior to coming to ASU in 2000, I taught Performance Studies in a Theatre and Dance department at Southwest Missouri State University, and before that, in a Communication department at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota. In 1993, I developed a performance about my experiences as a breast cancer survivor and toured it nationally for several years--appearing at theatres, universities, hospitals, community groups, and conferences. I have also organized and instructed co-curricular performance troupes specializing in interactive Theatre of the Oppressed and Playback Theatre. I have directed numerous stage productions--many of which were my original adaptations. I have published in Text and Performance Quarterly, Communication Education, Literature in Performance, and have contributed chapters to several books. I am a past chairperson of the National Communication Association&rsquo;s Performance Studies Division, and an Associate Editor of Text and Performance Quarterly.</p>

<h2 align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="Corey"></a>Dr. Frederick C. Corey</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"><img src="images/Corey.jpg" width="150" height="171" align="left" class="textonright">My interest in performance is connected to my interest in the human body as a site of cultural value. I trace this interest throughout my academic career, from my dissertation, a study of Martha Graham&rsquo;s use of classical tragedy in modern dance, to my most recent interests, psychoanalytic interpretations of gender and sexuality. Much of my work focuses on the gay male body, and I have essays and chapters on the gay male body published in Text and Performance Quarterly, Canadian Journal of Political and Social Theory, Journal of Homosexuality, Communication of Prejudice, and Communication and the Disenfranchised. I have worked as well with narrative, and I am especially interested in narratives that initiate social change. Topics I have explored at length include HIV education, young men in prison, and the corporeal desert. </p>
