Surplus Property and Recycling is responsible for the reassignment of departmental <a href="pcs004.html#excessproperty" target="New">excess property</a>, disposal of ASU surplus property and scrap, and the recycling of materials, as well as management of <a href="pcs004.html#temporarywarehousestorage" target="New">temporary warehouse storage</a>.<p><img src="pcshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Policy</b></font></center><img src="pcshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Disposal and Sale of ASU Surplus Property</b></font><p>All <a href="pcs004.html#surplusproperty" target="New">surplus property</a> is transferred to Surplus Property and Recycling unless a trade-in is made by the department.  When a department has surplus property, the property is transferred to the Surplus Property Warehouse by university movers, department personnel, or Surplus Property and Recycling.<p><blockquote><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>The releasing department must remove licensed software from computers before transferring them to Surplus Property and Recycling.</td></tr></table></blockquote></p><p>After property is transferred to the Surplus Property Warehouse, it will be made available to university departments, at no charge in most cases, for 15 calendar days unless <a href="pcs004.html#interdepartmentalsalesrights" target="New">Interdepartmental Sales Rights (ISR)</a> are reserved on the property. At the discretion of the Surplus Property and Recycling manager, some items may not be held for 15 days. Once property is received at Surplus Property and inventoried, it becomes the property of Surplus Property.<p>If departments choose the ISR field on a Property Relocation Authorization form, the proceeds from the sale of property costing more than &#036;2,000 per unit are distributed to the transferring department in accordance with the <a href="#Surplus"><b>Surplus Property and Recycling Sales Rebate Schedule</b></a> at the end of this policy.<p>After 15 calendar days, if property has not been reassigned to another department, it is declared surplus property and made available for sale to the general public.  If property is not sold after 30 days, the Surplus Property and Recycling manager reserves the right to adjust the sales price of the property to increase the chances of sale. If ISR is reserved, the Surplus Property and Recycling manager will contact the department to request a better asking price. If the Surplus Property and Recycling manager cannot agree with the department on a reasonable asking price, the property may be returned to the department.<p>Sales of <a href="pcs004.html#scrap" target="New">scrap</a> (metals, aluminum, copper, etc.) are made to outside dealers as volume and prices dictate.<p>External sales of surplus property by department personnel must be coordinated with the Surplus Property and Recycling manager. The distribution of proceeds from the sale will be in accordance with the distribution chart at the end of this policy. <p><font size=+1><b>Donations by Surplus Property</b></font><p>The university cannot donate property to any organization. The manager of Surplus Property may discount the usual selling price of certain designated surplus items by up to 50&#037; for sale to tax-exempt organizations that further the university&#146;s mission of education, research, and service. Organizations determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be tax-exempt that further the university&#146;s mission of education, research, and service may make a request to the manager of Surplus Property for receipt of surplus property at a discounted price. A university department interested in this type of exchange may address their request to the manager of Surplus Property stating the property involved and the receiving tax-exempt organization(s). The non-monetary consideration received by the university from the receiving organization shall be documented as part of the transaction record.<p><font size=+1><b>Sale of ASU Surplus Vehicles</b></font><p>Motor and mobile vehicles will be available for sale to the general public immediately after the vehicles are inventoried at Surplus Property. Vehicles are available for sale by sealed bid only during the first three working days they are made available. The bids must be at least the price on the vehicle window. All bids will be accepted in a sealed envelope with the vehicle&#146;s description (year, make, and/or vehicle number), bid amount, bidder&#146;s name, and daytime phone number. Bids are date- and time-stamped upon receipt. <p>Bids will be opened on the fourth working day, and the highest bidder with the earliest submission will be awarded the bid. If no bids are submitted or all bids submitted are below the window price, only written bids will be accepted and considered on an individual basis.<p>Payment for all bid items is due at the close of business on the day after bids are opened. Acceptable payment on all bid items is either a cashier&#146;s check or cash. No other form of payment will be accepted for the purchase of bid items. The vehicle(s) is to be removed from the Surplus Property yard within five working days of notification.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Storage of Property</b></font><p>Storage of property at the Surplus Property Warehouse may not exceed one year (see <a href="pcs1002-07.html">PCS 1002&#150;07</a>, &#147;Temporary Warehouse Storage&#148;).<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Surplus Property Arising from Remodeling Projects</b></font><p>For <a href="pcs004.html#remodeling" target="New">remodeling</a> projects, but before issuance of the Notice to Contractors of Intent to Receive Bids, the Department of Facilities Management project manager sets up an area walk-through consisting of a representative from:<p><ol><li>the Department of Facilities Management (arrangements made through the assistant director for crafts)<p> and</li><p><li>Surplus Property and Recycling (arrangements made through the Surplus Property and Recycling manager).</li></ol><p>For existing material that will become available during the renovation:<p><ol><li>the Department of Facilities Management has first right to the material, if it can be used by the department for campus projects<p> and</li><p><li>Surplus Property and Recycling has next right to the material, if it has economic sales value.</li></ol><p>For Surplus Property and Recycling to determine economic sales value, the Department of Facilities Management must provide estimated charges in writing to the department for any time-consuming disassembling required for items tentatively selected by the department.
