    <H4><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Checking tapes into the tape
    library</FONT></H4>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Academic customers may check
    in round reel or cartridge tapes containing data they wish to
    use. The customer fills out a Tape Volume Control Form, specifying
    the customer's name, campus address, userid, and other pertinent
    information.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The tape librarian gives the
    owner a receipt for the volume (i.e., a copy of the Tape Volume
    Control Form) at the time of check-in. The customer must present
    this receipt to remove the volume from the library. The receipt
    indicates what volume serial number has been assigned to the
    tape.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When the customer's tape is checked
    in, the data on the tape will be copied by the tape librarian
    onto a cartridge tape which will be used by the customer's computer
    programs. The librarian will inform the customer how long it
    will be before the cartridge tape may be used; this is typically
    15 to 30 minutes, although it depends on how busy the librarian
    is.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Once a customer's tape has been
    copied to a cartridge tape, the customer will be expected to
    remove the original tape from the tape library. The customer
    should present his copy of the Tape Volume Control Form; the
    tape librarian will make a notation on the form that the original
    tape has been checked out. If after two weeks the owner of the
    tape has not yet removed the original from the library, an effort
    will be make to contact the customer and request that the tape
    be picked up. If the customer cannot be reached, the tape will
    be returned via campus mail to the address given on the Tape
    Volume Control Form.</FONT></P>

    <H4><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Requesting a new blank tape</FONT></H4>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A customer may also request a
    blank tape for use on the system. To request a blank tape, the
    customer completes a Tape Volume Control Form at the tape library.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The customer must specify on
    the Tape Volume Control Form whether the tape should be initialized
    as an IBM standard label (SL) or nonlabeled (NL) volume.</FONT></P>

    <H4><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Tape protection</FONT></H4>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Tapes checked into the tape library
    or assigned to a customer's userid prior to May 16, 1992 will
    be write protected via RACF. That is, only the owner may write
    to the tape, and any customer can read it. Tapes checked in or
    assigned after May 16, 1992 will be read/write protected via
    RACF. That is, only the owner may read from or write to the tape.
    The owner may grant or deny read or write access to a tape for
    one or more individuals using RACF utilities on the Academic
    MVS system.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If the customer only intends
    to read the tape and not write to it, he/she can specify &quot;READ
    ONLY&quot; on the Tape Volume Control Form as a precautionary
    measure indicating that the volume will only be read. If &quot;READ
    ONLY&quot; is specified, a hardware interlock on the cartridge
    is set so that the tape cannot be written to, regardless of the
    level of RACF protection.</FONT></P>

    <H4><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Checking tapes out of the tape
    library</FONT></H4>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The customer must return his
    copy of the Tape Volume Control Form to the tape librarian to
    remove the volume from the library.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Without special exception, the
    tape owner is the only one who may check the tape out of the
    library.</FONT>&nbsp;</TD>
