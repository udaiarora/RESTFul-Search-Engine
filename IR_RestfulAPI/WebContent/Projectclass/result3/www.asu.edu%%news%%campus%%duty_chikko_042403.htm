      <h2>ASU employee looks back on life in Iraq; grateful to U.S.
        troops</h2>
      <p>        Like many of her fellow Americans, Madeline Chikko has been watching
          a lot of news lately. But for her, the scenes from Iraq don't represent
          some unfamiliar, foreign place. </p>
      <p>To Chikko, business manager for the
            Advanced Public Executive Program at ASU's Downtown Center, Iraq
        is her birthplace and childhood home. </p>
      <p>She and her family fled Kirkuk, Iraq, 27 years ago to escape the brutal
          reign of Saddam Hussein. Chikko's family members, who are Assyrian
        Christians, immigrated to Chicago, where she lived until moving to Phoenix
        three
          years ago.</p>
      <p>She says she will never forget April 9th when coalition troops
          took over downtown Baghdad. At 4 a.m. that morning she received an
        enthusiastic phone call from her brother in Chicago.</p>
      <p>"'It's over!'" he shouted breathlessly,'"
          Chikko recalls. "'It's the beginning of the end of Saddam's brutal
        regime! Madeline, wake up, it's
        here; the day is finally here!'"</p>
      <p>"'I know,' I told him. 'I've been up
          all night watching CNN.'"</p>
      <p>After talking
          with her brother, Chikko says she turned her attention back to the
        scene unfolding on television.</p>
      <p>"I was awake, but I felt like
          I was dreaming," she says. "I was watching overjoyed Iraqis' euphorically
          dancing in the streets of Baghdad. It
          was amazing!"</p>
      <p>As she watched Saddam's statue being pulled down by U.S.
          Marines, Chikko says she felt conflicting emotions. The scene was spectacular,
          but Chikko
          would have preferred to see the Iraqis topple the statue on their own
          - even if it had taken hours.</p>
      <p>"I believe, even if emblematic, that toppling
          the statue with their own hands would have given them - and all the
        rest of the Iraqi people -
          a sense of pride, the feeling of being part of the revolution and the
          overthrow of Saddam," she says. "But, even in this moment of symbolic
          victory, they were powerless. They couldn't even bring the statue down
          by themselves."</p>
      <p>Chikko says her mother is thrilled and has already started
          talking about making a trip back to see family in Kirkuk, the town
        where Chikko says
          she and her family suffered countless basic human rights violations.</p>
      <p>"Many
          times in the middle of the night they would raid my home and go through
          our personal belongings, tearing framed pictures off of walls,
          slashing mattresses and pillows looking for evidence to prosecute my
        father and brothers," she says.</p>
      <p>Leaving everything and fleeing Kirkuk
          was an agonizing decision for Chikko's father to make. </p>
      <p>"For fear for his life and ours, he decided we should
          escape the country and leave behind our relatives, friends, possessions
          and belongings,"
          she says. </p>
      <p>Chikko says it is because she knows firsthand how vicious Hussein's
          regime has been, that she is so grateful to the U.S. troops now liberating
          the
          people of Iraq.</p>
      <p>"To those with sons or daughters, sisters or brothers
          serving, I would like to say thank you," she says. "And, to assure
        them their loved ones
          are not only protecting our freedom here, but they are laying the foundation
          for a peaceful, secure and a free Iraq."</p>
      <p>Chikko says her hope for the
          Iraqi people is that they will soon experience what it feels like to
          live in the same kind of democracy she and her
          family enjoy living here in America. </p>
      <p>"It is only fair that they know
          this freedom, since they paid in full for it with their blood, tears
          and honor, and more," she says. "I want
          the people of Iraq to live in peace, for all the people of Iraq to
        find a peaceful coexistence that will allow them to rebuild and prosper." </p>
