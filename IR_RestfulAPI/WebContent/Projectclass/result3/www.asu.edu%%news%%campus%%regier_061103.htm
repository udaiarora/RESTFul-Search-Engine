      <h2>Dr. Philip Regier to lead W. P. Carey School of Business</h2>
      <p> Dr. Philip R. Regier has been named interim dean of the W. P. Carey
        School of Business at Arizona State University, effective July 1, 2003.</p>
      <p> Regier will work closely with Dean Larry Edward Penley during the next
        two months to provide a smooth leadership transition as Penley prepares
        to take on his new role as president of Colorado State University and
        chancellor of the Colorado State University system. Penley has been dean
        of the W. P. Carey School at ASU for the past 12 years.</p>
      <p>"It is critical that the momentum of the W. P. Carey School continue,
        and Dr. Regier has the full support and confidence of the administration
        to ensure it does," said Milton Glick, executive vice president and provost
        of the university. "I believe the W. P. Carey School is well positioned
        to attract an outstanding dean and we are committed to achieving that
        through a national search." </p>
      <p> Regier is the associate dean for undergraduate programs and the director
        of Business Honors, a post he has held since 1999. He joined the faculty
        of the School of Accountancy in 1987. He completed his baccalaureate
        degree at St. John's College - Santa Fe and his Ph.D. at University of
        Illinois at Urbana - Champaign.</p>
      <p> Under his leadership, the W. P. Carey degree has been re-designed to
        assure that every student, regardless of major, gains an advanced understanding
        of technology and its impact on all functional areas of business. Implementation
        of the curriculum change included the development of a laptop initiative,
        which utilizes wireless laptop computers to make every classroom in the
        business complex a computer classroom as needed.</p>
      <p> Regier was instrumental in the creation of the Rodel Community Scholars
        program, which pairs teams of Business Honors students with area high
        schools to address student retention. He was also a key player in the
        development of a partnership with Ford Motor Company, which resulted
        in the Certificate in Dealership Management -- a new addition to the
        specialized offerings within the business degree. Regier has underscored
        the W. P. Carey School's commitment to Business Honors, most recently
        supporting the creation of Honors Consulting. The school has also enhanced
        internship opportunities for students and is moving toward increased
        career services for undergraduates. </p>
      <p>&quot;I am very confident in Phil Regier's ability to maintain our school's
        trajectory during a very important period in its history," said Penley.
        "He is an excellent choice. He understands the significance of academic
        quality and he already works well with the business community. As a member
        of the school's senior leadership for several years, he has contributed
        to and shares the vision of the W. P. Carey School. Phil's appointment
        gives me a sense of confidence in the school's future as I depart." </p>
      <p>Regier pledged to keep the school moving.</p>
      <p> "My role will be to continue the momentum that characterizes the W.
        P. Carey School, and to work with the deans, department chairs and directors
        to help realize the potential created by our naming," Regier said. "I
        will also work with the search committee to assure that this position
        remains one of the most attractive business school positions in the country."</p>
