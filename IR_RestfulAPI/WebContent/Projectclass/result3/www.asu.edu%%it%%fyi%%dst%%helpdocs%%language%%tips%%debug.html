Debugging Programs in UNIX
</center></h2>
<p>
Question: if my program dumps a core file saying illegal instruction, 
how do I debug it to get more info. like where it dumps core and which 
is the illegal instruction. is there any way out to find it from core?
<p> 
Response:
If you have compiled the program with the correct flags the utility for
debugging programs in any UNIX system is "dbx" and uses the core file  ...
<p><ol> 
<li>To find about the flags for the compiler, you need to use to be able 
to debug type:
<blockquote>
       " man cc "  <----  for C<br>
       " man f77 " <-----  for Fortran
</blockquote><p> 
On RS/6000 (research cluster) you need to type:
<blockquote>
       "man xlc"<br>
       "man xlf "  respectively for C and Fortran....
</blockquote><p> 
Note: But in most UNIX systems the debug flag is -g ....
 <p><blockquote>
f77 -g program.f
</blockquote><p> 
<li>For more information on dbx enter "man dbx" at the system prompt.
Some of the systems have more sophisticated debuggers with GUI 
interface, but its different from system to a system, and may not be 
available on all.  
<p> 

<li>The "core" file is used by dbx for debugging, but before you start 
debugging, you must have compiled with the right flags....
DBX is called symbolic debuger, and that means it needs to be able to
associate addresses (numbers) with symbols (program variables, lines, 
etc.).  Thus the compiled program that you execute must have that 
information and this makes it larger in size than the default 
executable.
