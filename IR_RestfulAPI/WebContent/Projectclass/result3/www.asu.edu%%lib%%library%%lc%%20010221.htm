                  <br><h2 align="center">Minutes of Meeting</h2>
                  <br>
                  <p align="center"><b>February 21 , 2001</b></p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Meeting called to order at 3:00 p.m.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Chair: Pat Etter</p>
  <p>Secretary: Marilyn Wurzburger</p>
    <p>A quorum was present.</p>
    <p>Distributions: Performance-Based Salary Plan, April 20, 1995. </p>
    <br>
  <h2>I. Approval of Minutes</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Minutes of October 18, 2000, meeting were approved as written. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;                  </p>
  <h2>II. Chair &amp; Executive Committee Report</h2>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Pat Etter welcomed Gregory Green, Southeast Asian bibliographer, as a new member of Council. She bid farewell to Gordon Dutrisac, who has accepted a post in Seattle, and gave her thanks to Marilyn Wurzburger for agreeing to serve as Secretary for the rest of Gordon&rsquo;s term. At the March 21 meeting of Council Provost Milton Glick has been invited to address the group. He will speak at 3pm; the business meeting will follow his remarks. At the April 18 meeting Brooke Sheldon, the new director of the Arizona School of Information Resources and Library Science, will be addressing the group, and plans are to invite members of the classified staff to attend who might be interested in her presentation. </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h2>III. Dean's Report</h2>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Kurt Murphy substituted for the Dean. Kurt referred to the 1995 Salary Plan and the formula used therein. The Library Administration will be using an extension of that formula to determine merit awards, but will address market equity or compression issues as a separate exercise. Last year entry level salaries were boosted to $36,000, resulting in compression at mid and top levels. This year salaries for Associate and Full Librarians at the top end of the salary scale will be evaluated for market/equity adjustments. Mid-range salaries will be evaluated next year, completing the three-year cycle begun last year. There is no funding available for market equity adjustments now.
                  </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;                  </p>
                  <h2>IV. Committee Reports</h2>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h3>Personnel Committee - Helen Seaton</h3>
                  <p>&ldquo;Marion, the Librarian&rdquo; packets are now completed and have been sent to Kurt&rsquo;s office for review. They will then be given to the Review Committee for critical review. Helen added that proposed revisions to the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook will be considered under New Business. </p>
                  <h3>Review Committee - Mary Swaty</h3>
                  <p>Mary stated that the Committee had recommendations for revisions to the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook to be considered under New Business. </p>
                  <h3>Research and Professional Development Committee - Tom Greives</h3>
                  <p>Tom reported that there is still $3000 available for Research. Applications should be sent to the Committee now.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Compensation Committee - Ken Furuta</h3>
                  <p>No report.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Academic Senate - JoAnn Mulvihill</h3>
                  <p>In the absence of George Bell, JoAnn Mulvihill announced that Dean Schmidt will address the Senate regarding the Serials Cancellation Project on Monday, February 26.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Committee on Academic Professional Status</h3>
                  <p>Helen Seaton reported on the recent meeting with Dr. Gail Hackett. Dr. Hackett does not understand the distinctions being made between APs, APs with year-to-year contracts without continuing appointment, and Academic Associates. She recognizes this as an on-going problem that may not have an easy resolution. It has now been agreed that if an individual AP has a grievance, (s)he has the right to counsel.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Web Master - Annie Platoff</h3>
                  <p>Annie Platoff reported that the Librarians&rsquo; Council web site is up-to-date; all reports given to her before today have been added. </p>
                  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h2>V. Old Business</h2>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>None
</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;                  </p>
                  <h2>VI. New Business</h2>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>a) Helen Seaton presented revisions recommended by the Personnel Committee to Section E:2: Criteria of the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook regarding Professional Development and Contribution. Discussion followed, and the revisions will be brought before Council for a vote at the next meeting. </p>
                 <br>                   
                   <br> <P>b) Mary Swaty introduced the Review Committee&rsquo;s recommendations for changes to the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook of Section C.2.3:Review Committee for Personnel Action, which would more closely follow current practice, and delete what is no longer done. Discussion by Council members centered on the issue of confidentiality and security, and whether or not committee members should be conducting committee business via email. Kurt volunteered to check what legal issues might be involved and will report back to Council.</P>                  
                   <br> <P>Since the mandate to the Review Committee to make recommendations re Rank and Equivalency has been rendered moot as a result of the fact that there is no strict time-table that must be observed before applying for promotion, an amendment was made to delete the words &ldquo;and Equivalency&rdquo; [paragraph 2 under Meetings Scheduling]. JoAnn Mulvihill moved to delete the sentence &ldquo;At least three voting members must concur to establish consensus&rdquo; under Procedures Statement. Motion carried. The amended document will be voted on at the next meeting.</P>   
                   <br> <P>The question was raised as to whether or not these recommendations can be voted on next meeting in their amended form.</P>  
                   <br> <P>c) Report of Nominations Committee - Marilyn Wurzburger. Marilyn announced that there are two Senate posts to be filled for next year and the Committee has found two candidates willing to serve: JoAnn Mulvihill and Lucy Lyons. There were no further nominations from the floor. Marilyn will send ballots to all Council members.</P> 
                   <br> <p>There being no further business, meeting was adjourned at 4:03 pm.</P> 
				  <br>  <p>Marilyn Wurzburger, Secretary </P>
