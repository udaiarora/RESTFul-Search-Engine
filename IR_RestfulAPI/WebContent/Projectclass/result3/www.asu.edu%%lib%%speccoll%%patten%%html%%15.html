This work, which was originally published in London, is one of the first cookbooks printed in America.
  It has five hundred approved receipts including the following on how to fricasee
 artichoke bottoms: "Take them either dried or pickled; if dried, you must lay them
 in warm water for three or four hours, shifting the water two or three times; then
 have ready a little cream and a piece of fresh butter, stir it together one way over
 the fire till it is melted, then put in the artichokes, and when they are hot dish
 them up" (p. 80).
