The two entities are launching the Flexible Display Center at ASU to develop new concepts in information exchange and display." width="342" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="3" align="left">In a world where information plays a crucial role,          continually updated information can literally save lives.</p>      <p>This is no truer than on the battlefield, where troop movements, enemy        lines and weather conditions are as fluid as the battle itself.</p>      <p>Now, in a major effort to revolutionize on-field command and information        exchange, the Army has teamed up with ASU to establish the Flexible Display        Center (FDC).</p>      <p>&ldquo;The FDC brings together academia, industry and government to        develop what, in essence, will be revolutionary information portals &ndash; devices        that are small, lightweight, rugged and consume very little power,&rdquo; says        ASU President Michael Crow. &ldquo;But they will be very powerful in        that they will hold the key to successful military operations: real-time        information.&rdquo;</p>      <h2>Increasing the pace</h2>      <p>Crow adds that the center will accelerate research, development and        manufacture of flexible display technologies, which will boost commercialization        of flexible displays. As an early adopter, the Army will use the technology        developed in the center to accelerate the pace of its transformation,        which cannot be achieved with existing glass-based displays. In addition,        the Army&rsquo;s investment will lead to low-volume manufacturing that        meets its needs while ensuring the technologies become the industry&rsquo;s        commercial standard.</p>      <p>&ldquo;Flexible displays are the next revolution in information technology        that will enable lighter-weight, lower-power, more-rugged systems for        portable and vehicle applications,&rdquo; says Brig. Gen. Roger Nadeau,        commanding general of the Army&rsquo;s Research, Development and Engineering        Command.</p>      <p>Nadeau says flexible display technology will enable new applications        for the soldier and Army platforms that cannot be realized with current        glass-based displays. These will include body-worn displays that conform        to the uniform; displays that can be rolled up and put in a pocket when        not in use and unrolled for large-area, high information content; and        many other applications that Army engineers and scientists are considering.</p>      <p>The displays essentially are extremely thin computer screens, says Army        Research Laboratory Director John Miller. He says they will be &ldquo;integrated        with computation, communications and global positioning subsystems to        significantly enhance the soldier&rsquo;s situational awareness, survivability        and effectiveness.&rdquo;</p>      <h2>Overlapping technology</h2>      <p>The Flexible Display Center is the result of a $43.7 million, five-year        cooperative agreement between the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and        ASU. The February 2004 agreement has a performance period of five years,        with an option for an additional $50 million over an additional five-year        period.</p>      <p>Although the Army provides core funding for the center, the center&rsquo;s        focus is on commercial applications. The Army is leading the effort because        there is strong overlap between military needs and potential civilian        markets, such as consumer electronics and personal health monitors.</p>      <p>&ldquo;We will be developing the technology for flexible displays, improving        it to the point of commercialization, so military developers will be        able to buy them off the shelf and integrate them into their systems,&rdquo; says        FDC Director Greg Raupp.</p>      <h2><img src="../../../images/FDIfacility.jpg" alt="Flexible Display Center at ASU Research Park" width="458" height="175" hspace="8" vspace="2" align="right">State-of-the-art facility</h2>      <p>ASU was awarded the center after an intense national competition that        lasted almost a full year. As a result of the contract, ASU bought a        state-of-the-art, multi-functional display manufacturing research and        development (R&amp;D) facility in the ASU Research Park.</p>      <p>The signature 250,000-square-foot facility originally was designed for        flat-panel display R&amp;D to manufacturing. It includes 43,500 square        feet of advanced clean room space, plus extensive wet and dry labs. ASU        acquired the facility to enable a very rapid startup for the project,        a scenario the Army deemed important to the project&rsquo;s success.</p>      <h2>Technological hurdles</h2>      <p>By the middle of this year, Raupp says, the center will have produced        its first limited-flexibility 4-inch diagonal concept devices. The overall        goal is to continue improvements to display functionality (with increases        in size, reliability and flexibility), with final display sizes possibly        being as large as 15 inches to 17 inches diagonally.</p>      <p>Initially, the displays will be monochrome but will be developed into        full-color displays. In terms of degree of flexibility, the initial rugged        displays will evolve into conformal displays, then rollable, and finally        into foldable devices. The center also will develop the associated manufacturing        processes required to efficiently and cost-effectively produce integrated        flexible display demonstrators.</p>      <p>&ldquo;There are multiple technical challenges to making these devices        fully flexible, lightweight and extremely low power,&rdquo; Raupp says. &ldquo;But        we have the right university, industry and government team in place,        and we are confident that we can meet those challenges.&rdquo; </p>      <h2>Strategic partnerships</h2>      <p>Working within the center will be researchers from a strategically formed        team of military, industry and academic partners. Army partners include        the ARL and the Natick Soldier Center. Industry partners include EV Group,        Honeywell, Universal Display Corporation, Kent Displays, E Ink, Ito America,        General Dynamics, Rockwell Collins, Abbie Gregg Inc. and the U.S. Display        Consortium. University collaborators include Cornell University, the        University of Texas and Waterloo University. Additional partners will        be added as the center matures.</p>      <p>&ldquo;The outstanding capabilities of our facility and its manufacturing        R&amp;D infrastructure will enable us to work side by side with our partners        to intensively develop new breakthrough technologies,&rdquo; Raupp says.</p>      <p>Flexible display technology promises to boost U.S. display companies        by helping to create many significant commercial applications.</p>      <p>&ldquo;The FDC is more than a single-purpose center,&rdquo; says Jonathan        Fink, ASU vice president for research and economic affairs. &ldquo;This        center will not only aid the Army in a very important quest to significantly        update its IT capabilities, but it will spawn a new industry, largely        based in Arizona, that will specialize in flexible intelligent displays.        These can be used in commercial devices and in a host of new products        that will increase productivity and enhance leisure-time activities. &rdquo; </p>      <hr>      <p><em>By Skip Derra.
