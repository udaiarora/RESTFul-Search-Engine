These tenets, first proposed in the inaugural          policy paper, &ldquo;A New American        University:&nbsp; The New Gold Standard&rdquo; (November 2002), represent        a new way of thinking about the fundamental objectives of a university&mdash;teaching,        research, and public service. </font></p>      <p><font size="2">The eight &ldquo;design imperatives&rdquo; represent new standards&mdash;or        guiding principles&mdash;by which to measure our progress. The        design imperatives were never intended to represent hard-and-fast categories&mdash;most        of the accomplishments of the university do not correspond neatly to        a single design imperative, but rather cut across many. And because        the research interests of ASU scholars are so diverse, not all design        imperatives could possibly be relevant to any given individual or team. The        objective of the design imperatives is to spur new thinking, suggest        new possibilities, and unleash the creative potential of our academic        community. The overarching objective is to transform ASU into one        of the nation&rsquo;s leading public metropolitan research universities. </font></p>      <h2>DESIGN IMPERATIVE 1:&nbsp; ASU MUST EMBRACE ITS CULTURAL, SOCIOECONOMIC,        AND PHYSICAL SETTING:&nbsp; LEVERAGING PLACE</h2>      <p><font size="2">Academic institutions leverage place by embracing their cultural, socioeconomic,        and physical settings. Colleges and universities are situated in        regions with particular heritages, cultures, and aspirations, and scholars        at these institutions are uniquely positioned to address the problems        of their regions, and to offer perspective on the distinct historical,        cultural, social, demographic, political, economic, and environmental        forces shaping these regions. A focus on place means learning from        local knowledge, as well as considering the local relevance of research. If        an institution is socially embedded, meaningful and productive relationships        between the university and its surrounding community, region, and state        will flourish. Not least among these is the role of the research        university as a primary driver for regional social change, social and        cultural learning, and appropriate economic development.</font></p>      <h2><strong>DESIGN IMPERATIVE 2:&nbsp; ASU MUST BECOME A FORCE, AND NOT          ONLY A PLACE:&nbsp; SOCIETAL TRANSFORMATION </strong></h2>      <p><font size="2">Research universities are the preeminent catalysts for          societal change&mdash;no        institution possesses more potential to transform society, improving        the human condition, fostering sustained social advancement and economic        growth, and providing us with the tools we need for better planetary        stewardship. No corporation, no industry, no government agency        can rival their scope and impact, because universities alone exist solely        to produce and disseminate knowledge. Never before has the impact        of knowledge been greater, and no academic institution has had, or continues        to have, more influence than the research university. ASU is one        of only 300 major research institutions in the world, and, as such, has        the potential to generate new knowledge that may influence almost every        aspect of our future. </font></p>      <h2><strong>DESIGN IMPERATIVE 3:&nbsp; A CULTURE OF ACADEMIC ENTERPRISE:&nbsp; ASU          AS KNOWLEDGE ENTREPRENEUR </strong></h2>      <p><font size="2">Enterprise takes many forms in the academy&mdash;it is the signal characteristic        of the drive and passion that informs all groundbreaking scholarly and        creative endeavor. Enterprise inspires inquiry, and fosters the        originality and independence of mind that make new knowledge possible. Intellectual        capital is the wellspring of a great university, and the source of its        potential to transform our world. It is also the source of an institution&rsquo;s        prosperity&mdash;those who conduct groundbreaking research, developing        new knowledge and new products with commercial application, have the        capacity to generate significant revenues for the university, and to        encourage investment in our product. To the extent that we make        an original contribution to our disciplines, or, indeed, break free from        conventional disciplinary or organizational constraints, our work may        be said to exhibit <em>enterprise.</em>&nbsp; </font></p>      <h2>DESIGN IMPERATIVE 4:&nbsp; PASTEUR&rsquo;S PRINCIPLE:&nbsp; USE-INSPIRED        RESEARCH </h2>      <p><font size="2">The complexity of the challenges for global success that          are ahead of us makes it mandatory to balance the need for, and importance          of, continuing basic research (fundamental discovery) with a research          agenda focused on addressing actual and immediate problems. Much university          research is necessarily esoteric because we are involved in the discovery          of fundamental knowledge, but we must integrate the advancement of          knowledge with the transformation of society. If academic research          is to be a force for societal transformation&mdash;if we are to improve the human condition&mdash;we        must consider the social implications of our research, and harness our        knowledge for maximum societal benefit. This is an approach to        scholarship that could be termed <em>use-inspired</em>, and will increasingly        guide the ASU research enterprise. </font></p>      <h2>DESIGN IMPERATIVE 5:&nbsp; A FOCUS ON THE INDIVIDUAL:&nbsp; OUTCOME-DETERMINED        EXCELLENCE / A COMMITMENT TO INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY </h2>      <p><font size="2">Our nation&rsquo;s research universities are concerned with a certain        academic profile in their student body. They have defined their        academic excellence by the academic qualifications of their incoming        students&mdash;an input-driven model. ASU focuses instead on <em>outcome-determined        excellence</em>&mdash;that is, we admit students with differing interests        and indicators of intelligence and creativity, even different levels        of high school preparation. There is no single profile to which        a student seeking admission to ASU must conform. The university        will not be limited exclusively to the verbally and mathematically gifted,        nor the most intelligent children of the most successful families. We        welcome these gifted students, but seek greater diversity in our student        body. And we will judge the success of our university by the success        of each student <em>on a case-by-case basis. </em>Implicit in our        focus on the individual is a <em>commitment to intellectual and cultural        diversity</em>. </font></p>      <h2>DESIGN IMPERATIVE 6:&nbsp; INTELLECTUAL FUSION:&nbsp; INTERDISCIPLINARY        / MULTIDISCIPLINARY / TRANSDISCIPLINARY / POSTDISCIPLINARY </h2>      <p><font size="2">If we are to advance knowledge in the face of its rapidly changing nature,        and come to terms with the explosion of new knowledge that characterizes        the academy in recent decades, a new and more fluid organization is urgently        needed. Intellectual fusion is the <em>cognitive</em> norm in scholarship,        whereas the fragmentation imposed by disciplinary categories is an historical        social construct, however useful. Knowledge does not fall within        strict disciplinary categories, yet we cling to an institutional organization        that derives from the medieval academy. It is no longer sufficient        to neatly categorize knowledge into disciplinary-based academic departments&mdash;the        core disciplines are but one element of our intellectual identity. Accordingly,        the New American University encourages teaching and research that is <em>interdisciplinary,        multidisciplinary, transdisciplinary, and post-disciplinary, leading,        where appropriate to a convergence of disciplines, an approach that might        more accurately be described as intellectual fusion. </em></font></p>      <h2>DESIGN IMPERATIVE 7: SOCIAL EMBEDDEDNESS:&nbsp; PUBLIC SERVICE        / COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT / OUTREACH</h2>      <p><font size="2">Public service&mdash;or community outreach&mdash;is intrinsic to ASU&rsquo;s        mission as a public metropolitan research university, and central to        the vision of a New American University that is linked to its region        and the needs of its day; that balances its commitment to teaching with        world-class research conducted for the public good; and that takes on        major responsibility for the economic, social, and cultural vitality        of its region. Public service has long been a defining characteristic        of ASU, and we expect that commitment to grow with each coming year.          Because our approach to public service is comprehensive, and because          we conceive of public service in such broad terms, the extent of our          commitment to the community and region is perhaps best conveyed by          the concept of <em>social        embeddedness.</em></font></p>      <h2>DESIGN IMPERATIVE 8: GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT:&nbsp; TRANSNATIONAL /        TRANSCULTURAL</h2>      <p><font size="2">Because research universities bear partial responsibility          for the future of our planet, there is no aspect of our teaching, research,          or public service that does not possess global implication. ASU faculty          are members of an international community of scholars, and through          our scholarship and creative endeavor we implicitly address a global          audience. Even service to the communities immediately surrounding our          campuses can have worldwide application&mdash;through the development of innovative approaches        to universal societal problems, ASU can establish programs and practices        with application anywhere in the world. If we are to position the        institution as a leading public metropolitan research university, we        must forge partnerships with peer institutions around the world, and        make an institutional commitment to global engagement that is thoroughgoing.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>      </div>    <!-- InstanceEndEditable --> </div> </td>    <td width="20%" rowspan="3" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#FFCC33"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="RightColumn" -->      <table width="85%"  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">        <tr>          <td align="left" valign="middle"><a href="section3.html" class="nodecor"><img src="../images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="10" height="13" hspace="2" border="0" align="absmiddle"> <font color="#000000" size="2">Back </font></a></td>          <td align="right" valign="middle"><a href="appendixb-1.html" class="nodecor"><font color="#000000" size="2">Next</font> </a><a href="appendixb-1.html"><img src="../images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="10" height="13" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>        </tr>      </table>    <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->      <div class="indent">        <p><font color="#222222"><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=1><BR>      <img src="../images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="3" hspace="0" vspace="0"></FONT></font> </p>    </div></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</td>    <td bgcolor="#FFCC33">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td rowspan="2">&nbsp;</td>    <td colspan="3" align="right" valign="middle" bgcolor="#CCCC99"> <img src="http://www.asu.edu/president/images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="2" hspace="0" vspace="0"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td colspan="3" align="right" valign="bottom"> <p class="smallbold"><a href="http://www.asu.edu/copyright"><font color="#666666">Copyright    and Trademark Statement</font></a> | <a href="http://www.asu.edu/president/contact/"><font color="#666666">Contact</font></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;          <p class="smallbold"></td>  </tr></table> </BODY> <!-- InstanceEnd --></HTML>
