      <h2 align="left"><strong>IBM Senior Vice President Bob Moffat Visits ASU; </strong><strong>Inaugurates New Supply Chain Research Initiative </strong></h2>
      <p>IBM Senior Vice President Bob Moffat visits the W. P. Carey School of Business on Friday, May 14 at 11 a.m., kicking off an IBM-sponsored joint research and teaching initiative in supply chain management which links Arizona State University (ASU) to three other universities. </p>
      <p>Moffat will also address the W. P. Carey MBA Class of 2004 at its graduation convocation on May 15 at 10 a.m. at Wells Fargo Arena. </p>
      <p>Through a Shared University Research grant, IBM will foster supply chain research at the W.P. Carey School of Business in conjunction with research laboratories at the Eli Broad College of Business at Michigan State University and the Smeal College of Business at Pennsylvania State University. The IBM initiative is aimed at developing advanced supply chain practices that can be used to help businesses respond on demand to changing market conditions. A fourth laboratory, at the Smurfit School of Business, University College, Dublin, will be dedicated this summer. </p>
      <p>This cross-university initiative, which will simulate the workings of a complex supply chain, is supported by IBM software technologies, including WebSphere and AIX as well as the company's eServer pSeries systems. Advanced supply chain software was provided by i2 Technologies, Inc. </p>
      <p>"This initiative represents a rich collaboration with IBM and other top supply chain management programs to research grid and on-demand computing in the context of a complex, integrated supply chain," said Joseph Carter, chairman of the department of supply chain management at the W. P. Carey School. "The curriculum enhancements made possible by this initiative will also help us better prepare students who will be ready to use the advanced technologies to effectively manage supply chains in their future positions." </p>
      <p>Supply chain management Professor Craig Kirkwood, who is facilitating development of the project at the W. P. Carey School, said that the inter-university effort is expected to result in new knowledge about the potential of grid and on-demand computing. Grid and on-demand computing is a new approach analogous to electrical supply systems wherein computing capability is harnessed from a widespread grid of computers. </p>
      <p>"Supply chain management is a perfect context for exploring whether grid and on-demand computing can provide advanced computing capabilities in a way that is cheaper and/or more reliable," Kirkwood explained. "That's because a supply chain - which connects suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers - is distributed by nature, and requires information technology in order to work effectively. Long term we hope to develop a prototype grid for supply chain management." </p>
      <p>In the short run, Kirkwood added, the infrastructure provided will expand students' exposure to advanced technology in the classroom.</p>
      <p>The Center for Advancing Business through Information Technology (CABIT) will provide the front face for the IBM grid. CABIT conducts research with corporate and government partners exploring the impact and applications of technology on business processes. </p>
      <p>"This grant from IBM augments existing CABIT infrastructure, enabling faculty to delve into topics of research that range from <em>autonomic computing </em> and <em>grid computing </em>to applications related to <em>integrated supply chain </em>and <em>life cycle management issues, </em>" said Professor Ajay Vinze, director of the CABIT center. </p>
      <p>The W. P. Carey School of Business is a leader internationally in research, education and executive development in supply chain management. A survey recently published by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report </em> lists the W. P. Carey MBA eighth in the nation in supply chain management. </p>
      <p align="center" class="style1 style1"><strong>W. P. Carey School of Business </strong></p>
      <p class="style1 style1">The W. P. Carey School of Business provides quality undergraduate, masters and doctoral programs that draw upon a dynamic learning environment to prepare students at all levels for the future. Internationally recognized faculty enrich the curriculum with their latest research findings, and deliver this knowledge in a technology-rich environment. Ranked 21st in the nation by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report </em>, the undergraduate program features Business Honors comprised of some of the best students in the country. The MBA, ranked 14th in the nation among public programs, combines business fundamentals with marketplace issues and trends, giving graduates the knowledge and experience to excel in a global economy. W. P. Carey School of Business alumni are lifelong learners connected to the school and each other through an active alumni community and executive education opportunities. </p>
