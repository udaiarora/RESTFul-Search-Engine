      <h2>Latino scholars earn recognition from ASU, family, community</h2>
      <p>        ASU has more than 1,200 Latino students who were awarded academic scholarships
          or fellowships for the 2003 - 04 academic year - a big accomplishment
          for the university and the Hispanic community. On Oct. 3, these students
          and their families were honored at the seventh annual Latino Scholars
        Recognition Reception, "Celebrating Our Success."</p>
      <p>"We have so many talented
            and gifted Latino students," says Antonia Franco, executive coordinator
            of the ASU Multicultural Student Center and this
          year's event organizer. "Each year the reception serves as not only
        a recognition, but an example of how Latinos are continuing to strive
        in
          academics and higher education."</p>
      <p>Sylvia Carrizoza, a senior majoring in
          early childhood education, was this year's student speaker, who spoke
          about her future goals and her
          experience with the Doran Community Scholars Program. Carrizoza, who
          graduated from Maryvale High School, has been an active participant
        with the program since she was a freshman. In addition to the many community
          service hours Carrizoza has dedicated, she has served as an instructor
          with the Wesley Community Center for the last few years tutoring neighborhood
          kids and helping with after school programs.</p>
      <p>Juan Gonzalez, vice president
          of Student Affairs, congratulated students and their families on their
          success.</p>
      <p>"All of you should be proud of your
          achievement," Gonzalez said to the students after asking them to stand
          and be acknowledged. "You are all
          winners and remember that your parents are also winners because when
        you succeed, they also succeed."</p>
      <p>This year Ben Arredondo, councilman
          with the City of Tempe, and Ben Hartley, general manager of Sodexho's
          Campus Dining at ASU, were presented
            with
            plaques for their generosity and dedication to helping Latino students
          achieve their academic goals.</p>
      <p>Arredondo, who is serving his third term
          as a councilmember, is chairman of the Council Community Partnerships
          Committee and is a member of the
          Council Neighborhood and Public Safety Committee and the Council Ad
        Hoc Human Relations Committee. Arredondo is a high school teacher and
        former
          member of the Tempe Elementary School District Governing Board. Among
          his many achievements, Arredondo received the ASU College of Education
        Distinguished Achievement Award in 1993.</p>
      <p>Hartley, has been working with
          Sodexho for more than 22 years. Through his leadership, Sodexho has
        been a sponsor of the Hispanic Heritage Scholarship
        Program on the national and local level at ASU.</p>
      <p>In addition to the support
          of community members like Arredondo and Hartley, Bob Soza, dean of
        Student Life at ASU, says the university's academic
          programs continue to contribute to the success of Latino students at
        ASU.</p>
      <p>"ASU scholarship programs such as the Hispanic Community Scholarship
          Program, Hispanic Mother-Daughter Program, Upward Bound, Maroon and
        Gold Scholarship Program and others provide the financial assistance
        to recruit
          and support the many talented Hispanic students at ASU," Soza says.
        "The Multicultural Student Center and other academic and student support
        services
          programs, as well as the large number of talented Hispanic faculty
        and staff make ASU a great place for Hispanic students to obtain their
        degrees."</p>
