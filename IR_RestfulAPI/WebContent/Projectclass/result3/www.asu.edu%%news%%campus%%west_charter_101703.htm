      <h2>Federal grant expands ASU West charter school program</h2>
      <p>        ASU West's masters degree program for charter school administrators is
          expanding, thanks to a $2.9 million grant from U.S. Department of Education
          Secretary Rod Paige's Fund for the Improvement of Education (FIE).        </p>
      <p>The three-year grant allows for tuition waivers for a second cohort
            of students, a mentorship component and the potential creation of
        a center
          for school choice.</p>
      <p>The program, called Leadership for Educational Entrepreneurs
          (LEE), bridges the ASU West College of Education's master's degree
        in Educational
            Administration
            and the School of Management's MBA degree. LEE Fellows from around
            the country learn online as well as face-to-face at ASU West and
        at regional
            sites.</p>
      <p>"This innovative program is representative of Arizona State University's
          commitment to applying faculty research to critical public policy issues,"
          says ASU President Michael Crow. "With this new funding, the program
          can expand and have an even greater positive impact nationally on K-12
          education."</p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/ellieperry_101703.gif" alt="Eleanor Perry" width="180" height="251" align="right">Eleanor Perry, associate professor in the College of Education,
          founded the LEE program - the first such program in the nation serving
          the growing
          charter school industry - after conducting six years of action research
          focused on charter school leadership.</p>
      <p>"LEE gives participants both the
          education skills and business skills needed to successfully operate
        a charter school," Perry says. </p>
      <p>Forty states
          have passed legislation establishing charter schools. Nationwide, 175,000
          students attend 2,300 charter schools. Arizona has nearly 500
          charter school sites - the most of any state - serving more than 75,000
          children.</p>
      <p>"As a public university campus, we have a responsibility to
          work for the success of all children and to help develop talented K-12
          leaders,"
          College of Education Dean Michael Awender says. "The LEE program addresses
          this responsibility and is making a positive impact on the thousands
          of students attending charter schools across Arizona and the United
        States."</p>
      <p>The
          grant allows for the expansion of the program to include mentorship
        for LEE students who are administrators at charter schools in high-need
          areas, along with leadership development training for their mentors.
          Individuals selected to serve as mentors will be charter school leaders
          from high-need areas who have a documented track record of increased
          student achievement.</p>
      <p>"Our approach is innovative in that the mentors will
        receive professional development training before the mentor/prot&eacute;g&eacute; relationship
        begins, to enhance their mentoring and research skills," Perry says.</p>
      <p>"Extending
          the program to a second cohort and providing for the addition of an
        administrative mentorship will truly be an opportunity to build
          highly qualified educational leaders," says current LEE student Anita
          Mendoza, assistant superintendent of instruction at AmeriSchools in
        Tucson.</p>
      <p>The
          current LEE cohort, representing 11 states stretching from Rhode Island
          to Hawaii, began the program in the summer of 2002. The students
          are scheduled to complete their master's degrees next spring.</p>
      <p>The second
          cohort of 24 LEE students will begin their studies in summer 2004.
        In the meantime, mentors at high-need charter school sites around
          the country will be chosen and will begin receiving professional development
          training.</p>
      <p>"I am grateful to Sen. Jon Kyl and Representatives Trent Franks
          and J.D. Hayworth for their support as we pursued this grant," Perry
          says. </p>
      <p>ASU
          West is one of only seven recipients in the current round of FIE funding,
          and the only university among the recipients. The $2.9 million
          grant is the largest grant ever received by ASU West and the largest
          of the seven grants funded.</p>
      <p>"These grants help charter schools continue
          to grow, providing more options for students and families, especially
          those students who attend schools
          in need of improvement," says Secretary Paige.</p>
      <p>More information about
          the LEE program is available at (www.west.asu.edu/LEEP).</p>
