<P>Yonge, Charlotte Mary. <I>The Story of the Christians and Moors of Spain</I>.
London: Macmillan, 1878. Title vignette by W. Holman Hunt. Yonge states
in her preface that while there has been an interest in Spanish chivalry,
that the &quot;eight hundred years' struggle between the Moslem and the
Christian was little recollected at the present day.&quot; She continues
by noting that &quot;no one has tried to combine in a general view Spanish
and Moorish history, together with tradition, romance, and song.&quot;
Younge's work then begins with a table of the Moorish, Castilian, and Aragonese
sovereigns, followed by an introduction to the geography of the country,
contrasting the rugged mountainous Northern section from the open Southern
areas. The history then continues from ancient times until 1611. Younge's
importance for the PRB movement is found primarily in her novel <I>The
Heir of Redclyffe</I> which was adopted by William Morris and Burne-Jones
&quot;as a pattern for actual life.&quot; PRB-27. </P>
