               <p>     <strong> Notes and Precautions:</strong> A spill kit should be kept in each laboratory where work with microorganisms is conducted. Basic equipment is: concentrated disinfectant (household bleach or organism specific disinfectant), paper towels, rubber gloves, autoclave bags, sharps container, and forceps to pick up broken glass.</p>

               <p> For any biological spill, first notify others in the laboratory so they will not unknowingly spread the contamination. For spills of a large volume, or spills of organisms transmitted by inhalation when aerosolized such as <strong>BioSafety Level</strong> (BSL) agents, call the Principal Investigator (PI) and EH&amp;S @ (480) 965-1823 Monday &ndash; Friday 8:00 a.m. &ndash; 5:00 p.m. Nights and weekends call the ASU Police Department @ (480) 965-3456.
