      <h2>Herberger College partnerships impact numerous schools and youth organizations</h2>
      <p>        Integral to the mission and activities of the Katherine K. Herberger
          College of Fine Arts, the college's community programs office, together
          with the academic units, participates in more than 90 community partnerships
          that provide arts experiences for children and adults in the Phoenix
          metropolitan area. More than a dozen ongoing, multi-faceted, "signature"
          programs bring fine arts experiences to the community and provide a
          framework for arts education and the exchange of fine arts resources
        and expertise.</p>
      <p>Two of the college's "signature" programs that emphasize
            K-12 partnerships are the well-established Dance Arizona Repertory
            Theatre (DART) and the
          new Maestra! Maestro! These are tailored to fit the needs of each particular
          partner, says director of community programs for the Herberger College,
          Melanie Ohm.</p>
      <p>Dance Arizona Repertory Theatre (DART) is the community partnership
        dance company in the Herberger College Department of Dance. It builds
        collaborative
        and creative relationships with after-school programs that strengthen
        community ties between ASU and culturally diverse area schools. The community
        partners participating in DART are the inner-city Herrera School for
        the Arts, the Pappas School for Children of Homeless Families, and the
        Boys &amp; Girls Club of Gilbert.</p>
      <p>Mark Yslas, principal at the Herrera
          School for the Arts, says that the school's DART partnership is an
        integral part of its success.</p>
      <p>"Partnerships
          with arts organizations such as DART have helped us become a first
        rate school," Yslas says. "It is a relationship that I hope continues
          for years to come."</p>
      <p>DART involves students and faculty of ASU Dance joining
          with national and local guest artists to work with schools and organizations,
          creating
          opportunities for youth to discover their creative voices and experience
          the joy of dance. Dance provides them with a new mechanism for self-expression
          and creative exploration.</p>
      <p>After participating in a DART program, renowned
          dancer and choreographer Arthur Aviles said, "This partnership has
        helped make dance accessible
          - the way dance should be."</p>
      <p>Through collaborative dance workshops and
          performance opportunities, youth participants learn leadership and
        problem-solving skills while
          developing a sense of teamwork. ASU students obtain training in community
          dance methodologies.</p>
      <p>The DART collaboration with the Boys &amp; Girls
        Club has been "tremendous," according to Vic Cordts, Youth Development
        Director for Boys &amp; Girls
        Clubs of the East Valley.<br>
        "The opportunity for our members to interact and spend quality time with
        the young adults who instruct the program contributes significantly to
        their interpersonal and social development," Cordts says.</p>
      <p>Among the college's
          newer partnership programs is Maestra!Maestro!, a program now in its
          second year, whose aim is to promote the growth of
          after-school arts programming in the Greater Phoenix area.</p>
      <p>This partnership
          trains Herberger College arts students as community teaching artists
          by placing them with teaching artists already active
          in the community. The student apprentices and their mentor teachers
        are then paired with after-school programs in areas where access to arts
          education is limited. This is done through a second level of partnerships
          with the Phoenix Arts Commission and the City of Phoenix's Parks and
          Recreation Department.</p>
      <p>The teaching artist and student apprentice spend
          two afternoons a week teaching the arts to children in the after-school
          programs. The concept
          also is being expanded to pair academic tutors with the artists and
        their apprentices as the program expands to new locations and partner
        programs
          in its second year. Tutors and artists will work together to address
          the same educational concepts in their programs, tying the art lessons
          to the academic subjects being taught in the after-school programs.<br>
        Such change and development of the community partnership programs offered
          by the Herberger College is constant, says Ohm.</p>
      <p>"Our programs are always
          in flux, always morphing into new 'pilot programs' every time we start
          working with a new partner," Ohm says. "That's the
          nature of partnerships. Our programs never stay the same because we
        work together to meet the specific needs of each community partner."</p>
