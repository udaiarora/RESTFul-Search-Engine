<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><B>Print a report of monthly temperatures for each city.</B> The
BY statement determines that a separate report is generated for each city.
Thus, the REPORT procedure generates three pieces of output. To assign anchor
locations to this new output, ODS increments  the last anchor name that was
used (IDX), and therefore assigns the anchor names IDX1, IDX2, and IDX3 to
the output. These are the anchor locations that were specified above as the
anchor locations for variable CITYDRILL.
