      <h2>Professor builds research on change in construction material industry</h2>
      <p>        Low-cost, energy-efficient housing may be possible with the use of plastic
          blocks. But potential homeowners may not jump at the chance to buy
          a house built with plastic blocks, home developers may not want to
        build with such material.</p>
      <p>Carlos Mart&iacute;n, a new School of Construction
          professor and recently appointed endowed SRP professor of energy and
          environment, studies the
        cultural and industrial barriers to technological change in housing,
        and believes radical change is difficult.<br>
        "Building officials are suspicious of new technologies," he says, "and
        consumers are skeptical too."</p>
      <p>In his new position, Mart&iacute;n will
        have a joint appointment to the College of Architecture and Environmental
        Design and the Del E. Webb
        School of Construction in the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering. </p>
      <p>According
        to Mart&iacute;n, there are many more obstacles to making any
        changes in housing than just builder unwillingness and consumer skepticism.</p>
      <p>"City
        codes, lending and insurance policies, utility placement, land-use regulations,
        land costs and much more dictate what can be built in terms
        of design or technology," Mart&iacute;n says.</p>
      <p>Trained as both an architect
        and engineer, Mart&iacute;n became interested
        in architecture when he was very young, and went on to study at Stanford
        University, University of Michigan and M.I.T.</p>
      <p>"Throughout my architectural
        studies, I realized that there were a lot of things missing, things we
        weren't talking about. I kept looking for
        that extra piece."</p>
      <p>In his doctoral program, Mart&iacute;n began searching
        for the missing pieces by working with scholars in such disciplines as
        history, design
        and sociology to study the cultural and industrial barriers to housing
        changes.</p>
      <p>He continued his quest as a research engineer for the U.S. Department
          of Housing and Urban Development for three years, studying how policy
          issues affect housing and design.</p>
      <p>The reality, he says, is that architects'
          and engineers' influences on the housing market, of which they are
        a part, has been constrained, and
          to make any changes they must look at the big picture.</p>
      <p>Architects and
        engineers have had some success in introducing housing innovations, Mart&iacute;n
        says. </p>
      <p>"Energy-efficient windows and water-conserving
          bathroom and kitchen fixtures have been widely accepted by homebuilders
          and home consumers. </p>
      <p>"One of
          the primary reasons for their success is that they are not significantly
          more expensive than their less energy-efficient counterparts. So, their
          'payback' is shorter and consumers don't have to make the hard choices
          between what they can afford and what they would like."</p>
      <p>Highly touted
        straw-bale and rammed-earth homes haven't been as successful for several
        reasons, Mart&iacute;n says. </p>
      <p>"Since the technologies haven't
          been fully tested in a variety of conditions, building officials don't
          know how to handle or inspect them. They're
          still very labor intensive, and there's still some consumer apprehension
          about them. Appraisers don't have many comparables for them and their
        subsequent sales values really are ambiguous," he says.</p>
