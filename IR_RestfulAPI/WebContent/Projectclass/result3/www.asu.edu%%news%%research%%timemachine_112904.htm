      <h2><strong>&ldquo;Time Machine&rdquo; to Recreate Human Past, Then Explore Possible Futures </strong></h2>
      <p> Decisions, decisions &hellip; it would really help if we could look far into the future and see their consequences. </p>
      <p> A new, multidisciplinary research project at ASU aims to do just that &ndash; with input from the distant past. </p>
      <p> The project, funded by a five-year, $1.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation, aims to create a set of computer models for socioecology &ndash; the long-term interaction of human land use and ecology &ndash; based on areas that have been occupied by humans for millennia in the eastern and western Mediterranean. </p>
      <p> The project aims to create a model that captures the complex interplay, over long time spans, between specific human actions and landscape changes. Once perfected, such a model potentially could be applied to modern situations and used to predict the results of land use decisions. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;The idea behind this is to use archaeology and information about the past &ndash; past environment, past people &ndash; to develop a modeling laboratory for long-term human-environmental relationship, interaction and change,&rdquo; says Michael Barton, professor of anthropology and the project&rsquo;s director. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;What we propose to do is to build a modeling environment that will basically rebuild landscapes and let them change dynamically using geospacial modeling and agent modeling for human societies in two different parts of the Mediterranean ,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This is one of the earliest places for farming and civilization. We want to track what happened when people started farming, because this activity still has the biggest impact on landscapes today.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> Modeling &ndash; the development of computer programs that mimic reality &ndash; is a way for modern technology to extend the human brain and imagination to deal with large bodies of information, with complex problems, and with issues that have scales of time and space beyond normal human perception. </p>
      <p> While it is possible, for example, to watch what takes place in a given location over a day, a week or even a year, humans are not capable of directly &ldquo;observing&rdquo; processes that happen on regional or global scales over centuries or millennia. However, a model that is designed to copy the dynamics of reality can analyze huge amounts of information and &ldquo;pan back&rdquo; its field of view to show large-scale changes and illuminate the processes involved. </p>
      <p> According to Barton, the long-term ecological and geological dynamics of human land use is an ideal problem for modeling. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;The technology to do this is out there,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There are people building geospatial models to look at erosion and deposition, there are people building computer models to look at how vegetation is distributed across the past landscape, and there are people using agent modeling for human society. But no one has put it together like this before.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> The precision of such a model is only as good as how closely its design is able to capture the complex dynamics of reality and how complete its starting data is. This is the advantage, Barton says, of basing his model on areas that already have been extensively studied by archaeologists. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;We can start from what we know, create a model of what the land was like and then we can let it run and see what it is like 500 years later,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But the neat thing is that we don&rsquo;t have to guess about whether our model is working or not, because we <em>know</em> what it was like 500 years later.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> The project is looking at two areas in the Mediterranean with extremely long histories of being affected by human settlement but differing environmental conditions &ndash; a mountainous and relatively wet area in eastern Spain , and the dry and very low elevation environment of the Jordan Valley . The model plans to cover (and be tested against) a period of 6,000 years &ndash; from 8,000 B.C. to 2,000 B.C. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;Because we have a wealth of data going back a long way on both of these sites, we can check and see if our model matches or not. If it doesn&rsquo;t, we can tune the model to match what actually happened and do this over this period of time,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We use real data to tune these models of the past, which is something that can&rsquo;t be done to models of the future based on today&rsquo;s environments.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> Once the model has been &ldquo;tuned&rdquo; to accurately reflect human environmental interaction, Barton then plans to modify it to see how different human decisions could have resulted in different outcomes. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;We can start to ask some &lsquo;what-if&rsquo; questions,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What would happen if people had intensified farming by terracing? What if you put more animals on the landscape &hellip; or less? What if you didn&rsquo;t have goats and sheep? What if you cut down more woods &hellip; or less? Once we have a working model, we can see the results.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> &ldquo;These are all questions that are still important globally today,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;A lot of the planet is still being developed, and we don&rsquo;t know the long-term consequences. The Mediterranean area is a good place to study to find the answers since it has been affected by agriculture for longer than any place else in the world.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> And though the project is designed to study the past, its ultimate goal is very future-oriented, he says. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;If we can build this technology, then we can apply it in various other settings, in different places in the world, and looking forward instead of back,&rdquo; Barton says. &ldquo;The human mind can only look so far ahead, so we need to use other kinds of tools. This allows us to take the history of the past and look in the future. It&rsquo;s like a time machine.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> The project&rsquo;s principal investigators are Barton and Steven Falconer from the Department of Anthropology, Ramon Arrowsmith from the Department of Geological Sciences, Patricia Fall from the Department of Geography, and Hessam Sarjoughian from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. </p>
