<h1 class="storyhead">Ira A. and Mary Lou Fulton give Arizona State University  $100 million for Christmas </h1>
<p align="center"><em>Gift among largest in the history of higher  education</em></p>
<p>TEMPE, Ariz.  &ndash; The faculty, staff and students of Arizona   State University  are getting an unexpected gift this holiday season:  Ira A. and Mary Lou Fulton  put $100 million under the university&rsquo;s Christmas tree.</p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.asu.edu/feature/fultons/"><img src="images/TheFultons.jpg" alt="Mary and Ira Fulton" width="200" height="251" hspace="5" vspace="2" border="0" align="left"></a>The Fultons, already the university&rsquo;s largest single  donors, had been thinking about this gift for some time. This gift, one of the  largest single donations in higher education history, puts their total gifts to  ASU at more than $160 million. They have also given $72 million to Brigham Young University.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spirit of Christmas is giving to others,&rdquo; said Ira  Fulton. &ldquo;During the Depression, my mother ran a caf&eacute; in Tempe near ASU&rsquo;s campus and never turned  anyone away hungry, whether they had money or not. The best gift I can provide  today is the opportunity of a college education. It unlocks the door for young  people and enables them to build a brighter future for themselves and their  families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  Fulton, a self-made millionaire, is concerned about the  level of private investment in Arizona&rsquo;s  universities. He continued, &ldquo;A lot of people think the responsibility for  funding higher education belongs only to the state and the students. They don&rsquo;t  realize that state taxes pay for less than a third of the cost and tuition paid  by students covers another third. Private citizens in Arizona  are giving less than half of what citizens in California,  Texas, Colorado,  Kansas and Oklahoma are giving to their universities.  I&rsquo;d like to see that change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  The gift will be used for special educational initiatives,  which the university will establish after discussions with the Fultons. Those educational initiatives will  be announced at a later date. The gift will not be used for general budget  relief or construction projects.</p>
<p>Describing the gift as &ldquo;unprecedented and magnificent,&rdquo;  Arizona State University President Michael Crow praised the Fultons  for their &ldquo;incredible generosity, their unwavering commitment to ASU's future,  and their confidence in ASU&rsquo;s emergence as a New American   University.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What better Christmas present could anyone ever hope for  than this enormous gift of philanthropic support for ASU&rsquo;s promise and  potential?&rdquo; Crow added.</p>
<p>  Previous gifts by the Fultons have named the Ira A. Fulton  School of Engineering at ASU, one of the nation&rsquo;s premier institutions for  technology research and applied teaching; created the Mary Lou Fulton Program  at the ASU College of Education, Arizona's leading educational laboratory and  center for excellence in teacher training; and helped to launch ASU's Decision  Theater, the region's only interactive, three-dimensional institute that allows  civic leaders to engage in visualizing the effects of public choices on issues  ranging from water and air quality to transportation and land-use.</p>
<p>  Recently, ASU also launched the Fulton Challenge, matching donations by faculty, students, staff and alumni at ASU's Colleges of Nursing, Design, Education, Law, Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Katherine Herberger College of Fine  Arts, and Barrett Honors College  through a challenge grant provided by the Fultons.&nbsp; More than $560,000 has been raised to date  from 4,149 students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends, achieving 187% of the  original goal of $300,000.&nbsp; The Fultons have now extended the Fulton Challenge to include  ASU at the West Campus (Phoenix) and ASU at the  Polytechnic Campus (Mesa), the Walter Cronkite  School of Journalism and Mass Communication, and the College of Public Programs.  The Fulton Challenge for Athletics at ASU has also raised more than $1 million,  which has been matched by Ira and Mary Lou Fulton.</p>
<p>  In its November 28, 2005 cover story on the 50 most  generous Americans, <em>Business Week</em>  profiled Ira and Mary Lou Fulton in a piece entitled: &ldquo;Teaching others how to  give.&rdquo;&nbsp; It cited $160 million in lifetime  giving by the Fultons, the only Arizonans on the list, including $141 million  to educational and community needs since 2001.</p>
<p>  Ira Fulton grew up in Tempe and attended ASU, where he had a  newspaper delivery route that included the then-president of ASU, Grady  Gammage.&nbsp; Mary Lou Fulton is a graduate  of ASU's College   of Education.</p>
<p>  Additional details of the $100 million gift by the Fultons will be provided  in the coming weeks and months in three separate announcements built around  major events where ASU&rsquo;s future plans and programs will be fully articulated  and to which the public will be invited.</p>
<p> Describing their motivation for giving, Mr. Fulton observed:  &ldquo;ASU is a university on a roll. It is picking up momentum on every front&mdash;rising  enrollment, increasing federal research funding, new academic buildings and  residential dormitories, and impressive faculty recruitment and distinction. To  sustain this momentum, what ASU needs now is the backing of the entire  community, and substantial investment by private individuals, corporations and  local foundations. Our Christmas gift to ASU is meant to strengthen ASU and to  demonstrate the reality that great universities must be built and backed not  only by student tuition and research grants and state assistance&mdash;as important  as all those are&mdash;but by people such as ourselves who have a stake in the health  and prosperity of our region which is directly tied to ASU&rsquo;s future success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  This year, ASU enrolled more students at its Tempe campus than any  other university in the nation. Growth in enrollment to more than 61,000  students has been matched by record increases in the number of new faculty, and  double-digit increases in federal research funding. ASU enrolls more National  Merit Scholars than any other university in the West except Stanford. Faculty  have recently been awarded a Nobel Prize for Economics and the largest awards  in ASU&rsquo;s history ($45 million from the Department of the Army to develop  flexible computer displays and a $15 million grant from the Bill and Melinda  Gates Foundation for cutting-edge research on a potential cure for infantile  pneumonia).<br>
