The Accountancy program provides the foundational requirements for professional certification in accounting. The BS in Global Business and the BS in LIM provide two very different learning experiences for West campus students. Students in the new LIM program are drawn to the advantages of the foreign language component and international exposure for their career preparation. For other students, the flexibility of being able to attend part-time and not being away from family make the Global Business program a better match. The goal of the SGML is to provide programs that meet student needs as well as the demands of the industry.</p><p class="FM-C-Heading"><a name="pgfId-2443949"></a>Nature of Program</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-2446406"></a>The undergraduate curriculum has been devised so that the student completes 50 percent of work in general education and other nonbusiness courses and 45 percent in courses offered by the School of Global Management and Leadership, with the remaining 5 percent selected from either area by the student in consultation with his or her advisor. </p><p class="FM-C-Heading"><a name="pgfId-2446407"></a>Admission to the Professional Programs</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-2447265"></a>The School of Global Management and Leadership offers the upper-division level of the undergraduate curriculum.

The LIM program offers a more extensive international curriculum and greater multicultural experiences than the Global Business program. The new program requires a cohort learning experience for all upper-division core courses, a foreign language (Spanish), a semester of upper-division study at a university in Mexico, and a partnership with international exchange students who are in residence at ASU on the West campus. As a border state to Mexico, the number two global trading partner of the U.S., Arizona offers students a rich opportunity to learn the language while studying in a key trading partner country. </p><p class="FM-C-Heading"><a name="pgfId-2465570"></a>Career Outlook</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-2465571"></a>The ultimate outcome of the LIM program is to develop graduates who possess the knowledge, skills and techniques necessary to significantly participate in international business operations. Trade with Central American countries is expected to increase in the near future. The Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), signed into law in August 2005, will create opportunities for U.S.-based businesses to export goods with reduced tariffs, and eventually many goods will become duty-free. To be successful in this new environment, businesses will need a workforce that understands the Central American business environment, its cultures, and how to communicate and develop relationships with such businesses. This program is helping to provide such a workforce.</p><p class="FM-C-Heading"><a name="pgfId-2465573"></a>Admission</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-2465575"></a>Because of the cohort nature of the program, students are admitted to the program only for the fall semester.
