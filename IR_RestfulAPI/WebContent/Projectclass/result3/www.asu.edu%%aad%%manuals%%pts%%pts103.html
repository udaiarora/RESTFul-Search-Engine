A disabled decal may be revoked if it is used by an individual having no disability.</p><p>Individuals with disabilities who are unable to drive a vehicle do not qualify for disabled decals.  However, health attendant placards may be purchased for residence hall lots.</p><p>Van accessible stalls are designed for side lift access.</p><p>The Free Local Area SHuttle (FLASH) provides free perimeter transit service to the ASU Tempe campus community and is accessible to persons with disabilities.</p><p>On-campus transportation is available to students, faculty, staff, and guests of the university with permanent or temporary physical disabilities. Rides are provided by the Disability Resource Center to and from residence halls, designated parking areas, and all campus buildings.<p>The service is operated as a &#147;scheduled ride&#148; system and is available Monday through Friday from 7:10 a.m. until 6:45 p.m. The operational area is limited to the Tempe campus boundaries. Transportation is provided by four radio-dispatched electric vehicles, one of which is wheelchair-accessible, that are operated by student staff.<p>To schedule rides, call 480/965-3055.<p>ASU Associated Students Safety Escort service also provides safety escorts based on available resources from 7:00 p.m. to 3 a.m., Monday&#150;Sunday, during the fall and spring semesters. To request a safety escort, call 480/965-1515. For more information about on-campus safety escorts, go to the <a href="safety.html">ASASU Web site</a>.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Decals for Persons with Permanent Disabilities</b></font></p><p>A permanently disabled individual who presents a valid Arizona Permanently Disabled state license plate registration or placard, issued in his or her name, may purchase an ASU Disabled Decal.  A student may have a disabled license plate or placard from the state where the automobile is registered.  ASU disabled decals are purchased from the Decal Sales Office, PTS.</p><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Placards for Persons with Temporary Disabilities</b></font></p><p>Requests for parking made by persons with temporary disabilities due to illness or accident, e.g., a broken leg, will be handled on an individual basis by PTS.  An ASU Temporary Disabled Parking Pass placard authorizes parking in a designated section of Lot 59 or in the disabled stalls of the applicant&#146;s decal lot.</p><p><img src="ptshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"></p><center><font size=+2><b>Procedure</b></font><a href="pts103table.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">D</font></a></center><p><img src="ptshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"></p><p>To obtain temporary disabled parking, follow this procedure.<p><hr noshade><table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1><tr><th>Responsibility<hr></th><th>Action<hr></th></tr><tr valign=TOP>	<td>Temporarily disabled individual</td>	<td><ol>				<li>Obtain a note, signed by a physician (MD), that specifies:<br><br>					<ol type="a">					<p><li>the condition or type of disability</li></p>					<p><li>the estimated recovery period (must specify an ending date not to exceed six weeks)</p>					<p>					and</li></p>					<p><li>that DISABLED parking is required (&#147;closer parking&#148; is insufficient grounds).</li>					</ol>				</li>				</ol>				<ol start="2">				<li>Request temporary disabled parking at the Decal Sales Office.<br><br>					<ol type="a">					<p><li>Present ASU ID card (or driver's license) and a copy of the physician&#146;s note.</li></p>					<p><li>Specify whether a current, valid ASU Tempe campus decal (access A or B) exists.										<p><table>											<tr>												<td valign=TOP>Note:</td>												<td>If an applicant has no current, valid ASU Tempe campus decal (or less than an access A or B), 												a charge will be assessed for the ASU Temporary Disabled Parking Pass.</td>											</tr>										</table></p></li></p>					<p><li>Provide license plate number(s) and vehicle description(s) for the temporary pass.</li></p>					</ol></li></ol>	</td></tr><tr valign=TOP>	<td>Parking Administration Office</td>	<td><ol start="3">				<li>Verify eligibility.</li>				<p><li>Complete the ASU Temporary Disabled Parking Pass placard.</li></p>				<p><li>Receive applicable payment (if necessary).</li>				<p><li>Photocopy the placard and the physician&#146;s note for the file.</li>				<p><li>Issue the ASU Temporary Disabled Parking Pass placard and written 				instructions explaining where parking is authorized.</li></p>				</ol>	</td></tr></table><hr noshade><font color="#FFFFFF"><a name="endtable">endtable</a></font><p><img src="ptshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"></p><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><p><img src="ptshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"></p><p>For general information on decal sales and vehicle registration, see <a href="pts101.html">PTS 101</a>, &#147;Decal Sales and Vehicle Registration.&#148;</p><p>For general information on temporary parking permits, see <a href="pts102.html">PTS 102</a>, &#147;Temporary Parking Permits.&#148;</p><p>For information about on-campus transportation, see the <i>University Student Initiatives Policies and Procedures Manual&#151;</i><a href="../usi/usi701-10.html">USI 701&#150;10</a>, &#147;On-Campus Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities.&#148;<p>&#160;</p><hr><font color=#FFFFFF>skip navigation bar</font><div align="center"><p><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">PTS</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | PTS&#160;manual&#160;<a href="pts001.html">contact</a></p><p>&#160;</p><p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></p></div><p>&#160;</p></body></html>
