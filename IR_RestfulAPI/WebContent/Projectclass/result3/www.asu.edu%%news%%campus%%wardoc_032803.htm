      <h2>Call of duty - ASU doctor makes rounds to treat wounded troops</h2>
      <p>        In the waiting room of ASU's Student Health and Wellness Center, a large
          television screen shows wounded coalition troops arriving at Ramstein
          Air Force Base in Germany, just a few minutes away from life saving
        medical services at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center.</p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/irwinlevely_032803.jpg" alt="Irwin Levey" width="107" height="150" align="right">The scene being
            broadcast is troubling, but health center staffers take comfort in
            the knowledge that those injured will soon be in the care
          of one of their own, ASU health center Physician Irwin Levey, who is
          currently stationed at Landstuhl.</p>
      <p>His co-workers describe Col. Irwin Levey,
          M.D., as a generous and compassionate physician with an unbeatable
        sense of humor. They say his reassuring
          presence makes him ideally suited for caring for wounded coalition
        troops. </p>
      <p>Levey served in the Army during the Vietnam War, and has served as an
          Army Reservist for many years. He joined the health center in 1994
        as a general staff physician and also specializes in oncology and hematology. </p>
      <p>Levey was called to serve in Germany Feb. 1. Though Levey is half a
        world away, his co-workers hear from him on a daily basis thanks to e-mail.
          In a recent e-mail, Levey wrote about the things he misses most about
          home - good Mexican food, dark roast coffee and his cat, Eddy.</p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/wardoc_032803.jpg" width="288" height="188" align="left">Donna Estabrook,
          manager of Medical Records and Patient Services, says Levey is well
        known around the office for making "the very best" homemade
          salsa and for his bizarre, yet impressive, alien collection, which
        includes space movie posters, toy space ships and even little green men. </p>
      <p>"He is
          great," Estabrook says. "We all e-mail him jokes and funny stories
        so he knows we are still missing him."</p>
      <p>Levey's friends aren't anticipating
          as much contact from him now that Operation Iraqi Freedom is in effect.
          He will be busy doing what he does
        best - helping patients.</p>
      <p>ASU health center Physician Dr. Denise Beighe
          says she has always been impressed with the incredible amount of empathy
          Levey shows his patients.</p>
      <p>"He
          is so good with people," Beighe says. "He always makes time for patients,
          and he really cares. His patients know they are his top priority -
        there is no doubt."</p>
      <p>Beighe says she hates to imagine the combat injuries Levey
          will see in Germany.</p>
      <p>"It's sad to think about the kinds of serious injuries he'll
          see there," Beighe says. "We're not used to that kind of thing here.
          At least we
          know he is not on the front lines. He is helping, but hopefully he
        is not in danger."</p>
      <p>Dr. Brent Rich, another physician with the health center,
          says having his co-worker serving oversees makes the war in Iraq seem
          more real.</p>
      <p>"Having
          him gone brings the war closer to home," Rich says. "It makes everything
          more real when the person serving is not some unknown face
        - it's someone from the office next door. We're very proud of him." </p>
      <p>Sue
          Elliot, business manager, senior, says she is already looking forward
        to May, the month Levey is expected to return.</p>
      <p>"I really miss seeing him
          first thing in the morning as we liked to chat before the day got started,"
          Elliott says. "It will be so good to have
        him back home."</p>
