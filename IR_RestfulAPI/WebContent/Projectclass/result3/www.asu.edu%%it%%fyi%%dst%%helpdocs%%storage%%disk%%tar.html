Archiving/Unarchiving using the Tar Command
</center></h2>		
<p>
The "tar" command can be used for archiving and unarchiving files 
and as well as directories.
<h3>
1. Archiving 
</h3><p><b>
1.1</b> The basic command for archiving files with the tar command is:
<p><ul>
	tar -cvf archive_name file1 file2 ...
</ul><dl><dt>
where:
<dd>c - needed for creating a new file.
<dd>v - option for displaying the name of each file being archived.
<dd>f - needed for using the next argument as the name for the archive.
<dd>file1, file2, ... are the names of files that are being archived.
</dl><p>
Suppose, you wish to archive the files: "freq.sas", "plot.sas" and 
"sort.sas", and you wish to create an archive file called "sasfiles.tar". 
In this case, the tar command will be:
<p><ul>
	tar -cvf sasfiles.tar freq.sas plot.sas sort.sas
</ul><p><b>
1.2</b> The basic command for archiving directories with the tar command is:
<p><ul>
	tar -cvf archive_name -C directory .
</ul><dl><dt>
where:
<dd>C - performs a chdir subroutine,
<dd>directory - is the name of the subdirectory that is being 
		archived, and it may be a parent to one more directories. 
</dl><p>
Suppose, you wish to archive the subdirectory "sasdir" which are 
in your home directory, and you wish to create an archive file 
called "sasdir.tar".  In this case, the tar command when executed 
in your home directory will be:
<p><ul>
	tar -cvf sasdir.tar -C sasdir .
</ul><p>
Suppose, you wish to archive the subdirectories "sasdir" and "spssdir"
both of which are in your home directory.  In this case the tar 
command executed in your home directory will be:
<p><ul>
	tar -cvf sasdir.tar -C sasdir . -C ../spssdir .
</ul><p>
<h3>
2. Unarchiving
</h3><p>
The tar command can also be used for unarchiving a tar file, 
but before unarchiving, there are a couple of things that you need 
to do to avoid any problems.
<p><ol>
<li>Use the "fs listquota" command to check whether you have 
sufficient AFS file space.  If space is insufficient then copy 
the tar file to the system temporary storage area such as "/save".
<p>
<li>Always move to an empty directory before unarchiving a tar file. 
This is necessary because when you unarchive a tar file, its contents 
will overwrite files or directories with same names that are in the  
current directory.  You can use the UNIX "mkdir" command to create 
an empty directory.
</ol><p>
The basic command to unarchive a tar file is:
<p><ul>
   tar -xvf filename.tar
</ul><p>
This will unarchive the contents of the tar file "filename.tar" to
the current directory.
<p>
For more information on the tar command, please enter "man tar" at 
the system prompt.
