Admission</b>
</h2>
<h3>
<b>
Preprofessional Admission</b>
<a id="a82451"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
All newly admitted students to the ASU College of Education are admitted as preprofessional education majors. Preprofessional students are advised by a team of academic advisors whose primary focus is on preparing students for admission into the Initial Teacher Certification (ITC) program during their junior year. Admission to ASU with preprofessional status in the College of Education does not guarantee admission to the ITC program. Admission to the ITC is a separate, competitive process. Preprofessional students are strongly encouraged to meet each semester with the preprofessional team of advisors to ensure proper progression through their chosen major. It is crucial that all applicants seeking application to the ITC program gain valuable experience with the population of students they intend to teach; the Office of Student Services can provide information on various opportunities to gain such experience. To schedule an appointment with a preprofessional advisor, call 480/965-5555.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Initial Teacher Certification Professional Program Admission</b>
<a id="a25585"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Undergraduate students are eligible for admission consideration into the Initial Teacher Certification (ITC) program if they meet the following criteria:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
admission to the Tempe campus as a degree-seeking student. Application information is available at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/admissions">www.asu.edu/admissions</a>. Students planning to begin the ITC program in the spring should submit ASU admission materials in May. Students planning to begin the ITC program in the fall should submit admission materials in October;</li>
<li>
a minimum 2.50 cumulative GPA (ASU GPA and transfer GPA combined) (verified one month before program start date);</li>
<li>
a minimum 2.50 cumulative ASU GPA by the time the student begins the ITC program (verified one month before program start date);</li>
<li>
completion of at least 56 semester hours (verified one month before program start date);</li>
<li>
in progress or completion of the following prerequisites: ENG 101 and 102, the Mathematics (MA) requirement, and the Literacy and Critical Inquiry (L) requirement or the Natural Science (SQ or SG) requirement. Proof of in-progress course work (transcripts) must be submitted within the student&#8217;s ITC Application Portfolio. The above courses must be completed with grades of &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00) or higher by the time the student begins the ITC program (verified one month before program start date). For more information regarding courses that satisfy these requirements, consult with an Office of Student Services (OSS) advisor. Students from out-of-state institutions or students from outside of the Arizona public community college and university system need to have course equivalency approval before submitting an application;</li>
<li>
demonstration of experience with children/adolescents. Individuals who wish to become teachers need to have demonstrated a commitment to working with children in a way that helps children/adolescents learn a new skill, acquire knowledge, reinforce concepts, or expand their talents. The applicant&#8217;s interactions with children/adolescents need to be observed by a supervisor and referred to in the letters of recommendation; and</li>
<li>
formal application to the ITC program made by February 1 for fall admission or September 1 for spring admission. </li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
<i>
Note:</i> Secondary Education students must complete a portion of their academic specialization before submitting application materials. See an advisor for more details.</p>
<p>
Admission is a selective, competitive process and is not guaranteed to all that satisfy the minimum admission requirements. The ITC application is available online at 
<a href="http://coe.asu.edu/oss/admission">coe.asu.edu/oss/admission</a>
 before application deadlines.</p>
<p>
Some ITC programs have additional admission requirements; consequently, students should consult with an OSS academic advisor as they prepare to apply to the ITC program of their choice, to verify what additional requirements must be met. Students may also attend an Initial Advising Session (IAS), offered through the OSS, to learn more about the ITC application and admission process. To schedule an IAS appointment, call the OSS at 480/965-5555.</p></div>
<h3>
Application Deadlines</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The College of Education has three admission cycles. Priority application deadlines for most ITC programs are February 1 for fall admission and September 1 for spring admission. An additional application deadline of June 1 applies to students seeking spring admission to the Apprentice Teacher Program (ATP) or fall admission to the Integrated Certification in Teacher Education (INCITE) and the Teacher Education and Certification Highway + Master in Education option (TEACH+ME) postbaccalaureate programs. Spring admission to INCITE follows the regular September 1 deadline. For the most updated admission dates, access the ITC admission Web site at 
<a href="http://coe.asu.edu/oss/admission">coe.asu.edu/oss/admission</a>.</p></div>
<h3>
Transfer Students</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
To be considered for admission to the ITC program, transfer students must first be formally admitted to ASU. For more information, see 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a21220">Transfer Students or Readmission Students</a>. </p>
<p>
<i>
Note:</i> Once students receive notification of ASU admission, all education transfer students must attend an Initial Advising Session (IAS) as their first step in securing academic advising from the college. These sessions are conducted by academic advisors and are provided in groups according to the student&#8217;s desired degree program (early childhood, elementary, secondary, special education, multilingual/multicultural). During the IAS, students are given an overview of the various ITC programs available, application requirements are discussed, and individualized degree audits (through the Degree Audits Reporting System) are provided to each student. Course selection, degree requirements, and general education requirements are also covered during these sessions. To sign up for an IAS, call the Office of Student Services at 480/965-5555. ASU Undergraduate Admissions should receive the application for admission to ASU, transcripts, and other required information at least five months before the ITC application deadline for the desired ITC admission semester.</p>
<p>
Students who are considering transferring to ASU and the College of Education, who are not yet committed to ASU as their school of choice, may schedule an appointment with the transfer recruitment specialist by calling 480/965-5555.</p>
<p>
Transfer students from Arizona institutions should access the ASU Education Transfer guides for optimal course selection on the Web at

Students work with members of other disciplines and collaborate between and across community programs and university departmental structures to promote broad-based professional preparation. Students participate in schools and community agencies that also operate cross-professionally. The early childhood faculty and its community partners work from a child-sensitive, or constructivist approach that emphasizes constructivist theory, multiple points of view, emergent learning, and a developmental, integrative approach to classroom practice. The program includes course work for a provisional English as a second language endorsement, and is a K-8 certification program. For course requirements, see 
<a href="college-education.html#a83261">Course Requirements</a>.</p></div>

<p class="noindent"><b>
<a id="a57665"></a>Elementary Education Partnership Program (K-8).</b> 
Students in the Elementary Education Partnership Program (EEPP) work in three different elementary schools, one each semester, before their student teaching. Each semester, or block, includes methods courses that are taught on an elementary school campus through an internship of six hours each week. Students become an integral part of the life of the elementary school, and assignments link the classroom observations and experiences to the content of the methods courses. Faculty from each of the school sites coordinate assignments and activities to ensure a wide range of learning experiences; some assignments are continued across semesters. Course content is in place to qualify all students in this program for a provisional English as a second language endorsement. A fast track option is available, but it is a highly competitive process. Consult with an academic advisor in the Office of Student Services for application deadlines and criteria. For course requirements, see

<a id="a41186"></a>Indigenous Teacher Preparation Program.</b> 
Through the commitment of the College of Education and with the collaborative efforts of the ASU Center for Indian Education, the Indigenous Teacher Preparation Program (ITP) intends to meet the unique educational and culturally related academic needs of indigenous children. ITP has developed a program focusing on cultural knowledge and sensitivity; it emphasizes pedagogy and strategies that are most effective for indigenous learners. ITP strives to prepare high quality beginning teachers for elementary certification, provide a developmental and responsive curriculum focused on Indian education, foster knowledge and values of the indigenous community, and promote leadership in teaching and teacher education. The program benefits teaching candidates through a cohort for support, an apprentice model for field experiences, and numerous university resources.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
<a id="a56088"></a>Integrated Certification in Teacher Education.</b> 
INCITE is a flexible program that prepares working adults to become secondary education teachers. All course work is offered during the evening and on weekends except for secondary education methods courses, which may be offered only during daytime hours depending on the corresponding college&#8217;s schedule. Daytime field experience internship hours are required. INCITE is designed for postbaccalaureate students only.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Multilingual/Multicultural Program.</b> 
The MLMC program is a four-semester sequence offered in &#8220;blocks&#8221; with focused field requirements in selected elementary schools that offer bilingual and/or ESL settings. The bilingual education option prepares teachers to teach elementary students whose primary language is Spanish or a Native American language spoken in Arizona. The ESL option prepares teachers to teach elementary school students from any language background who are still acquiring English as an additional language. Methods courses are often divided into BLE or ESL sections, although some course work is planned together to promote collaboration. The program meets Arizona requirements for an elementary education teaching certificate with an endorsement in bilingual education or English as a second language. For course requirements, see 
<a href="college-education.html#a19049">Course Requirements</a>.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
<a id="a26574"></a>Secondary Education (SED) (7-12).</b> 
In order to integrate teacher education preparation with the secondary education requirement for an academic specialization, the College of Education maintains connections with academic departments across the university. Each program semester requires an internship in the schools, and some courses are taught in the field. Graduates are eligible for secondary certification in grades 7-12 in one of 15 active academic specializations, and have the option of adding a middle school endorsement. In addition to these 15 active SED programs, three additional specializations are available through the Herberger College of Fine Arts, including Music Education (choral-general or instrumental music), Art Education, and Dance Education. Fine Arts majors receive a recommendation K-12 endorsement. Students with a major in Secondary Education have two academic advisors: one in the college and department of the academic specialization and one in the Office of Student Services in the College of Education. For course requirements, see 
<a href="college-education.html#a40745">Course Requirements</a>.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
<a id="a43927"></a>Special Education (SPE).</b> 
The SPE program leads to the BAE degree in Special Education and to certification in 
K-12 special education for children with learning disabilities, mild mental retardation, or emotional/behavioral disorders. This program provides preparation in each of the three disability areas; however, the student only qualifies for a teaching certificate in one area, which is determined by the area of student teaching placement. A school internship is required for each semester. For course requirements, see 
<a href="college-education.html#a56396">Course Requirements</a>.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Teacher Education and Certification Highway + Masters in Education option (TEACH+ME).</b> 
TEACH+ME is a self-paced postbaccalaureate program geared toward working adults interested in achieving elementary (K-8) teaching certification or current teaching professionals who do not possess elementary education certification. The program offers students an array of experiences. Students learn the most recent teaching strategies and become an interactive force in the development of a professional teacher education model. Students also participate in teaching experiences with a mentor teacher and students in designated urban schools.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Teacher Education for Arizona Mathematics and Science (TEAMS).</b> 
TEAMS is a 10-month program, with course work leading to 7-12 certification and an optional middle school endorsement. It is a combined postbaccalaureate/master&#8217;s program specializing in mathematics, science, and technology, and is based on technology, field-based experiences, internships, and course work. Students attend classes full-time during daytime hours.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
University Graduation Requirements</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
In addition to fulfilling college and major requirements, students must meet all university graduation requirements. For more information, see 
<a href="university-graduation-requirements.html#a29335">University Graduation Requirements</a>.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Degree Requirements</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
A minimum of 120 semester hours is required for the Bachelor of Arts in Education (BAE) degree. The BAE degree consists of four areas:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
General Studies;</li>
<li>
College of Education core requirements (Elementary Education, Apprentice Teacher Program, Multilingual/Multicultural Education, Early Childhood Education, Secondary Education, and Special Education);</li>
<li>
Academic specialization (Secondary Education only); and</li>
<li>
Initial Teacher Certification (ITC) program courses.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The College of Education expects degree candidates to meet individual course assessment standards, field-experience observation criteria, courses required for teacher certification, and other proficiency standards and performance criteria required to demonstrate knowledge and skill in the areas listed under 
<a href="college-education.html#a41959">Bachelor of Arts in Education</a>.</p>
<p>
The degree program also includes courses and academic content required for teacher certification by the State of Arizona. Students seeking certification in one of the fine arts must complete degree requirements in the Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts and specified courses through the ITC program.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
General Studies Requirement</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
All students enrolled in a baccalaureate degree program must satisfy a university requirement of a minimum of 35 hours of approved course work as described in 
<a href="general-studies.html#a88218">General Studies</a>. Note that all three General Studies awareness areas are required. General Studies courses are listed in the 
<a href="UG.18.html#a31934">General Studies Courses</a>, in the course descriptions, in the <i>
Schedule of Classes,</i>
 and in the <i>
Summer Sessions Bulletin.</i>
</p>
<p>
Preprofessional students should complete as many of the General Studies courses as possible before admission to the ITC program. Students are encouraged to consult with an academic advisor to ensure they comply with all necessary requirements.</p></div>
<h3>
College of Education Core Requirements</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The Initial Teacher Certification program prepares students for teacher certification and requires students to complete semester hours selected from specific core courses pertinent to the teaching area. Courses listed under this portion of the academic major are governed by the general ASU &#8220;Guidelines for Determination of Catalog Year.&#8221;</p>
<p>
For more information, see 
<a href="university-graduation-requirements.html#a42063">Guidelines for Determination of Catalog Year</a>.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Initial Teacher Certification Program Courses</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The Initial Teacher Certification (ITC) program is a sequential program consisting of 36 to 55 semester hours. Ranging from nine to 19 hours per semester, the courses for one semester must be completed before enrolling in the next semester. In other words, courses for one semester usually may not be taken at the same time as those scheduled for another semester. In addition to ITC courses, students continue completing the General Studies requirement and core requirements or academic specialization requirements through the third semester of the program (except for students applying to the Apprentice Teacher Program in Elementary Education). Courses listed under this portion of the academic major are governed under an alternative catalog year, and students should consult with their academic advisors before applying to the ITC program of their choice, to determine the ITC courses for their designated admission date. </p></div>
<h3>
Declaration of Graduation</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Undergraduate students must file a declaration of graduation during the first semester of enrollment in the ITC program. Preprofessional students completing 87 hours (the university limit for registering without a program of study) who have not been admitted to the ITC program must meet with an advisor to obtain a registration waiver by the College of Education. See 
<a href="university-graduation-requirements.html#a29335">University Graduation Requirements</a>.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Field Experience Requirements</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
In addition to course work, students admitted to the ITC program are required to participate in directed field experiences during each of the four semesters of the program. The field experiences progress from short-term observation and participation to long-term supervised practice teaching. </p>
<p>
Students should expect these field experiences to be above and beyond the class times listed in the <i>
Schedule of Classes</i>
 for each semester. Such field experiences typically take place in schools throughout the greater Phoenix area. Regular attendance is required during all field experiences. Students should plan extra travel time and expect to confer with placement teachers and field facilitators before or after scheduled field experiences. To meet field experience requirements, students must plan to have their own transportation and <i>
be available during regular school hours.</i>
</p>
<p>
Teaching is a highly demanding and extraordinarily complex profession. Students desiring to become teachers must maintain academic standards and demonstrate requisite qualifications for successful teaching, including effective interpersonal skills, basic communication skills, appropriate professional conduct, and satisfactory performance during field experience assignments.</p>
<p>
Observation and participation assignments in the schools during first, second, and third semester field experience placements are designed to prepare students for the highly demanding performance-based student teaching during semester four.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Student Teaching.</b>
<a id="a76455"></a> 
The culminating field experience, called <i>
student teaching,</i>
 occurs in the final semester of the ITC program and is a full-day, full-semester obligation. Student teaching takes place only during fall and spring semesters.</p>
<p>
Student teaching is a full-time, 15 week, commitment under the supervision of a mentor teacher. To be eligible for a student teaching placement, individuals must apply by the deadline determined each semester by the Office of Professional Field Experiences. Students must complete all program requirements before beginning a student teaching assignment. Student teachers must adhere to the calendar, regulations, and philosophy of the schools in which they are placed. Beginning and ending dates for student teaching are determined by the Office of Professional Field Experiences in cooperation with the participating school. Because student teaching is on a full-day schedule, 8 
a.m. to 4 
p.m.
 Monday through Friday for 15 consecutive weeks, student teachers are strongly encouraged to avoid extra activities and outside employment that would interfere with the heavy demands placed upon them while student teaching.</p>

Elementary Education (Apprentice Teacher Program)&#8212;BAE</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Offered jointly with local school districts, the Apprentice Teacher Program (ATP) is a concentrated, full-time, daytime certification program option that is completed in one calendar year, with all course work based in the participating schools. This full-immersion program begins each January and leads to K-8 teacher certification. </p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
<a id="a16899"></a>Course Requirements.</b> 
The Initial Teacher Certification (ITC) program is completed in one calendar year, spring admission only. All course work (General Studies and College of Education requirements) not included in the ATP program, must be completed before beginning the program. Additionally, undergraduate students must complete 70 semester hours by the start of the program. The program schedule conforms to the public school calendar rather than the ASU calendar, thereby extending the academic year by eight weeks. The program is intense but efficient. Students are actively engaged in classroom experiences or ASU course work for at least seven hours every day (Monday-Friday) for 46 weeks. Field-based courses are taken in semester blocks in sequential order. Program courses and requirements are subject to change depending on the ITC admission date.</p></div>

<h2>
College of Extended Education</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The university-wide College of Extended Education provides an interactive link between ASU and the diverse communities it serves. The college assesses lifelong learning requirements and works in partnership with campuses, other colleges, and the community to serve learners, using a network of locations, programs, schedules, and technologies.</p>
<p>
For more information, see 
<a href="college-extended-education.html#a92893">College of Extended Education</a>, or access the Web site at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/xed">www.asu.edu/xed</a>.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Academic Standards</b>
</h2>
<h3>
<b>
Professional Program Status</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Students admitted to the ITC program must maintain high academic standards and demonstrate the requisite qualifications for successful teaching, including sound physical and mental health, good interpersonal skills, basic communication skills, a positive attitude, appropriate professional conduct, and satisfactory performance in field experiences. Because ITC standards are higher than those for the university, a student who is suspended from the ITC program may still be eligible to enroll in other non-ITC courses.</p>
<p>
A copy of the Retention and Continuation Policy, which is part of the ITC handbook, may be obtained from the Office of Student Services, EDB L1-13.</p>
<p>
College of Education faculty and placement teachers routinely review preservice teachers&#8217; professional attributes and characteristics to determine if the student is making satisfactory progress at both midterm and final examinations. To maintain good standing, students need to demonstrate appropriate professional demeanor in field placements and college classes.</p>
<p>
Students demonstrating behaviors or characteristics that make it questionable as to whether they can succeed in the teaching profession are reviewed by the director of the Office of Professional Field Experiences and the assistant dean of the Office of Student Services. If necessary, a review panel composed of faculty members who have had direct involvement with the student is convened. Following this review, the student may be referred to the Division of Curriculum and Instruction Standards and Appeals Committee. The committee&#8217;s review may result in a decision to disqualify the student or the specification of conditions under which continued participation is permitted, i.e., probation.</p>
<p>
Students who wish to appeal decisions of the Division of Curriculum and Instruction Standards and Appeals Committee may do so in writing to the dean of the college. Any exceptions to the retention and disqualification policies and procedures must be approved by the committee and the dean.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Certification for Teaching</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The curricula for both the undergraduate and postbaccalaureate Initial Teacher Certification programs meet the requirements for teacher certification in the state of Arizona.</p>
<p>
In addition to the course requirements specified in this catalog, there are other requirements for teacher certification mandated by the state of Arizona including the U.S. Constitution and Arizona Constitution requirement. Each student must pass the Arizona Educator Proficiency Assessment, which consists of professional knowledge and subject knowledge tests.</p>
<p>
Because these requirements vary over program areas and may be changed at any time, students are encouraged to maintain close contact with the Office of Student Services regarding the most current state certification requirements.</p>
<p>
The College of Education is approved by the Arizona Department of Education for the preparation of elementary, secondary, and special education teachers. The Office of Student Services maintains information about current certification requirements in Arizona and other states.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Independent Learning Course Work for Credit</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
It is the general policy of the College of Education not to accept course credit for <i>
courses in education</i>
 taken through Independent Learning. Exceptions to this policy may be approved if the Independent Learning course work has been approved in advance of enrollment in the course by the student&#8217;s advisor, respective program coordinator, and division director. In all such cases, an appropriate rationale must be submitted with the request to enroll.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
BIS Concentration</b>
<a id="a16550"></a></h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
A concentration in education is available under the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (BIS) degree, a program intended for the student who has academic interests that might not be satisfied with existing majors. Building on two academic concentrations (or one double concentration) and an interdisciplinary core, students in the BIS program take active roles in creating their educational plans and defining their career goals. For more information, see 
<a href="university-college.html#a42331">School of Interdisciplinary Studies</a>.</p></div>
<h2>
Graduate Degrees</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The College of Education offers numerous graduate degree programs. For more information, see the
