      <h2><strong>Center for Study of Religion and Conflict October Lectures Address Global Hot Spots and Burning Issues </strong></h2>
      <p>As the election season heats up to maximum intensity and Americans worry about flaring global issues, Arizona State University's Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict is presenting a month-long series of visiting speakers offering informed perspectives on our increasingly inflamed world. </p>
              <p>On <strong>October 12</strong>, the Center, in&nbsp; partnership with&nbsp; the College of Law, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and the Barrett Honors College is presenting long-time Middle East peace negotiator <strong>Ambassador Dennis Ross</strong>, who is visiting the Valley as a participant in "America and the World: Challenges Facing the Next Administration," <strong></strong>a symposium being presented by ASU and the Council on Foreign Relations. </p>
              <p>On <strong>October 14</strong>,&nbsp; the Center presents <em></em><em></em><em><strong></strong></em><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Mark Juergensmeyer </strong> of the University of California - Santa Barbara, who is visiting as part of a CSRC-sponsored conference entitled "Religion and Conflict in Asia: Disrupting Violence.<em>" </em> Juergensmeyer will open the conference with a public presentation on the Global Rise of Religious Violence. </p>
              <p>The month's events conclude on <strong>October 27 </strong> with New York University law professor, author, and former senior constitutional advisor in Iraq <strong>Noah Feldman</strong>, who will give the final presentation in the CSRC's fall lecture series,&nbsp; a lecture entitled "Islamic Democracy and the Future of Iraq." </p>
              <p><br>
        In the October 12 event, <strong>Ambassador Ross </strong> will discuss his highly acclaimed new book, <em>The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace </em> in ASU's Armstrong Hall at 2:30 p.m.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Ambassador Ross is counselor and Ziegler distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. For more than twelve years, Ambassador Ross played a leading role in shaping U.S. involvement in the Middle East peace process and in dealing directly with the parties in negotiations. A highly skilled diplomat, Ambassador Ross was this country's point man on the peace process in both the George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations. He was instrumental in assisting Israelis and Palestinians in reaching the 1995 Interim Agreement; he also successfully brokered the Hebron Accord in 1997, facilitated the 1994 Israel-Jordan peace treaty, and intensively worked to bring Israel and Syria together. </p>
              <p>Following the lecture Ambassador Ross will sign copies of his book.&nbsp; The event is free and open to the public. Information regarding the lecture and parking is available at &lt; <a href="http://www.law.asu.edu/ross/">http://www.law.asu.edu/ross/ </a>&gt;. Attendance at the ASU/CFR conference is by invitation only and not open to the public. </p>
              <p><strong>Mark Juergensmeyer</strong><strong><em>'s </em></strong><em></em>October 14 lecture is entitled "The Global Rise of Religious Violence: The Case of South And Southeast Asia" and will be presented in the Carson Ballroom of ASU's Old Main at 4 p.m. The event is free and open to the public. </p>
              <p>Juergensmeyer is professor of sociology and director of Global and International Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is the author of the best-selling <em>Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence </em> and has been working at the leading edge of issues related to religion and conflict for the past ten years. His publications include <em>The New Cold War? Religious Nationalism Confronts the Secular Stat </em>e, and <em>Gandhi's Way: A Handbook of Conflict Resolution</em>. His lecture at ASU will be based on his more than ten years worth of interviews with religious extremists and his recent travels through South and Southeast Asia. </p>
              <p>The October 27 lecture by <strong>Noah Feldman </strong> is the final fall event in "Alternative Visions,"&nbsp; the CSRC's annual series of public conversations with internationally recognized authorities aimed at exploring the sources of religious conflict and strategies for their resolution. The event, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the College of Law, is free and open to the public, but tickets <em>are </em> required. Reservations may be made by emailing csrc@asu.edu &lt;<a href="mailto:csrc@asu.edu">mailto:csrc@asu.edu </a>&gt; or calling 480-727-6736. </p>
              <p>An authority on constitutional law, Feldman is one of today's leading experts on Islam and Democracy. He has been involved as a senior constitutional advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. He teaches constitutional law, administrative law, law and religion and the intellectual history of legal theory at the NYU School of&nbsp; Law, where he is also the co-director of the Center on Law and Security. </p>
              <p>Feldman is also the author of <em>After Jihad: America and the Struggle for Islamic Democracy </em> and former senior constitutional adviser. His soon to be released book, <em>What We Owe Iraq: War and the Ethics of Nation Building</em>, helps to illuminate America's mission in Iraq as well as the significance of nation-building for the long-term interests of the U.S. and the nations involved. </p>
