<P>As
an alternative method to signing on through the  TELNET  daemon, the OpenVMS
Alpha spawner program allows SAS/CONNECT sessions
on OpenVMS Alpha systems without requiring that username and password pairs
be passed over the network in clear text mode.
<P>If the local SAS session is running Release 6.09E or a subsequent release
or Release 6.11 TS040 or a subsequent release, all data that flows from the
local host to the spawner program during sign on is encrypted.
<P>Unlike the TELNET sign-on process, the  spawner program allows sign
ons to an OpenVMS Alpha system without scripts. You should run the  spawner
by using <B>syspriv</B> or bypass privileges in order to start the remote
SAS processes with the privileges of the user who connects to the spawner.
<P>The spawner program is stored on the remote host in the executables
directory. An alias can be defined to point to the appropriate directory and
executable for the spawner program by using the following DCL command:



<PRE>SASTCPD:==$SAS$ROOT:[PROCS]SASTCPD.EXE</PRE>
<P>The spawner can then be invoked with options. For example: 



<PRE>SASTCPD -service spawnjob -nocleartext</PRE>
<P>Here
is the complete syntax for the command to start the spawner program:

<DL>
<DT>-BACKGROUND</DT>
<DD>specifies that the spawner program run as a background process.
The default specifies that the spawner program run in the foreground.<P></DD>

<DT>-SERVICE <B>service-name</B></DT>
<DD>specifies the name of the service that the spawner program
uses to listen for incoming requests. This value is identical to the <B>service</B> value in the REMOTE= option that the user specifies at the
local host prior to sign on. Because there is no default, you must specify
this value. See <A href="z0298088.htm#z0298087">Specifying the Remote Node Name</A>
for details.
<P>The service name must be defined identically in the 


<CODE><B>/etc/services</B></CODE> file on both the local and remote hosts. See <A href="zervices.htm">Configuring the SERVICES File</A> for more information about the 


<CODE><B>/etc/services</B></CODE> file. <P></DD>

<DT>-HELP</DT>
<DD>prints a list of valid parameters.<P></DD>

<DT>-INHERITANCE</DT>
<DD>causes the SAS session that is spawned to inherit the socket
that was created when the spawner accepted the initial connection from the
local SAS session .  This option is useful if your configuration involves
a firewall and you want to minimize the number of ports that you define to
the firewall for use by SAS/CONNECT. 
<P>If you start a spawner with the -INHERITANCE option, you then define
the port that the spawner is listening on to the firewall and map it to the
server machine's port.  This will enable any number of SAS/CONNECT clients
to connect through this single port and SIGNON to a remote host on the inside
of the firewall.  Each client just opens a unique socket on the defined port.
 This eliminates the need to define an individual port for each client that
may need to come in through the firewall.  In this configuration you set your
REMOTE= value to a two-level name where the first level is the name of the
host running the firewall and the second level is the well-known service name
of the port that you have enabled for connections.<P></DD>

<DT>  -NETENCRALG
<B>algorithm</B></DT>
<DD>If you specify more than one algorithm, enclose the algorithm
names in parenthesis and use commas to separate the names. If there are embedded
blanks in the algorithm name,  enclose each algorithm in quotation marks.
<P>Set this option at the remote host and, optionally, at the local host
to specify one or more encryption algorithms to use in a SAS/CONNECT session.
However, the local host and the remote host must share an encryption algorithm
in common. If you specify the option in the remote host session only, the
local host attempts to select an algorithm that was specified at the remote
host. If you also set the option at the local host and specify an algorithm
that is not specified at the remote host, the local host's attempt to connect
to that remote host fails when the local host assigns a library. 
<P>Valid values for this option are

<P>See the 



<B>SAS/CONNECT User's Guide</B> or the 



<B>SAS/SHARE User's Guide</B>  for more information about the -NETENCRALG
option.<P></DD>

<DT>-NETENCRYPT</DT>
<DD>Set this option at both the local host and the remote host.
At the remote host, this option specifies that encryption is required for
each connection from a local host SAS session. At the local host, this option
specifies that the local host must connect only to a remote host that supports
encryption. 
<P>The default for this option is that encryption is used if the -NETENCRALG
option is set and if both the local host and the remote host are capable of
encryption. If encryption algorithms were specified but either the local host
or the remote host is incapable of encryption, then encryption will not be
performed.
<P>Encryption may not be supported at the local host or at the remote host
for the following reasons:
<UL>

<LI>You are running a release of SAS (prior to Version 7) that does
not support encryption.<P>

<LI>Your site has not purchased a SAS/SECURE license for a specific
platform.<P>

<LI>You specified encryption algorithms in the local host and the
remote host SAS sessions that are incompatible.<P>

<LI>You do not have a cryptographic service provider installed on
your OpenVMS system.<P>
</UL>

<P>See the 



<B>SAS/CONNECT User's Guide</B> or the 



<B>SAS/SHARE User's Guide</B>  for more information about the -NETENCRYPT
option.<P></DD>

<DT>-NETENCRKEY<B>n</B> </DT>
<DD>You set this option in either the local host or the remote
host SAS session. It specifies the key length to be used by the encryption
algorithm.
<P>Valid values for this option are
<TABLE cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>128</TD>
<TD align="left">specifies 1024-bit RSA and 128-bit RC2 and RC4 key
algorithms.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>40</TD>
<TD align="left">specifies 512-bit RSA and 40-bit RC2 and RC4 key
algorithms.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>0</TD>
<TD align="left">no value is set. This is the default.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>If you require extra security, then set the -NETENCRKEY option to 128.
If you prefer to save CPU, then set the -NETENCRKEY option to 40. 
<P>By default, if you try to connect a host that is capable of only a 40-bit
key length with a host that is capable of both a 40-bit and a 128-bit key
length, then the connection is made using the lesser key length. If both hosts
are capable of 128-bit key lengths, then a 128-bit key length is used.
<P>See the 



<B>SAS/CONNECT User's Guide</B> or the 



<B>SAS/SHARE User's Guide</B>  for more information about the -NETENCRKEY
option.<P></DD>

<DT>-NETMAC | -NONETMAC </DT>
<DD>Set this option to control the use of Message Authentication
Codes (MACs) on network communications. A Message Authentication Code is the
equivalent of a checksum that is used to ensure that the original message
has not been modified.
<P>This option may be set at either the local host or the remote host.
The default is -NETMAC.
<P>See the 



<B>SAS/CONNECT User's Guide</B> or the 



<B>SAS/SHARE User's Guide</B>  for more information about the -NETMAC
option.<P></DD>

<DT>-NOCLEARTEXT</DT>
<DD>prevents a sign on from a local host that does not support
username and password encryption. This option prevents local hosts in a SAS
session that are running releases prior to 6.09E and 6.11 TS040 from signing
on to the spawner program. The default is to accept both encrypted and clear-text
userids and passwords. This allows local hosts in a SAS session that are running
releases prior to 6.09E and 6.11 TS040 to sign on to the spawner program.<P></DD>

<DT>-NOSCRIPT</DT>
<DD>prevents sign ons from local hosts that use scripts, and
allows sign ons only from local hosts that do not use scripts.
<P>This option requires that the user set security in the local SAS session
during sign on. For details about setting security (for example, by means
of the USER= and PASSWORD= options in an appropriate statement), see <A href="z0145433.htm#z1253348">Setting Security for SAS/CONNECT and SAS/SHARE</A>.
<P>If you use the -NOSCRIPT option, you must also use the -SASCMD option.<P></DD>

<DT>-SASCMD <B>filename</B></DT>
<DD>specifies the command that starts a SAS session when you
sign on without a script. If the RLINK fileref is not defined in the local
host SAS session, then the user is signing on without a script. In this case,
the -SASCMD option must be specified.
<P>Here is an example  of the content of an executable file that starts
a SAS session:  



<PRE>$!
$! mystartup
$!
sas /DMR/NOTERMINAL/NO$SYNTAXCHECK/DEVICE=GRLINK/COMAMID=TCP
$ exit</PRE><P></DD>

<DT>-SHELL</DT>
<DD>allows the SAS session that is invoked by the spawner program
to create a shell. A shell is necessary for the remote host to execute commands.<P></DD>

<DT>-USER</DT>
<DD>allows the spawner program to run without root privileges.
SAS processes assume the security status of the user or the administrator
who started the spawner program. The default action is to assume the privileges
of the user whose username and password are given to the spawner program.
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Open/VMS systems require group or system privilege in
order to validate passwords, this option may not work unless the user has
the correct privilege, or the user that starts the spawner passes his or her
own uername and password to the spawner for access verification.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR><P></DD>

<TR valign="bottom"><TD><HR></TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">Examples of Starting and Connecting to the OpenVMS Alpha Spawner Program</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>The following examples illustrate how to start the spawner program
and how to connect to it.
<P>Example 1:
<P>The following command starts the spawner program at the remote OpenVMS
Alpha host with the <B>service-name</B> VMSSPAWN and allows connections
only from local hosts that support username and password encryption.  



<PRE>sastcpd -service vmsspawn -nocleartext</PRE>
<P>At the local host host, the following statements specify a script file
named TCPVMS.SCR that makes a connection to the spawner program named MONARCH.VMSSPAWN.
The value MONARCH for REMOTE=  is the name of the OpenVMS Alpha node, or it
can be a macro variable that contains the Internet address of the OpenVMS
Alpha node where the spawner program is running.  



<PRE>options comamid=tcp;
options remote=monarch.vmsspawn;
filename rlink "$SAS$ROOT:[TOOLS]tcpvms.scr";
signon;</PRE>
<P>Example 2:
<P>From the OpenVMS Alpha node that will be the remote side of a SAS/CONNECT session,
the following command starts the spawner program with the service name VMSSPAWN,
which supports only sign ons without scripts.



<PRE>sastcpd -service vmsspawn -noscript 
        -sascmd $SAS$ROOT:[TOOLS]mystartup.com</PRE>
<P>The MYSTARTUP file starts the remote SAS session. See the -SASCMD option
for an example of the content of the executable file MYSTARTUP.
<P>In the following example, the TCP/IP access method connects the local
host to the remote host RMTHOST on which the spawner program VMSSPAWN runs.
 The value RMTHOST must be either the node name of the OpenVMS Alpha node
or a macro variable that contains the Internet address of the OpenVMS Alpha
node where the spawner program is running.  The USER= option to SIGNON causes
a prompt for userid and password during sign on.



<PRE>options comamid=tcp;
signon user=_prompt_ rmthost.vmsspawn;</PRE>
