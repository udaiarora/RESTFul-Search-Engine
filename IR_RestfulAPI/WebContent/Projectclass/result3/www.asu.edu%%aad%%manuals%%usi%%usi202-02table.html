<p>
<ol>

<p>
<li>determines and assigns the residency classification status of the student</p>

<p>
or</li></p>

<p>
<li>the University Undergraduate Admissions Board, if the student wishes to transfer to another college in the university.</li></ol></p>
</ol>

<p>
The college or University Undergraduate Admissions Board approves or disapproves the applications. If not approved, the student is notified in writing. The college or University Undergraduate Admissions Board returns the applications reflecting the readmission decision to the Recording/Readmissions section or Admission Services at the West campus, which files the disapproved applications.</p>

<p>
If approved, the Recording/Readmissions section or Admission Services at the West campus processes the student&#146;s reinstatement and readmission and issues a Certificate of Readmission through the mail to the student.</p>

<p>
A readmitted/reinstated student may contact the Residency Classification Section (480/965&#150;7712) if he or she disagrees with the residency classification determination.</p>
