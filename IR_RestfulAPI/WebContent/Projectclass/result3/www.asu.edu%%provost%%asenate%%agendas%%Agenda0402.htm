<p><b>Title of Motion: Request from the College of Business to Change the

Name of</b>

<br><b>Degree Program</b>

<br>&nbsp;

<p><b>The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic

Senate approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Business to change

the name of a degree program from MS in Information Management to MS in

E-Business and Information Systems.</b>

<p><b>Rationale:</b>

<p><b>The reasons for the name change are that advances in technology have

changed and continue to markedly change the global business landscape.

Terms such as E-Commerce and E-Business are now very much part of the vocabulary.

In response, to market their programs, universities have increasingly responded

by re-branding their technology rich programs with names such as Master

of E-Commerce or Master of E-Business. Prospective employers and prospective

students, in their search processes, now look for these names.</b>

<p><b>The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic

<p><b>Rationale:</b>

<p><b>Previously, the request to disestablish the Theatre Education concentration

was approved. As a follow-up, it is now requested that the BFA degree in

the Theatre Department be eliminated, as well. The Theatre Department no

longer will have any BFA degree or concentration.</b>

<p><b>The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic

Senate approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts

and Sciences for the establishment of an Undergraduate Certificate in Classical

Studies.</b>

<p><b>Rationale:</b>

<p><b>The certificate program in Classical Studies will benefit both the

students and the university in a number of ways. By means of the certificate

program in Classical Studies, students will be able to augment and enrich

their degree programs in related fields with an organized and consistent

curriculum which will expose them to many aspects of ancient language and

culture, and they will also be prepared to pursue advanced studies in Classical

Studies or in related fields in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Ancient

History, English, Art History, or Philosophy with the strength of an approved

program behind them.</b>

<br>&nbsp;

<p><font face="Arial">Personnel Committee</font>

<p><font face="Arial">Dear Colleagues:</font>

<p><font face="Arial">I have decided to run an experiment and, instead

of giving a verbal report at the April 2 meeting of the Senate, I have

decided to send a written one via e-mail. I?m betting it will be clearer

and save time.</font>

<p><font face="Arial">***************************************************************************************************</font>

<p><font face="Arial">Report on the March 22, 2001 meeting of the Personnel

Committee</font>

<p><font face="Arial">a) United Way- The Committee?s consensus was that

there is no workable way to ensure that an individual?s choices of where

he or she wants his or her contributions to go will have an effect on the

funds that different agencies ultimately will receive from the United Way.

In brief, people have two realistic choices: to contribute or not. On another

matter, there was consensus that it would be better if less pressure were

exerted on people to contribute during the annual fund-raising campaign.</font>

<p><font face="Arial">b) Whistleblower Policy- The Whistleblower Policy

bill was defeated in the House. In light of the fact that it included provisions

that would adversely affect the tenure and promotion procedure, the news

was received with relief.</font>

<p><font face="Arial">c) Married Faculty Occupying Administrative or Other

Significant Positions in the Same Department. There have been concerns

about husbands and wives concurrently occupying positions such as Department

Chairs and Chairs of significant committees. The Committee?s unanimous

view was that there was no feasible way to prevent such situations.</font>
