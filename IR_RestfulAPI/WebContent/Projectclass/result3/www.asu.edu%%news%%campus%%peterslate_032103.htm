      <h2>ASU President
  Announces New Technology Venturing Entity -- Names Peter Slate
  Chief
  Executive Officer </h2>
      <p><img src="campus_images/peterslate_032103.jpg" alt="Peter Slate" width="180" height="252" align="right">Taking Arizona State University technology from the research lab to
        the marketplace more rapidly and with greater ease is the role of Arizona
        Technology Enterprises, a new entity being developed through the ASU
        Foundation to serve as ASU's technology venturing enterprise. </p>
      <p>The move is further evidence of ASU's rapid shift from an agency to
        an enterprise model. Through its alignment with the ASU Foundation, the
        endeavor will have substantially more flexibility to stimulate and bring
        about new technology driven ideas and companies.</p>
      <p>ASU President Michael Crow says creating the new entity is part of ASU's
        progression as a nimble, fast-paced, and responsive entrepreneurial organization.
        He already has refocused the university's proceeds from Proposition 301
        to support the Arizona Biodesign Institute, and is expanding the university's
        research infrastructure to create new and high value economic opportunity
        for the state.</p>
      <p>&quot;We need to be as creative as we can, and use our creativity to
        catalyze economic opportunity,&quot; says Crow. "ASU already is Arizona's
        leading technology transfer enterprise, and, by breaking the traditional
        mold, we can go further and get even better."</p>
      <p>Finding the right person to lead such a dynamic enterprise has been
        a top priority for Crow. He found that person in Peter Slate, former
        director of Global Technology Outlicensing with Baxter International,
        Inc., an international biomedical company based in the Chicago area.
        Slate, who is relocating to Arizona, will join Arizona Technology Enterprises,
        as Chief Executive Officer effective April 1, 2003.</p>
      <p>Slate specializes as a corporate attorney and business development professional
        in the areas of tech transfer, venture capital and emerging company development,
        business acquisitions and strategic alliances.</p>
      <p>Slate says, "Arizona Technology Enterprises will be less about licensing
        patents and more about building value-generating partnerships with the
        business and venture capital communities around the university's core
        areas of technology expertise."</p>
      <p>&quot;By the time Arizona Technology Enterprises is fully operational,
        it will be, in a sense, a time shifter, bridging the gap between business
        culture and university culture so neither has to change to accommodate
        the other,&quot; says Crow.</p>
      <p>ASU's technology transfer program is among the leaders in national higher
        education, according to rankings released by the Association of University
        Technology Managers (AUTM) and published last year in the Chronicle of
        Higher Education.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Fink, ASU's vice president for Research and Economic Affairs,
        says the university's tech transfer program has been doing an excellent
        job of getting faculty and student inventions into the marketplace, especially
        given ASU's youth as a research university. </p>
      <p>"Seven years ago, the emphasis was largely limited to only one type
        of licensing (related to the Cancer Research Institute), so the university
        worked actively to diversify its portfolio," he says. "With funding from
        Proposition 301, the tech transfer program is now able to actively expand
        into other promising areas of science and technology."</p>
      <p>In the AUTM study, ASU's tech transfer program ranked 7th in the category
        "number of U.S. patent applications filed per $1-million spent on research,"
        ahead of Princeton (8th); Stanford (14th); and the University of Arizona
        (113th).</p>
      <p>ASU ranked 7th for "number of start-up companies formed per $10-million
        spent on research," falling just behind Stanford (6th), and ahead of
        Massachusetts Institute of Technology (14th); Iowa State University (19th);
        and University of Arizona (80th). </p>
      <p>ASU was 10th for "number of inventions disclosed per $1-million spent
        on research," ahead of Columbia University (22nd); Stanford (29th); and
        the University of Arizona (76th). </p>
      <p>With some of the employees from ASU's Office of Technology Collaboration &amp; Licensing
        moving to the new entity, there will be a seamless transition and a continuation
        of the group's hard work and dedication. The staff of professionals,
        with both academic and industry experience, will put an emphasis on supporting
        ASU faculty members during the invention and technology venturing process. </p>
      <p>&quot;We don't want faculty members worrying about writing patents,
        or thinking about the market or business,&quot; Crow says. &quot;We need
        faculty to be able to focus on great teaching and great research, while
        this new organization will perform all of the time consuming technology
        venturing and licensing functions.&quot;</p>
      <p>Slate, who was with Baxter International since 2000, created a small
        business development group responsible for marketing Baxter's technologies,
        both in and out of the healthcare industry. The group successfully licensed
        Baxter's technology to healthcare organizations and other companies in
        fields as diverse as outerwear and beverage distribution.</p>
      <p>Another important role for Slate at Baxter was to evaluate and develop
        new business areas for the company. In one deal, he helped Baxter develop
        the concept for a new nutrient enhanced beverage that is currently being
        launched nationally.</p>
      <p>Slate, who also has experience in business acquisitions and developing
        joint ventures with both Primecare International (1997), a physician
        practice management company, and Zenith Electronics Corporation (1997
        - 2000), says Arizona Technology Enterprises will focus on building strong
        relationships within the university and externally. </p>
      <p>&quot;Successful businesses are based on strong relationships,&quot; says
        Slate. &quot;It will be a top priority of the organization to build credibility,
        not only in our ability to get deals done, but also in our dealings with
        the faculty and the technology community at large.&quot;</p>
      <p>Slate says the organization will create a capital fund to assist researchers
        with technology development. He says lack of development support can
        derail many new concepts and technologies before they get off the ground.
        By adding a small amount of strategic funding early in the process to
        allow researchers to prove the viability of their concepts, it can substantially
        increase the technology's value. </p>
      <p>Slate says that one of the keys to success will be to spread the word
        that ASU is generating valuable technology that addresses identifiable
        business needs. </p>
      <p>&quot;Businesses have many options for who they partner with. Our goal
        is to create a world-class technology transfer and development organization
        that will become a partner of choice," he says.</p>
      <p>&quot;To do that,&quot; Crow says, &quot;service and speed will be Arizona
        Technology Enterprise's key asset. This will be a unit that will really
        focus on providing outstanding service to the faculty and to industry.&quot;</p>
