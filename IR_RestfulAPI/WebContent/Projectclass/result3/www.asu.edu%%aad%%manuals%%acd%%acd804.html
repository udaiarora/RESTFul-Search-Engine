Areas may be designated as smoking areas only if the area supervisor determines that the smoke cannot drift into a nonsmoking area.<P>No unit or unit supervisor is required to expend university funds to contain smoke in a designated smoking area.<P>Smoking is prohibited in any areas where flammable gases, liquids, or other volatile materials are located or stored or in which a fire or safety hazard may exist.<P>Smoking is permitted in enclosed and unshared university offices unless prohibited by the area supervisor as a health hazard to nonsmokers in the area, and in shared offices where smoking is confined to areas designated as smoking areas, unless smoke from the shared or unshared office drifts to a nonsmoking area and cannot be contained in the smoking area.  Nothing in this policy shall require the establishment of a smoking area in any ASU <A HREF="acd002.html#workplace" TARGET="New">workplace</A> that has previously been designated as nonsmoking.<P>Complaints or concerns regarding this policy or disputes regarding its implementation should be referred to the area supervisor for resolution.<P>Human Resources is available to provide guidance and clarification of this policy and to assist in the resolution of disputes.  Written complaints may be made anonymously so long as the specific university location that is the subject of the complaint is identified.  The ASU Department of Public Safety (ASU DPS) does not handle smoking complaints.<P>If no accommodation can be reached that is reasonably satisfactory to all employees in a given work area, smoking shall be prohibited in that area, and the no smoking designation shall not be subject to either mediation or grievance.<P>An employee who makes a formal complaint regarding smoking, or <A HREF="acd002.html#rule" TARGET="New">rules</A> governing smoking and nonsmoking, cannot be terminated or be the subject of disciplinary action as a result of the complaint.  An employee who uses or does not use tobacco products may not be subject to discriminatory action related to such use or nonuse.  However, employees that fail to follow rules regarding smoking in unauthorized areas may face disciplinary action.<P><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Procedure</B></FONT><A HREF="acd804table.html"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">D</FONT></A></CENTER><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><P><HR NOSHADE><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 CELLSPACING=1><TR><TH>Responsibility<HR></TH><TH>Action<HR></TH></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Employee</TD><TD><OL><LI>Discuss the complaint or concern about smoking with the area supervisor.</LI></OL></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Area supervisor</TD><TD><OL START="2"><LI>Try to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement.
