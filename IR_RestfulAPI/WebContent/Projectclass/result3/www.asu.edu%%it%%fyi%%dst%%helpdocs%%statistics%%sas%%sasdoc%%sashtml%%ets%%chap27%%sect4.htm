used to adjust the forecast values produced by the forecasting model.
Unlike a regressor,
an adjustment variable does not have a regression coefficient.
No model fitting is performed for adjustments.
<P>Nonmissing values of the adjustment series are simply added to
the model prediction for the corresponding period.
Missing adjustment values are ignored.
If you supply adjustment values for observations within the period of fit,
the adjustment values are subtracted from the actual values, and the model
is fit to these adjusted values.
<P>To add adjustments,
select <TT>Add</TT> and then select <TT>Adjustments</TT>
from the pop-up menu (shown in <A HREF="index.htm#tfpr01">Display 27.1</A>).
This displays the <TT>Adjustments Selection</TT> window.
The Adjustments Selection window functions the same as
the Regressor Selection window (which is shown in <A HREF="sect3.htm#tfpr08">Display 27.8</A>).
You can select any number of adjustment variables as predictors.
<P>Unlike regressors, adjustments do not require forecasting models
for the adjustment variables.
If a variable used as an adjustment does have a forecasting model fit to it,
the adjustment variable's forecasting model is ignored when the
variable is used as an adjustment.
<P>You can use forecast adjustments to account for expected future events
that have no precedent in the past and so cannot be modeled by regression.
For example, suppose you are trying to forecast the sales of a product,
and you know that a special promotional campaign for the product is planned
during part of the period you want to forecast.
<P>If such sales promotion programs have been frequent in the past, then you can
record the past and expected future level of promotional efforts in a
variable in the data set and use that variable as a regressor in the
forecasting model.
<P>However, if this is the first sales promotion of its kind for this product,
you have no way to estimate the effect of the promotion from past data.
In this case, the best you can do is make an educated guess at the effect
the promotion will have and add that guess to what your forecasting model
would predict in the absence of the special sales campaign.
<P>Adjustments are also useful for making judgmental alterations to forecasts.
For example, suppose you have produced a forecast sales data over 
the next twelve months.  Your supervisor believes that the forecasts are 
too optimisticnear the end, and asks you to prepare a forecast graph in 
which the numbers
you have forecast are reduced by 1000 in the last three months.  You can
accomplish this by editing the input data set so that it contains 
observations for the actual data range of sales plus twelve additional
observations for the forecast period, and a new variable called, say,
<TT>adjustment</TT>.  The adjustment variable contains the value 1000
for the last three observations, and is missing for all other
observations.  You fit the same model previously selected for 
forecasting, using the <TT>ARIMA Model Specification</TT> or 
<TT>Custom Model Specification</TT> window, but with an adjustment added
using the variable <TT>adjustment</TT>.  Now when you graph the forecasts
using the Model Viewer, the last three periods of the forecast are
reduced by 1000.  The confidence limits are unchanged, which helps draw
attention to the fact that the adjustments to the forecast deviate from
what would be expected statistically.
