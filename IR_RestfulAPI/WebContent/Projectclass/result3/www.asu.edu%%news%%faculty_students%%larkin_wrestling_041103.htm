      <h2>Larkin receives honor as country's top wrestler</h2>
      <p>ASU senior Eric Larkin of Tucson added another award to his mantle when
        he was named the winner of the 2003 Dan Hodge Award, by the International
        Wrestling Institute and Museum and WIN Magazine. The Hodge Award, in
        its ninth year of existence and highly regarded as the "Heisman Trophy
        of amateur wrestling," is awarded annually to the top collegiate wrestler
        in the nation. </p>
      <p>Larkin follows three-time award winner Cael Sanderson,
          the four-time undefeated NCAA champion from Iowa State who finished
        his career last
          year at 158-0. </p>
      <p>"I am very proud of Eric," said Thom Ortiz, ASU head coach.
          "This is a tremendous honor for him and for our entire program.We are
          very excited
          for Eric and know he is well-deserving of this honor." </p>
      <p>Larkin dominated
          his opponents this year enroute to a perfect 34-0 record and the NCAA
          championship at 149 pounds. He won 20 of his matches with
          bonus point victories with 11 coming by pinfall, two by technical fall
          and seven by major decision. Only five times did the final buzzer sound
          with Larkin's opponent within three points of him. A career 123-12,
        he tied for the sixth-most wins in school history, using the third-most
          pins (36) to his advantage. Larkin also tied for 13th in dual match
        wins
          with 48.</p>
      <p>"Everything just came together for me this year," Larkin said
          following his national championship victory. "I am just happy to finally
          reach
          my goals. I just kept wrestling hard until I finally won the national
          title. All the hard work was worth it to get to this point." </p>
      <p>The first
          Sun Devil to be named the Outstanding Wrestler at the NCAA Championships,
          Larkin became the sixth ASU grappler to win a national
          title. He also was the fourth to earn All-America honors four times
        in his career and the first to accomplish the feat wrestling at three
        different
          weight classes. He finished fourth as a freshman at 133, third as a
        sophomore at 141 and was national runner-up last year at 141 before claiming
        his
          national title. </p>
      <p>Larkin also was a force in the Pac-10 Conference, winning
          four conference crowns at three weights and earning the tournament's
          outstanding wrestler
          award the past three years. He was named the Pac-10 Wrestler of the
        Year for the past three years. He never lost a match to a conference
        opponent
          at any point in his career, including dual meets and tournaments. </p>
      <p>Adding
          to his awards and honors, Larkin won the Las Vegas Invitational this
          year and was named the tournament's Outstanding Wrestler. At the
          Pac-10 Championships, Larkin was named the outstanding wrestler and
        picked up the Most Falls in Least Time Award by pinning three opponents
        in 6:03. </p>
      <p>Larkin helped the team to fifth place at the national meet this year,
          its best finish since 1995 when the team came home fourth. In conference,
          Larkin was a member of two Pac-10 championship teams including this
        year as the Sun Devils overcame a tough crowd in Boise, Idaho. </p>
      <p>The Hodge Selection
          Committee will formerly present the prestigious award to Larkin April
          15 at the Sun Devil wrestling team's annual awards banquet.
          ASU also will present the Hodge Award to Larkin during the Sun Devils'
          football game with conference foe USC on Oct. 4 at Sun Devil Stadium. </p>
      <p>The award, named for legendary Oklahoma Sooner wrestler Dan Hodge, takes
          into consideration a wrestlers' dominance on the mat, his number of
        pins, his overall record, past credentials, the quality of competition
        he faces,
        his sportsmanship, his citizenship and his heart. </p>
