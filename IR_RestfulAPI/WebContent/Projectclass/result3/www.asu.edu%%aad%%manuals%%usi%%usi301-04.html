Violation of any one of these standards will result in loss of financial aid eligibility (not including scholarships and employee tuition benefits). These standards represent minimum performance requirements based on federal statutes and regulations and do not necessarily coincide with academic program requirements. In addition to meeting these standards, a student must fulfill all other requirements to receive financial aid.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Student Standards</b></font><p><b>Scholastic Standard</b><p>A student must be in compliance with ASU scholastic standards. A student on ASU academic disqualification is not eligible for financial aid.<p><b>Percentage (Pass Rate) Standard</b><p>Students must pass at least 67 percent of the total institutional credit hours attempted in their degree level at ASU. Passed credits include letter grades of A, B, C, D, P, RC, Y, or Z and law grades of 65 to 99, H and HH. Passed credits do not include courses for which no grade was received (NR) or grades of I (incomplete), E (failure), W (withdraw), RN (remedial no credit), or law grades of 59 (Failing F89-SS01) and 64 (Failing F01).<p>Attempted credits for the percentage standard include all ASU courses for which a student was registered at each census. If a student&#146;s passed courses for any given semester are higher than his or her attempted credits, attempted credits will be changed to reflect the student&#146;s passed hours for that semester.<p>A passed course, if retaken, will be considered passed only once, yet attempted twice. Audited courses are considered neither attempted nor passed for purposes of this measurement.<p>Measurement of each student&#146;s pass rate will occur at the completion of each spring semester. Upon first measurement, students who do not meet the percentage standard will be placed on Financial Aid Probation. A student on financial aid probation will have until the next spring measurement to raise his or her cumulative institutional pass rate to the 67-percent standard. If this standard is not met at this measurement, the student will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension and will be ineligible for financial aid (not including scholarships and employee tuition benefits) for subsequent semesters.<p>Students will be mailed written notification if a financial aid probation or suspension violation occurs. However, it is the student&#146;s responsibility to know a violation has occurred, whether or not the student receives notification.<p><b>Maximum Credit-Hour Standard</b><p>Students who have cumulatively attempted credits in excess of the credit hours indicated in the table below are ineligible for financial aid (not including scholarships and employee tuition benefits) for subsequent semesters. Transfer credits are included in this measurement. This requirement is measured at the end of every fall, spring, and summer semesters and will include both ASU credits and transfer credits taken in the student&#146;s current degree level. <p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>Any credits taken while a student is classified as a graduate student, even credits for non-graduate-level courses, will count against the graduate-level totals.</td><tr></table><p>Attempted credits for the maximum credit-hour standard include up to 64 community college transfer credits with a grade of &#147;C&#148; or higher, all transfer credits from a four-year postsecondary institution with a grade of &#147;C&#148; or higher, and all ASU courses (other than audited courses) in which the student was registered at each census. ASU attempted summer credits are also included. If a student&#146;s earned hours are higher than his or her attempted hours, attempted hours will be changed to reflect the earned hours for that semester.<p>In general, the following standards will be applied:<p><table border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1><tr><th colspan=6>Undergraduate Maximum Credit-Hour Limits*</th></tr><tr align=LEFT><td valign=TOP>Prebaccalaureate Students (students seeking their first bachelor&#146;s degree)</td><td valign=TOP>180 cumulative credits taken while classified as an undergraduate student</td></tr><tr align=LEFT><td valign=TOP>B.S. in Aeronautical Management Technology (all concentrations)</td><td valign=TOP>192 cumulative credits taken while classified as an undergraduate student</td></tr><tr align=LEFT><td valign=TOP>B.S. in Computer Engineering Technology (all concentrations)</td><td valign=TOP>192 cumulative credits taken while classified as an undergraduate student</td></tr><tr align=LEFT><td valign=TOP>B.S. in Computer Science</td><td valign=TOP>192 cumulative credits taken while classified as an undergraduate student</td></tr><tr align=LEFT><td valign=TOP>B.S. in Construction (all concentrations)</td><td valign=TOP>192 cumulative credits taken while classified as an undergraduate student</td></tr><tr align=LEFT><td valign=TOP>B.S. in Electronic Engineering Technology (all concentrations)</td><td valign=TOP>192 cumulative credits taken while classified as an undergraduate student</td></tr><tr align=LEFT><td valign=TOP>B.S. in Engineering (all concentrations)</td><td valign=TOP>192 cumulative credits taken while classified as an undergraduate student</td></tr><tr align=LEFT><td valign=TOP>B.S.D. in Interior Design</td><td valign=TOP>225 cumulative credits taken while classified as an undergraduate student</td></tr><tr align=LEFT><td valign=TOP>B.S. in Manufacturing Engineering Technology (all concentrations)</td><td valign=TOP>192 cumulative credits taken while classified as an undergraduate student</td></tr><tr align=LEFT><td valign=TOP>B.S. in Mechanical Engineering Technology</td><td valign=TOP>192 cumulative credits taken while classified as an undergraduate student</td></tr><tr align=LEFT><td valign=TOP>B.M. in Music Education</td><td valign=TOP>188 cumulative credits taken while classified as an undergraduate student</td></tr><tr align=LEFT><td valign=TOP>B.M. in Music Education (Music Therapy concentration only)</td><td valign=TOP>194 cumulative credits taken while classified as an undergraduate student</td></tr></td></tr><tr align=LEFT><td valign=TOP>Postbaccalaureate Students<br> (students seeking a second bachelor&#146;s degree)</td><td valign=TOP>240 cumulative undergraduate credits</td></tr><tr align=LEFT><td colspan="6"><font="no BOLD">*Measurement is based on all cumulative undergraduate credits attempted.

Documentation must be in written form. The Student Financial Assistance Office will not contact references on a student&#146;s behalf.<p>Supporting statements from an individual must specify the relationship of the individual to the student and be signed and dated. A statement from a third party may be deemed more credible than one from an individual who could benefit from the outcome of the appeal decision, depending on the circumstances.<p>In all cases, the outcome of any appeal will depend on the nature of the circumstances causing the violation, the quality of the documentation provided, and how well the student has demonstrated the ability to progress towards degree completion within a reasonable timeframe.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Appeal Deadlines</b></font><p>Written appeals for reinstatement of financial aid eligibility must be received in the Student Financial Assistance Office no later than the 21st calendar day of the fall and spring semesters.  The summer appeal submission deadline is the last summer session add/drop date. These deadlines will apply regardless of the date the student was notified of the loss of financial aid eligibility. Students submitting appeals after this deadline will have their appeals reviewed for consideration for the next semester. Appeals can take between 10 to 12 business days to process.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Additional Information</b></font><p>For more information, contact the Student Financial Assistance Office at 408/965&#150;3355.
