                  From 1936 to 1938, over 2,300 former slaves from across the American South were interviewed by writers and journalists under the aegis of the Works Progress Administration. These former slaves, most born in the last years of the slave regime or during the Civil War, provided first-hand accounts of their experiences on plantations, in cities, and on small farms. This web site provides an opportunity to read a sample of these narratives, and to see some of the photographs taken at the time of the interviews. The entire collection of narratives can be found in George P. Rawick, ed., The American Slave: A Composite Autobiography (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1972-79).</p>

                  <p><br>
                  Assignment: Locate three websites with primary sources relevant to our course. Of these websites, only one may have a &ldquo;.edu&rdquo; address. Evaluate the websites according to the guidelines below. Would you recommend the websites to other users? Why or why not? </p><br>
				  
                  <h3><br>
                    Guidelines for Evaluating Historical Websites </h3>
					
					<p><br>
                    <b>Who:</b> Who is the author or sponsor of the website? Is that person or organization named? Is any supporting documentation available?</p>
					<p>
                    <b>What:</b> What is the mission or purpose of the website? Is it clearly articulated? What kinds of materials are on the website? Are they properly cited and acknowledged? What is the document format on the web?</p>
					<p>
                    <b>Where:</b> Where is the site located? Is there a physical address with phone number and email address for a contact person? Does the site have a .edu, .org, or .com address?</p>
					<p>
                    <b>Why:</b> Why does the site exist? Does it have a point of view or opinion? Is it pedagogical or polemic? Does it want something from you?</p><br>
					
                    <h3><br>
                  Exercise 2: Documentary Consistency and Legitimacy </h3>
				  
                  <p><br>
                  Are the resources complete or selected? Do they represent a specific edition and/or translation of the document? </p>
                  <p><br>
                  In the following examples of the United States Constitution, the first site includes only the original document excluding the Bill of Rights and subsequent Amendments (<a href="http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html">http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html</a>), while the second site includes the Bill of Rights, and all subsequent ratified and un-ratified amendments (<a href="http://www.law.emory.edu/FEDERAL/usconst.html">http://www.law.emory.edu/FEDERAL/usconst.html</a>) </p>
                  <p><br>
                  While both sites are reputable and each does present the actual text of the Constitution, these separate sites made a judgment as to whether the complete United States Constitution includes the Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments. </p>
                  <p><br>
                  The following sites all have versions of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen approved by the National Assembly of France, August 26, 1789. The first site is in French from the Office of the Premier and includes a facsimile of the original document: <a href="http://www.premier-ministre.gouv.fr/fr/p.cfm?ref=6114">http://www.premier-ministre.gouv.fr/fr/p.cfm?ref=6114</a>; The document in the second example is an English translation (including a citation to the source and translator of the document) from the site Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution (scroll down to specific document): <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/browse/texts/">http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/browse/texts/ Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, 26 August 1789</a>; and the last document (again, in English) is from a site titled Human and Constitutional Rights. This document does not include a citation to source or translator: <a href="http://www.hrcr.org/docs/frenchdec.html">http://www.hrcr.org/docs/frenchdec.html</a> </p>
                  <p><br>
                  Compare the text of the Articles in the two English translations and see where they differ. </p>
                  <p><br>
                  Are the resources prejudicial or objective in presentation and selection? </p>
                  <p><br>
                    The following sites (<a href="http://www.dixienet.org/csa-docs/csa-docs.html">http://www.dixienet.org/csa-docs/csa-docs.html</a> and <a href="http://templeofdemocracy.com/document.htm">http://templeofdemocracy.com/document.htm</a>) both present documents dealing with the Confederacy. Go to each sites&rsquo; homepage, League of the South: <a href="http://www.dixienet.org">http://www.dixienet.org</a> and Temple of Democracy: <a href="http://templeofdemocracy.com/index.htm">http://templeofdemocracy.com/index.htm</a> and compare the missions and the views of each site. Does the stated viewpoint of each site affect the validity of the documents they select?</p>
