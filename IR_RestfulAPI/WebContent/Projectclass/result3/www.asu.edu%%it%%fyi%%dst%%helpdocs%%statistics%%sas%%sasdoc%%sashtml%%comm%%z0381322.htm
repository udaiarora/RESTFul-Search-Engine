<P>Various errors may occur when you initially
try to establish a connection over a network with the NetBIOS access method.
 Many of these problems are related to the network.  SAS/CONNECT attempts
to present an error message that indicates the cause of the error.  The following
section explains the most common problems in establishing NetBIOS communications.
 



<PRE>ERROR:  Network request failed rc=38. 
Requested resource(s) not available.</PRE>
<P>There are not enough system resources available to satisfy either the
VQMLINKS or the VQMCONVS request. This error can be caused by either of the
following situations: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>The default value for either VQMLINKS or VQMCONVS requests
more resources than are available. The default value for both options is 0,
which implies 16 NetBIOS sessions and 16 commands with most implementations.<P>

<LI>You have specified a value for either VQMLINKS or VQMCONVS and
there are not enough resources to satisfy the request.<P>
</UL>

<P>To correct this error, specify a new value for either VQMLINKS or VQMCONVS
on either the local or the remote session, as appropriate.  



<PRE>ERROR:  Network request failed rc=22. 
Too many commands outstanding.</PRE>
<P>The number of simultaneous sessions that are requested is greater than
the allocated commands allow, and the request has failed. You are using too
many resources.
<P>To correct this problem, either increase the number of sessions that
are allowed or decrease the number of simultaneous sessions. To increase the
number of sessions that are allowed, increase the value of the VQMCONVS option
on either the local or the remote session, as appropriate, provided sufficient
system resources are available. In general, one session is required for each
concurrent SAS/CONNECT session as well
as each remote LIBNAME.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x14) - 
Cannot find name called.</PRE>
<P>The SAS/CONNECT spawner program cannot be found.  Verify the following: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>you have the proper network selected<P>

<LI>you have specified the
correct name for the spawner program<P>

<LI>the spawner program is started.<P>
</UL>
  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0xA7) -  
Unknown NetBIOS return code.</PRE>
<P>NetBIOS is not set up to run in the Windows environment.  



<PRE>ERROR: File not found loading  \sas\core\sasexe\sasvnnet.dll; 
File contributing to error: ACSNETB 
ERROR: File not found loading  \sas\core\sasexe\sasvnmne.dll;
File contributing to error: NETAPI</PRE>
<P>The NetBIOS access method was loaded but the supporting vendor software
was not found.  



<PRE>ERROR: Network request failed (rc 0x05) -
 Command timed out.</PRE>
<P>During a NetBIOS SIGNON, SAS.EXE could not be executed from the directory
that the spawner program is executing from. Ensure that SAS.EXE is located
in either the OS/2 PATH variable or in the spawner's current directory.

<P>The NetBIOS access methods used by SAS/SHARE sometimes issue generalized
messages to identify problems. The following are the most frequently encountered:
 



<PRE>Network request failed (rc 0x30) - 
name defined by another environment.</PRE>
<P>Another server that has the same name is already running on the network,
or another NetBIOS application is using the name. Choose another name.  



<PRE>Network request failed (rc 0x38) - 
requested resource(s) not available.</PRE>
<P>Insufficient resources specified.  Either use the VQMLINKS and
VQMCONVS variables to cause SAS to ask for less resources, or reconfigure
NetBIOS so that there are more resources available to NetBIOS applications.
Reconfiguring NetBIOS is system and vendor specific.  



<PRE>Network request failed (rc 0x14)
- cannot find name called.</PRE>
<P>The server that was specified by the SERVER= option cannot be located
on the network.
