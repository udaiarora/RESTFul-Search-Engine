      <p>A faculty or staff member who is employed at Arizona State University 
        for 20 or more hours per week in a continuous position for six months 
        or more is considered to be a "benefits-eligible" employee under Board 
        of Regents and University policies. The University offers a broad range 
        of benefits to its employees.</p>
      <p>ASU offers insurance plans for 
        medical, dental, vision, life insurance, short-term disability,&nbsp; 
        long-term disability, long-term care, auto/home insurance, and COBRA (insurance 
        after termination). ASU pays an employer share of the premium for medical 
        and dental insurance. Life insurance and long-term disability insurance 
        are provided at no additional cost to the employee. The employee is entirely 
        responsible for the cost of vision insurance, short-term disability, long-term 
        care insurance, auto/home insurance, and COBRA coverage. Employees may 
        set up flexible spending accounts to pay for medical; vision; dental and 
        / or dependent (day) care expenses with money withheld from their paycheck 
        that is not subject to Social Security and federal or state income taxes.      </p>

      <p>Employees must make their insurance program choices at their initial 
        date of hire. Employees can make changes to their prior selections either 
        during the Open Enrollment period or upon the occurrence of certain events 
        (e.g., marriage, birth of a child, divorce, death) that occur outside 
        of the open enrollment period.</p>

        leave for its employees. If a family member, including domestic partner, 
        or one of their relatives dies in-state, the employee will receive up 
        to 3 paid working days. If the employee needs to make arrangements for 
        or to attend a funeral that is out-of-state, the employee can receive 
        2 additional working days of pay.</p>
