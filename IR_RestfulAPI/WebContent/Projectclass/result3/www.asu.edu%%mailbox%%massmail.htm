                    <p>The target audience should be a specific demographic group 
                      for which the topic of the message relates. </p>
                  <li> 
                    <p>Requests by recipients to be removed from a list should 
                      be honored, except under certain circumstances such as: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li> 
                        <p>A college or department sending notes to students within 
                          an area </p>
                      <li> 
                        <p>Professors sending notes to students in their class 
                        </p>

                      <li> 
                        <p>Departments heads (or authorized agents) sending notes 
                          to their staff </p>
                      <li> 
                        <p>Mailings approved by the Provost's or Registrar's Office 
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                  <li>Requests to be removed from an &quot;ad hoc&quot; list 
                      (e.g. generated from a Data Warehouse query) must be respected 
                      in any future &quot;ad hoc&quot; mailing. <br />

                  <li> Use of lists such as &quot;All Employees&quot;, &quot;All 
                    Faculty&quot; and &quot;All Staff&quot; are governed by the 
                    Provost's Office. Requests to send to these lists should be 
                    forwarded to <em><strong>Linda Van Scoy</strong></em>. These 
                    lists are automatically generated nightly in the ASU Microsoft
                    Exchange and can only be used from within Outlook/Exchange. <br />
                  <li> Use of an &quot;All Student&quot; list is governed by the 
                    Registrar's Office. Requests to send to all students should 
                    be forwarded to <em><strong>Bonnie Wilcox</strong></em>. Lists 
                    of students within specific majors and colleges are automatically 
                    generated nightly in Exchange; use of these lists is controlled 
                    by the Dean of the respective college. <br />

                  <li> 
                    Official ASU E-mail addresses are stored in the &quot;Electronic 
                      Post Office&quot; (EPO) database. E-mail addresses from 
                      the database are replicated nightly to the Data Warehouse 
                      and &quot;Directory Services&quot; database. <br />
                  <li>
                    Those who obtain e-mail addresses from the Data Warehouse must still
                      obtain authorization to send to large groups as specified above.  Use
                      of <a href=http://www.asu.edu/amdf>AMDF</a> is recommended for sending
                      to large lists of e-mail addresses.<br />

                  <li> 
                    It is <strong>strictly prohibited</strong> to give or sell ASU e-mail 
                      address lists to outside entities. <br />
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Message Content</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li> 
                    <p>The message should contain a valid &quot;From:&quot; address 
                      for e-mail replies. </p>

                  <li> 
                    <p>Use an appropriate &quot;Subject:&quot; header. </p>
                  <li> 
                    <p>Start the message body with why they are receiving the 
                      note, e.g. &quot;You are receiving this note because you 
                      are an employee of ASU. This mailing has been approved by 
                      the Provost's Office.&quot; </p>
                  <li> 
                    <p>If more than one mailing is intended to be sent to a particular 
                      group, you should state that and include simple instructions 
                      on how to not receive further mailings. </p>

                  <li> 
                    <p>The name and phone number of a person to contact must be 
                      included within the body of the message. </p>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Other Suggestions</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li> 
                    <p>Send to large lists (e.g. &gt; 1000) during off-peak, non-business 
                      hours to avoid over-loading the ASU network and messaging 
                      systems. </p>

                  <li> 
                    <p>Keep the message short and to the point. </p>
                  <li> 
                    <p><strong>Do not </strong>attach software or documentation 
                      to your message. Rather, provide instructions as to how 
                      it can be obtained (e.g. from file download or the Web). 
                    </p>
                  <li> 
                    <p>Have someone proofread the message for spelling, grammatical 
                      and content errors. </p>
                  <li> 
                    <p>Have officials in your department approve the message if, 
                      for example, you anticipate any complaints generated by 
                      the mailing. </p>

                  <li> 
                    <p>Send a test version of your message to yourself and another 
                      person to see how it shows up. Check for proper word wrapping 
                      (if applicable) and for an appropriate &quot;signature&quot; 
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What to Expect</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li> 
                    <p>You will likely receive some &quot;undeliverable&quot; 
                      mail notifications if you are using EPO addresses. Approximately 
                      20 per 1000 is normal. In certain cases, you may wish to 
                      contact these individuals to let them know their &quot;EPO&quot; 
                      account is not properly configured or that their mailbox 
                      is &quot;over quota&quot;. These are the two most likely 
                      causes for returned mail. </p>

                  <li> 
                    <p>In general, people don't like to receive unsolicited e-mail 
                      and they may let you know about it via heated replies. The 
                      more inappropriate the mailing, the more complaints you 
                      will receive. </p>
                  <li> 
                    <p>When using demographics to build your distribution list, 
                      you will notice that not everyone in your query has an e-mail 
                      address. You may wish to consider building a separate query 
                      to capture these people and generate mailing labels to send 
                      paper mail, if that is appropriate. </p>
                </ul>
                <p>For information on how to send e-mail to &quot;ad hoc&quot; 
                  lists, or if you would like to create a Listserv list or Exchange 
                  shared distribution list, submit a question online at the <a href="http://asu.edu/askit/">Ask IT Web page</a>, or call the <a href="http://asu.edu/helpdesk/">IT Help Desk</a> at (480) 965-6500.</p>
