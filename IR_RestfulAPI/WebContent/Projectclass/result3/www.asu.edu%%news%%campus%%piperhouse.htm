          <h2><B>Historic</B> ASU Building to Create New History as Piper Writer&rsquo;s House</h2>
          <p>First it was known as &ldquo;The President&rsquo;s Cottage,&rdquo; then the University Archives. The building has had a few names over the years, has been home to presidents and their families, has seen births and deaths, and contains a lot of legends. Now, after nearly a hundred years of history, the house has a new and exciting role to play and will be re-christened again.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>On Thursday, February 3, the restored 1907 President&rsquo;s Cottage (listed on the National Register of Historic Places), will become the Virginia G. Piper Writer&rsquo;s House, and will become a home once again, this time to ASU&rsquo;s Virginia G. Piper Center for Creative Writing, a tenancy that should lead to many more stories.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>In celebration, the university has scheduled a full day of festivities (see schedule attached), beginning with a 10:30 a.m. presidential ribbon-cutting, poetic dedication and tour, followed by private and public readings by renowned novelists E.L. Doctorow and Amy Tan and concluding with evening readings by ASU fiction writers and poets.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>&ldquo;This is an important day for writing and writers at ASU and in our Arizonan community, so we are going to celebrate with fiction, poetry and nonfiction readings and discussions about the power of language and publishing,&rdquo; said Jewell Parker Rhodes, the Center&rsquo;s Artistic Director. &ldquo;It will be a glorious open house.&nbsp; We will have two of the nation&rsquo;s most prominent writers in attendance &ndash; E.L. Doctorow to do a two-week residency with our students and our community and Amy Tan to do a public reading.&nbsp; Alberto Rios, Regents Professor and Marshall Endowed Chair, has written a poem in honor of the House Opening.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll end with readings by our very own prestigious faculty.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>Dignitaries coming to the event include international visitors as well &ndash; Dr. Michael Hawes, Director of the Canadian Fulbright Program, and Pam Johnson,&nbsp; the Canadian Consul in Los Angeles. The Piper Center for Creative Writing is rapidly forging relationships with cultural entities around the globe, including faculty exchanges (and pending student exchanges) with the Royal Holloway University of London and the University of Warwick in England.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>Though the &ldquo;cottage&rdquo; looks small on the outside, the renovated Piper Writer&rsquo;s House&rsquo;s two-story structure (with basement and attic) will contain a host of facilities for ASU and community writers.&nbsp; The first floor has two classrooms, including a traditional &ldquo;writers workshop&rdquo; seminar room, with a specially designed round seminar table. A third &ldquo;outdoor classroom&rdquo; is included in the garden landscaping design behind the facility, to allow classes to take seasonal advantage of Tempe&rsquo;s generally excellent climate.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>The first floor also includes a large reading room with a fireplace and comfortable lounge chairs, and a writers&rsquo; library. In addition to key reference materials for writers, the facility will house the area&rsquo;s largest collection of contemporary literary magazines&nbsp; &ndash; a critical resource for writers interested in publishing. The first floor also includes a partial kitchen and a spacious front porch with more lounge chairs. Daily copies of local newspapers and the New York Times will be available for free for writers interested in keeping abreast with current events.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class=MsoBodyText>&ldquo;We want writing to be intimately integrated into the ASU community and for all writers to feel comfortable, like they have a home at ASU,&rdquo; said Rhodes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a &lsquo;center&rsquo; and that really means that we want to be the center of the literary life of our community--locally, nationally and internationally."</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>The Piper Writer&rsquo;s House will also serve as the headquarters for Virginia G. Piper Center for Creative Writing and the myriad of programs the Center sponsors in the community. The second floor will house six offices for the Center director and her staff, including an office available for prominent international writers when they visit campus for residencies, readings and workshops. Editorial offices for ASU&rsquo;s national literary magazine, <I>Hayden&rsquo;s Ferry Review</I>, will also be in the building.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>Of course, the Center&rsquo;s activities will continue to extend well beyond the Piper Writer&rsquo;s House, with a wide range of educational and outreach activities being planned at a variety of other venues in collaboration with other Valley education and cultural institutions. This spring, the Center is sponsoring readings by six prominent visiting and local writers and its third annual major writing conference on March 9-12 (see attached schedule of spring events). The writers conference, itself a major Valley arts event, features a host of prominent writers from across the writing disciplines, and is currently accepting registrations, with forms available at: <A 
href="http://www.asu.edu/pipercwcenter/conference/2005/registration/" 
target=_BLANK>http://www.asu.edu/pipercwcenter/conference/2005/registration/</A> </p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>For writers, the choice of the historic building to house the center could not have been better, both because of the house&rsquo;s Arizona charm and because of its evocative background. In addition to university presidents, many famous people have slept in its guest rooms, including Lady Astor, Ronald Reagan, Robert Frost, Edward Teller, and several heads of state. &nbsp;</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>According to Valley leader Grady Gammage, Jr., who spent his first nine years in the house, the building is very much the same as when he lived there, though the surrounding neighborhood has changed. Gammage remembers having a treehouse in the mulberry tree outside, and nearby men&rsquo;s dorms, which had open-air verandas where the students would play pool.&nbsp; He also remembers a shuffleboard court and an enormous night-blooming cactus in the yard.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>Among other interesting features about the history of the house is the campus legend that the building contains a ghost.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>When Gammage&rsquo;s father, Grady Gammage, Sr., became the ninth president of the institution in 1932, he moved into the house with his first wife, Dixie Gammage. After a few years, the first Mrs. Gammage became an invalid and was confined to the house&rsquo;s second floor, where she stayed until she died in 1948. After her death, students reported still seeing her on occasion,&nbsp; walking past the second story windows, dressed in a bathrobe and wearing a characteristic hat. No one currently on campus could be found who has actually seen her, but the house seems like an ideal haunt for a resident spirit, with its many rooms, nooks, corners, as well as a dark basement and attic.</p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>Beyond the ghost story, the house also has its domestic side. Grady Gammage, Jr.&rsquo;s mother, Katherine Gammage married President Gammage in 1950, and Grady, Jr. was born in 1951. President Gammage died in 1959 and Grady, Jr. and his mother continued to live in the house until 1960. It was a home with all the classic fifties details &ndash; Grady, Jr. remembers that his family was one of the first to have central air conditioning, and also remembers having the first TV in the neighborhood &ndash; a ten-inch screen he used to sit in front of to watch &ldquo;The Mickey Mouse Club.&rdquo; </p>
          <p class=MsoBodyText>&ldquo;All in all,&rdquo; said Rhodes, &ldquo;the house is a place with great character, the sort of place that writers love. We will be very happy here.&rdquo;</p>
