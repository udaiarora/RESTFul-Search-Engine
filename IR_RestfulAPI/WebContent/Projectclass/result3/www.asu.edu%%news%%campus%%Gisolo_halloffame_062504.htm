      <h2><strong>ASU has new - and unusual -- Hall of Famer </strong></h2>
      <p>She was the chair of the Arizona State University Department of Dance for 23 years and a lieutenant commander in the Navy in World War II. She has two honorary doctoral degrees. </p>
      <p>And now, she's been inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in Chicago.
      
      <p>Margaret Gisolo, who will be 90 in October, was honored for her break-through role in baseball in 1928, her tennis career - which she continued until age 86 - and her devotion to the art and study of dance. </p>
        <p>When she was a teenager, Gisolo played American Legion baseball on Blanford, Indiana's Cubs. Her RBI single in a June 18, 1928, title game against the Clinton Baptists would go on to knock the youth sports world into a spin. </p>
        <p>"In the top of the 12th, Margaret knocked in the winning run with a single to right. Clinton protested the loss, saying that the league was reserved for boys only," said Beth Lessard, also a former chair of the Dance Department. </p>
        <p>"A three-man commission, including Baseball Commissioner Kennesaw Mountain Landis, eventually ruled in favor of the Cubs. The team went on to capture the Indiana state championship and compete at Chicago's Comiskey Park. Because of Margaret's accomplishments and the high profile of the case, thousands of girls across the country signed up for American Legion baseball." </p>
        <p>Gisolo graduated from Indiana State University, enlisted in the U.S. Navy, and rose to the rank of lieutenant commander. After her Navy service in World War II, she taught at Indiana State College, then moved to Arizona in 1953. </p>
        <p>She joined the ASU dance faculty and was chair from 1954 to 1977, building what is now recognized as one of the top dance programs in the country. </p>
    
        <p>After she retired, Gisolo, who resides in Tempe, began to play tennis and was soon on the national circuit. She was nationally ranked until 2000, when at age 86 she stopped traveling to national matches. She was ranked first in doubles and second in singles. </p>
        <p>Among her other accomplishments: <br>
. She established and funded a Summer Study Award program that gave scholarships to gifted students who would not otherwise be able to go for professional summer training.<br>
. She was a founding member of Friends of ASU Dance. <br>
. In 1979, she received ASU's Distinguished Teacher Award. <br>
. She was a founding member of the Arizona Dance Arts Alliance. <br>
. After retiring, she wrote a history of Dance Companies in the state of Arizona. The manuscript is in the New York City and Lincoln Center libraries, among others.<br>
. She received an honorary doctorate from ASU in 1994, and one from Indiana State University in 1996. <br>
. In 1998, ISU inducted her into its athletic Hall of Fame. </p>
        <p>Lessard said of Gisolo, "Her legacy lives through the many persons whose lives have been touched by her knowledge, enthusiasm, professionalism and pioneering spirit. She is an inspiration to us all." </p>
        <p>For an interview with Gisolo, contact Lessard at (480) 838-5551 or Beth.Lessard@asu.edu.

        <p class="style1 style1"><span class="style1"><span class="style1"><strong>National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame Facts </strong><br>
. Founded in 1977 by George Randazzo as the Italian American Boxing Hall of Fame as a way to raise money for a struggling local Catholic youth program.<br>
        </span></span>. The first dinner honored 23 former Italian American boxing world champions, including Rocky Graziano, Jake LaMotta and Sammy Angott.<br>
. That event was so success that a friend encouraged Randazzo to start a Hall of Fame to honor all Italian American athletes. The first inductees included Lou Ambers, Joe DiMaggio, and Eddie Arcaro. Mrs. Vince Lombardi also accepted the posthumous induction of her late husband.<br>
. The organization has raised more than $6 million for scholarships and charitable causes. <br>
. Memorabilia in the Hall of Fame includes Mario Andretti's Indy 500 race car, Rocky Marciano's first heavyweight championship belt, and swimmer Matt Biondi's Olympic gold medals.<br>
. Jerry Colangelo is chairman of the board of trustees. </p>
