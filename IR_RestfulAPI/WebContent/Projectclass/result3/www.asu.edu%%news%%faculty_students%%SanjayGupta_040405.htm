          <h2 align="left"><strong>Henry &amp; Horne Endows Professorship </strong><strong>Tax Scholar </strong><strong> Sanjay Gupta</strong><strong> Honored </strong></h2>
          <p align="center"><strong> &nbsp;</strong>Nationally known tax scholar Sanjay Gupta of the School of Accountancy at ASU&rsquo;s W. P. Carey School of Business has been selected to receive the newly established Henry &amp; Horne Professorship in Accountancy. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;The recognition of Sanjay Gupta as the Henry &amp; Horne Professor is well-deserved for his role in delivering high quality scholarship to academics and students, as well as distinguished service to the profession and the school,&rdquo; said Phil Regier, deputy dean of the W. P. Carey School of Business. &ldquo;Sanjay is a longtime friend and colleague. It&rsquo;s gratifying to see the honor awarded to such a gentleman. It's great for the department, the school, and the university.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Gupta, who joined the W. P. Carey School faculty in 1990, is the director of the Master of Accountancy and Information Systems and Master of Taxation programs. He developed four graduate courses and teaches in the W. P. Carey MBA, Master of Accountancy in Information Systems, Master of Taxation and doctoral programs. Gupta&rsquo;s research, including the tax policy work for which he is known, has been published in academic journals such as the <em>National Tax Journal</em>, the <em>Journal of Law and Economics</em>, and <em>The Journal of American Taxation Association</em>. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;Sanjay has been an outstanding contributor to both the scholarship and teaching of taxation,&rdquo; said Jim Boatsman, director of the School of Accounting. &ldquo;His published work appears in virtually every top-tier academic journal. His course, &ldquo;Taxes and Business Strategy,&rdquo; consistently receives near perfect student evaluations. He has also played a vital role in administering the School of Accountancy's graduate programs.&rdquo;</p>
          <p> Henry &amp; Horne, PLC is an Arizona-based certified public accounting and business advisory firm founded in 1957. The 140-person firm serves closely held businesses and high net worth individuals throughout the United States and internationally from four Arizona locations: Tempe, Scottsdale , Casa Grande and Pinetop. In 2003 and 2004, the firm was recognized as one of the Valley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Best Places to Work&rdquo;. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;As passionate supporters of excellence in education, we are thrilled to have the Henry &amp; Horne Professorship awarded to someone with the credentials and personal dedication of Dr. Gupta,&rdquo; said Mark Eberle, managing director of Henry &amp; Horne. &ldquo;We are delighted to be able to support ASU, the School of Accountancy and Dr. Gupta in their quest to set ever higher educational standards in the field of accounting.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Private sector support is an essential ingredient in maintaining a nationally competitive accounting program, and the firm's support clearly evidences its recognition of the value to the community of&nbsp;a quality program,&rdquo; said Boatsman. </p>
