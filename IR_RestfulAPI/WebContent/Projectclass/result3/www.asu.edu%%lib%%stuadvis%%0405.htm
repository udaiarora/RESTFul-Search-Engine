                        <p >Welcome by Vicki Coleman, Associate Dean for Library Services</p>
                        <p >&nbsp;</p>                        <h3 ><strong>Facilities </strong></h3>                        <p ><strong>Question: Do you feel that the library facilities are conducive to your needs? </strong></p>
                        <p ><em>Noble study rooms do not have enough insulation between you can hear groups in the next room, they are also stuffy. There are no places to sleep anywhere on campus, both the student union and the library have removed spaces. When you're on campus for many hours straight you need a place to rest. </em></p>
                        <p >&nbsp; </p>
                        <p ><em>Library is so overwhelming, I needed a guide before I got the guided tour. I asked other students about the lilbrary and they don't know much about it either. It's so overbearing and overpowering; staff is helpful but they're not there to give tours (like we to locate a couch!) Students don't come to the library because it's overwhelming. </em></p>
                        <p >&nbsp; </p>
                        <p ><em>I found it easy to use the library but obviously not everyone has had that experience. But I do find it appalling to see people sleeping in the library. Is this the appropriate place to sleep? </em></p>
                        <p >&nbsp; </p>
                        <p ><em>Where else can we sleep? </em></p>
                        <p >&nbsp; </p>
                        <p ><em>I'm concerned that I don't see more recycling in the library; there are no recycling places. Can printers do double-sided copying to save paper? Also, there's no microsoft software on the computers. </em></p>
                        <p >&nbsp; </p>
                        <p ><em>Yeah, we need WORD </em>. </p>
                        <p >&nbsp; </p>
                        <p ><em>Carrels are nice in Noble, but not those fabric carrels in Hayden; in the future buy carrels that can be cleaned. </em></p>
                        <p >&nbsp;</p>                        <p ><em>I like ILL here; we get pdfs (electronic delivery) and it's free. It's not the same at other universities (told story about friends at U of South Dakota who have to go to Nebraska to get stuff ?because USD shut down their ILL ?) </em></p>
                        <p >&nbsp; </p>
                        <p ><em>Can we get dissertations thru ILLI heard on East campus you can keep the dissertation and not pay (as we do here) </em></p>
                        <blockquote>
                          <p>Ginny Sylvester explained more about the Interlibrary Loan service, which obtains copies of articles, books, dissertations, etc for students. </p>

                        <p ><em>ILL </em><em> is on par here. Most libraries have paper request forms. I like to see more library hours especially during holidays, intersessions, and spring break. The hours need to be longer - like one library open 24/7 ? you could have a different library each time, it wouldn't have to be the same one. Or at least extend the library hours during those times. </em></p>

                          <p>Ginny Sylvester explained that  usually does have indication but should say ?lost and billed?, but perhaps since 3/16 was simply overdue. But it is true that the catalog should indicate status more clearly. </p>
