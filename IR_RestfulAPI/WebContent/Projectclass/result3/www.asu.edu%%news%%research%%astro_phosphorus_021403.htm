      <h2>Astrobiologists find phosphorus' role in regulating ecosystems is unexpectedly 
        complex in living lab</h2>
      <p>For several years now, Arizona State Unversity astrobiologists have been 
        doing experiments in a living lab for evolution -- a set of remarkable 
        desert springs located near Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila, Mexico which may 
        give scientists a modern "analogue" for conditions during the transition 
        from Earth's ancient bacteria-based biosphere to the present, more complex 
        one. </p>
      <p>The area's numerous clear-blue, spring-fed pools and outlet streams each 
        have their own unusual thermal and chemical conditions and their own distinctive 
        biota that have evolved to cope with the specific environments. Like a 
        Galapagos Archipelago in reverse, these islands of water set in a sea 
        of desert give the research team a range of both benign and extreme environments 
        and their accompanying food webs to study in relation to the Cambrian 
        transition. </p>
      <p>A series of papers being presented at the 2003 Astrobiology Institute 
        General Meeting describe experiments being done in this unique setting 
        that may ultimately help explain how the earth's biosphere became what 
        it is today.</p>
      <p>One of the hypotheses that the researchers have been eager to test at 
        Cuatro Cienegas is the concept that the relative availability or lack 
        of availability of certain critical nutrient elements in the early earth 
        could have had a profound effect on the evolution of multi-celled organisms. 
        The critical elements for life include carbon, oxygen, nitrogen (without 
        which there can be no proteins), and, as these investigators are emphasizing, 
        phosphorus. </p>
      <p>The last of these, phosphorus has intrigued researchers because it is 
        relatively rare in the environment, yet it is a critical component in 
        nuclic acids, including ribonucleic acid (RNA), which is, in turn, a critical 
        part in the cell's growth process. RNA is DNA's messenger and the cell's 
        factory worker in the process of creating proteins. Previous work has 
        shown that organisms must produce large amounts of this phosphorus-rich 
        RNA to sustain rapid growth and therefore need to have relatively high 
        concentrations of phosphorus available to them to be successful. An intriguing 
        fact from the fossil record is that there are significant phosphorus-rich 
        deposits ("phosphorites") that date to approximately the period of the 
        Cambrian Transition (540 million years ago), when eukaryotic life took 
        charge. </p>
      <p> From this, a logical question has arisen: could the limited availability 
        of phosphorus have been responsible for keeping eukaryotic cells from 
        exploding into multi-cellular life for three out of the 3.5 billion years 
        that life has existed on earth?</p>
      <p>In addition to having a variety of different chemical and thermal environments 
        nearby to compare, Cuatro Cienegas is also interesting because many of 
        the springs contain microbe-based ecologies that may bear a certain amount 
        of resemblance to the ecologies that may have existed at the period of 
        the Cambrian Transition from a strictly single-celled biosphere to the 
        biosphere dominated by multi-cellular organisms that we live in today. 
      </p>
      <p>The ecologies of many of Cuatro Cienegas's pools and run-off streams 
        depend for food on stromatolite (coral reef-like deposits) forming microbial 
        mats (based on photosynthesizing cyanobacteria), that in turn support 
        "grazing" snails, that then support fish, and so on. A key question then 
        is: does the amount of phosphorus available to the these microbes affect 
        the success of the (eukaryotic) snails that graze on them? A positive 
        answer to this question might be a strong early indication of the importance 
        of available phosphorus to the evolutionary dominance of multicellular 
        eukaryotic life...</p>
      <p>If only life (and science) were so simple. In 2001 and 2002, ASU biologist 
        and Cuatro Cienegas project co-principal investigator James Elser and 
        colleagues ran three experiments to test the hypothesis with mixed results.</p>
      <p>"We added phosphate to the water and the cyanobacteria that were in the 
        stromatolite mat picked it up," said Elser. We had some questions we wanted 
        to answer: How does the phosphate effect the microbial producer community, 
        the carbon to phosphorus ratio of their biomass? How does phosphate rearrange 
        the community structure of the bacterial mat? Second, given that you've 
        added phosphate to the system and done something ecologically or physiologically 
        to the microbial mat, what effect does that have on the consumers of that 
        material, the snails?"</p>
      <p>Elser's group did, in fact, discover that the microbes readily increased 
        in phosphorus content with the addition of phosphate, but the effect on 
        the snails eating the phosphorus-rich bacteria was not completely expected.</p>
      <p>"We were surprised. The first year we thought we got evidence that supported 
        our hypothesis that the snails had been limited by the very low phosphorus 
        content of the microbes that they were consuming. The snails themselves 
        had a higher phosphorus content and appeared to be performing better," 
        he said. "In 2002, however, we did the experiment longer and more extensively 
        with more sites and instead of the stimulation response we got the opposite 
        - there was apparently a poisoning effect of some kind. It was too much 
        of a good thing."</p>
      <p>In the second round of experiments, Elser found that the mortality rate 
        of snails was significantly higher on phosphorus-enriched stromatolites 
        than on the untreated ones. What's more, new snails didn't move in to 
        replace the dead ones - regular numbers of new snails were observed in 
        untreated colonies, but not in the treated ones.</p>
      <p>Elser points out that the snails in question are probably adapted to 
        a phosphorus poor environment, so, in the short-term, a significant, sustained 
        phosphorus increase is harmful to the population.</p>
      <p>"The snails are normally exposed to a low phosphorus diet. When we improve 
        that diet moderately for a short while, they do better, But when, like 
        in 2002, we go too far and give them too much phosphorus, they don't. 
        They are apparently so well adapted to acquiring phosphorus, so used to 
        being phosphorus limited, their metabolisms don't know what to do," he 
        said. " We think that perhaps the snails have adapted to the extremely 
        phosphorus-limited environment and are living on a stoichiometric knife-edge 
        with regard to phosphorus." </p>
      <p>Of course, an increase in phosphorus supply over an evolutionary time 
        period could have a different effect, eventually changing the population 
        by selecting for snails who could withstand higher phosphorus concentrations, 
        and even take advantage of them.</p>
      <p>"You could imagine exposing them to slowly increasing phosphorus content 
        in their diet and allow some sort of natural selection process to take 
        place," Elser said, "but that's a different experiment." </p>
