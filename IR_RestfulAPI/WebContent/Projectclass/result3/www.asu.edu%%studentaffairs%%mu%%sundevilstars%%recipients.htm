							<dt>Jennifer Bergmark</dt>
								<dd>Jennifer Bergmark has found her home in the ASU community through involvement throughout campus. She has demonstrated leadership as the Director of Pep Rallies for the Student Alumni Association, VP of Operations for the Sports Business Association, Vice President of Devils? Advocates, planning team member for Sparky?s Summer Shakedown, and student orientation leader. She is the student representative on the ASU Alumni Association?s School of Community Resources & Development Chapter Board and represents ASU as a member of the 2005-2006 Fiesta Bowl Court. Jennifer advocates for CRD and ASU with enthusiasm and grace.</dd>
						
							<dt>Joseph Bertoletti</dt>
						
								<dd>I am pleased to nominate Joseph Bertoletti, one of the most dynamic students I know, for a Sun Devil Star award. He has a true passion for the W. P. Carey School of Business and Arizona State University. Joe's pride of place comes across in his smile when shares ASU traditions with his peers and prospective students as president of Devil's Advocates. Joe is also a COB 194 facilitator, one of the most capable with whom I work. His passion for ASU has created an exciting environment for his class. Joe is a star amongst our brightest Sun Devils.</dd>
						
							<dt>Thomas Boltz</dt>
								<dd>Thomas does all the behinds the scenes work for RHA, taking minutes, balancing the budget, and being the financial go-between with Res. Life. Without his effort, RHA would not be able to program, create legislation, or function smoothly. However, it is his passion and heart that set him apart. With integrity he is always able to observe the situation and give needed and valuable insight. His under the radar efforts are essential to the success of RHA's mission and goals.</dd>
						
							<dt>Chris Burford</dt>
								<dd>Chris has been a student work in the Office of College Advancement for 9 months. He is always willing to go above and beyond his "student worker duties" lending a hand to students, faculty and staff. He is an asset to the office and to the University and a joy to work with. Thanks, Chris, for all you do for the office.</dd>
						
							<dt class="alpha"><a name="2006C"></a>C</dt>
						
							<dt>Victoria Carpenter</dt>
								<dd>Victoria is currently a weight room supervisor for Campus Recreation. She has been a role model to the other employees by being very conscientious and meticulous about her work. Victoria continually goes beyond the call of duty and exceeds her expectations. She enjoys being involved with the fitness program by taking on additional projects and always seeking supplementary ways to learn. She has also demonstrated excellent customer service with patrons by disseminating thorough information at all times. Victoria has been an asset to our program and the university.</dd>
						
							<dt>Matt Cicinelli</dt>
								<dd>Matt exhibited exceptional leadership talent in his role as Assistant Director for Homecoming under PAB during the fall of 2005. His leadership and professionalism was noticeable to all of the PAB staff, campus and Tempe community with whom Matt interacted. There is a hefty responsibility on Homecoming students' shoulders and having leadership such as Matt's is critical to engage, inspire and continually motivate other students. As an individual, there is no project or problem too big or small for Matt to take the initiative to resolve. During the course of the planning and during the week of Homecoming, there were all manner of snags and unexpected obstacles that would occur, but Matt never panicked. He always knew just what needed to be done and how to accomplish the goal. His dedication has been a model for other students.</dd>
						
							<dt>Joe Clay</dt>
								<dd>As a freshman at ASU, Joe has taken on responsibilities that have contributed to the success of Campus Recreation programs. His work has been incredible and he hasn't failed to step up when needed. He is available when extra work is necessary and he is always smiling! We appreciate all he does for our programs and Campus Recreation. THANK YOU!</dd>
						
							<dt>Alan Clifford</dt>
								<dd>Alan proved his exceptional leadership by being a part of Homecoming under PAB for two years in a row. Alan is the caliber of leader that the responsibilities of Homecoming demand because of his vision, creativity and his dedication to the mission. Alan is conscientious, though decisive and is comfortable and confident making "executive" decisions which others are sometimes uncomfortable making. However, he also seeks equally to get other opinions from those with whom he works. He leads by example, makes things fun and motivates the team by just being around and I have rarely seen the kind of devotion that the Homecoming staff had to Alan. All fall semester the Homecoming staff looked forward to the weekly Homecoming meetings because they were actually fun with him at the helm.</dd>
						
							<dt class="alpha"><a name="2006D"></a>D</dt>
						
							<dt>Michael De Villa</dt>
								<dd>Michael De Villa, a Junior living at Cholla Hall is the type of student that lives the ASU driven life and provides an positive example to students and staff alike on what a Sun Devil Star is. During Michael's freshman year he served as Vise President of programs on the Student Hall Council. His sophomore year he was both a Desk Assistant and President of Student Hall Council. I met Michael this year while he was involved at both Cholla and Sahuaro Halls Floats for the Homecoming Parade. I observed his leadership abilities in the way he was able to garner support for the completion of the Cholla Hall float when others would have giving up in frustration. Michael Pule, Community Coordinator of Sahuaro Hall and his boss as Desk Assistant agrees that Michael is a committed and dedicated student who can always be counted on and often fills in when other Desk Assistants miss their shifts.</dd>
						
							<dt>Kimberlee Demaree</dt>
								<dd>Kim Demaree exudes enthusiasm - especially when it comes to service. She spends countless hours serving as the President for ASU's Circle K International and motivating the members to serve with a smile. Through her work with the Community Service Program, Kim has been able to reach beyond the members of CKI, and teach other students the joy of serving. She has successfully doubled the number of CSP Team Leaders and organized the first ever Team Leader service project so the TL's would have an opportunity to bond while doing service together. She is a tremendous asset to the Community Service Program, ASU, and the community as a whole. She is a great example to others, and truly is a Sun Devil Star.</dd>
						
							<dt>Matthew Dircks</dt>
						
								<dd>Matt is in his 2nd year of working for Operations & Facilities in the Athletic Department. For being one of the younger members of the student-staff, Matt has demonstrated the leadership of a veteran. He has the ability to work with everyone well: from his co-workers to clients of the athletic department and the coaching staff. He is willing to do any type of assignment, big or small. He's the first to volunteer and will see everything through to the end. Matt truly defines what a team player is.</dd>
						
							<dt>Ryan Dromgoole</dt>
								<dd>Ryan exemplifies the qualities of a great leader including positive attitude, dedication, motivation, listening skills, presentation skills and patience. He is a valuable asset as a Peer Advisor at Career Services and acts as a positive role model and mentor to his peers. Ryan has a calmness and presence about him that inspires trust, which is evident through his interactions with students, faculty and staff. His recent presentation at the Academic Advisor luncheon offered true testament to his leadership abilities and he further exhibits these skills as V.P. of Career Development with the Supply Chain Management student organization.</dd>
						
							<dt>Diana Durazo Leon</dt>
								<dd>Diana has worked for Professional Enhancement Programs as a student worker for over a year. During this time, she has demonstrated excellent leadership skills by training other student workers and also assisting in my training as her supervisor. Everyone who works with Diana agrees that her enthusiasm and professionalism are unmatched. She demonstrates maturity in her interactions with customers and staff, and she is committed to providing high quality work, even in the smallest of tasks. Diana is a model student, and her flexibility, cheerful attitude, and attention to detail make her an ideal employee and agreeable co-worker.</dd>
						
							<dt class="alpha"><a name="2006E"></a>E</dt>
						
							<dt>Tara Egnatios</dt>
								<dd>Tara excels as a student in the Barrett Honors College. She was also a stellar student worker this summer while I coordinated a UNI 100 course for first time first year students of color, APPLES. Tara could easily be nominated for her work with me and her performance in the classroom, but that is not why I am nominating her today. Tara is a Sun Devil Star! In talking with me about starting a new professional position serving Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Ally students in the Multicultural Student Center, Tara and I spoke briefly about the need for an inclusive and information Gender and Sexuality website link for the MSC's website.</dd>
						
								<dd>Tara took it upon herself to review the 134 other campus websites across the country and develop what may be the most comprehensive collection of information for LGBTQ college students, faculty, and staff. Her leadership and initiative have made this project attainable. We are currently finalizing web development details with the department, but within the next semester, ASU will have a web site listing local and national resources and information for the ASU LGBTQ community and the surrounding area. I can't thank Tara enough! She truly is a role model for all students and if I may say so, for faculty and staff as well. Tara saw a problem, developed a solution, and took the time needed to see this solution through.</dd>
						
							<dt>Matt Estes</dt>
						
								<dd>Matt's leadership is illustrated by his work in two roles: writing tutor at the Learning Resource Center (LRC) and peer advisor in the Barrett Honors College. Matt is a role model because of the way he mentors his new tutoring colleagues, takes the initiative to arrange meetings with instructors, and offers thoughtful advice about ways to enhance writing tutoring. Matt has an impressive way of connecting with students and making them feel comfortable analyzing their writing to find their strengths and areas in need of improvement. As a tutor, he is invested in students' understanding and success.</dd>
						
								<dd>Matt has continued over the years to be a strong focal point to students as a positive peer role model in the Barrett Honor College Advising Office. He meets with students and assists them with concern about their schedules, classes to take, discussions in length about their major, their personal and individual concerns and suitability of each professor. He also has been known to promote BHC with his tremendous individual recruiting style. Matt holds down a job at the LRC as a tutor, and in his spare spare time he is a volunteer with Hospice of the Valley. Thank you for caring! That's Matt, a Sun Devil Star!</dd>
						
							<dt class="alpha"><a name="2006F"></a>F</dt>
						
							<dt>Alicia Fremling</dt>
								<dd>Alicia has been a Sun Devil Fitness Instructor with Campus Recreation for around two years. From a management standpoint Alicia is a star due to her communication and follow-up, her team-player attitude and energetic support of the Group Exercise program. But where Alicia really shines is with the participants in her group exercise classes. Alicia's outgoing and welcoming demeanor creates a positive, fun atmosphere as she motivates Sun Devils to stay active. Thanks for the energy, Alicia!</dd>
						
							<dt class="alpha"><a name="2006G"></a>G</dt>
						
							<dt>Aimee Gipper</dt>
								<dd>In the short time that I have grown to know Aimee, her leadership style and commitment to student success and academics as shown in her involvement with many student groups such as REACH, RHA, Associated Students, Meal Plan Committee, Devils? Advocates, START and the new Memorial Union Advisory Board, just to name a few. She is often ?behind the scenes? working to better students and the future of ASU.</dd>
						
							<dt>Joshua Groen</dt>
								<dd>Joshua Groen, a peer tutor for the Learning Resource Center, exceeds the responsibilities of his position and provides leadership to his peers and the students using our services. Josh tutors math, physics, and engineering classes. He also tutors online for us, providing tutoring to students who are unable to come to campus. As we develop our advanced tutor certification, Josh eagerly volunteers to participate, mentoring new tutors, helping to train new tutors, and developing resources for students. Reliable, responsible, and ready to do whatever it takes to excel and help others, Josh embodies the traits of a Sun Devil Star.</dd>
						
							<dt>Chelsea Grubb</dt>
								<dd>Chelsea is a driven student who is dedicated to helping others both in of and out of the classroom. As a future teacher, Chelsea has prepared herself by working as a Resident Assistant in Manzanita Hall and through her volunteer work in local schools. Chelsea continues to showcase her teaching talents by serving as a Peer Facilitator of DCI 194, a university success course designed for first-year Education students. Chelsea has worked for the USG as a Safety Escort, is involved with Gamma Phi Beta and is a member of the National Society for Collegiate Scholars. Chelsea truly defines what it is to be a student leader and a Sun Devil Star.</dd>
						
							<dt class="alpha"><a name="2006H"></a>H</dt>
						
							<dt>Martin Hallqvist</dt>
								<dd>Martin has worked for the Memorial Union for over one year, as both an Event Assistant and Building Manager. Martin is always willing to help out anyone at anytime. He is flexible, knowledgeable and friendly. It is always a pleasure to work with him, and several clients have sent thank-you notes to him with regards to his excellent service. He is a role-model to others with his commitment and dedication to his job. He is truly one of the shining stars of the student employment programs here at the MU.</dd>
						
							<dt>Nancy Herrera</dt>
								<dd>Nancy Herrera is a dedicated student and commendable leader. As the secretary in STEP (Students Toward Educational Progress) Multicultural Honor Society, she always goes above and beyond her duties and seems to fulfill everything else that needs to get done for the student organization to be successful. She is friendly and makes every student feels as if they belong in the organization, which is one of the reasons why STEP continues to have great involvement among their members. Along with all of the efforts she puts into STEP, Nancy is also involved in the Hispanic Mother Daughter Program and other numerous events on campus, all the while maintaining a 3.7 GPA.</dd>
						
							<dt>David Haveman</dt>
								<dd>Dave has served on the staff of the Learning Resource Center since his freshman year, starting as a Computer Lab Attendant, progressing to Senior Web Developer. He has been a mentor to new staff, sharing his experience and knowledge and helping them feel welcome. His contribution extends beyond the lab in his work as our web developer. He revolutionized the LRC's service delivery options by designing and developing an amazing web-based database that allows students to view schedules and register for tutoring and peer coaching online. This database functions more effectively than commercially available models we have seen and tried. Dave's approach to the project was, if we could imagine it, he could build it. Whenever we asked for something he had never done before, he always agreed, then did some research and experimentation until he figured out how to get it done. Dave is a Sun Devil Star!</dd>
							
							<dt class="alpha"><a name="2006K"></a>K</dt>
						
							<dt>Amanda Keim</dt>
								<dd>As editor of The State Press, Amanda leads a newsroom of about 65 students who produce the daily student newspaper and the weekly student magazine. She is a calm, quiet leader who can manage the almost inevitable daily crises while keeping here staff focused and productive. She?s a strong journalist, but it takes more than that to run a newsroom well. She is also a strong manager of people ? one who is open and collaborative and still clearly in charge. Amanda also sets a high standard for the The State Press. She understands the role of the student newspaper in the ASU community and does her best to be an accurate and fair provider of news and information.</dd>
						
							<dt>Sophia Kelly</dt>
								<dd>It is a pleasure to nominate Sophia Kelly as a Sun Devil Star. Sophia started working in Veterans Services this past summer. During the summer our office underwent a massive remodeling project. During that time, our department was relocated three different times and we were often working out of boxes and improvising as we went along. Sophie was a real trooper during all the chaos and confusion. She cheerfully adjusted to all the changes while learning the rules and regulations required by the US Dept of Veterans Affairs. She has a cheerful, bubbly personality that affects the atmosphere of the whole office. She is a pleasure to have around.</dd>
						
							<dt>Sarah Kennedy</dt>

							<dt>Brian Kinney</dt>
								<dd>Brian Kinney became an RA in the spring of 2005. He took over a floor that had had no leadership or guidance in the Fall semester. Brian came in with a positive attitude and a concern and compassion for helping students. He turned that floor into a tight knit "family". This year Brian has moved to a different hall but his legacy continues. He has formed a leadership council for his floor that meets weekly, has t-shirts and hosts programs for the entire community. Brian understands what being a RA means and exemplifies that everyday. He is an everyday hero that goes unsung but not unappreciated. Brian has touched, influenced and cared about the lives of the young people living in our residence halls here at ASU.</dd>
						
							<dt>Brittney Krause</dt>
								<dd>Brittney is currently a lifeguard and safety education instructor at the Student Recreation Complex. She has been a role model to the other employees by being very positive and team oriented about her work.

							<dt>Penny Litten</dt>
								<dd>Penny exemplifies the qualities of a Sun Devil Star in many ways. She demonstrates her leadership skills in the intramural program by her quality of work as an Sport Club and Intramural Manager each night on the field.

During her stay here, she has been a loyal employee; taking so much of an interest in learning how the office works that I would have no qualms about leaving her with no supervision for days at a time+. During our changeover from several depts. to a School in 2003, Rhonda proved to be an invaluable resource, as we were seriously understaffed to handle such a consolidation due to staff attrition. We now have 5 fulltime employees doing what 2 employees were trying to keep up with at the time---we absolutely counted on Rhonda to see us through, and she was unbelievable. She has also married during her stay here, and she made the Dean's list this semester.
