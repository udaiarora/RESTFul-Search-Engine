  Dr. Anderies received his doctorate from the Institute of Applied Mathematics at the University of British Columbia, Canada, with a specialization in mathematical bioeconomics. Prior to coming to ASU, he held a three-year appointment as a postdoctoral researcher at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Australia. Dr. Anderies studies a range of archaeological, historical, and contemporary examples of social-ecological systems using formal mathematical modeling and analysis. Other areas of interest include economic growth, demographics and the environment, and mathematical modeling in community ecology. His current research interests focus on robust institutional design for coupled social ecological systems. Dr. Anderies is an associate editor for <em>Ecology and Society</em>, a journal of integrative science for resilience and sustainability. </p>

He entered the graduate program in audiology at the University of Kansas in 1995 and received his Ph.D. in 2000. He continued conducting research in cochlear physiology at the University of Kansas Medical Center and was appointed a research assistant professor there in 2003. His research on noninvasive measures of inner ear function has been awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health.

  Dr. Bimonte-Nelson received her doctorate from the University of Connecticut in 2000. Prior to coming to ASU, she was a postdoctoral fellow and then research assistant professor at the Medical University of South Carolina in the Neuroscience Institute and the Center on Aging. Her research area focuses on the cognitive and brain changes that occur during aging, incorporating this information to develop behavioral, pharmacological, and dietary strategies to attenuate mnemonic and neurobiological age-related alterations using animal models. One of her primary interests is to determine the roles that sex, hormones, and brain chemistry play in brain function and cognition in the young versus the aged, with special relevance to Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease-related variables. </p>

<p><strong>Janet Bond-Robinson</strong><br>
  <em>Associate Professor, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry</em><br>
  Dr. Bond-Robinson received her doctorate from the University of Iowa in science education with a specialization in chemical education. She held a postdoctoral position in chemical education for one year at the University of Kansas in Lawrence and was subsequently hired as an assistant professor of chemical education in the Chemistry Department there. Her Career Grant (2001-2006) funded by the National Science Foundation explores learning in two contexts: pedagogical chemical knowledge (PCK) learned as graduate students teach chemistry and empirical chemical knowledge gained in the research laboratory over five years of work. Her publications identify fundamental aspects of pedagogical content knowledge required to be an effective constructivist teacher in the laboratory as well as coaching methods to catalyze performance of PCK, and characteristics of the learning environment of a research laboratory and the kinds of reasoning acquired over time that spur development of a scientist. </p>
