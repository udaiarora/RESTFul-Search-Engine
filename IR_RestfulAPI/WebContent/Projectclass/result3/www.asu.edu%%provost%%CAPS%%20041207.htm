<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;Dr. Gutierrez?
presentation focused on the recommendations of last year?s Academic
Professional Task Force, the Provost?s response to these recommendations, and
the current status of action on the recommendations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In large part she reviewed the Provost?s response, which is available
at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/provost/ap/APTF-prov-resp.doc">http://www.asu.edu/provost/ap/APTF-prov-resp.doc</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial">She
also mentioned several actions that have been taken since the Provost?s
response was distributed:<o:p>
</o:p>

font-family:&quot;Wingdings 3&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">­<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">A working group that will write
new ACD policy language, as required by the recommendations, has been formed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The working group was selected so as to include representatives from all
three campuses; and representatives of each of the three types of AP positions;
Research, Pedagogy, and Information and Materials management; and a
representative from the Office of General Counsel.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list .25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Wingdings 3&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">­<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">A proposal to allow multiple-year
appointments for APs has been approved by the Academic Senate and will be
presented at the next Board of Regents meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If this proposal is approved, the working group will develop policies for
this new type of appointment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
goal is to present the new policy to the Academic Senate this spring.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;Some questions raised
in the question-and-answer portion of the program:<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Q:
When a new AP position is created, who will determine the correct appointment
type (continuing-track, multi-year, or one-year) for the position?</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">A:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The decision will be made jointly by the department involved and its
college administration.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Q:
What is the distinction between continuing status and tenure?</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">A:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tenure is a property right, while Continuing Status is an expectation of
employment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In practice, they are
very similar, but legally they?re different.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;Questions also dealt
with the proposed move of Academic Advisors out of the Academic Professional
category into a set of Classified Staff and Service Professional positions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was explained that Barbara Mawhiney is currently developing these
position descriptions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Academic
advisors who currently hold Academic Associate positions will be offered Service
Professional contracts in the next appointment period.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;Dr. Gutierrez
responded to further questions about the future status of Academic Advisors. She
pointed out that one advantage of Service Professional positions is that they
offer the possibility of promotion and salary increases. One of the main reasons
for the change, she noted, was to place advisors across the university in the
same category as a basis for providing parity and uniformity in salaries. She
also noted that it should be possible for Advisors to continue to teach, should
they and their departments find this desirable. The number of sections to be
taught will be negotiated by Advisors and their supervisors.<o:p>
