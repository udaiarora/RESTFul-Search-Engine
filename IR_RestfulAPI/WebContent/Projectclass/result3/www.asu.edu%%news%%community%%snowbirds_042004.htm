      <h2>'Snowbirds' inject $1 billion annually into state's economy </h2>
      <p>A declining number of winter residents - popularly known as "snowbirds" - were living in Phoenix metro area's mobile home/RV/travel trailer parks at the height of the 2003-04 winter season, according to a study by the Center for Business Research at Arizona State University. But the trend is deceiving -- reflecting changing lifestyles of the emerging baby boom generation. The state's seasonal population is actually growing, estimated at 300,000 individuals and spending an estimated $1 billion. </p>
      <p>The center has conducted an annual survey of mobile home/RV/travel trailer parks in the Phoenix area for the past 19 years. In 1990-91 the study was expanded to include areas outside the Phoenix/Apache Junction area. Since then, the survey has included parks in an 11-county region (previous research indicated few winter residents in the four northern/eastern counties of Apache, Coconino, Navajo, and Greenlee). </p>
      <p>The purpose of the annual winter resident study is to estimate the size and the economic contribution of the large number of part-time residents who spend the winter in Arizona, says Dr. Timothy Hogan, Center director. </p>
      <p>Emerging trends are making it more difficult each year to pinpoint a winter visitor population total. "There is anecdotal evidence that growing numbers of snowbirds have are choosing to live in second homes and condominiums in the Phoenix area," Hogan says. "At the same time, some of the park snowbird households are staying less time in the Phoenix area, with those driving big motor homes at the top of the list. But as they leave Phoenix, significant numbers stay in other locations in the state. </p>
      <p>"Therefore, even with the declines in recent years in snowbird households in the Phoenix area parks, a growing seasonal population in other accommodations in the area, increases in park snowbird households elsewhere in the state, and the recognition that a significant number of snowbirds are choosing a more mobile lifestyle resulting in a higher proportion of short-term winter visitors - all of this leads us to believe that the overall impact of elderly seasonal households on the state was at least 1 billion dollars for the 2003-2004 season." </p>
      <p>"What's next on the horizon is open to speculation," says Dr. Stephen Happel, co-author of the study. "Given the sheer size of the baby boom generation, we have every reason to believe the overall number of snowbirds will grow significantly over the next 10 years. Arizona will remain a prime destination for those embracing the snowbird lifestyle. But the traditional park crowd will likely give way to a younger generation of snowbirds looking elsewhere." </p>
      <p>The study's conclusion? "Those in the industry, as well as policymakers in Arizona, should be ready to adapt quickly to the changing nature of the snowbird industry. If not, other states will surely step forward to cater to the big-spending crowd of baby boom retirees who will be seeking meaningful personal experiences as they move through their retirement years." </p>
