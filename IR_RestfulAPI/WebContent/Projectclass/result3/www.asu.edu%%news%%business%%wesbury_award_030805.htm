          <h2>W. P. Carey School of Business Presents Stuart A. Wesbury, Jr. Community Leader Award to CEO of Scottsdale Healthcare </h2>
          <p align="center"><strong> </strong>Max Poll, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Scottsdale Healthcare, receives the Stuart A. Wesbury, Jr. Community Leader Award from Arizona State University&rsquo;s School of Health Management and Policy at a luncheon on March 24. U.S. Surgeon General Richard H. Carmona, M.D. will deliver the Stuart A. Wesbury, Jr. Lecture at the event.</p>
          <p> The reception begins at 11:30 a.m. in the Grand Ballroom of the Arizona Biltmore, 24 th St. and Missouri, Phoenix. Reservations are being accepted through March 15 by email at <a href="mailto:wpcareyhap@asu.edu">wpcareyhap@asu.edu</a> or by calling 480-965-7778. Single seats are $50; tables of 10 are $1,000 and half table are $500<strong><em>. Complimentary media seating is available by contacting Liz Farquhar at 480-965-7774 or liz.farquhar@asu.edu.</em></strong></p>
          <p> Poll came to the top leadership position at Scottsdale Healthcare in 1992 with 30 years experience in health care administration. Most recently he was president and CEO of the 1,200-bed Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, Mo. &ndash; the primary teaching affiliate of Washington University. Previously he was administrator and CEO of Boone Hospital Center in Columbia, Mo.</p>
          <p> The Stuart A. Wesbury Jr. Award honors Professor Emeritus Wesbury, a pioneer in the development of the healthcare management field. The award recognizes a leader who, like Wesbury, has provided leadership to the profession and has supported higher education in the field.</p>
          <p> &ldquo;Max Poll has been an extremely successful leader in healthcare and his community.&nbsp; His leadership is reflected in the excellent reputation enjoyed by Scottsdale Healthcare and in the broad spectrum of high quality services provided to Scottsdale and area citizens,&rdquo; said Jeffrey Wilson, director of the School of Health Management and Policy. &ldquo;Poll has extended his leadership beyond his institution, particularly through his work with Scottsdale economic development groups and in his successful efforts to make&nbsp;the Phoenix metropolitan area the home of TGen.&rdquo;</p>
          <p> Carmona has direct ties to ASU&rsquo;s W. P. Carey School of Business, having been a student in the School of Health Management and Policy when he was earning a masters degree in public health from the University of Arizona (at the time, ASU provided the health business and policy courses in that degree). Before being sworn in as Surgeon General in 2002, Carmona was the chairman of the state of Arizona Southern Regional Emergency Medical System, a professor of surgery, public health and family and community medicine at the University of Arizona, and the Pima County Sheriff's Department surgeon and deputy sheriff. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;We at ASU are proud that we had a role in Dr. Carmona&rsquo;s educational experiences,&rdquo; Wilson said.&nbsp;&ldquo;We consider him to be one of our own and take some measure of pride in his success as our nation's Surgeon General.&nbsp; We look forward to listening to his challenge to us as he brings his message of the need for greater leadership in promoting&nbsp;the&nbsp;nation's health.&rdquo;</p>
          <p> Also at the event an outstanding graduate student in the School of Health Management and Policy will also be honored with the Stuart A. Wesbury Student Award. </p>
          <p> The luncheon and award ceremony was inaugurated in 2004, when Roger A. Hughes, executive director of St. Luke's Health Initiatives, became the first recipient of the Stuart A. Wesbury, Jr. Community Leader Award.</p>
          <p> The School of Health Management and Policy is a major educational and research unit of ASU&rsquo;s W. P. Carey School. The school provides education and training for health services managers and policy makers, and pursues healthcare industry and management research. </p>
          <p> The full-time accredited graduate program is consistently ranked among the best business-based programs in the nation. Graduates earn the W. P. Carey MBA/Master&rsquo;s in Health Management dual degree, which includes a specialization in one of the following fields: supply chain management, finance, services marketing or information technology. Graduates are uniquely qualified for leadership positions in the healthcare industry. </p>
          <p> The school also offers part-time evening programs leading to the Master of Health Sector Management (MHSM) degree with tracks in epidemiology, policy, and management. The programs are offered cooperatively with the W. P. Carey MBA - Evening Program.</p>
