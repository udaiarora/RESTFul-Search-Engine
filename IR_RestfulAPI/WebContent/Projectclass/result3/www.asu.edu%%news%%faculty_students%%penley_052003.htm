      <h2>Colorado State University names new president: W. P. Carey School Dean
        Larry Penley accepts top job </h2>
      <p> Larry Edward Penley, dean of the W. P. Carey School of Business at
        Arizona State University (ASU), has been named president of Colorado
        State University and chancellor of the Colorado State University system.
        The formal announcement will be made tomorrow in Fort Collins, Colo.,
        at a 2 p.m. press conference.</p>
      <p>Penley will assume his new post sometime
          this summer. </p>
      <p>"We are grateful for Larry Penley's passionate leadership as dean of the W.
    P. Carey School of Business for the past 12 years, and for his academic excellence
    and commitment to quality education at ASU since 1985," says ASU President
    Michael M. Crow. "Larry has positioned the business school on a steep upward
    trajectory, and we are committed to continuing on this path with the same energy
    and passion." </p>
      <p>Colorado State University, based in Fort Collins, serves almost
    24,000 students at its main campus and three satellite campuses. The system
    also includes the
    University of Southern Colorado, which becomes Colorado State University
        - Pueblo on July 1, 2003.</p>
      <p>"We have worked very hard to come up with the right
    person to lead the institution and the system," said Don Hamstra, president
    of the board of governors of the
    Colorado State University system. "In Larry Penley we have selected a leader
    with vision, experience, integrity and with a real passion for moving Colorado
    State and the university system forward. We're thrilled to make this announcement
    tomorrow and excited about what the future holds."</p>
      <p>ASU Senior Vice President
    and Provost Milton Glick said an interim dean will be appointed, and a national
    search will begin soon to find a top leader to
    succeed Penley.</p>
      <p>"This is an attractive position," Glick said. "The progress
    of this school over the last decade is extraordinary. We have a strong faculty,
    and the Carey
    name and gift gives us an opportunity to bring in a strong leader who can
        take off from the solid base that Larry Penley built." </p>
      <p>Penley has been on the faculty
    of ASU's business school since 1985, when he was hired as chair of the management
    department. In 1990, he was named interim
    dean, and appointed to the permanent position in 1991. His crowning achievement
    was the January 2003 W. P. Carey School of Business naming, spurred by the
    second largest gift ever given to a U.S. business school -- $50 million from
    New York City real estate investment banker Wm. Polk Carey. </p>
      <p>During his tenure
    as dean, the W. P. Carey School has emerged as a top-ranked MBA and undergraduate
    program led by a strong research faculty and supported
    with the latest in information technology. </p>
      <p>Penley developed deep collaborative
    ties with the business community regionally and nationally, leading to the
    program improvements and funding resources that
    fueled the W. P. Carey School's rapid rise to prominence. The L. William
        Seidman Research Institute grew to include eight prominent research centers
        providing
    business data and new knowledge essential to companies and the community.
        Under his leadership, the school added a dozen endowed chaired and 15
        professorships,
    greatly improving incentives for the best faculty to join and remain at the
    W. P. Carey School. </p>
      <p>"Larry Penley's leadership brought ASU into the ranks of
    the leading public business schools," said Lee McPheters, associate dean
        for executive and professional
    programs. "The most notable program accomplishments were in the national
        recognition of the MBA program and the growth in size and quality of
        the Business Honors
    program, but faculty research productivity also continuously improved. The
    Dean emphasized technology and this was evident in the success of the online
    MBA program as well as the growth in technology support for faculty staff
      and students." </p>
      <p>Penley is past chair of AACSB International - The Association
          to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. At ASU, he is an affiliated
          faculty member
      with the Center
      for Latin American Studies. He serves on the boards of several community
      organizations, including the Greater Phoenix Economic Council. He is the
      past chair of the
      K-12 Education Task Force of the Valley Citizens League and was honored
        by INROADS Arizona with the Frank C. Carr award. </p>
      <p>Raised in Tennessee, Penley received
    a B. A. in psychology and M. S. in communication from Wake Forest University,
    and a Ph. D. in management at The University of
    Georgia. He studied Spanish at Centro de Artes y Lenguas, Mexico, and Universidad
    Autonoma de Mexico. He has taught strategic and human resource management.
    His executive training experience and his consulting have brought him into
    contact with industries ranging from manufacturing to health care. In addition
    to his service at ASU, Penley's academic career included 10 years on the
        faculty at University of Texas, San Antonio, and was a visiting faculty
        member at Universidad
    de Carbobo, Venezuala and ITESM, Mexico. <br>
