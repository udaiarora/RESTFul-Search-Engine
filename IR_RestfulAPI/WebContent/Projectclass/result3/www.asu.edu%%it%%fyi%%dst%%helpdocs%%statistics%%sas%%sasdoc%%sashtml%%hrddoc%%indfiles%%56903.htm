Real-world problems and data sets are the backbone of this groundbreaking  book.  Applied Multivariate Statistics with SAS Software, Second Edition
provides a unique approach to the topic, integrating statistical methods,  data analysis, and applications.  Now extensively revised, the book
includes new information on mixed effects models, applications of the      MIXED procedure, regression diagnostics with the corresponding IML
procedure code, and covariance structures.  The authors' approach to the   information aids professors, researchers, and students in a variety of
disciplines and industries. Extensive SAS code and the corresponding       output accompany sample problems, and clear explanations of the various
SAS procedures are included. Emphasis is on correct interpretation of the  output to draw meaningful conclusions. Featuring both the theoretical and
the practical, topics covered include multivariate analysis of             experimental data and repeated measures data, graphical representation of
data including biplots, and multivariate regression. In addition, a quick  introduction to the IML procedure with special reference to multivariate
data is available in an appendix. SAS programs and output integrated with  the text make it easy to read and follow the examples.
