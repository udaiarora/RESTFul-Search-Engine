      <h2>Assessing the progress of economic recovery in Arizona </h2>
      <p>As Arizona joins other states across the nation on the road to economic recovery, analysts expect the job growth rate will increase 3.5 percent this year, bringing more than 80,000 new jobs to the state, according to an analysis in the current issue of the <em>Arizona Blue Chip Economic Forecast </em>. If the forecast proves correct, says contributing editor Elliott Pollack, "This would be the best job growth performance since 2000." </p>
      <p>Looking back on the recession of 2001, it is evident that the impact has varied among industries throughout the state. "Employment growth occurred in education and health services, select retail operations, utilities and insurance," Pollack says, "Yet, for those individuals employed in high-tech manufacturing and tourism, the recession and early recovery may have been more difficult. Manufacturing employment in Arizona declined by 9 percent in 2002 and 5.2 percent in 2003. Throughout the United States it declined by 6.9 percent in 2002 and 5.1 percent in 2003." </p>
      <p>The tourism industry was particularly hard hit by reductions in business spending, as well as the 9/11 terrorist attacks. "During the recession, leisure and hospitality employment in Arizona declined by 3.7 percent," Pollack reports. "As a state we are reliant on high-tech manufacturing for many of our higher-wage jobs, and on tourism as a significant source of inflowing revenue." </p>
      <p>On the positive side, Arizona was spared the lengthy employment recession that the rest of the country experienced. Arizona employment growth turned positive after only 10 months of decline, compared to 30 months of decline for the nation as a whole. Retail sales have also recently accelerated. As of February, the latest data available, statewide retail sales were up 9.5 percent over the previous year. </p>
      <p>"Housing, which is probably peaking right now, has been incredibly strong," Pollack reports. "The wild card in the housing market is the extent interest rates rise during the next year or two. Interest rates are closely tied to inflation. Recent activity in the financial markets is pointing to steadily rising mortgage rates in the near future. However, even if rates increase a couple hundred basis points from the recent trough, a 7.5 percent 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is still attractive by historical standards." </p>
      <p>Pollack says the Blue Chip panel expects population to grow by nearly 3 percent in 2004, personal income by nearly 7 percent, and retail sales by 6 percent. All categories, with the exception of housing, are expected to grow even more rapidly in 2005. </p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the <em>Arizona Blue Chip</em>, Editor Tracy Clark surveyed the panel members on their assessment of risk factors for consumer spending in the months ahead. Consumer debt buildup was the only risk factor sharing a top spot on the list for two years in a row. A loss of consumer confidence also was a contender on the list, but didn't rank as high as last year. </p>
      <p>"It is clear that the panel members believe interest rates will be rising over the next year, but apparently they don't believe this will significantly slow consumer spending," says Clark. " Oil prices are also a concern because higher oil prices mean consumers have less to spend on other goods. Oil price increases can also filter from firms down to consumers, because cost increases that impact competitors equally are more likely to be passed along. </p>
      <p>Clark added, "Inflation is indeed likely to increase from the unusually low levels of the past year or so, but it is unlikely that the Consumer Price Index will rise more than 3 percent in the next 12 months." </p>

It is published by the Bank One Economic Outlook Center, an affiliate of the L. William Seidman Research Institute in the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.
