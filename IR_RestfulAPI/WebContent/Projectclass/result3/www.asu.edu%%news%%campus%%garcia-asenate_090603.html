      <h2>Garcia, Academic Assembly prepare for busy year ahead</h2>
      <p> As students settle in for another exciting school year, ASU&#146;s Academic 
        Senate is moving forward with its efforts to identify and address matters 
        involving faculty and academic affairs.</p>
      <p>Antonio Garcia, who was elected last year to lead the group&#146;s efforts, 
        says this year&#146;s agenda is filled with new projects and challenges.</p>
      <p>&#147;The plus/minus grading system was intensely discussed last year 
        in the Academic Senate meetings, especially during the spring semester,&#148; 
        says Garcia, associate professor of bioengineering. &#147;As a natural 
        extension, I believe that we will continue the discussion early in the 
        fall semester as the details surrounding the implementation of the new 
        grading system are worked out. </p>
      <p>&#147;I also plan to bring to the table a variety of items that can engage 
        faculty and bring vibrant discussion on the direction ASU is moving toward,&#148; 
        Garcia adds. &#147;We will be discussing a variety of items such as the 
        University Design Team report, the Tenure and Promotion Task Force II 
        report, and ASU employee compensation and benefits. There will not be 
        a shortage of important items for faculty input and engagement.&#148;</p>
      <p>ASU&#146;s Academic Senate is the representative body of the Academic 
        Assembly, which consists of all tenure track faculty, academic professionals 
        and full-time lecturers and senior lecturers with three-year appointments 
        in the university. Garcia, who will serve as president this year, says 
        the group plans to discuss and make recommendations on how to provide 
        better service to students.</p>
      <p>&#147;I feel the most important topic that will permeate our discussions 
        will be access and quality,&#148; he says. &#147;While major investments 
        have been pledged to help make ASU a dynamic force for learning and discovery, 
        we need many more resources to expand access for students while enhancing 
        the quality of all aspects of ASU&#146;s mission. We cannot let programs 
        erode by allowing high quality faculty, staff and administrators to leave 
        because they do not have the resources to be the best at what they set 
        out to be.&#148;</p>
      <p>Many concerned ASU faculty and administrators have worked hard to ensure 
        that the university&#146;s population reflects the state&#146;s demographics. 
        ASU&#146;s enrolled student demographics currently do not reflect the 
        state&#146;s demographics, Garcia says, but the university has been moving 
        the student graduation demographics toward the state&#146;s percentiles.</p>
      <p>Garcia says in the past 11 years, there has been a 146 percent increase 
        in the number of degrees granted to Latino students at ASU while the increase 
        in all degrees has been 43 percent. Similarly, increases above the overall 
        degrees-granted rate for African-Americans (92 percent), American Indians 
        (156 percent) and Asian Americans (106 percent) have been realized. Garcia 
        believes degrees granted is the best bottom line to track improvements 
        in serving students. </p>
      <p>&#147;Our percentage increases reflect an acceleration in the overall 
        effort to serve them,&#148; Garcia says. &#147;However, given the demographics 
        in our state, we should have a more representative student body. I feel 
        that the academic community and administrators are responding to the challenge 
        of meeting this need. Also, by necessity we must be even more responsive 
        to this issue since the demographics in our K-12 school system are changing 
        rapidly.&#148;</p>
      <p>Since arriving at ASU from Eastman Kodak&#146;s Life Science Research 
        Laboratories in 1989, Garcia has seen ASU go through many significant 
        changes such as becoming a Research I University; transitioning from an 
        inverted undergraduate student pyramid to a strong first-year student 
        base approaching 7,000 enrolled freshmen; the emergence of the East and 
        West campuses; and the recent recognition of ASU as an important investment 
        by state and business leaders.</p>
      <p>&#147;Among these changes, one thing that has not changed is the collegial 
        atmosphere we enjoy,&#148; Garcia says. &#147;My experience at ASU, as 
        compared to other universities, is that the academic community works well 
        on scholarly activities and student outreach in a collaborative way across 
        the university.&#148;<br>
