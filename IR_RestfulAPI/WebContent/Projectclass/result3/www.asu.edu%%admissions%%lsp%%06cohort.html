In high school, I was very involved with my school?s Academic Decathlon team as its president. I was also a member of Volunteerism is Pride and National Honor Society, both of which heavily focused on community service. Throughout my life, I have had a passion for education, and in the past few years it has turned into a passion to bring education to those who struggle with learning. To this end, I tutor English Language Learning students as well as other students in subjects like mathematics and English, I volunteer at Casa de la Misericordia (House of Mercy) in Mexico by helping build and paint classrooms, and I help at places like Child Crisis Center, UMOM, and the Boys and Girls Club by tutoring and playing games with children. I am so excited to start college at ASU?I?ve been waiting my whole life to be a Sun Devil! I plan to major in mathematics and economics and possibly minor in Spanish, but I really have no idea what I want to ?be when I grow up.? All I know is that I?m thrilled to be part of LSP and can?t wait to get closer to everybody involved in this program! </font></td>

My name?s Clarissa Andorfer Lopez. I am a Tempe native, and a recent graduate from local high school Marcos de Niza. In my time there I was involved in a lot of things like everyone else. Some of my favorites were sports, (I played volleyball, basketball and softball), Key Club, We the People and orchestra. Being so busy allowed me to thrive as an individual and, I admit, I loved the pressure and challenges of managing my time well. I basically am a fun, outgoing, down-to-earth person with a love for life. I like to be involved and interact with different people while making new interests and new friends. I like to spend my time hanging with my buddies, listening to music (anything that has a good beat), laughing ?til I cry, dancing, and doing anything active like sand volleyball or rock climbing. I also spend a lot of time with my huge family, especially my crazy sisters. I am so excited for college at ASU and LSP and I hope I can make an impact on whatever or whoever I come across. I plan to major in pre-med and become a general surgeon. I can?t wait too meet my new family and fellow LSPers, so don?t be afraid to holla at me. Go get ?em Devils!</font></td>

Arizona sunsets, painting, running, a good book, and coffee are a few of the things that I love. I am currently a lifeguard, loving the sun and the water, and am giving swim lessons to some of the most adorable kids. As for the future, I?m not sure. I have a direction, but I will trust God to alter my steps when need be. For now, I?m planning to pursue medicine and engineering, with the hopes of perhaps combining them. I am excited to be a Sun Devil and part of LSP. I can't wait to meet all of you in the fall and share the experiences that I know will be waiting for us at ASU! </font></td>

That is all you really must know about me, as it is the glue that holds my personality together. It encumbers every facet of my life. I have my red hair and it has me. Now, you may ask, ?What if you were to lose your hair? What if you were to be involved in a freak hair dye accident and every strand was to be turned into a repulsive Brussels sprout green?? Stereotypes aside, being a red head is unique to each person who possesses it. It runs deeper into the very marrow and in doing so, I would inherently retain my confidence and ingenuity, and with that ingenuity I would move on and travel the world, mentoring young redheads who were involved in a similar freak hair dye accident. (I would like to make a note that the above paragraph is fictional and, frankly, completely absurd. But, if there is one bit of wisdom that has proven true, it is that one must never, ever take himself/herself too seriously. But seriously, I am a graduate of Chino Valley High School. I am ever in awe to be attending Arizona State University and to be part of the Leadership Scholarship Program. I am so excited to be part of both legacies. I am proud of ASU and LSP and maybe, just maybe, they can be proud of me. Me and my red hair!)

I am a graduate of Agua Fria Union High School in Avondale, Arizona. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. During my freshman year of high school I moved to Arizona, where I was thrown into a completely new culture and way of life. I was able to grow and learn, and I have come to love it here. During high school, I was involved in the Avondale Youth Advisory Commission, where I was the Vice-Chair. There I was able to learn how a city functions, and represent my peers in the city. I was also the Vice President of the National Honor Society, and the Treasurer of the Interact and Key Club. I played varsity badminton and varsity tennis all throughout high school. I also took a nursing assistant class during my senior year of high school at the community college, where I was able to learn how to care for patients and become a CNA. As this new chapter of my life opens up, I am very honored to be part of ASU and the LSP program, and I just can't wait until school starts. See you there!</font></td>

I graduated from St. Johns High School where I was involved with the dance team, Academic Decathlon team, soccer team, drama club, solar car team, and student government. I was the Junior Class President and the Senior Class Vice President. I have enjoyed working in student government and serving my class and school. Outside of school I have been involved in dance. For the past year and a half I have been teaching dance classes to three-to-seven-year-olds at a private dance studio. It has been a difficult, but fun year. I plan to be studying business management at ASU and later opening my own business. I love to meet new people and be involved in my community. I am so excited to be part of LSP!</font></td>

I was born and raised in northwest Indiana. I live very near to Chicago and love big cities. I plan to double major in marketing and accounting. I hope to one day become a tax attorney, because everyone loves tax collectors. I was very involved with Key Club in high school and even became an international trustee. I did several other clubs in high school. I also love hanging out with friends, skateboarding, and listening to music. I'm a very easy-going and fun-loving kid and have a passion for trying new things. The chance to pick up everything and go far, far way for college is something I dove right into. I look forward to making new friends and learning what I can from this program. I can't wait to see all of you at ASU. </font></td>

My long-term goal is to eventually become a federal judge. I am positive I will reach all my goals in life and I know with my great work ethic and determination there is nothing but success waiting for me.

I also played on the varsity teams for basketball, volleyball, and track, hung out with friends, and enjoyed myself as much as possible. School has always been my number one priority, and I hope to do well in the Barrett Honors College at ASU. 

My passion has always been sports and conditioning, so I am looking toward majoring in business as a foundation for having my own sports medicine clinic. I?m a real people person and am excited to get to know all my LSP cohorts!

I recently graduated from Nogales High School in Nogales, Arizona. I contribute my leadership qualities and my overall personality to the different activities that I indulged in during my high school career. I was involved in different extra-curricular activities such as Link Crew, Student Council, and National Honor Society. During my high school career, I also had the honor of being one of 11 International Baccalaureate Diploma candidates. In the future, I hope to attend medical school and become a doctor. Therefore, I have decided to major in biology and society and become a pre-med student at ASU. My ambition to work in the health field and to become a leader to my fellow peers and community is something that I would like to bring to Arizona State University. By participating in the Leadership Scholarship Program and as a Gates Millennium Scholar, I hope to be able to become a leader at ASU. As of right now I have three major goals in mind for when I start my education at ASU; to be involved in as many things as possible, to graduate with honors, and to get accepted into medical school. I look forward to my next four years as an LSP member and all the wonderful things that this university and program has in store for me. </font></td>

Ultimately, I plan to be either a college professor or a high school principal, but I?m not sure about which yet.

With ASU on my mind, I cannot wait for college to begin. I was accepted into the Barrett Honors College and the W. P. Carey School of Business where I plan to major in business marketing. I am so excited for everything that ASU has to offer and LSP seems to be the cherry on top of it all. I can?t wait to meet all of my fellow LSP cohorts and alumni and to get this whole college experience going! See you all soon!</font></td>

Throughout high school, I was involved in many clubs and sports, and I graduated as valedictorian of the best senior class there ever was. I have been playing baseball for longer than I can remember and I love the game, even though my team?s win record this year was a disgrace. I love to snowboard, wakeboard, and surf, and I am always up for a thrill. At ASU, I plan to major in business management and accounting.
