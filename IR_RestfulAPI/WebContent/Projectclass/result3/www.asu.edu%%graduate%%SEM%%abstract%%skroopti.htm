J.

These issues include p-type doping of ZnSe and related materials, and the growth of novel materials for use in separate confinement heterostructure lasers. First, we describe the use of low temperature photoluminescence and related techniques to characterize a number of acceptors and other impurities in ZnSe, including Li, N, As, P, O, C, and two as-yet unidentified shallow acceptor species. Second, we discuss the characterization of pseudomorphic zinc blende MnS grown on ZnSe buffer layers on GaAs by molecular beam epitaxy, which is a binary end point of a new quaternary alloy system (Zn<sub>l-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>S<sub>y</sub>Se<sub>l-y</sub>) that can be lattice matched to GaAs and provide a wide range of energy gaps from about 2.7 to 3.7 eV. Luminescence is shown to be useful in characterizing the crystal habit, defects, and anti-ferromagnetic ordering of the MnS, and is employed to assess the type IIA band offsets in ZnSe/MnS superlattices.<p><i>submitted to J.
