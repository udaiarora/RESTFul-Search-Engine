      <h2>Setting an example for faculty excellence:<br>
        President Crow recognizes four newly-tenured exemplars</h2>
      <p>Some people manage to do it all. Many on the ASU faculty amaze us with 
        their keen intellect, yet they also are talented teachers and producers 
        of high quality research and outstanding service who lift the standards 
        for the entire faculty.</p>
      <p>President Michael Crow has recognized four &#147;rising stars&#148; whose 
        prodigious talents and hard work are helping ASU become the New American 
        University. They are exemplars, among this year&#146;s newly-tenured faculty, 
        of the finest teacher-scholars at ASU.</p>
      <p>&#147;ASU has some of the most talented, productive faculty in the country, 
        many of whom have been at the university for many years,&#148; says Crow. 
        &#147;These four individuals have made amazing contributions in a short 
        span of time, in persuasive and original scholarship and inspired teaching. 
      </p>
      <p> &#147;There are many other accomplished, high performing faculty among 
        the newly-tenured professors. These four exemplify the high standards 
        that will raise ASU to the next level of excellence.&#148;</p>
      <p>Ileana Orlich, associate professor of Romanian, has single-handedly created 
        the Romanian program at ASU. With its language and culture courses at 
        all levels, a summer program in Romania and five other countries, and 
        participation of students from all over the United States, the program 
        has made ASU a highly visible presence in central Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>Orlich has published four books and 16 scholarly essays, translated four 
        volumes of poetry, and has made 35 presentations on Romanian and western 
        literature in recent years. She is president of the Romanian Studies Association 
        of America and a member of the American Romanian Academy. She also has 
        won the Associated Students of ASU Centennial Professor Award for her 
        teaching.</p>
      <p>&#147;Orlich&#146;s research and teaching not only contribute impressively 
        to ASU&#146;s linkages to the global community, but also establish a new 
        knowledge base for our students,&#148; says Nancy Gutierrez, vice provost 
        and former associate dean in the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences. 
        &#147;She is more than a teacher and scholar &#151; she is an ambassador 
        creating a vital bridge between Romanian and American culture.&#148;</p>
      <p>Kimberly Updegraff, associate professor of family &amp; human development, 
        has earned the respect of colleagues across the country with her research 
        on the effect of family interactions upon adolescent social development 
        and peer experiences. Her work considers the role of gender, ethnicity 
        and culture in adolescents&#146; family interactions and peer relationships.</p>
      <p>&#147;Because of its more accurate reflection of family dynamics in a 
        multicultural society, policy makers are likely to find her research an 
        effective model upon which to create or revise economic and social programs,&#148; 
        says Richard Fabes, chair of the Family &amp; Human Development. &#147;Updegraff 
        has emerged as a leader in a field whose knowledge creation is critical 
        to the stability and vitality of our society.&#148;<br>
        Updegraff has made 44 refereed national presentations and published 19 
        refereed articles and two chapters. She was nominated last year for the 
        Dean&#146;s Distinguished Teaching Award in the College of Liberal Arts 
        &amp; Sciences.</p>
      <p>Nora Annesley Taylor, associate professor of interdisciplinary humanities 
        and coordinator of the program&#146;s concentration in Asian studies and 
        humanities, is an art historian whose scholarship has taken a radical 
        departure from the traditional perspective of her field. Through numerous 
        articles, exhibition catalogues and edited volumes, she has argued that 
        an active community of artists in Vietnam has played an active role in 
        the economic, political and social transformation of that country.<br>
        &#147;The persuasiveness of her scholarship, which is interdisciplinary, 
        has caused her professional colleagues across the globe to recognize her 
        as re-inventing her field of study,&#148; says Vice Provost Gutierrez. 
        &#147;Further, she has challenged her students on both the undergraduate 
        and graduate levels to look at the world from multidisciplinary and multicultural 
        perspectives.&#148;</p>
      <p>Taylor is serving a three-year term as chair of the Vietnam Studies Group 
        for the national Association for Asian Studies. Because of her expertise, 
        she has been invited to present 26 lectures and 14 conference papers around 
        the world. </p>
      <p>Nikhilesh Chawla, associate professor of chemical and materials engineering, 
        is a highly respected teacher who was a finalist for two teaching awards 
        last year, the Professor of the Year by the ASU Parents&#146; Association 
        and the Teaching Excellence Award by the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering. 
        He has had 13 sponsored research projects and one patent since coming 
        to ASU in 2000, and has had 60 publications and made 107 presentations 
        thus far in his career. </p>
      <p>&#147;Chawla&#146;s performance at ASU has been stellar,&#148; says Subhash 
        Mahajan, chair of the Chemical &amp; Materials Engineering Department. 
        &#147;His ability to identify the right goals, and to pursue them in a 
        diligent fashion, sets him apart from others. His combination of vision 
        and discipline are marks of someone with a great future.&#148;</p>
      <p>These exemplary faculty have received an extra salary increase in addition 
        to the promotion adjustment, and in some cases have received a commitment 
        for additional teaching or research assistance.</p>
