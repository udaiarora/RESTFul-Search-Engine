<H2>Warm Starts</H2>
<A NAME="idxnet1428">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet1429">&#13;</A>Using a warm start can increase the overall
speed of PROC NETFLOW when it is used repetitively on
problems with similar structure.
It is most beneficial when a solution of a previous optimization
is close to the optimum of the same
network with some of its parameters, for example, arc costs,
changed.
Whether a problem is changed or not,
a nonoptimal solution resulting from a previous optimization can be
used to
restart optimization, thereby saving PROC NETFLOW from having to repeat
work to reach the warm start already available.
<P>Time also is saved in the data
structure initialization part of the NETFLOW procedure's execution.
Information about the previous optimal solution, particularly
concerning the size of the problem, a
description of the basis spanning tree structure, and what is basic
in constraint rows, is known.
Information about
which nonbasic arcs have capacity flow and which nonbasic nonarc variables 
are at their respective upper bounds also
makes up part of the warm start.
The procedure can place arc data into the internal arc length arrays in
precisely defined locations, in order of ascending head node
internal number.
It is not necessary to have
multiple passes through the data because literals such as node, 
nonarc variable, arc, constraint, and special row names
are defined and meaning is attached to each.
This saves a considerable amount of memory as well.
None of the pre-optimization feasibility checks need be
repeated.
<P>Warm starts also are useful if you want to determine
the effect of arcs being closed to
carrying flow.
The costs of these arcs are set high enough to ensure
that the next optimal solution never has flow through them.
Similarly, the effect of opening arcs can be determined
by changing the cost of such arcs from an extreme to a reasonable value.
<P>Specify the <A HREF="sect30.htm#netflowfuture1">FUTURE1</A> or <A HREF="sect30.htm#netflowfuture2">FUTURE2</A> option to ensure that
additional data about a solution to be used as
a warm start are output to output data sets.

Only cost list variable values in the <A HREF="sect15.htm#netflowconout">CONOUT</A>= data set can
be changed before the solution

<P>If a Primal Simplex

<A NAME="idxnet1450">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet1451">&#13;</A>You never need to alter the

time they are generated and when they are used as a warm start.

<A HREF="sect15.htm#netflownodedata">DUALIN</A>= data set were used with an <A HREF="sect15.htm#netflowarcdata">ARCDATA</A>= data set of
a different solution.
<P>It is possible, and often useful, to specify <A HREF="sect15.htm#netflowwarm">WARM</A> and either <A HREF="sect30.htm#netflowfuture1">FUTURE1</A>
or <A HREF="sect30.htm#netflowfuture2">FUTURE2</A>, or both, in the same 
<A HREF="sect15.htm#netflownetflow">PROC NETFLOW</A> statement
if a new warm start is to be generated from the present warm start.
<P>The extent of the changes allowed to a Primal Simplex warm start
between the time it is generated and when it is
used depends on whether
the warm start describes an unconstrained or constrained solution.
The following list describes
parts of a constrained or
an unconstrained warm start that can be altered:
<P><UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="sect20.htm#netflowcost">COST</A> list variable values
<A NAME="idxnet1426">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet1427">&#13;</A><LI>
the value of an arc's capacity,
as long as
the new capacity value is not less than the lower flow bound or
the flow through the arc
<LI>
any nonarc variable information, in an unconstrained warm start
<LI>
for an unconstrained warm start, any side constraint data
</UL>
<P>The changes that can be made in constraint data 
for a constrained warm start are more
restrictive than those for an unconstrained warm start.
The lhs coefficients type, and
rhs value of a constraint can be changed
as long as that constraint's slack, surplus, or artificial
variable is basic. The constraint name cannot be changed.
<P><H3><I>Example of a Warm Start</I></H3>
The following sample SAS session demonstrates how
the warm start facilities
are used to obtain optimal solutions to an unconstrained
network where some arc cost changes occur or optimization is
halted before the optimum is found.
<PRE>
                  /* data already in data sets node0 and arc0 */
   proc netflow
        nodedata=node0  /* if supply_demand information  */
                        /* is in this SAS data set       */
        arcdata=arc0;
                  /* variable list specifications go here    */
                  /* assume that they are not necessary here */
                  /* if they are, they must be included in   */
                  /* all the PROC NETFLOW calls that follow  */
      reset
         future1
         nodeout=node2  /* nodeout and arcout are necessary  */
                        /* when FUTURE1 is used              */
         arcout=arc1;
   proc print
         data=arc1;     /* display the optimal solution      */
   proc fsedit
         data=arc1;     /* change some arc costs             */
   data arc2;
      reset arc1;
         oldflow=_flow_;
         oldfc=_fcost_;
                  /* make duplicates of the flow and flowcost*/
                  /* variables. If a id list was explicitly  */
                  /* specified, add oldflow and oldfc to this*/
                  /* list so that they appear in subsequently*/
                  /* created arcout= data sets               */
</PRE>

<P>The following PROC NETFLOW uses the warm start created previously, performs
250 stage 2 iterations and saves that solution, which (as future1 and
arcout= data set and nodeout= data set are specified) can be used 
as a warm start in another PROC NETFLOW run.
<PRE>
   proc netflow
        warm
        nodedata=node2
        arcdata=arc2;
      reset
        maxit1=250
        future1;
      run;
      save
        nodeout=savelib.node3
        arcout=savelib.arc3;
               /* optimization halted because 250 iterations */
               /* were performed to resume optimization,     */
               /* possibly in another session (the output    */
               /* data sets were saved in a SAS library      */
               /* called savelib)                            */
</PRE>

<P>Using the latest warm start, PROC NETFLOW is re-envoked to find the 
optimal solution.
<PRE>
   proc netflow
        warm
        nodedata=savelib.node3
        arcdata=savelib.arc3;
      reset
        future1
        nodeout=node4
        arcout=arc4;
   run;
</PRE>

<P>If this problem has constraints with data in a data set called
CON0, then in each of the previous PROC NETFLOW statements, specify
CONDATA=CON0.
Between PROC NETFLOW runs, you can change constraint data.
In each of the RESET statements,
you could specify the <A HREF="sect15.htm#netflowconout">CONOUT</A>= data set
to save the last (possibly optimal) solution reached by the optimizer
if it reaches stage 2.
You could specify FUTURE2 and the DUALOUT= data set 
to generate a constrained warm start.
<PRE>
   proc netflow
        warm
        nodedata=node4
        arcdata=arc4
        condata=con0;
      reset
        maxit2=125 /* optional, here as a reason why         */
                   /* optimum will not be obtained           */
        scratch    /* optional, but warm start might be good */
                   /* enough to start stage 2 optimization   */
        future2
      run;
        /* optimization halted after 125 stage 2 iterations  */
      save dualout=dual1 conout=conout1;
</PRE>

<P>Stage 2 optimization halted before optimum was reached. 
Now you can make cost and nonarc variable objective function 
coefficient changes. Then to restart optimization, use
<PRE>
   proc netflow
        warm
        condata=con0 
              /* NB. NETFLOW reads constraint data only     */
        dualin=dual1
        arcdata=con1;
      reset
        future2
        dualout=dual2
        conout=con2;
      run;
</PRE>
