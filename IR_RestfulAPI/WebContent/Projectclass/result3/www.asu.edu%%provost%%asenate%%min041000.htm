<p><b>1. Call to Order.</b>

<p>The meeting was called to order at 3:20 p.m. by Senate President-elect,

Doug Johnson.

<p><b>2. Acceptance of Previous Minutes of March 20, 2000.</b>

<p>The minutes of March 20, 2000 were approved by voice vote as published

on the Academic Senate web site and distributed by email. If there are

further editorial corrections, please contact Darby Shaw at the Senate

office (965-9245vm).

<p><b>3. Announcements and Communications.</b>

<p><b>3.A. Senate President's Report</b> (Doug Johnson for David Burstein).

<p>Dr. Johnson introduced himself and announced that Dr. Burstein was absent

due to illness.

<p>The Whistleblower Bill, Senate Bill 1512, was defeated; it was a sensitive

bill for the university because it included the universities in with other

state agencies and clouded the role of the Board of Regents in this process.

We were pleased that SB 1512 was defeated; we may see another version of

that

bill again at some future date. It will remain on our agenda as well.

<p><b>3.B University Provost's Report </b>(Milton Glick).

<p>Several members of this body have raised the issue of support for graduate

students. It has concerned many of us; the lack of waivers for the resident

part of tuition and the lack of health insurance for our graduate students.

The Dean of the Graduate School, Bianca Bernstein, has been a strong advocate

on this issue and she has been putting together resources to allow us to

cover the single person health insurance for teaching assistants who are

on state funds. She has agreed to cover that amount for three years. During

that three years, we would be looking for other resources to backstop.

We would have to tell the colleges that if there were no other resources

that it would then be their responsibility to reallocate internally. That

would put us in a better position to recruit graduate students but equally

important, it is the moral thing to do. I wanted to pay special tribute

to Bianca for the identification of those resources.

<p>On grant funded research assistants, the Vice Provost for Research,

John Fink, has agreed to cover those insurance benefits for grant funded

research assistants for the first year and then continue on until we can

move them into the grants, because once you fill that in for ALL TAs and

RAs, the granting agencies will pay those benefits. Obviously, that leaves

some RAs and TAs as a responsibility of their colleges (if they cannot

be ultimately moved into grants). Still this is very encouraging news.

<p>Downtown at the legislature, I regret to have to tell you that the one

percent additional increment for salaries never even got a hearing on the

floor. In the next few weeks, you will be informed of your increase for

this year and it will be retroactive to April 1.

<p>We think we have a compromise on the issue of the Intellectual Property

Bill. The President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, and the Majority

Leader, introduced legislation that would have essentially overridden the

Intellectual Property Policy of the university and the Board of Regents.

After all expenses are paid under the IP Policy, we have to split the royalties

1/3 to the Vice Provost for Research, 1/3 to the inventor, and 1/3 to the

inventor's laboratory. For one part of the university, it was proposed

in the new legislation that the revenues not be used at all to offset expenses,

and that all of the inventor is to considered "laboratory," which would

have essentially made it impossible to do technology transfer in that area,

because there had been no revenue stream to support it. We think a compromise

is possible if it will keep the Intellectual Property Policy intact.

<p>The legislature voted to fund a lease purchase for a new facility at

ASU West and for infrastructure upgrades at ASU East. That item was vetoed

down by the Governor last week. We do not know at this point whether there

will be an effort to override or not. We certainly do not intend to lead

such an effort. The Governor's initiative could be very important to us.

It is for a six-tenths of a penny sales tax increase which would be used

to fund education. Ultimately, of the total sales tax revenues that were

generated, 5% will go to the community colleges and 15% will go to the

universities. This year that would have meant another 57 million dollars

for the three universities. The question now is will the Governor be able

to get that on the ballot and through the legislature. There is considerable

talk about moving it through the initiative process. That would likely

be in special session, as will the discussion of what will be done with

the tobacco revenue.

<p>The school facilities board will make their report within the next two

weeks on what the overall cost of bringing the schools up to standards

are. The numbers we hear are from 800 million to 1.4 billion and that compares

with the 300 million that was estimated when the legislature passed the

bill originally. That is one of the reasons that these other initiatives

are so important.

<p>The Higher Education Task Force made a recommendation (backed by Regent

Don Ulrich) that for all students that directly enroll in a community college

for their first two years, they would receive free tuition. One of the

problems is that an increase in tuition waivers costs us a loss of tuition

revenue, but more importantly, you have essentially picked up a large number

of tuition vouchers and there is little evidence that the we will actually

change the college wide habits. We have aimed for an approach that picks

up at least the equivalent of the community college tuition in a voucher,

either to be used at the universities or for the community college, or

if there is a private sector to encourage that set of students who might

otherwise not pick a college to do so. Personally, what I would see for

the students is to make that voucher a higher dollar value so that the

students will have to work less (outside the university). One of the major

reasons that the students coming from low-income groups are not as successful

as we would want them to be is because many are working 40 hours a week.

The other item on the agenda for the Higher Education Task Force is that

of investing in long term economic development through supporting research

at the universities. That idea seems to be getting a positive hearing at

the legislature. All of the discussions at the Higher Education Task Force

have started taking on greater interest since the Governor has announced

this initiative, because before that initiative there was common belief

that this would be one more hollow exercise. There is really some money

to invest now and it has become a more significant issue.

<p>Senator Landers: It appears from the newspapers that the Governor's

objection to the lease purchase arrangement was the way of financing it.

She is making it sound like she had warned people that she would not approve

that in the first place. Do we have some other plans down the line or are

we just hoping that they override her veto?

<p>Provost Glick: First off, we will not request an override. Make that

clear; it is one thing to support a bill that the Governor does not want,

and it is quite another thing to support an override. I think it will be

back on the table next year. It is part of the Governor's initiative. I

think she does not want to make decisions that are very cheap, without

first finding a continuing revenue source. We have lots of proposals that

are starting to bubble up. There are two items that caused her veto--a

revenue commitment without a revenue stream to back it up. The second is

that Arizona's personal chemistry among the executive and legislative branch.

Some of you here have written the book about that!

<p>Senate President-elect Johnson: I want to add my congratulations to

Dean Bernstein for developing a plan to support health insurance for graduate

students. I hope that those of you who are out there recruiting graduate

students can use this as a sweetner to close the deal on some outstanding

graduate students who might not come otherwise. It certainly is a step

in the right direction and the right thing for us to be doing. Milt's description

of the political environment is fascinating. Observing the legislature

this year has been very interesting. I would like to say I have learned

something in the process of doing that, but I still am amazed. I will need

your help in the next year in thinking about how the faculty can have an

important voice in some of these decisions. We are used to watching at

a comfortable distance the decisions made at the legislature, but we may

have to be involved in carrying a petition for signatures and in other

ways be active in the coming year. The budget is going to be a very difficult

one to settle next year. If you want to be involved or know of some way

we should approach that, we would certainly like to hear from you.

<p><b>3.C ASASU President </b>(Jenny Holsman).

<p>I would also like to praise Dean Bernstein, thank you very much on behalf

of the graduate students.

<p>One good piece of news is that the Student Regent Bill was passed and

signed into law. Next year, two students will serve on the Board of Regents

for two-year terms.

<p>We had a successful Carnival del Diablo last week. The activity was

held on Hayden and Suaharo lawns and it was well attended by students.

We had a great speaker and we had a lot of sprit.

<p>The tuition was set at the Board of Regents meeting and for instate

students it worked out very well. For out of state students, it is probably

inevitable that students will begin paying 100% of their college education.

<p>Our Insuring Tomorrow program was held on April 1 in Gammage Auditorium,

and Jack Kemp was our speaker. Everyone that attended learned something

and we will plan an even better event for next year.

<p>Teacher evaluations will be distributed in the next two weeks. Please

encourage everyone to fill them out and return them.

<p>Senator Landers: I have read in the <i>State Press</i> that you want

to work with the State legislature and it sounded as if you are also trying

to keep the tuition levels down so that tuition doesn't increase. My point

is that a lot of the reason tuition has to increase every year is because

we are not getting the funding from the legislature that they should be

giving us. I am wondering if that pitch is being made by the students to

get more money up front from the legislature, so we don't have to increase

student by as much.

<p>Jenny Holsman: I think the students have definitely agreed on that.

We have all generally talked about it. We have been told that in order

to keep the tuition dollars low by the Arizona Board of Regents, we needed

to work with the legislature in getting them to appropriate more funds

because currently they are appropriating less than 2% of their biennial

budget to higher education in the state.

<p>I would like to introduce Alex Bainbridge who will be our ASASU student

body president next year.

<p><b>3.D ASU West Senate Report</b> (Rick Knopf).

<p>We have been reviewing the recommendations of the Technology Policy

Advisory Committee. There was concern that there was no commentary in the

recommended policy specifying provisions of fair use, consequences of policy

violation, and due process. The gist of it is under what conditions can

someone (other than yourself) have access to the information which you

have been building (databases, programs, etc.) and what are the consequences

of policy violation.

<p>We have looked at the Intellectual Property Implementation Policy that

was recommended and we felt there was not enough nourishment surrounding

copyrights and trademarks, most of the commentary dealt with patents. We

also had a subcommittee looking at those issues.

<p>Last month we focused on internal promotion and tenure enhancements.

One of the things that might be of interest to you is concern on behalf

of the faculty of what might happen, what rights do faculty have if they

feel that something is going askew in the process, once it gets to the

deans office and moves up to the Provost office. Should a faculty member

have the right based on a briefing by the Dean, to include some reservations

into the evaluation that then goes to the Provost. This issue has opened

up a whole lot of questions as to what information faculty should have

access to; can all the records be opened up? There is a conversation going

on with the General Counsel right now.

<p>We are going up for a sight visit with North Central accreditation in

May.

<p><b>3.E ASU East Senate Report</b> (Andy Jackson).

<p>The bill to fund improvements at ASU East and West was vetoed. To give

you an idea of how that affected East Campus, had the bill been approved,

we could have begun initial planning and construction and those new requirements

would not have been felt for 18 months to two years in the future. We currently

have about 1500 full-time students, projected for 2000 in the fall for

next year, and 3000 the following fall. It is a critical time frame for

us, and it is distressing to hear that the Governor has vetoed it at this

point, even though it went through the house, the senate and back to the

house. We are very concerned about that. I was at the Board of Regents

meeting a week ago and as Jenny told us, there was a compromise struck

on tuition between the Board of Regents and the student coalition. I also

want to point out that Regent Amos stated that this was a one-time opportunity

to keep the tuition low. The next time the tuition may have to be raised

significantly to keep the university healthy. My expectation looking down

the road is that the level of instate tuition this year is probably the

last time we will see such a low increase. I also felt the Board was frustrated

at the legislature for not funding the universities at the appropriate

level. The Governor seems to have put a lot of her emphasis on the proposed

tax increase (6 tenths of one percent sales tax increase) thinking that

will make the entire system healthy. Part of the reason for vetoing the

bill for improvements at East and West was that she was waiting for an

output from the Governor's Task Force on Higher Education, as to how those

monies should be spent. Jerry Hogle who is the President of the Arizona

Faculties Council said that the Governors Task Force has not addressed

facilities or infrastructure as part of its process to date. Whether that

will become an issue based on the Governor's veto, I am not sure. As of

this date, the task force is about 50% into their service to the state.

That is a concern for future growth and funding.

<p>We are in the process of reviewing the Technology Policy Advisory Committee's

input--we met after the comments came in from ASU West and Main, and provided

revisions to the committee for review; we expect to see a first revised

iteration from that committee within about the next two weeks. We are committed

to doing a second reading on Reading Day this year.

<p><b>4. Open Forum.</b>

<p>4.A Academic Facilities (David Techau, Director).

<p>Regarding scheduling of classrooms, the Board of Regents has urged us

this past year to utilize our classroom space more efficiently, therefore,

the university instituted an algorithm in the fall and as a consequence,

many of us found ourselves in different rooms and buildings and in many

cases, that was uncomfortable or unacceptable. Many of you have provided

input on the problems experienced with that system of scheduling. The process

continues and gets better--we schedule a long time in advance now.

<p>I want to introduce my assistant, Kathleen Tibbetts, Senior Program

Coordinator for Academic Facilities. We have spent since December of 1997

implementing the new classroom scheduling program. It was fully implemented

with the Fall 1999 schedule. The closest analogy I can draw upon for classroom

scheduling is that it is like trying to dance in a Mosh Pit. We have to

understand the complexity of what we are dealing with. There a finite number

of rooms in which we are trying to schedule classes. The program is designed

to schedule both summer sessions. We are in the process of compiling all

of the data from our Fall 1999 class schedule to present to the Board of

Regents next month, as every year we present a space utilization to the

Board of Regents, of which class scheduling is an important component.

There are approximately 5,000 course requests across the campus and we

somehow have to fit them into 300 rooms. The inventory of rooms is made

up of all different types of rooms. Most of our classrooms are clustered

into the small end (holding 30-60 students). Forty to 50% are in that size

group. As we get to the larger classrooms, as we have forces and trends

moving us to decrease the capacity of classrooms to accommodate the new

freshman, we find ourselves moving upstream to accommodate these changes.

We have 268 classrooms that are programmed into our scheduling package.

There another 45 classrooms that are departmentally controlled. Over the

years these classrooms have been assigned to different departments and

different colleges for academic use. Most of those classrooms are small

seminar rooms with 15-20 capacity, at the low range of our current inventory.

I have illustrated this information for you on a bar chart (at the request

of a senator, this chart will be posted on the Academic Senate Web Page).

<p>There are significant issues in scheduling: <u>Prime time.</u> As you

know on Friday, between the hours of 9:40 a.m.-1:40 p.m. in the afternoon

is when we have the largest number of course requests. There are five time

slots on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and if you multiply those by the

available inventory, we come up with 1340 available class times Monday,

Wednesday, and Friday. If we factor in Tuesday/Thursday 9:40 a.m.-1:40

p.m., we would have another 1072 class times that we could accommodate

requests. We currently have approximately 3,600 course requests prime time,

Monday through Friday. You can see that there is no possible way with our

current inventory that that we can accommodate all those requests during

prime time. The time slots that we have available say nothing about the

mix or match between classes and the capacity of the rooms. We are dealing

with a significant issue here. What is happening is that we are moving,

shifting, and forcing classes to move to early morning. When we try to

deal with this issue with the colleges and the departments it is very sensitive

because it deals with when it is convenient for them to teach and when

they are available to teach. When the students really want to attend classes

is in early morning, late afternoon, and evening. Faculty are expressing

discomfort with moving classes outside of the prime time schedule. It is

a critical issue. One of the only ways to address it is with a system that

can handle this level of complexity.

<p><u>Standard vs nonstandard classes.</u> With the new system, 30% of

our requests are now in nonstandard class times. As an example, one to

three-hour classes, on Monday/Wednesday that mirror Tuesday/Thursday classes.

There are all sorts of four day per week courses, that faculty want to

offer. If we begin to increase the percentage and number of those nonstandard

times, we are laying nonstandard class times on top of a standard schedule

which increases the complexity of the entire scheduling system. <u>"O"

enrolled courses</u> in Fall of 1999 created another problem in that we

had 315 courses that were scheduled to use university resources, and they

were cancelled before the 21st day of classes. We could then schedule them

for special events, but we could not reschedule them for classes during

the day.

<p>During the last six months we have received input from a lot of faculty

and from the departments on how we could make improvements on the system.

There is perceived overcrowding in classrooms. The system we have used

to project classroom usage, based on the expected enrollment in a class,

did a very good job for Fall 1999.

<p>A second issue is <u>the inconvenience of classes located outside of

home buildings</u>. One of the things we are trying NOT to do is disrupt

the communities of learning that exist across the campus. Our inventory

of rooms in buildings that support certain departments are the wrong size

for those departments sometimes. For instance, the JWS Classroom Building

houses classes that do not match the size needed for their classes. So,

what we are doing as a part of this study is when there is a good match

between courses and rooms in a building--where a home department is located--we

are moving that mix into the nearest building in a neighborhood cluster--then

taking faculty outside their home building if there is not adequate space

to accommodate their courses in the home building. Some of the problems

that arise in moving outside of a home building are: unfamiliarity, lack

of media, lack of media tools, technology in the classroom and the unreliability

of technology support. Dean Bill Lewis will be chairing a task force that

will be looking at the technology and support issues, which are really

not scheduling issues. Our goals are reduced capacities across the board,

and to relax the utilization rules in the ACA. This sytem is a multi-task

algorithm system; it is a smart system for which we must write the parameters.

It is really dependent upon us to mirror the system that exists in reality

at ASU with a complex alogrithmic system that will produce optimal scheduling.

For those departments with special needs, that have labs right next to

them, regardless what the lab's capacities are, they obviously need to

be in those rooms. We have in addition tried to improve the proofing time

of class schedules. Hopefully, with adequate time to review and get back

to us, we can then negotiate the rooms before classes begin. Those are

the major initiatives that we are trying to implement to improve the system.

<p>The benefits of using the system that we have found are that we in our

office cannot do this job manually and neither can the departments or the

Registrar's office. It is a good, smart tool for us to use. There are a

few bugs to work out still. There are a lot of homeless departments on

this campus. They do not have classrooms in their buildings, and we must

assign them classroom space. This system will level the playing field across

the campus. The flexibility to schedule more nonstandard class times is

a valuable tool for us. Those are the three primary benefits. Obviously,

standardization of media and recapitalization of media are important; right

sizing classroom assignments. We may have to subdivide rooms and make them

fit the needs of the buildings they are in. Pilot programs that we have

been involved with include working with the College of Business on teaching

more classes in BA and BAC. We are talking to Dean Krahenbuhl about teaching

classes in the Social Science Building within a few of the departments,

Sociology, Political Science, and History. Six class rooms in BA and BAC

were off line for renovation. 63% of their classes were inside the buildings

and 34% were outside the buildings. After we worked with them this past

fall, now they offer 93% of their classes inside their two buildings and

7% outside their buildings. This has taken a significant effort on the

part of the college of business. This is a very serious look at how they

can offer their courses, even some together, coordinating schedules. What

we would like to do now is work with those departments that are experiencing

some problems like having to move too far outside their home buildings.

<p>Senator Brown: Any thought about extending the school day, starting

earlier? Staying later.

<p>David Techau: I think that is happening naturally. There are certainly

more 7:40 a.m. classes than ever before. There are lot more evening courses

also.

<p>Senator Rivera: I have a situation with a large class that I teach in

the Fall. Prior to the fall schedule even being printed, I knew that I

was going to be sent way far out on campus. One of the things that I learned

today from you, the fact that a proofing period is made available on rooms

before the schedule is finalized. I had never been asked to provide any

input. Is the system so rigid that you cannot even get into a classroom

to plan until the week before classes?

<p>David Techau: No, not if you know a designee.&nbsp; We work with approximately

70 designees on campus and they show the schedule to the faculty in the

departments. This is where we get the feedback for proofing revisions.

<p>Senator Karady: There is the grand thinking -- that the Monday, Wednesday,

and Friday classes will be changed in such a way that Friday will be for

one and 1/2 hour classes. What is the trend, does this makes the situation

worse of improve it? It will not have that much effect, you are talking

about a non-standard issue.

<p>David Techau: Our Friday utilization falls way off. It is probably a

third of what it is the other four days of the week.

<p>Senate President-elect Johnson: The reality is that we just don't have

many students that want to take Friday afternoon classes. It is hard to

fill those spaces.

<p>Senator Kahn: You indicated that there are 315 classes that were cancelled

because of zero enrollment.

<p>That number is low because it only includes those courses scheduled

in the class, not in the labs.

<p>David Techau: We are concerned with the resource space that is being

utilized in the classroom because it takes away from research.

<p>Senator Dan Landers: Is there a way to cancel reservations before the

end of the 21st day? We may be sent out far from our home building, and

then later find a good space. We cannot, however, do anything until the

third week.

<p>Senate President-elect Johnson: I think that is one of the issues that

we can do as faculty, communicating with our representatives in our department,

much earlier than when we receive the information.

<p>Senator Allen: What is the procedure if you get a classroom that does

not work. Who is supposed to handle that?

<p>David Techau: If you are talking about media technology, there is a

support group in the information technology unit on this campus that is

supposed to the classrooms and the media in the classrooms on campus. If

you did not get into the right room with the right features then you must

call our office and we will reassign you to another room.

<p>Senator Allen: Does that person go to the chair of his or her department

or to some other person.

<p>David Techau: Usually it is done through your departmental designee.

<p>Senate President-elect Johnson: That person is usually the administrative

associate/assistant in the department.

<p>Senator Allen: Is this person then responsible for communicating the

problem?

<p>David Techau: That person is responsible for informing us that you are

unhappy with the media in the room, etc. We will make every attempt to

find you another room that is compatible with your course requirements.

<p>Senator Saenz: One incentive for students may be a reduced tuition if

they sign up for classes that are not offered in prime time. In advising,

you hear that students will in fact sit out a semester to get the class

they want in prime time.

<p>Senate President-elect Johnson: That is an interesting possibility,

sort of a two for one special. I know other schools that have tried similar

efforts only to find that students are not that price sensitive.

<p>David Techau: There are some campuses that actually limit the number

of courses that departments can offer.

<p>Senator Komnenich: I was curious how, in the College of Business that

they worked to get a number of their courses in their own colleges. How

does a college work to do this and who has priority?

<p>David Techau: It was an internal process; they examined their available

resources for classrooms; how many slots they had available and to make

all the departments cooperate and coordinate their schedules to use those

facilities better. They are using those spaces now with an 80% efficiency.

<p>Senator Komnenich: So, those classrooms have now become unavailable

to other classes (yes). So, the process is one of internal review, then

it would have to go through your office? (yes).

<p>Kathleen Tibbetts: The College of Business worked it all out internally

among their departments as to who got priority based upon previous enrollment,

and many other factors. They did several iterations and the Dean approved

the final schedule before we saw the request.

<p>David Techau: We have a set of priorities also on how we rate the classrooms

according to ABOR standards. Remember that we are reporting to the Board

of Regents next month on our Fall 1999 Space Utilization Report, but we

still expect an improvement of between 5-7% in efficiency of usage since

the implementation of the new system of scheduling.

<p>We are having a training session for all the designees on April 27,

Thursday. Other interested parties are invited to attend.

<p>Does everyone know who the designees are so we know who to blame?

<p>Each department will be appoint that designee. The important thing is

to have that conversation before the 21st day of the semester.

<p>Senator Landers: That would be a good thing to put on the web site because

not many faculty are aware of that. That might well be true.

<p>Senator Crawford: It seems to me that information is power, and I think

the comment made earlier about some people being a barrier--is simply a

function of the fun it is to be in power. One of the powers is not knowing

that the list is out. I was quite surprised to find out that the tentative

schedule was out four weeks before I knew it was out and I thought I was

staying on top of things. It would be helpful to put out an announcement

to the effect that we have now done a tentative plotting of rooms. That

would tell us that it is now appropriate to communicate on the schedule.

<p>Senator Burgess: Having been the chair of Economics, the chair of a

department is the one that is ultimately responsible, not the designee,

for the decisions made about scheduling. There is no way to get around

that unless there is some particular reason to make that decision is being

made by the designee.

<p>Senate President-elect Johnson: I want to thank David Techau for joining

us to today. Provost Glick is strongly in favor of using classroom space

most efficiently and effectively. Ultimately our problem is that we are

short on space, we need more classrooms, better upgrades. What the with

the Board of Regents and their push for learner-centered education, one

of the issues that we will have to deal with is that the type of spaces

that we have do not fit the classes that we are trying to provide. In the

short term we have to talk about using what we have better and in the long

term we have to create an increasing supply.

<p>We do have other business to address.

<p><b>5. Unfinished Business (Motions from Committees)(second reading).</b>

<p><b>5.A Executive Committee</b> (Doug Johnson).

<p>Revisions to the ACD Manual: 509-02, the Faculty Grievance Procedures.

This change is necessary to bring our grievance procedures in compliance

with the new Supreme Court ruling that provides for full use of attorneys

in the hearing process. This we have previously discussed with regard to

the Intellectual Property Policy. It also allows a grievant to have an

attorney available as a consult or an advocate of during the hearing. The

university would then provide the counterpart for the respondents in the

case, such as advising the committee. Are there questions about the changes

to the Faculty Grievance Procedures. Hearing no further discussion, we

will move to a vote. The revised faculty grievance procedures were approved

by voice vote (copies may be obtained by calling the Academic Senate Office

5-9245vm).

<p><b>6. New Business (Reports and motions from Senate Committees) (first

reading).</b>

<p><b>6.A Committee on Committees</b> (Brent Brown).

<p>Just a quick reminder that you will receive ballots in the mail between

April 10-12 and they should be returned by Friday, April 21, at 5:00 p.m.

The results of the election will be announced at the last Senate meeting

on May 1. We encourage you to make sure that people in your units know

that timetable and deadline. We also will have a ballot to be filled out

at the last meeting. Senators will elect new members to Senate committee

vacancies.

<p><b>6.B Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee </b>(Jack Fouquette).

<p>Information Items: Both are from the College of Education: 1) Establishment

of a concentration in the M.Ed in Curriculum and Instruction, Professional

Studies 2) Establishment of a concentration in the Ph.D. in Curriculum

and Instruction, Art Education.

<p>Action Item: <b>Senate Motion #17: A request from the College of Liberal

Arts and Sciences to establish a Graduate Certificate Program in Geographic

Information Science (GIS) (multi-disciplinary).</b>

<p><b>6.C Student Faculty Policy Committee </b>(Mike Mayer).

<p><b>Senate Resolution #1 (1999-2000) concerning the proposed ASU TransportationCode</b>.

The Senate resolution supports the new code, but the right to amend policy

language was not included. The document was not created by the Student

Faculty Policy Committee, although they worked with David Wright and members

of the Coalition for Mall Safety on the review of the recommendations in

the document. Under the new guidelines, gas and electric powered vehicles

will be prohibited on the mall, but inline skates and skateboards will

be allowed. It outlaws go-peds and other motorized vehicles that are not

ASU Property. There will be a modified use of bicycles on the malls and

around Memorial Union with a speed limit of six miles per hour imposed.

Approval of the resolution today will give the Coalition for Mall Safety

backing in implementing these new guidelines.

<p>Senate President-elect Johnson: Is there further discussion of Resolution

#1. Hearing none we will move to a vote. The resolution passed unanimously

by voice vote.

<p><b>6.D University Services and Facilities Committee </b>(Anne Kopta).

<p>On April 24, at 1:00 p.m. there will be an open hearing on the locker

room issue in Memorial Union Room 209. Vice Provost Mernoy Harrison will

attend, and the USFC hopes to provide a forum for discussion and conclusion

of this issue.

<p>Senate President-elect Johnson: This has been an issue of great concern

for some people. There are plans to demolish PE West Annex to make room

for addition to the Memorial Union and in doing so space for faculty and

staff lockers will be lost. The proposal is to replace those lockers within

the PE West Facility itself. The administration has worked to provide faculty

with a private and air conditioned space, a carpeted area and other amenities.

This hearing will provide a chance to speak on the issues. The real issue

however is the amount of money that those improvements will cost. The discussion

at the hearing will center on whether faculty will bear that cost or if

the university should bear it.

<p>Senator Saenz: Will these facilities be available to both male and female

faculty? (Yes.)

<p><b>7. Adjournment.</b>

<p>There being no further business, the meeting adjourned at 4:35 p.m.
