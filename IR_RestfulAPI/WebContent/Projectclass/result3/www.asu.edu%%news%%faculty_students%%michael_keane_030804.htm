      <h2>Yale professor becomes new Barry Goldwater Chair, organizes labor conference </h2>
      <p>Michael Keane, an economics professor at Yale and one of the foremost econometricians in the country, has begun a two-year appointment as the Barry Goldwater Chair of American Institutions at ASU. He will teach doctoral students in the Department of Economics and present public lectures. </p>
      <p>Keane also has organized a Conference on Labor Markets, in conjunction with the Barry Goldwater Chair, to be held at ASU March 19 - 20. Leading economists from around the country will present new research on the most pressing issues of labor markets, including the implications of rising wage inequality, the growth of the service sector, the impact of minimum wages on labor market outcomes and the role of early and higher education on intergenerational earnings. </p>
      <p>Among the distinguished conference participants will be James Heckman of the University of Chicago, 2000 Nobel Laureate; and two winners of the prestigious Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics, Thomas Sargent of New York University and Edward Prescott of ASU. </p>
      <p>Keane is best known for developing a probability simulator that for the first time made it practical to estimate choice models that have more than just a few alternatives. Applications are widespread. In marketing, the technique is used to estimate price sensitivities of demand in markets with many different brands. In labor it may be used to model students' choice of major in college or workers' occupational choices; in health economics it has been used to model decisions on the choice of insurance plans. </p>
      <p>Keane has published more than 40 articles in refereed journals since receiving his Ph.D. from Brown in 1990, and is the eighth ranked econometrician in number of citations. In addition to his more technical econometric work, he also has written on financial aid in higher education, the economic transition in Poland, the political economy of Congressional careers, the effect of advertising on consumer behavior, U.S.-Canada trade liberalization, equalizing race differences in school attainment, health plan choice, welfare reform, and much more. </p>
      <p>"Both Professor Keane's technical skills and his versatility in applied topics will be put to great use in developing the research skills of the Ph.D. students in the department," says Arthur Blakemore, chair of the Department of Economics. "This is a wonderful opportunity for our students to study under such an accomplished leader in econometrics research." </p>
      <p>Keane has received three major multi-year NSF grants and three multi-year NIH grants covering issues in career choice, public welfare, the dynamics of earnings and poverty, and consumer choice. He is a member of the peer review panel for the NIH and is the associate editor of <em>Econometrica, </em> one of the most prestigious journals in economics. </p>
      <p>The Barry Goldwater Chair of American Institutions was established at ASU in 1977 to honor Senator Goldwater for his exceptional service to Arizona and the nation. Holders of the chair are scholars who have distinguished themselves in the fields of political science, history, economics, law and public policy, and who uphold the principles of Americanism, individual freedom and the free enterprise system, which Goldwater espoused throughout his public career. </p>
