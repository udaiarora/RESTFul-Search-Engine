The plants drawn from nature by Henderson and engraved on wood
 by Thomas Bewick.  London: Printed for Richard Phillips
 (Printed by Richard Taylor & Co.), 1810.  With 261 wood
 engravings of various plants.  Publisher's ads [1] p. at end.
  First edition--Cf. Johnston, S. H. Cleveland coll.
  Includes index. References: Johnston, S. H. Cleveland coll. 745.
<P>
While this herbal was published later than all others featured in this collection,
 it is noteworthy because it represents Thomas Bewick's only attempt
 at botanical wood engravings.  Included are 261 woodcuts by the
 foremost woodcut artist of his day based on the originals by Peter
 Charles Henderson.  This is the first edition of these cuts by Bewick;
 the illustrations were the reason for this book's excellent sales
 record.  The text is a straightforward and useful medicinal herbal
 by Dr. Thornton, who was a physician and medical writer of
 importance in his day.  The section on Foxglove, from which
 digitalis is made, is the longest in the book.
