Adequate salaries are a prerequisite for attracting and retaining the faculty and staff needed to support these missions.  External market forces outside the control of any institution result in different minimum salaries needed to attract and retain faculty and <a href="acd002.html#academicprofessional" target="New">academic professionals</a> of comparable quality in different disciplines.  External market salaries typically reflect research and creative activities more than other institutional priorities.  But ASU at Tempe campus will reward faculty and academic professionals for all valuable institutional contributions, including those that external markets may undervalue.  Foremost among the latter are significant contributions to the teaching mission of the university.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Goals</b></font><p><b>Long-Term Goals for Salaries for ASU at Tempe Campus</b><p>ASU at Tempe campus average salaries are substantially below competitive levels.  Because the quality of the university depends primarily upon the quality of its personnel, ASU is committed to establishing and then maintaining salary structures that are competitive in the relevant markets for all personnel.<p><b>Short-Term Goals for Faculty and Academic Professional Salaries</b><p>An ongoing priority in all university budgeting decisions has been improving salaries and achieving equitable distribution of salaries within individual units by eliminating salary compression and inversion for those faculty and academic professionals who are judged to be performing at a satisfactory level or better; the highest priority in budget requests to the state legislature has been improving salaries until the following benchmarks are met:<p><ol><li>for faculty and academic professionals, at least the 50th percentile of the (overall) average salary of all ranked faculty at the combined ASU/U of A peer institutions, as reported in the annual AAUP salary surveys,<p>and</li><p><li>when the above data are not available for academic professionals, at least the average salary for comparable positions in the relevant local, regional or national market.</li></ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Evaluation and Salary Adjustment Guidelines</b></font><p>The following guidelines are used for ASU at Tempe campus performance evaluation and salary adjustments.  These guidelines permit considerable flexibility for individual units (generally departments) because of the different circumstances they may face.  Individual units have the authority and responsibility for performance evaluations and salary adjustments.  The provost, deans, and chairs are accountable for ensuring the fair and consistent application of these guidelines.<p><ol><li>Approval of written plan.  Unit plans shall include the unit&#146;s evaluation criteria, evaluation process, and salary adjustment process.  Unit plans shall be: consistent with these guidelines; stated in a document that has been accepted by votes of the unit&#146;s faculty and of academic professionals; and approved by the chair and the dean.  College plan shall be approved by the provost.  Approved plans will be available in the library.  Colleges and individual units (generally departments) that do not have written plans approved shall not receive funds for performance-based salary adjustments.</li><p><li>Performance-based salary plan.  To the extent ASU at Tempe campus has discretion, satisfactory or better performance is a necessary condition for all types of salary increases.  Each year that salary adjustment funds are available, all faculty and academic professionals shall be considered for possible salary adjustments, based on the evaluations specified in these guidelines.</li><p><li>Salary issues included.  Unit salary plans shall state how the unit allocates salary adjustments:<br><p><ol type="a"><li>to reward valuable institutional contributions to teaching, research/creative activity, service, and <a href="acd002.html#affirmativeaction" target="New">affirmative action</a> and <a href="acd002.html#minority" target="New">minority</a> <a href="acd002.html#student" target="New">student</a> recruitment and retention goals</li><p><li>to remedy salary compression and salary inversion problems<p>and</li><p><li>to correct discriminatory salary inequities that may exist or arise for individual faculty or entire groups.</li></ol></li></ol><p><ol start="4"><li>Performance evaluation plans.  The performance evaluation plans for each unit shall:<br><p><ol type="a"><li>incorporate Arizona Board of Regents guidelines for assessing performance of faculty and academic professionals <i>(Arizona Board of Regents&#146; Policy Manual </i> - 6-211 and 6-302).  For faculty, these guidelines include performance in teaching, research/creative activity, and university/professional/public service, and contributions to departmental and/or university affirmative action and minority student recruitment and retention goals.  For academic professionals, these guidelines require that evaluations are based on individual job descriptions</li><p><li>normally accord equal weight to teaching and research/creative activity for the unit as a whole, even though the weights can vary for individuals,<p>and</li><p><li>focus on improving and/or enhancing future performance as well as assessing past performance.</li></ol></li></ol><p><ol start="5"><li>Performance period and evaluation frequency<br><p><ol type="a"><li>Period:  The period for evaluating performance for salary adjustments normally will include the three consecutive years preceding the performance evaluation.</li><p><li>Frequency:  In-depth performance evaluations shall be conducted either annually or, if approved as part of a unit&#146;s written policy, at least every three years.  For units that conduct in-depth performance evaluations less frequently than every year, chairs annually shall conduct a brief evaluation updating performance progress for each faculty member and academic professional (peer reviews need not be included in these annual updates).</li></ol></li></ol><p><ol start="6"><li>Flexible performance agreements for tenured faculty and academic professionals with continuing <a href="acd002.html#Appointment" target="New">appointments</a>.  Emphasizing the different skills/interests of tenured faculty and academic professionals with continuing appointments can enhance unit productivity and overall achievement of institutional goals.  Unit plans normally will permit variation in the weights assigned to the three activities for individual tenured faculty and academic professionals with continuing appointments, consistent with the mission of the university.  Units also may establish a process for authorizing individualized agreements specifying the future mix of teaching, research/creative activity, and service for tenured faculty and academic professionals with continuing appointments.  (Performance agreements do not supersede established promotion criteria.)</li><p><li>Appeals.  Grounds for an appeal shall be failure to implement the unit&#146;s approved evaluation and salary plan consistently.  Appeals shall be filed first at the unit level and, if necessary, then at the next administrative level.  For colleges with departments, the unit appeal process shall be approved by a vote of the unit&#146;s faculty and academic professionals, and the college appeal process shall be approved by a vote of the college&#146;s faculty and academic professionals. For colleges without departments, the college appeal process shall be approved by a vote of the college&#146;s faculty/academic professionals, and the appeal process at the next administrative level shall be determined by the provost in consultation with the college faculty/academic professionals.</li></ol><p>&#160;<p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
