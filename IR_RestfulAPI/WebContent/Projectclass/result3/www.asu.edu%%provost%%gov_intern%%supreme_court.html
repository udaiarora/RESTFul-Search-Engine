      <P><STRONG>General Description</STRONG><BR>
One temporary, full-time, paid intern positions are available at the Arizona
Supreme Court, Administrative Office of the Courts, in Phoenix.  The Arizona
Constitution charges the Supreme Court with responsibility for providing
administrative supervision over all the courts of the state.  This is done through
  the Administrative Office, and includes adult and juvenile probation, juvenile
  detention, diversion programs, child support, child custody, adoption, domestic
  relations, restitution, substance abuse treatment, administrative and personnel
  matters; and issues affecting municipal, justice, superior and appellate courts.
  The intern will work in the Executive Division of the Administrative Office,
  assisting with judicial department legislation and other administrative responsibilities. </P>

      <P>The term of the intern position is from January 2, 2007 to May 4, 2007.
         Normal working hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; however, legislative activity
        and other job
duties will require extended hours and attendance at early morning or evening
meetings.  There are no holidays or semester breaks.  </P>

      <P><STRONG>Duties</STRONG><BR>
Required duties will include attendance at court and legislative committee
meetings and hearings; assisting the Administrative Director and Legislative
  Officers in preparing, testifying, researching and tracking legislation with
  impact on the courts; acting as a liaison to the Legislature; and communicating
  with judges and administrative staff on legislative activity.
  The intern will be required to prepare written materials (e.g., fact sheets,
  legislative summaries and letters) and make oral presentations on legislation
  to court
  committees and staff. The intern may also lobby legislators on select proposals.
</P>
      <P><STRONG>Qualifications</STRONG><BR>
This position requires basic research, word processing, and strong communication
and organizational skills.  The intern will be expected to work independently.
  
Preference will be given to applicants with experience and demonstrated interest
or academic studies in public administration, the justice system, political
process, or law.  <STRONG>Both undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged
to
apply.</STRONG></P>

      <P><STRONG>Application Procedure</STRONG><BR>

To apply, complete the &#147;Arizona Legislative and Government Internship
Program&#148; application.  Applications <STRONG>MUST</STRONG> also be accompanied
by a <STRONG>RESUME</STRONG>, <STRONG>TWO</STRONG> letters of recommendation, and an
<STRONG>ADDITIONAL WRITTEN STATEMENT</STRONG> identifying current issues of interest
to the
student that effect Arizona courts and stating the student's reasons
for and interest in applying for the Supreme Court internship.
      <P>        <STRONG>Common questions asked about the Supreme Court Internship</STRONG>
      <P><STRONG>Q:	How many interns will be hired?</STRONG><BR>

A:	<STRONG>One.</STRONG>  The intern, together with the Legislative Officers
and the Administrative Director of Courts, will comprise  the
legislative team for the Arizona Judicial Department.   


<P><STRONG>Q:	Must I be a law school student to apply?</STRONG><BR>

A:	<STRONG>No!</STRONG>  Prior interns have had educational backgrounds in justice studies,
English, business, accounting, public administration, social work and
political science. A demonstrated interest in public administration and/or the
judicial system, through a student's course work, future career plans, or
volunteer or work experience is preferred.

<P><STRONG>Q:	Does the intern work with the Supreme Court
justices?</STRONG><BR>

A:	The Supreme Court has two main responsibilities: hearing cases on appeal
from the lower courts and statewide administration of the court system.  The
intern's work focuses exclusively on the administrative responsibility.  In
this capacity, the intern may be involved in preparing information for the Chief
Justice relative to legislative proposals.  Researching cases pending before
the
Court and writing legal briefs is <STRONG>not</STRONG> one of the intern's duties.

<P><STRONG>Q:	Will the intern have contact with judges and court
administrators?</STRONG> <BR>

A:	<STRONG>Yes.</STRONG>  Because the Arizona Supreme Court has administrative responsibility
for the state court system, this internship exposes the students to all aspects of
the judicial department.  Part of the intern's responsibilities will be
informing judges and court administrators about proposed legislation and
obtaining feedback from the courts on introduced legislation.

<P><STRONG>Q:	To what issues will the Supreme Court intern be exposed?</STRONG> <BR>

A:	Criminal and civil law matters, death penalty issues, adult and juvenile probation, juvenile detention, diversion programs, child support, child custody, adoption, domestic relations, restitution, substance abuse treatment, administrative and personnel matters; and issues affecting municipal, justice, superior and appellate courts.

<P><STRONG>Q:	How do prior Supreme Court interns describe the
internship?</STRONG><BR>

A: &#147;...a great learning experience that could never be obtained inside a
classroom.&#148;<br>&#147;...an invaluable educational experience involving a great
deal of
dedication, hard work and long hours.&#148;<br>&#147;...there is no better way to
learn the political process and the
behind-the-scenes action.&#148;<br>&#147;Exciting, intense, very educational, demanding,
challenging, WELL WORTH
IT!&#148;</P>

<P><STRONG>Q:	What did prior Supreme Court interns do after their
internship?</STRONG>
<BR>
A:	Many of the prior interns went on to law school and other graduate
school programs.  The schools they have attended for their graduate studies
include UCLA, U of A, ASU, American University and Northwestern University. 
Nancy Swetnam a previous Legislative Officer, continues to work for the Supreme
Court as a division director. Darren La Sorte, also a previous Legislative Officer,
works for the National Rifle Association as a lobbyist. Marian Conrad works for
Pima County lobbying particulate matter (air polution) issues.
