      <h2>Gonzalez joins Student Affairs; Rund heads new initiative</h2>
      <p>        ASU President Michael Crow announced the appointment of Juan Gonzalez
          as vice president for Student Affairs, following a successful national
          search. Crow also announced the creation the Office of University Undergraduate
          Initiatives and has appointed James Rund to lead the university-wide
          effort as vice president for University Undergraduate Initiatives.        </p>
      <p>Both appointments are effective Aug, 1, pending approval by the Arizona
          Board of Regents. </p>
      <p>Gonzalez, currently vice president for Student Affairs
          at Georgetown University, will focus on campus life, residential life,
          student well-being
          and health and other areas that impact student success and overall
        experience. Rund, currently interim vice president for Student Affairs
        at ASU, will
          have cross-cutting responsibilities, working closely with all administrative
          areas to manage enrollment growth, selective admissions, diversity
        and achievement in a multi-campus setting. The changes are necessary
        as ASU
          continues to grow and get better at the same time.</p>
      <p>"This is a critical
          time for ASU," said Crow. "We are growing the university to provide
        services to larger enrollments of highly qualified students,
          while continuing to enhance quality and remain open and accessible.
        To do this successfully, with student success being our highest priority,
        we need to be intensely focused."</p>
      <p>Crow is making the changes without
          expanding his administrative staff. </p>
      <p>Rund has been interim vice president for Student Affairs since last
        October, when Christine Wilkinson was named senior vice president and
        secretary
          of the university. Rund's previous position as associate vice president
          for Student Affairs and dean of Student Development, which he held
        from 1995 to 2002, is not being filled.</p>
      <p>Gonzalez joins ASU from Georgetown,
          where he has been vice president for Student Affairs since August 2000.
          From 1994 to 2000, Gonzalez was
          vice president for student affairs at California Polytechnic State
        University, San Luis Obispo. He was vice president for Student Services
        at California
          State University, San Bernardino, from 1990 to 1994.</p>
      <p>Among his responsibilities,
          Gonzalez will oversee general campus welfare to promote a healthy campus
          environment. He was the principal investigator
          for a three-year grant from the Anheuser-Busch Foundation for a campaign
          to reduce high-risk behavior and encourage the health and safety of
        Georgetown University students.</p>
      <p>Rund has been instrumental in improving the undergraduate
        experience at ASU. He created ASU's Freshman Year Experience program,
        which ranked
        23rd in the 2003 U.S. News &amp; World Report's "America's Best Colleges"
        ranking of first-year programs designed to help freshmen be successful.</p>
      <p>Crow
          said, "Jim and Juan will provide the strong, focused leadership we
        need in those areas that are key to student success as we move quickly
          to advance the multiple goals associated with the Arizona Board of
        Regents'
          Changing Directions initiative, enrollment growth, student quality
        and achievement and improving campus life and the residential learning
        environment."</p>
      <p>In
          his new role, Rund will design and build the enrollment and academic
          support infrastructure for the university to operate on multiple campuses.
          He will develop and implement university enrollment goals and strategies
          that will enhance university-wide student quality and diversity, while
          accommodating anticipated enrollment growth. </p>
      <p>"Integrating the multi-campus
          efforts are a prodigious undertaking that is best done centrally and
          with the support of the entire university,"
          said Milton Glick, executive vice president and provost of the university.
          "Both Jim and Juan have a tremendous opportunity ahead of them and
        I'm confident our team is stronger in every way with this new structure."</p>
      <p>Rund
          will oversee student recruitment and admission efforts that support
        the academic program plan, including coordinating the selective admissions
          program and creating a seamless university experience for students
        within
          and between campuses and programs.</p>
      <p>"The university has been re-energized
          since president Crow has come on board, and I marvel at his tireless
          commitment to making ASU not only
          better than it has ever been, but the best in every aspect," said Rund.
          "He has outlined a bold vision that will serve Arizona well. I'm pleased
          to continue serving ASU and advancing the President's agenda in this
          new role."</p>
      <p>To accomplish the mission of his office, Rund will employ the
          tools of Undergraduate Admissions, Student Financial Assistance, University
          Registrar
          and Student Services Administrative Computing.</p>
      <p>Gonzalez will focus on
          student life, well-being and success, including designing and directing
          programs and services that enhance the student
          experience and overall quality of campus life and the learner-centered
          environment. </p>
      <p>Gonzalez will lead efforts to enhance the residential experience
          and develop additional campus communities, and the university's living
          and
          learning environment. He will oversee development of the new South
        campus academic village, which will unite students and faculty in a living
        and
          learning environment designed to encourage more interaction between
        students and faculty. Gonzalez also will work with the dean of the Barrett
        Honors
          College to expand the living-learning environment for ASU's premier
        undergraduate honors program.</p>
      <p>"Under President Crow's leadership, ASU has tremendous
          potential to impact students' lives in ways that will forever transform
          them as individuals
          and contributing members of society," said Gonzalez. "Over the next
        10 years we have the opportunity to redefine success and become a university
          that is directly engaged within the state, country and on a global
        basis,"
          said Gonzalez.</p>
      <p>Gonzalez says he has a great deal to learn, but is pleased
          with the solid foundation in Student Affairs at ASU. </p>
      <p>"I believe the most effective model
          to reduce high-risk behavior is one that engages students in the learning
          process," Gonzalez said. "Currently,
          there is tremendous promise in the reduction of high-risk underage
        drinking with the social norms philosophy, and I'm pleased that ASU employs
        that
          program and is realizing impressive results."</p>
      <p>He will have responsibility
          for Student Health and Wellness, Counseling and Consultation, Career
          Services, Recreational Sports, Residential Life,
          Memorial Union/Student Development, Student Media, and Student Life.</p>
      <p>David
          Young, chairman of the search committee charged with hiring the vice
          president for Student Affairs, said, "I think Dr. Gonzalez' breadth
          of experience will serve him well at ASU, and make him an outstanding
          vice president for Student Affairs. I'm impressed by his commitment
        to work with the faculty to enhance the learning environment, as well
        as
          his enthusiasm for making higher education an exceptional experience
          for all students."</p>
      <p>Gonzalez earned his bachelor's degree in Latin-American
          Studies from Texas Tech University. He has a master's degree in bilingual-bicultural
          education from the University of Texas, and a Ph.D. in educational
        psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>
      <p>Rund has a B.A. from
          Moorhead State University, an M.S. from North Dakota State University,
          and an Ed.D. in higher and adult education from ASU.</p>
