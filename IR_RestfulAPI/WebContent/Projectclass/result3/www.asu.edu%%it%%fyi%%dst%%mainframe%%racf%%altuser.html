FUNCTION
          5740-XXH  (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 1987

     The ALTUSER command changes the RACF attributes of one or more
     users or those attributes applicable to a particular group.

     You may modify your name field and default group value.  If you
     have the SPECIAL attribute, you can use all the operands except
     UAUDIT or NOUAUDIT.  If you are the owner of the user's profile,
     or have the group-SPECIAL attribute in the group, you can use any
     of the operands for user-related attributes.  if you have JOIN,
     CONNECT, or group-SPECIAL authority in the group, or are the
     owner of the group, you may use the group, authority, and UACC
     attributes.  If you are the owner of the user's profile, or have
     group-SPECIAL authority in the group, and have the CLAUTH
     attribute for the class to be added or deleted, you can specify
     CLAUTH or NOCLAUTH.  If you have the AUDITOR attribute or the
     group-AUDITOR attribute in the group owning the user profile, you
     can specify UAUDIT or NOUAUDIT.  In addition, in order to specify
     SUB-OPERANDS of the TSO operands, you must have the SPECIAL
     attribute or have UPDATE authority via field level access
     control.

      base.  The name may be from 1 to 20 alphameric, SPECIAL, or
      national characters the first of which must be alphanumeric.

  PASSWORD(password)
      Specifies the sequence of 1 to 8 alphameric or national
      characters to be used as a password for the user.  The default
      is the default group name.  The password is set expired.

  NOPASSWORD

      password.

  OWNER(userid or group-name)
      Specifies a RACF-defined user or group name to be made owner of
      the user to be altered.

  GROUP(group-name)
      Specifies the name of a group to which the user is connected.
      User attributes specific to a group (UACC and authority
      operands) will be modified for this group.  If this operand is
      not specified and either UACC or authority are, the default
      group of the user will be used.  If DFLTGRP was specified and
      the above conditions exist, the modifications will be to the old
      default group.

  DFLTGRP(group-name)
      Specifies a new default group for the user.  The user must be
      connected to the group specified with at least USE authority.

  AUTHORITY(JOIN | CONNECT | CREATE | USE)

      To specify this operand, you must either have the SPECIAL
      attribute or be the owner of the user and have class
      authorization for the class(es) specified.  If you have
      insufficient authority to a class, that class is ignored and
      processing continues with the next class name.

  NOCLAUTH(class-name...)
      Specifies that the user is not allowed to define profiles in the
      classes specified.  The valid class names are USER and those
      defined in the class descriptor table.  The class names

            REMAINING OPERANDS IGNORED

            Explanation:  You specified operands in addition to UAUDIT
            or NOUAUDIT, but for the indicated userid, you are only
            authorized to specify the UAUDIT or NOUAUDIT operands.

            System Action:  All operands other than UAUDIT or NOUAUDIT
            are ignored.

  ICH21013A ENTER OPERATOR IDENTIFICATION CARD

            Explanation:  You have specified the OIDCARD operand.
            This message is requesting that you enter the operator
            identification card for the user being altered so that the
            information on it can be put into the user's profile.

            System Action:  Command processing waits for you to enter
            the operator identification card.

  ICH21014I COMMAND ENDED DUE TO ERROR
            TERMINAL TYPE NOT SUPPORTED

            Explanation:  You specified the OIDCARD operand, but when
            the operator identification card was entered, it could not
            be verified because it was entered on a terminal that is
            not supported.

            System Action:  The ALTUSER command is terminated.

  ICH21015I CLASS class-name AND REMAINING CLASSES NOT ALTERED FOR

            names in the CLAUTH/NOCLAUTH list were not added to or
            deleted from the list of authorized classes in the user
            profile because an error occurred in the RACF manager.

            System Action:  A RACF manager error message precedes this
            message and explains the error.  Other operands on the
            command have been processed.

  ICH21016I PASSWORD CHANGE FOR 'id' SUPPRESSED BY INSTALLATION
            PASSWORD EXIT

            Explanation:  The proposed password, as specified in the
            PASSWORD operand on the ALTUSER command, does not obey the
            syntax rules of the installation.  (These rules were
            specified by the PASSWORD keyword, RULEn option, on the
            SETROPTS command.)

            System Action:  The command is terminated.

            User Response:  See your local administrator for the rules
            regarding new passwords.

  ICH21017I NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPECIFY MODEL/NOMODEL, OPERAND IGNORED

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to
            specify  MODEL or NOMODEL on the ALTUSER command. The
            proper authority is either a user modifying his own entry,
            OWNER of entry, or SPECIAL.

            System Action:  The command is terminated.

  ICH21018I WARNING, UNABLE TO LOCATE THE MODEL PROFILE FOR
            data-set-name

            Explanation:  You have specified a model profile data set
            name that cannot be found on the RACF data base.  For
            modeling to be effective for this data set name, a data
            set profile must first be created.

            System Action:  RACF adds the data set name you specified
            to the user profile in anticipation that profile
            information for this name will be completed (using the
            ADDSD command) at a later time.  RACF continues to process
            the ALTUSER command.

  ICH21019I 'RESUME' IGNORED.  userid NOT CURRENTLY REVOKED

            Explanation:  The indicated userid is not currently
            revoked.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the specification of a future
            date with the RESUME operand.

  ICH21020I category ALREADY DEFINED TO profile-name

            Explanation:  The specified category has already been
            defined in this profile.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the category and continues
            command processing with the next option.

  ICH21021I category NOT DEFINED TO  profile-name

            Explanation:  Because the specified category has not been
            defined in this profile, RACF cannot delete it.

            System Action:  RACF ignores the category and continues
            command processing with the next option.

  ICH21022I 'REVOKE' IGNORED.  userid IS CURRENTLY REVOKED

            Explanation:  REVOKE was specified with a date, but the
            user is already revoked.

            System Action:  RACF ignores REVOKE processing  and
            continues command processing with the next option.

  ICH21023I COMMAND PROCESSING TERMINATED.  NO (SECLEVELS |
            CATEGORIES) FOUND

            Explanation:  RACF could not validate the name you
            specified on the SECLEVEL or ADDCATEGORY keyword. This
            happened for one of two reasons:

            o   There is no SECLEVEL or CATEGORY profile.
            o   A profile is defined, but it doesn't contain any
                members.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH21026I NOT AUTHORIZED TO UPDATE SPECIFIED FIELD(S) IN
            TSO SEGMENT

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to
            access the TSO segment at the field level.

  ICH21027I COMMAND PROCESSING COMPLETED BUT UNABLE TO
            UPDATE 'SYS1.BRODCAST'.

            Explanation:  The command you issued has completed;
            however, your attempt to change the TSO data set
            'SYS1.BRODCAST' has failed.

  ICH21028I TSO OPERAND NOT PROCESSED

            Explanation:  You have specified the TSO operand
            incorrectly.  Correct the error and retry the command.

  ICH21029I CONFLICT BETWEEN SIZE AND MAXSIZE.  OPERAND IS IGNORED.

            Explanation:  The SIZE and MAXSIZE parameters differ.
            Both parameters are ignored.

  ICH21030I SIZE SPECIFIED GREATER THAN MAXSIZE.  SIZE
            ADJUSTED EQUAL TO MAXSIZE.

            Explanation:  The specified SIZE is greater than the
            maximum allowable size, as specified on the MAXSIZE
            parameter.

            System Action:  RACF adjusts SIZE to equal the MAXSIZE
            parameter.

            User Response:  You can adjust the SIZE and MAXSIZE
            parameters using the ALTUSER command.
