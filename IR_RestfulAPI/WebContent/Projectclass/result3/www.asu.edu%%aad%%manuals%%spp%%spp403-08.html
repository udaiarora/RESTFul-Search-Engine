Eligibility for state- and university-sponsored salary adjustments is subject to legislative appropriations and guidelines and approved by the Arizona Board of Regents. The types of salary adjustments that may be provided to an employee are by <A HREF="spp002.html#performance increase">performance increases</A>, equity adjustments, <A HREF="spp002.html#market adjustment">market adjustments</A>, and performance-based incentives.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Performance Increases</B></FONT><P>A performance increase may be awarded to an employee based on an assessment of work performance.  Performance increases may be provided only when appropriated by the legislature and authorized by the university.<P>A classified employee may be eligible for a performance increase not to exceed the maximum of the assigned pay range.<P>Performance increases usually occur at the start of each fiscal year or as otherwise designated by the legislature.  <P>Performance increases are based on the performance period specified by the university. An employee whose performance evaluation is Level 1 (&#147;the responsibilities of the position are not fulfilled&#148;) is not eligible for a performance increase.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Equity Adjustments</B></FONT><P>An equity adjustment is a salary increase to correct disparities based upon protected class status.  Protected class status covers race, color, religion, national origin, citizenship, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, Vietnam-era veteran status, other protected veteran status, or special disabled veteran status.  These adjustments are not related to market conditions and are not to be used in lieu of performance adjustments.  Departments should submit any requests for equity adjustments to ASU&#146;s Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Office for review.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Market Adjustments</B></FONT><P>A <A HREF="spp002.html#market adjustment">market adjustment</A> may be awarded based on an assessment of the employee&#146;s salary compared to the job&#146;s <a href="spp002.html#market rate">market rate</a>. Administrative officials and HR should work together in partnership to determine appropriate market adjustments. This assessment should include the salaries of other employees within the same job classification in the unit and their salary relationship to market, if appropriate. In the event a mutual agreement cannot be reached, the appropriate person with higher authority in the unit will make the final decision after considering both parties&#146; perspectives.<P>A vice president/provost or designee must approve market adjustments that result in the employee&#146;s new salary exceeding the job&#146;s market rate for service professional and administrative employees or the grade <A HREF="spp002.html#midpoint">midpoint</A> of the salary range for classified employees.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Performance-Based Incentives</B></FONT><P>Work groups or teams may develop performance-based incentive programs to promote efficiency and effectiveness in the unit. All programs must:<P><OL><LI>have measurable standards of performance related to university goals and objectives that must be achieved in order for employees to receive an incentive</LI><P><LI>apply equally to applicable employees in the unit</LI><P><LI>result in cost reductions, improved service or product quality, or improved productivity</LI><P><LI>not exceed the maximum incentive payment permitted per employee by the <I>Arizona Revised Statutes</I> or be added to an employee&#146;s base salary<P>and</LI><P><LI>be funded from up to 80 percent of excess vacancy savings or other monies appropriated from the state general fund or other sources.</LI></OL><P>Work groups or teams who are interested in establishing incentive programs should contact HR for university guidelines.<P>Each program must be approved by the appropriate dean or director before being forwarded to the State Performance-Based Incentive Oversight Committee for review. Programs must then be approved by the executive director of the Board of Regents before implementation.<P>All incentives will be paid to employees through the university&#146;s human resources management system and are subject to taxes and withholding. Payments will be made as specified in the approved incentive program plan.<P><IMG SRC="spphr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Cross-Reference</B></FONT></CENTER><IMG SRC="spphr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><P>For more information on salary increases, see <A HREF="spp402-05.html">SPP 402&#150;05</A>, &#147;Career Progression.&#148;<P>&#160;<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><HR><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">SPP</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | SPP&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="spp001.html">contact</A> | Human&#160;Resources&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="hr.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
