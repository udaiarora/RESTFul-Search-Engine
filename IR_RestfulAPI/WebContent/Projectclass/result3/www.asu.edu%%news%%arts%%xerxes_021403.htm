      <h2>Lyric Opera Theatre performs one of Handel's last Italian operas - Xerxes</h2>
      <p>WHAT: Lyric Opera Theatre opera: Xerxes<br>
        WHEN: 7:30 p.m., Feb. 28, March 1, 2, 7, 8; 2:30 p.m., March 9<br>
        WHERE: Evelyn Smith Music Theatre, Music Building, 40 E. Gammage Parkway, 
        Tempe<br>
        TICKETS: $14 general, $12 faculty/staff/seniors, $5 students<br>
        INFORMATION: 480-965-6447</p>
      <p>Unrequited love, comedic misunderstandings, mistaken identities and Stephen 
        Wadsworth's libretto translation all contribute to the ASU production 
        of Handel's Xerxes performed by the Herberger College School of Music's 
        award-winning Lyric Opera Theatre.</p>
      <p>The opera will be presented at 7:30 p.m. Feb. 28, March 1, 2, 7 and 8, 
        with a 2:00 p.m. matinee on March 9. The venue is the Evelyn Smith Music 
        Theatre in the Music Building on the main ASU campus in Tempe, 40 E. Gammage 
        Parkway. Tickets are $14 general, $12 faculty/staff/seniors and $5 students. 
        Call the Herberger College Box Office, 480-965-6447. A pre-performance 
        lecture will be held at 1 p.m. before the March 9 matinee.</p>
      <p>Lyric Opera Theatre chose to use the English translation and adaptation 
        by Wadsworth, which has wowed audiences across the country from New York 
        to Seattle; New York City Opera is slated to perform Wadsworth's translation 
        and adaptation of Xerxes in Spring 2004. According to The New Yorker magazine, 
        "Stephen Wadsworth's ingenious translation of the Italian text updates 
        the language without undercutting the bucolic innocence of this marital 
        comedy." The Wall Street Journal review states that the Wadsworth production 
        is "One of the most compelling operatic and theatrical experiences to 
        be had anywhere."</p>
      <p>The ASU production is under the direction of noted director Dale Dreyfoos, 
        professor of music, and associate director/ resident stage director for 
        the Lyric Opera Theatre. It features an orchestra under the direction 
        of John Metz, professor of harpsichord and director of early music studies 
        at ASU. Metz and the musicians are recreating what 18th-century audiences 
        would hear when attending a performance of Xerxes at London's Royal Academy 
        of Music. Handel was the institution's composer in residence in the early 
        to mid 1700s and wrote many of his Italian operas during that period.</p>
      <p>Xerxes was one of the last operas that Handel wrote before turning to 
        the English oratorio genre and was one of his rare forays into comedy. 
        The majority of his operas were based on historical, mythological or legendary 
        subjects. In the 1700s, one of the main attractions to Handel's operas 
        was the opportunity to hear the "castrati," male singers whose soprano 
        voices has been surgically preserved from childhood. In modern performances, 
        castrati roles are either performed by women or sung by men in a transposed 
        key. The Lyric Opera Theatre production of Xerxes features female mezzo-sopranos 
        in the male roles of Xerxes, the king of Persia, and his brother, Arsamene.</p>
      <p>Wadsworth has translated two other operas by Handel, Alcina and Partenope, 
        as well as operas by Monteverdi, Mozart, and Udo Zimmermann. He has also 
        translated and adapted Moli&egrave;re's Don Juan and Goldoni's La Locandiera. 
        He wrote the opera, A Quiet Place, with Leonard Bernstein and has directed 
        operas at La Scala, Vienna State Opera, Royal Opera Covent Garden, Netherlands 
        Opera, Scottish Opera and San Francisco Opera and many other companies, 
        including Seattle Opera, where he directed a new production of Wagner's 
        Ring in 2001.<br>
