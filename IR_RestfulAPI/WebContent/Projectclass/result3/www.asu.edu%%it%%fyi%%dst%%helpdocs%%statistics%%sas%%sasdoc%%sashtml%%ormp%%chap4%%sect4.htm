<H2>Side Constraints  </H2>
<P><A NAME="idxnet0007">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet0008">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet0009">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet0010">&#13;</A>Often all the details of a problem cannot be specified in a
network model alone. In many of these cases, these details
can be represented by the addition of side constraints to the
model. 
Side constraints are a linear function of arc variables
(variables containing flow through an arc) and nonarc
variables (variables that are not part of the network).
This enhancement to the basic network model allows for very
general problems. In fact, any linear program can be
represented with network models having these types of
side constraints. 
The examples that follow help
to clarify the notion of side constraints.
PROC NETFLOW enables you to specify side constraints.
The data for a side constraint consist of coefficients of arcs and
coefficients of nonarc variables, a constraint type (that is, <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/neteq1.gif"
 ALT="\le">, =, or <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/neteq2.gif"
 ALT="\ge"> )
and a right-hand-side value (rhs).
A nonarc variable has a name, an objective function coefficient
analogous to an arc cost, an upper bound analogous to an arc 
capacity, and a lower bound analogous to an arc lower
flow bound.
PROC NETFLOW finds the flow through the
network and the values of any nonarc variables that minimize
the total cost of the solution.
Flow conservation is met, 
flow through each arc is on or between the arc's lower flow
bound and capacity, 
the value of each nonarc variable is on or between the nonarc's
lower and upper bounds, and the
side constraints are satisfied.
Note that, since many linear programs have large embedded networks,
PROC NETFLOW is an attractive alternative to the LP procedure in many
cases.
<P>In order for arcs to be specified in side constraints, they must be named.
By default, PROC NETFLOW names arcs using the names of the
nodes at the head and tail of the arc.
An arc is named with its tail node name
followed by an &#34;_&#34; followed by the name of its head node name.
For example, an arc from node <EM>from</EM> to node <EM>to</EM>
is called <EM>from_to</EM>.
<P><H3><I>Proportional Constraints</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxnet0011">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet0012">&#13;</A>Side constraints in network models fall into several
categories that have special structure.
They are frequently used when the
flow through an arc must be
proportional to the flow through another arc.
Such constraints are called <EM>proportional constraints</EM>
and are useful in models where
production is subject to refining or modification into
different materials.
The amount of each output, or any waste, evaporation, or reduction
can be specified as a proportion of input.
<P>Typically the arcs near the supply nodes carry 
raw materials and the arcs 
near the demand nodes carry refined products.
For example, in a model of the milling industry,
the flow through some arcs may represent quantities of wheat.
After the wheat is processed, the flow through other arcs might
be flour. For others it might be bran.
The side constraints model the relationship between
the amount of flour or bran
produced as a proportion of the amount of wheat milled.
Some of the wheat can end up as neither flour, bran, nor any useful
product, so this waste is drained away via arcs to a waste node.

The cost of flow on this arc is the milling cost.

Note that it is not necessary to specify the constraint
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
0.5 <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">Wheat_Mill</SPAN> - <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">Mill_Other</SPAN> = 0.0
</DIV>since flow conservation implies that any flow that does not

<A NAME="idxnet0013">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet0014">&#13;</A>And, computationally, it is better 
if this constraint is not specified, since
there is one less side constraint and fewer problems with
numerical precision.
Notice that the sum of the proportions must equal 1.0 exactly;
otherwise, flow conservation is violated.
<P><H3><I>Blending Constraints</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxnet0015">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet0016">&#13;</A>Blending or quality constraints can also 
influence the recipes or proportions 
of ingredients that are mixed.
For example, different raw materials can have different properties.
In an application of the oil industry, the amount of products
that are obtained could be different for each type of crude oil.
Furthermore, fuel might have a minimum octane requirement or limited
sulphur or lead content, so that a blending
of crudes is needed to produce the product.
<P>The network fragment in <A HREF="#netfbl">Figure 4.3</A> shows an example of this.

<P>The arcs <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">MidEast_Port</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">USA_Port</SPAN> convey crude oil

The arc <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">Port_Refinery</SPAN> represents refining while the arcs
<SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">Refinery_Gasolene</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">Refinery_Diesel</SPAN> carry the

The proportional constraints
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

</DIV>capture the restrictions for producing gasolene and
diesel from crude.
Suppose that, if only crude from the Middle East is used,
the resulting diesel would contain 5 units of sulphur per litre.  
If only crude from the USA is used,
the resulting diesel would contain
4 units of sulphur per litre.
Diesel can have at most 4.75 units of sulphur per litre.
Some crude from the USA must be used if Middle East crude is used
in order to meet the 4.75 sulphur per litre limit.
The side constraint to model this requirement is
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
5 <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">MidEast_Port</SPAN> + 4 <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">USA_Port</SPAN> - 4.75 <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">Port_Refinery</SPAN> <IMG WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 ALT="\le"> 0.0
</DIV>Since <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">Port_Refinery</SPAN> = <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">MidEast_Port</SPAN> + <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">USA_Port</SPAN>, flow conservation
<A NAME="idxnet0017">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet0018">&#13;</A>allows this constraint to be simplified to

 ALT="\le"> 0.0
</DIV>If, for example, 
120 units of crude from the Middle East is used, then at least 40
units of crude from the USA must be used.
The preceding constraint is simplified because you assume that the sulphur
concentration of diesel is proportional to the sulphur
concentration of the crude mix.
If this is not the case, the relation
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
0.2 <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">Port_Refinery</SPAN> = <SPAN CLASS="ssfeleven">Refinery_Diesel</SPAN>

<P>An example similar to this Oil Industry problem is solved in

<H3><I>Multicommodity Problems</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxnet0019">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet0020">&#13;</A>Side constraints are also used in models in which there are
capacities on transportation or some other shared resource,
or there are limits on overall production or demand in multicommodity,
multidivisional or multiperiod problems.
Each commodity, division or period
can have a separate network coupled to one main
system by the side constraints.
Side constraints are used to combine the outputs of subdivisions
of a problem (either commodities, outputs in distinct time periods,
or different process streams) to meet overall demands or to limit
overall production or expenditures.
This method is more desirable than doing separate
<EM>local</EM> optimizations
for individual commodity, process, or time networks and then
trying to establish relationships between each when determining an
overall policy if the <EM>global</EM> constraint
is not satisfied.  Of course,
to make models more realistic, side constraints may be necessary in
the local problems.

<P><H3><I>Large Modeling Strategy</I></H3>
In many cases, the flow through an arc might actually represent
the flow or movement of a commodity from place to place or from
time period to time period.
However, sometimes an arc is included in the network as a 
method of capturing some aspect of the problem that you would
not normally think of as part of a network model.
For example, in a multiprocess multiproduct model (<A HREF="#netfmp">Figure 4.5</A>),
there might
be subnetworks for each process and each product.
The subnetworks can be joined together by a set of arcs that
have flows that represent the amount of product <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>j</I></SPAN> produced by
process <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>i</I></SPAN>.
To model an upper limit constraint on the total amount of product <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>j</I></SPAN> that
can be produced, direct all arcs carrying product <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>j</I></SPAN> to a 
single node and from there through a single arc.
The capacity of this arc is the upper limit of product <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>j</I></SPAN> production.
It is preferable to model this structure in the network rather 
than to include it in the side constraints because
the efficiency of the optimizer is affected less by a 
reasonable increase in the size of the network.

<P>It is often a good strategy when starting a project to 
use a small network formulation and
then to use that model as a framework upon which
to add detail.
For example, in the multiprocess multiproduct model,
you might start with the network 
depicted in <A HREF="#netfmp">Figure 4.5</A>.
Then, for example, the process subnetwork 
can be enhanced to include the distribution of products. 
Other phases of the operation could be included 
by adding more subnetworks.
Initially, these subnetworks can be single nodes, but
in subsequent studies they can be expanded to include
greater detail.
<P>The NETFLOW procedure accepts the
side constraints in the same <A HREF="sect42.htm#netflowdenseformat">dense</A> and

Although PROC LP can solve
network problems, the
NETFLOW procedure generally solves network flow problems more
efficiently than PROC LP.
