<U>Rationale and Objectives</U><P>

Human organizations and relationships have evolved from being family and village centered to modern global interdependence.  The greatest challenge in the nuclear age is developing and maintaining a global perspective which fosters international cooperati
on.  While the modern world is comprised of politically independent states, people must transcend nationalism and recognize the significant interdependence among peoples of the world.  The exposure of students to different cultural systems provides the ba
ckground of thought necessary to developing a global perspective.<P>

Cultural learning is present in many disciplines. Exposure to perspectives on art, business, engineering, music, and the natural and social sciences that lead to an understanding of the contemporary world supports the view that intercultural interaction h
as become a daily necessity.  The complexity of American society forces people to balance regional and national goals with global concerns.  Many of the most serious problems are world issues and require solutions which exhibit mutuality and reciprocity. 
 No longer are hunger, ecology, health care delivery, language planning, information exchanges, economic and social developments, law, technology transfer, philosophy, and the arts solely national concerns; they affect all the people of the world.  Surviv
al may be dependent on the ability to generate global solutions to some of the most pressing problems.<P>

The word university, from universitas, implies that knowledge comes from many sources and is not restricted to local, regional, or national perspectives.  The Global Awareness Area recognizes the need for an understanding of the values, elements, and soci
al processes of cultures other than the culture of the United States.  Learning which recognizes the nature of others cultures and the relationship of America's cultural system to generic human goals and welfare will help create the multicultural and glob
al perspective necessary for effective interaction in the human community.<P>

Courses which meet the requirement in global awareness are of one or more of the following types:  (1) in-depth area studies which are concerned with an examination of culture-specific elements of a region of the world, country, or culture group, (2) the 
study of contemporary non-English language courses that have a significant cultural component,  (3) comparative cultural studies with an emphasis on non-U.S. areas, and (4) in-depth studies of non-U.S. centered cultural interrelationships of global scope 
such as the global interdependence produced by problems of world ecology, multinational corporations, migration, and the threat of nuclear war.<P>
