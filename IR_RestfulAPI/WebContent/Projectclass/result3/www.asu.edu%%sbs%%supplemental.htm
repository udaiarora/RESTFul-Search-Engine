            <p><b><u>Payments 
              Received for Qualified Tuition and Related Expenses</u></b></p>
<p>The amount shown in box 2 of Form 1098-T and reported to the IRS is the qualified tuition and related expenses billed to you during the calendar year.  The amount shown in Box 3 of Form 1098-T and reported to the IRS represents adjustments to amounts billed in prior years.&nbsp; These amounts may be different from the amount actually paid or refunded during the calendar year, although for many students the amounts will be the same.  Under section 25A of the Internal Revenue Code and the associated regulations, a taxpayer may take a tuition and fee deduction or claim an education tax credit only with respect to qualified tuition and related expenses actually paid during the calendar year.  You may not be able to take a tuition and fee deduction or claim an education credit with respect to the entire amount billed and reported in box 2.  
<p>Qualified tuition and related expenses are sometimes referred to as qualified education expenses, although the terms are not always interchangeable.  For purposes of the Form 1098-T provided by Arizona State University, the following categories of charges are included or not included in qualified tuition and related expenses:

<center>Qualified Tuition and Related Expenses</center>
<table width=609 align=center border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0>
<tr>
<td width="294" valign=top><li>Resident and Non-resident Tuition

<p>ASU is providing as supplemental information the details of payments received and refunded during the calendar year for qualified tuition and related expenses.  ASU has attempted to present as accurately as possible the payments received, but in some instances complete information is not available.  As described below, your own records should serve as the primary source of information used in determining whether, and for how much, a tuition and fee deduction can be taken or an education credit claimed.</p>
<p>The supplemental paid data can be viewed by logging onto <a href="https://sec.was.asu.edu/intsite/Main">ASU Interactive</a> and selecting ?View Your IRS Form 1098-T Tuition Statement?.  From this page, select ?View 1098-T information and supplemental detail?, then select ?Click Here To View Supplemental Paid Tuition and Fees Detail? to view payments made to ASU during the calendar year for qualified tuition and related expenses.</p>
<p>The payments are presented in detail by semester, date, description, and amount.  Positive amounts represent direct payments of tuition as well as student account credits that paid or cleared a qualified tuition or related expense:</p>

<center>Types of Payments Included</center>
<table width=600 align=center border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0>
<tr>
<td width="286" valign=top><li>Direct payments by cash, check, or credit card
<li>Financial aid credited to tuition and related expenses, including loans
<li>Payments from outside sponsors</td>
<td width="275" valign=top><li>Credits posted to your student account by ASU departments
<li>Charge reversals from ASU departments
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses do not include amounts that are waived due to the student?s status as a benefits eligible ASU faculty or staff member or the spouse or dependent of an ASU faculty or staff member or tuition charges waived due to the student?s status as an eligible research or teaching assistant/associate.</p>
<p>Negative payments represent tuition refunds, which generally result when classes are dropped or withdrawn from.  Tuition refunds, i.e. negative payments, must be subtracted from positive payments to calculate qualified tuition and related expenses paid during the calendar year.&nbsp; Tuition refunds are first used to pay university charges and are only paid to the student if in excess of university charges. </p>
<p>The paid information being provided is supplemental and is not reported to the IRS.</p>
<p><b><u>Use Your Own Records</u></b></p>
<p>You should not rely solely on the supplemental information provided by ASU.  If you are taking the tuition and fee deduction or claiming one of the education credits, you should also use your own records to determine tuition paid, refunds of qualified expenses, and tax-free educational assistance. This is particularly true if an employer or other non-ASU entity has reimbursed you for tuition paid or paid your tuition directly on your behalf. The information on the supplemental report does not reflect any refunds or reimbursements paid to you or on your behalf by third parties, but these amounts must be considered in determining eligibility for the tax credits. If you have further questions regarding your qualification for the Education Tax Credits, please obtain available information from the IRS and/or consult with a tax advisor.</p>
<p>You may also call (480) 965-9834 to correct information shown on the 1098-T or supplemental report.</p>
