      <h2>Enrichment programs share world of knowledge with community</h2>
      <p> Connecting the university with the community it serves, and using collective 
        energy to solve some of the greatest challenges facing society, is a primary 
        goal of ASU President Michael Crow. Three programs under the umbrella 
        of the President's Community Enrichment Program exactly model this idea 
        for the entire university, says Patricia Beaty, vice president, Strategic 
        Planning &amp; Marketing, with the ASU Foundation.</p>
      <p>The programs, Adventures in Learning, Journeys of the Mind and Great 
        Conversations, are tools to enrich the ASU learning experience for community 
        friends and allow them to become engaged in activities and interact with 
        a rich array of faculty talent, she says. </p>
      <p>In the three years since its inception, Adventures in Learning has earned 
        a successful track record among its participants who eagerly line up for 
        its four-to-six-week non-credit course offerings. Participant volunteers 
        open their homes as hosts and give countless hours to organize more than 
        a dozen courses offered each season, said Adrienne Schiffner, program 
        coordinator for Adventures in Learning and Great Conversations.</p>
      <p>Schiffner said while most courses offered are liberal arts based, there 
        is a tremendous shift in course topics from year to year to keep things 
        interesting. Course offerings range from classical literature to the changing 
        environment and origins of humanity, she said, and enrollment is limited 
        to 45. Given the prevailing world events, some topics generate long waiting 
        lists. This year's programs on the Middle East, Latin America, Asia and 
        the Civil War are proving to be among the most popular.</p>
      <p>ASU History Assistant Professor Kyle Longley is teaching a course on 
        United States-Latin American relations in the Adventures in Learning program. 
        He is one of 15 faculty members involved in the 2003 Adventures in Learning 
        series.</p>
      <p>"Most of the participants, mainly retirees, are extremely interested 
        in learning more about this topic because they played a role in its development 
        during their personal careers," Longley said. "Their own experiences really 
        enhance the lecture content and as the instructor, I am finding teaching 
        the class is stimulating and inspiring."<br>
        Great Conversations blends community members with professors and Barrett 
        Honors College students to discuss literary works in small group settings. 
      </p>
      <p>Journeys of the Mind, which attracts hundreds of Valley leaders each 
        year, offers community members an exciting opportunity to learn about 
        progressive research being conducted at ASU. Program coordinator Gena 
        Bonsall said the program links the intellectual energy found the in classroom 
        and laboratory to the issues and challenges facing society. </p>
      <p>"It is so exciting to see how community members are embracing the university 
        because of the knowledge gleaned from this program," said Bonsall. "Journeys 
        of the Mind is much more than just taking a class. It's an insider's look 
        to the hidden treasure within the university. Participants are going back 
        into the community feeling connected to ASU and energized by what we are 
        accomplishing here."<br>
