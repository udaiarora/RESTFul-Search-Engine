      <h2>Quality and convenience: W. P. Carey MBA announces online program</h2>
      <p>        The W. P. Carey MBA at Arizona State University is accepting applications
          for a new graduate degree option at the nationally-ranked school. The
          W. P. Carey MBA - Online Program, a web-based distance-education curriculum,
        will begin classes in January 2004.</p>
      <p>"The purpose of the W. P. Carey
            MBA - Online Program is to offer the challenges of our AACSB-accredited
            program and the expertise of our internationally
          renowned faculty to individuals who cannot come to campus," said Dr.
          Lee McPheters, associate dean for executive and professional programs.
          "We are looking for students who want the dynamic and stimulating educational
          experience that is the W. P. Carey MBA, but have been held back by
        scheduling or other circumstances."</p>
      <p>The school expects to draw many students from
          the metropolitan area as well as other parts of the country and around
          the world. Already, inquiries
          have come in from potential applicants as nearby as Chandler, AZ, and
          as far away as Macao, China.</p>
      <p>The Online Program will offer the quality
          and depth of the W. P. Carey MBA, made more convenient by web-based
        delivery. Admissions standards,
            for example, will match the bar set for all W. P. Carey MBA offerings.
            Online Program students will tackle the same rigorous curriculum
        and study under the same highly regarded faculty. And, because the program
            retains the cohort structure characteristic of the W. P. Carey MBA,
            students will benefit from the advantages of progressing through
        classes
            as a
            community of learners.</p>
      <p>The program will begin with an on-campus, five-day
          orientation including team building with fellow students and faculty
          and an introduction to
          the technology used to deliver course content. Students will then pursue
          the classes at home, at work or on the road, studying when it is convenient. <br>
        <br>
        Unlike mass-marketed online programs, however, the W. P. Carey MBA
          - Online Program will enforce what Faculty Director M. Johnny Rungtusanatham
            calls "time fences." Students will be held to deadlines by quizzes
            and assignments, assuring that they move ahead at the same pace as
          others in their cohort.</p>
      <p>"This approach maximizes convenience, yet develops
            in students the ability to complete assignments on time," Rungtusanatham
            said. "For students
          it will be as if they were working on a project deadline, analogous
        to scenarios they will face in the corporate world."</p>
      <p>The cohort formula has
          been used successfully in the W. P. Carey MBA - Evening Program, which
          boasts one of the highest graduation rates of
          any part-time program in the country. The "time fence" approach has
        worked well in the W. P. Carey MBA - Corporate Program, a customized
        online
          degree for groups of students from one or more companies. </p>
      <p>"A valuable
          lesson we have learned from our sister programs is that students drop
          out if they have no intellectual or emotional support from peers,"
          Rungtusanatham added. "That issue is especially pressing in an online
          program, which by definition tends to isolate individual learners.
        Besides the use of time fences, the Online Program has incorporated many
        deliberate
          mechanisms to minimize isolated individual learners so that our students
          will realize that they are not alone 'out there' . . . there are others
          going through the same experience."</p>

          Program, see wpcareymba.asu.edu/online. To access a photo of Rungtusanatham,
