      <h2>Beyond borders: College partnerships take student teachers international</h2>
      <p>        Undergraduate students in the ASU College of Education are exploring
          the K-12 world overseas through a collaborative effort between the
        college and the International Programs Office.</p>
      <p>This year, the college
            introduced its newest international student teaching program that
        provides an opportunity for students in one of ASU's teacher
          preparation programs to student teach in an accredited international
          school in Costa Rica. </p>
      <p>This is the first year the college's student teaching
          program has collaborated with Lincoln School, a K-12 English-language
          school in San Jose, Costa
          Rica. This fall five students are participating. Carlos Ovando, associate
          dean for Teacher Education in the College of Education and director
        of the program, says experiencing Costa Rica's way of life is one of
        the
          most beneficial factors to the program.</p>
      <p>"By experiencing firsthand the
          sociocultural and linguistic challenges and opportunities of another
          culture, our students become aware of the
          great cultural, linguistic, educational and economic diversity within
          Latin America," he says.</p>
      <p>During the semester-long program, students complete
          all student teaching requirements under the supervision of experienced
          mentor teachers. The
          ASU students also learn about the history and culture of Latin America,
          acquire language skills in Spanish and explore one of the most environmentally
          diverse regions of the world. Students are supervised by carefully
        selected exemplary teachers at Lincoln School and in continuous contact
        with an
          ASU supervisor via e-mail. </p>
      <p>For information about the program visit (<a href="http://courses.ed.asu.edu/ovando/costarica_revised/">http://courses.ed.asu.edu/ovando/costarica_revised/</a>).</p>
      <p>ASU's
          College of Education also offers students the opportunity to teach
        in Brighton, England, through an established, 25-year-old program. Education
          Professor Robert Gryder says students who participate in the program
          offered in exchange with Brighton University (BU), become enriched
        with
          England's culture and academia.<br>
        "This program provides education majors the opportunity to work with
          one of the finest schools located in a beautiful country," he says.
          "This program is ideal for students who want to broaden their educational
          experience."</p>
      <p>The
          program is offered to undergraduate and graduate education majors in
          areas including elementary, secondary, bilingual, early childhood
          and special education. Program participants student teach in Brighton
          for five days a week for eight weeks in January and February. Two weeks
          are available for travel in England or Europe at the end of the student
          teaching assignment. Students then teach in their regular ASU placement
        until school ends in May or June.</p>
      <p>Gryder says there are so many challenges
          educators face that it would be difficult to pinpoint one that would
          apply to every teacher and future
          teacher. However, Gryder says teachers at every level should strive
        to do their best work.</p>
      <p>"One challenge that teachers need to overcome is learning
          how to listen to students - all of the students," he says. "We should
          make every effort
        to bolster their self-esteem and make them a part of the education experience.</p>
      <p>"Many
          people's view about education is based on the chair they're in," Gryder
          adds. "Motivate the students and find the best in them and make
        them better than they imagined they could ever become."</p>
      <p>Ovando says having
          future teachers participate in exchange programs is a great way for
        them to learn new teaching methods, which will help keep
        their students motivated in the classroom.</p>
      <p>"Today's teachers must not
          only know their content areas well, but they also must be strong, creative
          and caring leaders of classroom practices
          that meet the increasingly pluralistic needs of our students in relation
          to teaching standards and high stakes testing," he says. "Exchange
        programs enable future teachers to step outside their cultural comfort
        zones and
          experience the great variation of the human experience in other cultural
        and linguistic contexts."</p>
