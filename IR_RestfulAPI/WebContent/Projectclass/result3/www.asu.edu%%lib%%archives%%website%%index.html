<h4><center>Day of the Refugios</h4>
<h5>by Alberto Ríos</h5>
                
<font size=-1><b><i>In Mexico and Latin America, celebrating one?s 
                Saint?s day instead of one?s birthday is common.
                It is an act of community.</i></center></font>

I was born in Nogales, Arizona,<br>
On the border between<br>
Mexico and the United States.<br>
<p>
The places in between places<br>
They are like little countries<br>
Themselves, with their own holidays
<p>
Taken a little from everywhere.<br>
My Fourth of July is from childhood,<br>
Childhood itself a kind of country, too.
<p>
It?s a place that?s far from me now,<br>
A place I?d like to visit again.<br>
The Fourth of July takes me there.
<p>
In that childhood place and border place<br>
The Fourth of July, like everything else,<br>
It meant more than just one thing.
<p>
In the United States the Fourth of July<br>
It was the United States.<br>
In Mexico it was the día de los Refugios,
<p>
The saint?s day of people named Refugio.<br>
I come from a family of people with names,<br>
Real names, not-afraid names, with colors
<p>
Like the fireworks: Refugio,<br>
Margarito, Matilde, Alvaro, Consuelo,<br>
Humberto, Olga, Celina, Gilberto.
<p>
Names that take a moment to say,<br>
Names you have to practice.<br>
These were the names of saints, serious ones,
<p>
And it was right to take a moment with them.<br>
I guess that?s what my family thought.<br>
The connection to saints was strong:
<p>
My grandmother?s name - here it comes -<br>
Her name was Refugio,<br>
And my great-grandmother?s name was Refugio,
<p>
And my mother-in-law?s name now,<br>
It?s another Refugio, Refugios everywhere,<br>
Refugios and shrimp cocktails and sodas.
<p>
Fourth of July was a birthday party<br>
For all the women in my family <br>
Going way back, a party
<p>
For everything Mexico, where they came from,<br>
For the other words and the green<br>
Tinted glasses my great-grandmother wore.
<p>
These women were me, <br>
What I was before me,<br>
So that birthday fireworks in the evening,
<p>
All for them, <br>
This seemed right.<br>
In that way the fireworks were for me, too.
<p>
Still, we were in the United States now,<br>
And the Fourth of July, <br>
Well, it was the Fourth of July.
<p>
But just what that meant, <br>
In this border place and time,<br>
It was a matter of opinion in my family.
