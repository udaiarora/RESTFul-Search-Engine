Different ways to print a file
</center></h2>
<p>
Assume that you created a text file while logged on the general or on the 
research/statistics cluster.  Now to print that file there are several 
options.  
<ul>
<li>For a remote printer destination defined via the "menu" 
command, use "lpr" at the system prompt to send a file for 
printing to that destination. The command is:
<blockquote>
      <code>lpr file_name</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
<li>For a remote printer that has a queue name but is not defined via the
"menu" command, use "np" at the system prompt to send a file for 
printing to that queue. The command is:
<blockquote>
      <code>np -q queue_name file_name</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
<li>If you are using a terminal emulator (telnet or secure shell) such
as Kermit, EWAN, Exceed, or SSH Secure Shell that supports "ansiprint",
then you may be able to print to your workstation's local (or network attached) printer. The command is:
<blockquote>
	<code>ansiprint file_name</code>
</blockquote>
If the terminal emulator does not support "ansiprint", the file may be
displayed on your monitor instead of getting printed.
<p>
<li>If you are using a workstation with an AFS client (such as the
workstations in the IT-provided computing sites), you can print to the
workstation's local (or network attached) printer. Logon to the workstation
and change to your AFS-drive. You can open any text file in your AFS space
using a local word processor and then print it.   
<p>
<li>You can also access your AFS space with a web browser, by pointing to
the following url:
<blockquote>
	<code>http://www.asu.edu/emma</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
An AFS client is built into Emma. You can use Emma to download a file to
your workstation and then print locally.
<p>
As an alternative to Emma, you can use ftp to transfer a file from your
AFS space to your workstation and then print it.
<p>
<li>If your email messages are accessible from a PC and can be also 
printed from a PC to a local (or network attached) printer, then any 
text file can be sent to your email address and printed.  The command to 
send the text file to your email address is:
<blockquote>
         <code>mail my_email_address@asu.edu &lt; file_name</code>
</blockquote>

</ul>
