By default, SAS/GRAPH output is stored
in SAS catalogs as catalog entries of type GRSEG. These entries can be viewed
and manipulated within the SAS System and, in some operating environments,
can be printed directly as hardcopy. However, you may want to use your SAS/GRAPH output
outside of the SAS System. For example, you may want to </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>import your graphs into other software packages<P>

<LI>use host
system commands or applications to print
or manage your graphs<P>

<LI>run batch processes to create and print multiple
copies of your graphs<P>

<LI>create graphics output and HTML files that enable
you to display SAS/GRAPH output on
the Web.<P>
</UL>

<P>In order to do these kinds of things with your SAS/GRAPH output,
you must export your graphs from SAS/GRAPH,
using a different graphics file format, such as CGM, GIF, or TIFF, and store
them in external files.
<P>For information on creating SAS/GRAPH output
for Web publishing, see <A href="z0696071.htm">Bringing SAS/GRAPH Output to the Web</A>.
For information on SAS/GRAPH language
elements and programs and on how procedure output is generated, see <A href="z0696047.htm">SAS/GRAPH Programs</A>. For information
on using and managing SAS/GRAPH output,
see <A href="z0696063.htm">SAS/GRAPH Output</A>.

<P><A name="z0748194">&#13;
 When you export
SAS/GRAPH output,
you run the output through a device driver that creates a <B>graphics stream
file</B> or GSF. A GSF is an external file that contains graphics commands.
 Typically, you select a device driver that produces the type of graphics
file format that you want, such as CGM, PS or EPS, GIF, or TIFF, although
you can select a driver that sends the output directly to a printer or other
hardcopy device without creating an external file.  You can specify the exact
name and location of each file or assign a default location to which all files
are sent.</A>
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also use the Output Delivery
System (ODS) or SAS/GRAPH device drivers
to generate SAS/GRAPH output as HTML
and GIF files that you can view with a Web browser. Details are discussed
in <A href="z1024732.htm">Using SAS/GRAPH Web Drivers to Create Web Output</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<P>Once you have created a GSF, you can

<P>
<UL>

<LI>print the file using host commands<P>

<LI>view the file with an appropriate viewer or
browser<P>

<LI>edit the file with the appropriate editing software<P>

<LI>import the file into other software
packages.<P>
</UL>
 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A GSF is different from a SAS/GRAPH catalog
entry. A GSF is an external file that is independent of SAS, and a catalog
entry is a type of SAS file. Consequently, you use host commands to manipulate
a GSF independent of the SAS System, whereas you must use the SAS System to
manipulate SAS catalog entries. For example, to view graphics output stored
in a catalog you must use the GREPLAY procedure or the GRAPH window.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>

<P>The type of graphics file format that you choose depends
on how you are going to use the output. If you are planning to import the
graph into other software products, such as Microsoft Excel or Word Perfect,
you may prefer to create a CGM file. These vector-based files are usually
smaller than bitmapped files, and they can be edited. In addition, they use
hardware fonts and provide a clear image on high-resolution devices.
<P>If you want to display the graph on a Web page, or import
it into software that cannot accept vector graphics like CGM, you will need
to create a bitmapped file using a format such as GIF or TIFF. 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HTML and WEBFRAME drivers generate both HTML files and GIF files specifically
for use with a Web browser. For details, see <A href="z1024732.htm">Using SAS/GRAPH Web Drivers to Create Web Output</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<P>Most software packages that process
graphics input can
accept one or more of these file formats.  Check the documentation for the
hardware or software product to which you want to send the graph to determine
what file format or formats it can use.
<P>For a complete list of graphics file formats available
with SAS/GRAPH in your operating environment, refer to the Device Help for SAS/GRAPH in
the SAS Help facility.

<P><A name="z0748231">&#13; There are several ways to send SAS/GRAPH output
to an external file in a different graphics file format. You can export graphics
output in these ways: </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>From the GRAPH window or the Graphics Editor window,
use menu selections to select the type of file format and specify a destination
for the output that is displayed in the window.  When you export SAS/GRAPH output
in this way, you are limited to the types of file formats that the Export
as Image window supports in your operating environment. For details see <A href="zractive.htm">Exporting SAS/GRAPH Output Interactively</A>.
<P><B>Operating Environment Information:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Windows operating
environments, WMF formats cannot be exported using
this method.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><P>

<LI>Use SAS/GRAPH program
statements to direct the output to a graphics stream file. When you use program
statements to create a GSF, you explicitly specify a SAS/GRAPH device
driver. This driver can be one of the drivers supplied with SAS/GRAPH software
and stored in SASHELP.DEVICES, or a custom driver that you have created. 
For details see <A href="zort-gsf.htm">Exporting SAS/GRAPH Output with Program Statements</A>.<P>

<LI>Create a custom device driver that contains all
of the commands for producing a GSF.  For details see <A href="z0762619.htm">Exporting SAS/GRAPH Output Using Modified Device Entries</A>.<P>

<LI>Use the
SAS/GRAPH web
drivers or the Output Delivery System to create HTML and GIF files. For details
see <A href="z0696071.htm">Bringing SAS/GRAPH Output to the Web</A>.<P>
