      <p><strong>Arizona Students Ready to Buggy Across the 'Moon' as Teams Gear Up For NASA's 11th Annual Great Moonbuggy Race, April 2-3</strong></p>
      <p>TEMPE, Ariz .- April 2, 2004- Arizona students are getting ready to "buggy" this weekend. No, it's not for Spring Break, rather it's NASA's 11 th Annual Great Moonbuggy Race, attracting students from three local high schools and Arizona State University (ASU) this weekend. </p>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/moonbuggytesting.jpg" width="216" height="162" align="right">The Moon Devils, ASU's competing moonbuggy team from the ASU NASA Space Grant Program in the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, are made up of twelve ASU undergrads with majors ranging from accounting to engineering. These students have spent the last year preparing for this weekend's competition and working with students from three valley high schools to develop a competitive high school moonbuggy program for Arizona. </p>
      <p>"We've always done outreach and seen the kids' excitement," said Benjamin Higgins, aerospace engineering junior and Moon Devil co-leader. "They have wanted to participate in the race but have not had the means or experience to start their own team." The new high school team will be bringing their moonbuggy to this year's competition. "It has been great to see how far the high school team has come in such a short time," said Higgins. </p>
      <p>Prizes for the moonbuggy race go to the top-three finishing teams in both divisions. A design award goes to the team in each division that represents the best technical approach toward solving the engineering problem of navigating the lunar surface. Last year, ASU students received the "Best Pit Crew" and the well respected "Best Engineering Design" award. </p>
      <p>"This year we want to take the ASU team to the next level," said Higgins. While the ASU Moon Devil team has been successful in creating innovative designs in the past, this year's goals include attaining the shortest combined set-up and race time. This year will also mark ASU's 10 th year participating in the race. </p>
      <p>Altogether, student teams from 18 states and Puerto Rico will be traveling to the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama this weekend to compete in the annual moonbuggy race, a vehicle race across more than a half-mile of simulated lunar terrain. This year, 32 college teams and 37 high school teams have worked long hours, designing, building and testing moonbuggy vehicles to participate in this year's competition. </p>
      <p>The competition is a grueling endurance test that includes twists, turns and inclines, as well as simulated moon craters, rocks, lava ridges and soil. Students have to deal with real-life, real-time situations of buggies breaking and repairing them, and sometimes the heartbreak of not being able to fix them. Like the moon's actual terrain, the course is tough, and the two buggy drivers who power the vehicle must be in top athletic condition. To be fit for the race, drivers perform physical conditioning exercises and practice riding the buggy before competing. </p>
      <p>But just to get into the race, teams of students work from the beginning of the school year to configure moonbuggies in much the same way that NASA engineers design space equipment. Student buggies must fit in a container no larger than 4 feet by 4 feet by 4 feet before it's assembled. Two racers, one male and one female, must lift and carry the unassembled moonbuggy 20 feet, without any assistance, and assemble the vehicle while being timed. Many teams use lightweight materials, bicycle gearing systems and bicycle wheels to pull together what they hope will be an award winner.&nbsp; Just like NASCAR, the teams even have pit crews ready to repair buggies that suffer damage while trekking the course's rough terrain. </p>
      <p>"The students learn some valuable lessons in this challenge that will prepare them for the future," said Durlean Bradford, Great Moonbuggy Race coordinator in the education department at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville. "They have to work hard to get to the race. The design, fabrication and building of the buggies test their engineering and math skills. They also may learn a greater understanding about what teamwork can achieve, and all that it takes to the get the job done." </p>
      <p>The competition was inspired by the original lunar rover team of the 1960s, in an effort managed by the Marshall Center. That team had the challenge to design and build a compact, light, flexible and durable vehicle that would carry astronauts on the moon's surface during the Apollo missions. They met the challenge, as astronauts used separate lunar rovers on the final three moon missions -- Apollo 15, 16 and 17 -- to travel 52.51 miles (84.5 kilometers), gather 620.6 pounds (281.5 kilograms) of rock and soil samples, and return them to Earth. </p>
