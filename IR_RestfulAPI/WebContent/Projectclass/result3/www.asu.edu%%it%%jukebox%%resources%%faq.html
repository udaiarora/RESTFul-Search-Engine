                  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                  <p>There are many resources and options available for those who wish to publish webpages at ASU. From personal webspace to online course websites, this page attempts to be a gateway leading you to information about ASU's diverse Web-offerings.</p>
                  <h3>Basics</h3>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>I want webspace on the Web server. Where do I start?</strong><ul><li>All the information you need is in the Webpages section of the Jukebox at <a href="../webpages">http://www.asu.edu/jukebox/webpages</a>. The process you follow and what type of space you get (and where) can vary depending on what you plan to use your webspace for. ASU departments can find information on getting webspace at <a href="../webpages/departmental.html">http://www.asu.edu/jukebox/webpages/departmental.html</a></li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>What is an ASURITE UserID?</strong><ul><li>Your ASURITE UserID is the ID you were assigned or chose when you self-subscribed to ASU computing services.  You will need your ASURITE UserID to access many computing resources at ASU. This ID is <i>not</i> your ASU ID, the ID comprised of numbers. It's the ID that starts with three or more lower-case letters. If you haven't self-subscribed yet, you do not have an ASURITE UserID. Get all the details at the Computer Accounts page at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/computeraccounts/">http://www.asu.edu/computeraccounts/</a>.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>I forgot my ASURITE password! How can I get it reset?</strong><ul><li>Computer Accounts can reset your password for you. You'll need to visit one of their offices (there's one on every campus) with a picture ID. For more information, visit the IT HelpDesk page at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/helpdesk/">http://www.asu.edu/helpdesk/</a>.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>How much space do I get? How can I get more?</strong><ul><li>All users start with either 5 or 10 Megabytes of personal AFS space. The IT HelpDesk processes requests for quota increases. Visit the IT HelpDesk page at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/it/tempe/cac/accounts/quota.htm">http://www.asu.edu/it/tempe/cac/accounts/quota.htm</a>.</li><li>Department webspace is currently provided at the VP unit level.  Webmaster's at the VP/College level can request quota increases by submitting the <a href="#" onClick="webquota = window.open('http://www.asu.edu/mailbox/requests/web_quota.htm', 'webquota', 'WIDTH=400,HEIGHT=615');">Quota Increase Request Form.</a></li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>Where can I find information on creating Web pages?</strong><ul><li>Start with the &quot;Web Basics&quot; section of the Jukebox at <a href="../webpages/beginners.html">http://www.asu.edu/it/jukebox/webpages/beginners.html</a>. Then explore the rest of the Jukebox at <a href="/jukebox">http://www.asu.edu/jukebox/</a>. You'll find a wealth of information and links to good Web design resources within these pages.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>I can use my webspace for anything I want, right?</strong><ul><li>No! The web services provided by ASU are intended for academic use. Since these services are provided on a state-funded resource, you cannot conduct or advertise commercial business within your webspace. Nor can you use your webspace for illegal activities, such as copyright violations, illegal harassment, or publishing material of a sexually explicit nature. See the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html">ASU Computer, Internet, and Electronic Communications Policy</a> for full details.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>What happens to my space when I go away for the summer or graduate?</strong><ul><li>If a student does not attend classes during a fall or spring semester, their account will be suspended after registration ends for that semester (21st day). If a student has graduated, they may keep their basic services active for up to one year past their date of graduation. This is NOT done automatically however, it requires the student to request this from the Computer Accounts Office. This may be done by email, phone, or in person. A students ASU ID number is required in order to verify the date of graduation.<p>Please note that basic services includes access to:</p><ol><li>General Purpose UNIX servers (general.asu.edu)</li><li>IT Computing sites</li><li>AFS Filespace</li><li>Email Storage</li></ol><p>A student will also be able to keep their web page active during that time (WWW service). This does NOT include PPP access. If you have any further questions regarding access to computing facilities at ASU, don't hesitate to contact the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/computeraccounts/">Computer Accounts Office</a>.</p></li></ul></li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>Public Webspace</h3>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Can I change my URL?</strong><ul><li>Your URL is based on your ASURITE UserID. In order to change your URL, you would have to change your ASURITE UserID. This is done by Computer Accounts only under extreme circumstances. You can reach Computer Accounts by phone at (480) 965-1211, or by email at Computer.Accounts@asu.edu.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>How do I get into the Homepages Directory at http://www.asu.edu/asuweb/directory/homepages?</strong><ul><li>Right on the front page of the Home Pages Directory, there's a link that says "Add My Page". Click that link, fill out the form, and press [Submit]. Your page will appear in the directory (under your last name) within a day or two. Note: Only home pages that are resident on ASU Web servers are accepted into the directory.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>How do I get out of (or edit my entry in) the Homepages Directory?</strong><ul><li>Submit the Homepages Directory Request Form with a description of your request. Be sure to include your URL and your last name so we can find your entry to delete it (or modify it).</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>I found this cool CGI script on the Web (or I wrote one of my own). Can I use it in my Web space?</strong><ul><li>Not yet. We aren't currently enabling CGI on the www.public server. There are several security issues to work out first -- to make sure, for instance, that a script from somebody else's space can write into his/her own directory but not into yours. The nature of our file system complicates this, but we consider it a good trade-off for the security our users have as a result. Presently, we plan to make a public CGI server available sometime in the future. These are preliminary plans, and more information will be published on the Jukebox when these plans are more firm. In the meantime, you might want to look at the CGIs we've enabled for ASU Web servers -- all the information is on the Jukebox at http://www.asu.edu/jukebox/cgi. We've found that these scripts cover about 80% of what people want to do with their public space.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>My counter used to work. Now it doesn't. I use Netscape Composer, Microsoft FrontPage, or some other Web editing program. What could be wrong?</strong><ul><li>You're the victim of a dumb Web editing program that thinks it's smart. Your program changed the reference of your counter to a plain image link. You could change some options in your program to get around this, but the easiest way to fix it is to use an absolute URL for the counter, rather than a relative one. Like this: &lt;img src="http://cgi.asu.edu/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?df=mycounter.dat"&gt;</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>I need more Web space! What can I do?</strong><ul><li>The IT HelpDesk processes requests for quota increases. Visit the IT HelpDesk page at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/it/tempe/cac/accounts/quota.htm">http://www.asu.edu/it/tempe/cac/accounts/quota.htm</a>.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>I receive a "Not Found" error, or I see a directory listing, but when I click on a file (such as index.html) I receive an error.</strong><ul><li>Run the <a href="https://www-sec.asu.edu/cgi-bin/it/publicweb/fix.cgi">Fixpage</a> CGI Script</li></ul></li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>Uploading Files</h3>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>How do I get my Web pages from my computer to my AFS space?</strong><ul><li>You can transfer them by SFTP to general.asu.edu, or you can even use a Unix-based editor on general.asu.edu to create your pages if you prefer. Full details can be found on the Jukebox at http://www.asu.edu/jukebox/uploading.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>Where can I learn how to FTP my pages to my space?</strong><ul><li>On the Jukebox at http://www.asu.edu/jukebox/uploading.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>I want to use Netscape Composer, Microsoft FrontPage, or some other Web editing program. How do I publish to my space?</strong><ul><li>Most Web editing programs now tout a "one-button publishing" option. The ASU Web servers our team administers do not support the PUT method required to publish to your URL, and due to new security considerations no longer support non-SFTP one-button publishing. Many of the newest versions of popular editing programs are beginning to support SFTP for uploading webpages, but most current and earlier versions do not. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Details on uploading with SFTP can be found here: http://www.asu.edu/jukebox/uploading. </li></ul></li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>URL Problems</h3>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>When I enter the URL of my website, I get "Not Found". What gives?</strong><ul><li><strong>Public space:</strong> Your URL will return "Not Found" if there are no files in your Web space, or if you haven't completed all the Webpages steps at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/jukebox/webpages">http://www.asu.edu/jukebox/webpages</a>, or if the AFS file server containing your files is down (as in the case of a maintenance outage). If you know your Web space is set up properly, you can check AFS file server status by contacting the Help Desk at (480) 965-6500.  If the AFS file servers are working, try running the <a href="https://www-sec.asu.edu/cgi-bin/it/publicweb/fix.cgi">FIXPAGE</a> script.  You can do this through the web at <a href="https://www-sec.asu.edu/cgi-bin/it/publicweb/fix.cgi">https://www-sec.asu.edu/cgi-bin/it/publicweb/fix.cgi</a>.</li><li><strong>Department space:</strong>  Your URL will return "Not found" if the AFS file server containing your files is down (as in the case of a maintenance outage). You can check AFS file server status by contacting the Help Desk at (480) 965-6500.  If the AFS file servers are working, contact the IT Helpdesk for more information.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>When I enter the URL of my website, I get "Forbidden". What gives?</strong><ul><li><strong>Public space:</strong> This indicates a permissions problem on your webspace; the Web server is not being allowed to open your files and send them to the browser. Visit <a href="https://www-sec.asu.edu/cgi-bin/it/publicweb/fix.cgi">https://www-sec.asu.edu/cgi-bin/it/publicweb/fix.cgi</a> to fix your webspace permissions.</li><li><strong>Department space:</strong> This indicates a permissions problem within your Web space; the Web server is not being allowed to open your department's files and send them to the browser. Contact the IT Helpdesk for more information.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>My home page or website doesn't come up. I get "Index" followed by a list of my documents. What gives?</strong><ul><li>Your home page (or the first page you want a viewer to see) should be named index.html or index.htm. The Web server looks for index.html or index.htm when serving your URL. If no such file exists, the Web server will display a listing of all files in your directory. Rename your home page to index.html and it will come up automatically. Note: No upper-case letters in that filename -- the Web server is case-sensitive! Also, if both index.html and index.htm exist, index.html will have priority.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>I just graduated/dropped out/quit working at the university. My URL doesn't work. What gives?</strong><ul><li><strong>Public space:</strong> When you leave the university, so does your ASURITE account! ASU alumni can request continuation of their computing services for one year after graduation; exiting staff, please contact Computer Accounts, phone (480) 965-1211 or email Computer.Accounts@asu.edu. For current Computer Accounts information, visit the Computer Accounts page at http://www.asu.edu/computeraccounts/.</li><li><strong>Department space:</strong> Please see the answer to this question under the Department Webspace category.</li></ul></li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>Organization Websites</h3>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>I need a website for a faculty or staff organization. Where do I start?</strong><ul><li>You have two options: <ul><li>A site hosted under www.asu.edu/assn</li><li>A site hosted within myASU.</li></ul>To get either type of site setup for your organization, you should first register your organization with the Office of the Provost. Information on registering your organization and an online registration form are available at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/provost/forms/facgroups/">http://www.asu.edu/provost/forms/facgroups/</a>. Next, you need to decide which location will best suit your needs. Once you've decided, if you prefer a website under www.asu.edu/assn, submit an email request to <a href="mailto:web-q@asu.edu">web-q@asu.edu</a> being sure to include the name and description of your organization. Or, if you prefer a website within myASU, fill out the request form within the myASU documentation website.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>What is the difference between having my organization website hosted under www.asu.edu/assn and having it hosted within myASU?</strong><ul><li>The primary difference is that sites under www.asu.edu/assn are open to the world while sites hosted within myASU are restricted to ASU Affiliates with an ASURITE UserID. If your site is hosted under www.asu.edu/assn, anyone who can connect to ASU's web server www.asu.edu can view your organization's website. Another difference is that myASU offers functionality that is not available to sites hosted on www.asu.edu. Within an organization website in myASU, it is possible to host a discussion board, offer real-time chat sessions, and share files easily.</li></ul></li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>Class Websites</h3>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>I want to publish a website for my class. Where do I start?</strong><ul><li>You have many options. It depends on how much functionality you want your class website to have. Other questions and answers on this page will help better answer this question.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>I want to have a class website but all I want to do is provide a place where students can download my syllabus and perhaps a few powerpoint files with class notes. Where should my site be hosted?</strong><ul><li>It may be easiest for you to have your class website hosted in your personal webspace on www.public.asu.edu or from your class' <a href="../webpages/instructional.html">Instructor Volume</a>. See information in the Jukebox for details on how to set up your personal webspace or <a href="../webpages/instructional.html">Instructor Volume webspace</a>.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>I want a class website with chat capability, functionality for threaded discussions, and the ability for students and myself to share files back and forth with relative ease. Where should my site be hosted?</strong><ul><li>You will want to host your site within myASU, the university's Blackboard installation. Check out Instruction Support's myASU information page for more details on how to get started with a class website in myASU.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>I want my class website to be password-protected with minimal effort.</strong><ul><li>You may want to investigate hosting your class website on myASU since it requires students to sign-on with their ASURITE UserID and password before they can view your class materials. Plus, only students that are "enrolled" in your class within myASU will have access to your class website. Check out Instruction Support's myASU information page for more details on how to get started with a class website in myASU. You can, however, set up password protection on directories and/or files in your personal space (on www.public.asu.edu) if that is where you host your class website. Details on securing your public space can be found within the Jukebox <a href="../toolbox/protectingspace.html">Toolbox</a>.</li></ul></li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>Department Webspace (on www.asu.edu)</h3>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>My department wants/needs space on ASU's Web server. Where do I start?</strong><ul><li>All the information you need is in the Department Webpages section of the Jukebox at <a href="../webpages/departmental.html">http://www.asu.edu/it/jukebox/webpages/departmental.html</a>.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>What is the URL for my department's website?</strong><ul><li>Your Uniform Resource Locator, or URL, will most likely be <i>http://www.asu.edu/&lt;vp_unit_or_college&gt;/&lt;dept_name&gt;</i>, where <i>&lt;vp_unit_or_college&gt;</i> is the acronym for the VP unit or college which houses your department and where &lt;dept_name&gt; is an acronym or short form of your department's name. For instance, the URL for the website of ASU's Department of English (a department in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences) is http://www.asu.edu/clas/english/.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>Can I change the URL for my department's website?</strong><ul><li>Yes, often departments require shorter URLs than those supplied by the convention for ASU URLs detailed in answer #2 directly above. We can set up these shorter URLs one of two ways, via a <strong>URL alias</strong> or via a <strong>URL forward/redirect</strong>, both of which can be requested by submitting an email to <a href="mailto:web-q@asu.edu">web-q@asu.edu</a> including the URL that you have and the URL that you would like. See <strong>What is a URL alias? What is a URL forward</strong> below for more information.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>What is a URL alias? What is a URL forward?</strong><ul><li>A <i>URL alias</i> "masks" your department website's actual URL to be <i>http://www.asu.edu/&lt;dept_name&gt;</i> even though your files live at <i>http://www.asu.edu/&lt;vp_unit_or_college&gt;/&lt;dept_name&gt;</i>. Visitors to your site will see the URL <i>http://www.asu.edu/&lt;dept_name&gt;</i> in their browser. A <i>URL forward</i> lets web visitors type in <i>http://www.asu.edu/&lt;dept_name&gt;</i> but they are immediately "pushed" or redirected to <i>http://www.asu.edu/&lt;vp_unit_or_college&gt;/&lt;dept_name&gt;</i> and that is the URL that shows up in their browser.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>My department's website is hosted on our own department web server. Can we get a "pointer" URL on www.asu.edu that sends people to our "real" website?</strong><ul><li>Yes. Please submit a request for an Alias/Redirect to <a href="mailto:web-q@asu.edu">web-q@asu.edu</a> for a <b>URL forward</b> from <i>www.asu.edu/&lt;dept_name&gt;</i> to the location/URL of the website on your department's server.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>I think my department's website has run out of disk space. Can I get more?</strong><ul><li>Yes. Please submit a request for a quota increase to <a href="mailto:web-q@asu.edu">web-q@asu.edu</a>.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>Where can I find information on creating Web pages?</strong><ul><li>Start with the "Web Basics" section of the Jukebox at <a href="../webpages/beginners.html">http://www.asu.edu/it/jukebox/webpages/beginners.html</a>. Then explore the rest of the Jukebox at <a href="../">http://www.asu.edu/it/jukebox</a>. You'll find a wealth of information and links to good Web design sources within these pages.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>Are there restrictions on what type of material my department can post on its website?</strong><ul><li>Yes, there are restrictions. Department webspace cannot be used to promote commercial business activity of any kind. Nor can department webspace be used for illegal activities, such as copyright violations, illegal harassment, or publishing material of a sexually explicit nature. See the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html">ASU Computer, Internet, and Electronic Communications Policy</a> for full details.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><strong>What happens to my department's webspace when I leave my job at the university?</strong><ul><li>Department webspace does not &quot;expire&quot; the way that ASU public webspace does. Instead, directory permissions are changed giving the appropriate ASU employee access to a particular department's webspace.
