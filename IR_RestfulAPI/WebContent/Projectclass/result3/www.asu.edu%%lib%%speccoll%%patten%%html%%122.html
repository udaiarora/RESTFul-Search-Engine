<h2>
Gerard, John</h2>
1545-1612
<p><i><font size=+1>The Herball, or, Generall Historie of Plantes.</font></i>
<p>Gathered by John Gerarde. Very much enlarged and amended by Thomas Johnson.
London: Printed by Adam Islip, Joice Norton and Richard Whitakers [sic],
anno 1633. Often referred to as <i>Gerard emaculatus</i> or Johnson's <i>Gerard</i>.
The first leaf and the final leaf are blank. Four pages between 30 and
31 incorrectly numbered 29-30, 29-30. Includes indexes. Bibliography included
in "To the reader," prelim. p. [20]-[32]. "A catalogue of the Brittish
[i.e. Welsh] names of plants, sent me by Master Robert Dauyes of Guissaney
in Flint- shire:" p. [31]-[32] at end. Last printed page (7B5 verso) contains
"Errata" (with corresponding catchword on preceding page); in a later issue
the errata is replaced by "An aduertisement to the readers" (without a
catchword). References: STC 11751; Hunt 223. Second ed. Of the herball;
first ed. Of Johnson's corrected and expanded verso--Cf. Hunt 223.
<p>This edition, enlarged and amended by Thomas Johnson, is considered
superior to the 1597 ed. that had so many errors.&nbsp; Gerard's Herball
is certainly one of the delights of the English language and it continues
to be reprinted despite its outmoded medical recommendations.&nbsp; It
is very likely that the number of copies printed in the 20th century far
outnumber those printed in the 16th and 17th centuries.&nbsp; Gerard's
Herball is actually Dodoen's Herbal done into English, including English
manners and substance.&nbsp; While Gerard's expertise as a surgeon is debatable,
his genius with language is not.
