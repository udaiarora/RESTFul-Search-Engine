Lanham, MD: The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1999.

Huhndorf references other works in her examples of how &ldquo;going native&rdquo; regenerates the ideas and justifications of European-American hegemony. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p><strong><em> Indian Images in Commerce</em></strong> , Gregory A. Reinhardt. Weston, CONN: Pictures of Records, Inc., 2000. This collection of slides was used as a material-culture essay about how conventional images of Indians have been used commercially throughout the world. The slides illustrate how non-Indians have exploited Indian images to sell or advertise products by depicting Indians in various contexts, re-enforcing stereotypes that have and continue to denigrate Indians. Themes used in describing Indian images range from &ldquo;The Respectable Indian&rdquo; to &ldquo;The Enigmatic Indian.&rdquo; </p>

                  <p><strong><em> Playing Indian</em></strong> , Philip J. Deloria. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001. This book examines the ways in which imagining Indians has been used to shape national American identity. Some examples studied are the Boston Tea Party, Campfire Girls, Boy Scouts, and Grateful Dead concerts. Deloria explores these identities throughout American history and how each era has appropriated and deprived Indians of their identity for the sake of constructing an American one. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p><strong><em> Selling the Indian: Commercializing &amp; Appropriating American Indian Cultures</em></strong> , Carter Jones Meyer and Diana Royer, eds. Tucson: The University of Arizona Press, 2001.

Issues of economic need, cultural integrity and self-determination are integrated with the discussion of marketing the Indian. Stereotypes mentioned include the &ldquo;casino Indian,&rdquo; the &ldquo;environmentalist Indian,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Indian Princess,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;wise Indian elder.&rdquo; </p>
                  <br>
