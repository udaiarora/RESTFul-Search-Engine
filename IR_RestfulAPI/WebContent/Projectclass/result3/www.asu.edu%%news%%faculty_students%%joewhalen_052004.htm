      <h2>Student receives MBA a year late, but much more grateful </h2>
      <p>On Aug. 7, 2002, Joe Whalen was on his way toward a business career that he had planned and prepared for carefully. He was about to start his second and final year in the W. P. Carey MBA program and was wrapping up a challenging summer internship. </p>
      <p>But as he drove home from a workout at the Student Recreation Complex, a drunk driver altered his plans, slamming into the driver's side door of Whalen's car as he waited to make a left turn. </p>
      <p>"The next thing I knew, it was 10 days later and I was lying in a hospital bed," Whalen says. </p>
      <p>Whalen suffered profound injuries in the crash, including a stroke brought on by the trauma to his head, a collapsed lung, broken bones and a torn aorta. Whalen was in the hospital for 53 days, and the months that followed were devoted to occupational, physical and cognitive therapy to rebuild his body. </p>
      <p>Behind him were years of preparation, as he had been student body president at the University of South Florida and had received a law degree from the University of Miami. He had planned to combine his legal training with an MBA to carve out a career in e-business. </p>
      <p>By spring of 2003, he was ready to attempt school again. Judy Heilala, director of MBA programs, and Georgia Musgrave, MBA student services director, helped Whalen set up a schedule of classes that allowed him to complete the W. P. Carey MBA. It took him a year longer than he planned, but he received his degree May 13 and is grateful for what he has learned. </p>
      <p>"This year I've worked as hard as I've ever worked in my life - I'm a completely different person," Whalen says. "Before the accident I took what God gave me for granted. I had always been a straight A student, and it came fairly easily. This year I got a lot more education - and gained more competence - because I worked as hard as I possibly could, and I got a lot of gratification out of it. Now I work as hard as I can to take advantage of my blessings." </p>
      <p>Farquhar, with the W. P. Carey School of Business, can be reached at (480) 965-7774 or (liz.farquhar@asu.edu). </p>
