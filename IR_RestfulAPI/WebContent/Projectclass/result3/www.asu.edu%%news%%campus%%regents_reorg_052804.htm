      <h2>Regents propose dramatic plan to reorganize state university system </h2>
      <p align="left">The president of the Board of Regents has proposed historic changes in the state university system, creating three regional universities in addition to the research universities. The proposal was developed to accommodate Arizona's explosive population growth and increase access to higher education. </p>
      <p align="left">Under the proposal by Regents President Chris Herstam, the West campus of ASU would become a university tentatively called Central Arizona University. It would become part of a regional system that would include Northern Arizona University and a newly formed Southern Arizona University made up of NAU-Yuma and the University of Arizona's Douglas and Sierra Vista campuses. </p>
      <p align="left">The Regents will hold a public meeting at 9 a.m., June 3, in the Memorial Union Alumni Lounge to determine whether to go ahead with a feasibility study on the reorganization proposal. If authorized, the study will be presented to the board within a year, after which the Regents will decide whether to go forward. </p>
      <p align="left">The three state universities will participate in the planning effort. If implemented, the earliest date changes could occur would be August 2006. </p>
      <p align="left">"This is an unprecedented opportunity to step back, thoroughly examine where Arizona's universities are and where they are heading, and to plan for the best future for all of us," said ASU President Michael Crow. </p>
      <p align="left">"Arizona's infrastructure for four-year colleges and universities is vastly under-built for its current population and does not offer the range of higher education opportunities most states enjoy. The current university system will be overwhelmed by the projected increase in the number of state high school graduates in the decades to come if it is not expanded." </p>
      <p>Forty-three percent more Arizona high school seniors will be eligible for college admission 15 years from now, when ASU's projected enrollment would reach 90,000 students. Even under the proposed plan, ASU will enroll about 70,000. </p>
      <p>The proposed reorganization would allow ASU and UA to continue on the path to becoming strong research institutions. The regional universities would focus on undergraduate education, also offering master's degrees and, in the case of NAU, some doctoral programs. Without the costs of research, they might also offer lower tuition. </p>
      <p>At a forum at the West campus May 24, Milton Glick, ASU executive vice president and provost, urged the faculty and staff to engage in designing the restructuring of higher education. Glick said that the university will need to focus on three tasks simultaneously. </p>
      <p>"First, run and improve today's university," he said. "Second, move forward with implementing the decisions arising out of Dr. Crow's response to the University Design Team. And third, develop the model for higher education in Arizona, a decade or more in the future." </p>
      <p>"I felt the forum was a very open and productive way to initiate the process of dialogue and deliberation that will be taking place over the coming months," said Mark Searle, vice provost for academic affairs at the West campus and recently named West provost. "As a university, we are committed to the open and frank exchange of ideas that was very much in evidence at the meeting." </p>
      <p>Diane McCarthy, ASU Alumni Association president who has a long history in the West Valley as president of WESTMARC, sees the proposal as an opportunity for the West campus to position itself as a major force in the metropolitan area. </p>
      <p>"West (campus) can take a huge, quantum leap forward by becoming a stand-alone institution," said McCarthy. "It can expand its influence to become the focal point for education in the <br>
  West Valley." </p>
      <p>In a statement to employees, Crow emphasized his continuing support for the West campus. </p>
      <p>"The West campus is a highly valued part of the university, and we will continue to operate as though West will remain a part of ASU," he said. "Whether it remains a part of ASU or becomes a stand-alone university, the West campus will continue to serve the state, to expand its enrollment and to enhance its academic offerings. </p>
      <p>"We will continue to implement the university redesign announced in April, continue to develop a school-centric system, and continue to recruit an increasingly diverse student body. ASU will continue to build our model of the New American University." </p>
