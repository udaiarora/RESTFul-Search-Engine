<P>In a relatively short time in the history of civilized societies, humankind moved from what was essentially an agrarian population into an industrial age, which in recent years has been profoundly shaped by such scientific and technological advances as genetic engineering, the computer, and space exploration.  Our history of irrepressible ingenuity makes a compelling case for a future that will be even more profoundly influenced by science and technology.  It is imperative that we react expeditiously and effectively to the problems and the promise that these advances create.  We must ensure that technological change is directed to the benefit of society and that it will promote human dignity and values.  Success in achieving this goal will depend upon the insight and knowledge of political and public opinion leaders, and the scientific enlightenment of educated citizens.  To a significant degree, the ability of these individuals to understand the nature of the issues and the alternative courses of action will be determined by the quality of science presented at the nation's institutions of higher learning.

<P>The recommendation of at least one laboratory course that includes a substantial introduction to the fundamental behavior of matter and energy in physical or biological systems derives from a number of considerations.  First, all physical and biological phenomena have at their roots the fundamental principles governing the behavior of matter and energy.  These principles have been shown over a period of time to be a value in reliably predicting and rationalizing a broad range of phenomena.  Unless the lines to these roots are established, our understanding of the broader range of the sciences, and other fields upon which these sciences impinge, will be impaired.  Second, because these fundamental principles have been experimentally established beyond reasonable doubt, the essentials of the scientific method can be clearly and coherently revealed by their study.  Third, the study of the behavior of matter and energy illustrates the usefulness of mathematics in precisely describing and rationalizing certain physical phenomena, and the expressiveness of mathematical equation.
