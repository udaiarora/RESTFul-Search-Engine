<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Primary Responsibility to a Faculty Member&#146;s Field</B></FONT>

<P>
The <A HREF="acd002.html#facultymember" TARGET="New">faculty member</A>, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advance of knowledge, recognizes the special responsibilities placed upon faculty members.  The primary responsibility to one&#146;s field is to seek and to state the truth as one sees it.  To this end, the faculty member devotes time and energy to developing and improving scholarly competence.  The faculty member accepts, as well, the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in extending and transmitting knowledge.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Assigned Duties at the University</B></FONT>

<P>
The duties of a faculty member consist of those responsibilities assigned by the <A HREF="acd002.html#president" TARGET="New">president</A> or appropriate administrator, such as the executive vice president and provost of the university, <A HREF="acd002.html#vicepresident" TARGET="New">vice president</A>, dean, director, or <A HREF="acd002.html#departmentchair" TARGET="New">department chair</A>. Teaching assignments, schedules, and other instructional responsibilities (e.g., maintaining office hours, meeting class in accordance with college policies at all regularly scheduled times and places) shall be carried out under the direction of the president.  Duties and responsibilities shall be related to the expertise and competence of the faculty member and may include sponsored or unsponsored research projects, public service activities, committee assignments, or administrative functions.  Within the parameters of a faculty member&#146;s assigned responsibilities, he or she shall have the privileges and responsibilities expressed in the <A HREF="acd002.html#board" TARGET="New">board</A>-approved statement contained in the <A HREF="acd002.html#NoticeofAppointment" TARGET="New">notice of appointment</A>.  Teaching, research, and service performance shall be considered in decisions relating to compensation, retention, promotion, termination, or decisions not to rehire.

<P>
A breach of this policy by a faculty member may be considered in any decision relating to that person&#146;s promotion, retention, termination, or salary.

<P>
As a member of the institution, the faculty member should seek above all to be an effective scholar and teacher.  The stated regulations of the institution are to be observed, provided they do not contravene <A HREF="acd002.html#academicfreedom" TARGET="New">academic freedom</A>.  The right to seek revision is maintained.
