<h3>
Security Reminder: This Means YOU!</h3>

We are all aware of the need to keep our antivirus software up to date, and many of us have seen the alert box from McAfee when it finds a virus. Hackers, however, are stealthier than viruses; they can gain access to your workstation and use it for their purposes without your realizing the machine has been compromised. Because they install legitimate remote-access software to gain control of your computer, your antivirus program will not detect their activities. Prevention is the key to avoiding their mischief. 

Recent hacking incidents in the library indicate a need for everyone to check their Windows 2000 computer for compliance with some basic security procedures. Hackers exploit user accounts that have no passwords, or passwords that are the same as the user name. Preventing this is simple: check that all user accounts on your computer have passwords (preferably secure passwords that contain a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters), and that the password is not the same as the user name on any account. If you are not confident that your user accounts are secure, please have Keith Swartz check this for you. Otherwise you may find that your workstation has become an ftp server for a hacker?s files!

<h3>Visitor Information Comes Together</h3>

The ASU Libraries system can be daunting, especially to our non-ASU affiliated (community) users. To better serve these customers and help them navigate our system, Linda Shackle and Library Services Council have compiled a visitor information page that covers almost anything a visitor to the libraries would need to know. The page presents information about the libraries at all branches and all campuses. This includes locations and hours, services and resources available, and even recommended visitor parking lots!  It ends with a section on "Frequently asked questions".  

The visitor pages are now linked from the Library Information and Services page, under "Services for the Community": <a href=http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/services.htm#community>http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/services.htm#community</a>. The main visitor page - <a href=http://www.asu.edu/lib/help/visitors.htm>http://www.asu.edu/lib/help/visitors.htm</a> - will also have a quick link from the home page soon.

<h3>ERR Meeting Highlights</h3>

<b>Streaming Video</b> - The project to replace videotaped courses with online digital video is on track for Fall semester. 
<P>
<b>Scholars Portal</b> - The portal will be up and running this fall, with a unique name and look tailored to ASU and functionality that will allow users to search multiple library catalogs, internet search engines, and databases simultaneously -- try it at 
<a href=http://zportal.lib.asu.edu/zportal>http://zportal.lib.asu.edu/zportal</a> ("Sign In" as username: ARU, password: [none]). 
<p>
<b>Web Access Management (Proxy Server) Update</b> - We have directed all Serials Solutions links through the proxy server as a test.  Both the 'static' e-journal pages, as well as the dynamically generated "find" search at <a href=http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/ejournals.htm>http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/ejournals.htm</a> send all users through the proxy server.  On-campus users are passed directly through, while off-campus users are asked to authenticate with their library name, number and PIN.  So far, the system has handled the increased traffic without a problem.
<p>
<b>INNOVATIVE Interfaces Beta Test update</b> - Upgrading to INNOPAC Release 2002, Phase 3 has allowed the library to encrypt patron information when authenticating to use the proxy server. We have also gained a WebOPAC staging area, which allows us to test changes to the WebOPAC in a live manner. Administrative functionality was increased with Advanced System Access and Administration, which gives the System Administrator the ability to add networked printers to the system, manipulate the size of boolean files and change the Millennium field display names.
<p>
<b>VPN</b> - There were some questions concerning VPN (Virtual Private Network).  Information on what VPN is, who needs it, and where to get the software is available at 
<a href=http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/comm/security/secureclient/index.html>http://www.asu.edu/it/fyi/comm/security/secureclient/index.html</a>.
