      <h2><B>ASU Graduate Student Selected by Carter Center as Indonesian Election Monitor</B> </h2>
      <P align=justify>Arizona State University graduate student Christopher Lundry has been invited by the Carter Center to participate as an observer in the upcoming Indonesian elections. Lundry was chosen based on his experience as an observer for the United Nations sponsored referendum in East Timor, his experience working and conducting research in Indonesia and East Timor, as well as his fluency in Indonesian. </P>
      <P align=justify>Lundry is a doctoral candidate in Political Science, teaches the Intro to Southeast Asia Course (HST 240), edits<I> Suvannabhumi,</I> the bi-annual publication from the Program for Southeast Asian Studies, and is active in human rights organizations related to Southeast Asia.&nbsp; </P>
      <P align=justify>A delegation of forty observers, including prominent academics and politicians from around the world will meet in Jakarta for two days of training and then be deployed to various parts of Indonesia to make sure that the electoral rules are followed and that the election is free and fair.&nbsp; </P>
      <P align=justify>Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation in the world and the largest Muslim country in the world&nbsp; With the first direct Presidential election in Indonesia&rsquo;s history taking place this year,historians, politicians, economists and the international community as a whole have turned to Southeast Asia to watch and react as the political process unfolds. </P>
      <P align=justify>The Carter Center&nbsp; describes the situation in Indonesia as follows: &ldquo;&rsquo;The 2004 elections will be the first electoral test of Indonesia's democratic political institutions and processes since the transitional elections in 1999, and a critical opportunity to demonstrate that the democratic process can yield effective leaders and accountable government,&rsquo; said Dr. David Pottie, senior program associate of the Center's Democracy Program.</P>
      <P align=justify>&ldquo;After 40 years of military-backed governments, Indonesia began a democratic transition in 1998. In June 1999, Indonesia held its first genuinely democratic elections, for the legislature, a process that was monitored by The Carter Center. The vote for legislative seats was the first step in electing a new president after the May 1998 resignation of President Suharto, who led an authoritarian government for 32 years. While his ruling party won every election for nearly 20 years, 48 parties were approved for the 1999 ballot when his successor, interim President B.J. Habibie, agreed to hold open elections. The Center and the National Democratic Institute fielded a 100-member delegation led by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and concluded, along with other international organizations that observed the elections, that the elections were credible and representing the will of the people. </P>
      <P align=justify>&ldquo;Following the parliamentary vote, Abdurrahman Wahid was selected president in November 1999 by the 700-member People's Consultative Assembly, a body including the legislature and other specially represented regional, social, and demographic groups. In July 2001, however, less than two years into his term, President Wahid was removed from office and replaced by Vice President Megawati Sokarnoputri, following an extended clash with the national legislature regarding Wahid's alleged mismanagement and mishandling of state funds. </P>
      <P align=justify>&ldquo;Since 1999, Indonesians have gained new political freedoms, but recent public opinion polls have found that most Indonesians are disillusioned with government and the country's economic decline. </P>
      <P align=justify>&ldquo;In January,&nbsp; a Carter Center assessment team met with political parties, election officials, civil society and observer groups, all of whom encouraged international observers from the Center to help build confidence in the elections.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
      <P>&nbsp;Lundry will speak about his experience during &ldquo;Explore Southeast Asia Week&rdquo; hosted by the Program for Southeast Asian Studies on Tuesday, October 26, 2004, at 12:00 - 1:00 in conjunction with the Department of Political Studies&rsquo; &ldquo;Capitol Scholars Brown Bag series&rdquo;.&nbsp; For further information please contact the Program for Southeast Asian Studies at <FONT color=#0000ff>pseas@asu.edu</FONT> or lundry@asu.edu.</P>
