<font size=+1><b>Recruitment of Subjects</b></font>

<p>
<a href="rsp004.html#investigator">Investigators</a> are responsible for ensuring that the recruitment of human subjects is conducted in an ethical manner.  Potential subjects must be advised that their participation is voluntary and that their privacy will not be violated.

<p>
Investigators cannot begin data collection until they have received a written approval letter from the Research Compliance Office. All approved projects must be conducted in accordance with protocol-submitted guidelines and <a href="rsp004.html#irb">Institutional Review Board (IRB)</a> conditions when available.

<p>
A sample of a recruitment script can be downloaded from the <a href="irbforms.html">IRB</a> Web site.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Informed Consent</b></font>

<p>
Principal investigators are responsible for obtaining <a href="rsp004.html#informedconsent">informed consent</a> in accordance with university policy and federal regulations and for ensuring that no human subject will be involved in the research before obtaining consent.  Unless otherwise authorized by the IRB coordinator, the investigators must ensure that legally effective informed consent shall:

<p>
<ol>
<li>be obtained in writing from the subject or the subject&#146;s legally authorized representative</li>

<p>
<li>be in language understandable to the subject or the representative</li>
<p>
<li>be obtained under circumstances that offer the subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether the subject should or should not participate

<p>
and</li>

<p>
<li>not include exculpatory language through which the subject or the representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject&#146;s legal rights; or releases or appears to release the principal investigator, the sponsor, the university, or its agents from liability for their negligent acts or omissions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Informed Consent Forms</b> 

<p>
The informed consent form must be in language easily understood by the subject:  therefore, it will be necessary either to avoid technical terms or to explain them thoroughly.  The IRB Web site provides a template form that outlines the elements required.  Any modification or alteration to the informed consent form, or a request for waiver of informed consent, must be requested in writing at the time of submission.

<p>
Parents, legal guardians, or a legally authorized official must sign consent forms permitting minors (individuals under the age of 18) to participate in research projects.  In addition, an assent form is to be signed by those minors (generally individuals aged 7&#150;17) capable of reading and understanding a simplified version of the consent form signed by the parent or guardian.  If the minor is unable to read an assent form, but is capable of understanding an oral explanation of the procedure, the minor can indicate assent (orally) or sign a typed copy of the oral presentation. Investigators are responsible for documenting child or minor assent.

<p>
Samples of informed consent and assent templates can be found on the <a href="irbforms.html">IRB Forms</a> Web site.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Research Protocols</b></font>

<p>
A protocol must be submitted to the IRB for all research, development, or related activities in which human subjects are involved or in which there is a question of such involvement.  Protocols must be kept on file for a period of at least three years after completion of a study.
