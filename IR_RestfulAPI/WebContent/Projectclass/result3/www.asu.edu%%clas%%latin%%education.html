	  <p>The Center for Latin American Studies has 13 affiliates whose primary research focuses on education. For example, numerous other professors pursue interests in bilingual education, both as between English and Spanish in the U.S. and between Spanish and indigenous languages in Latin America. Issues of bilingualism and biliteracy occupy some part of the research interests of the education affiliates, as is the case with Dr. Eugene Garcia, whose work examines the psycholinguistics of bilingualism. Dr. Carlos Ovando, Associate Dean in the College of Education at ASU, takes a unique perspective on the effects of bilingual education, examining its political impact in multicultural schools. Meanwhile, Dr. Alfredo Artiles, Professor of Special Education, pursues research regarding the simultaneously individual and global concern of learning disabilities, as applied to ethnic minorities in Central America; Gustavo Fischman, Professor of Multicultural Education, focuses on cultural studies in education in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. Other research topics include cross-cultural cognitive psychology, mathematics education in Mexico, and sociocultural theories of learning. On the whole, the Center for Latin American Studies views the development of educational methods in Latin America as an invaluable opportunity to create closer ties with Latin America.</p>
	  <p>ASU exhibits an active role in educational projects in Latin America through programs such as the CASS Indigenous Teacher Professional Development Program and the Amazon Field School in Ecuador. While CASS brings in teachers from Latin America for a year of study at ASU, the Field School immerses U.S. trained teachers in the experience of the educational process in Latin America. Moreover, ASU sponsors student teaching programs from the College of Education in both Costa Rica and Guatemala. Teachers from both the U.S. and Latin America gain new cultural perspectives, and acquire unique educational skills and methods through such programs. Hence, the educational arm of the Center for Latin American Studies seeks to emphasize the need of K-12 educational development in Latin America.</p>
	  <p>With over 40 links to universities through Latin America, including schools in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, and the Dominican Republic, ASU students have unparalleled access to a first-hand experience of Latin America. Many other specialized connections exist, such as the partnership between ASU's renowned W.P. Carey School of Business and the Instituto Tecnol&oacute;gico Aut&oacute;nomo de M&eacute;xico. However, ASU also opens its doors to Latin American students through historic programs such as CONACYT, which provides fellowships for 75 graduate students from Mexico each year. The Center for Latin America Studies at ASU is committed not only to a greater comprehension of Latin America through research, but also to the promotion of Latin American culture and society by providing new and diverse educational opportunities.</p>
