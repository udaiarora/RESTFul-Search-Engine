Croft came to ASU as a faculty member from Cornell University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1973. He had been a student of both Professor Couch and Professor Ekmanis in the 1960's as he pursued Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics at ASU. He completed his Master's Degree in Russian, however, at the University of Arizona in Tucson before going on to doctoral work and his first professorship at Cornell.</p><p>His professional specialty is Slavic Linguistics. He was a participant of the first Joint Soviet-American Conference on the Russian Language in 1974, and he served as the Dean of Soviet Programs for the American Institute for Foreign Study in 1977. Since 1975 he has served as Coordinator of the Slavic Languages Section of the Department of Languages and Literatures, in which he has also served as Assistant Chair and as Faculty Senator. He has been active in the development of ASU's academic exchange with Universitet Kiril i Metodij (UKIM) in Skopje, Macedonia, directing the exchange from 1984-90, and is one of the founding members of ASU's Russian and East European Studies Consortium (REESC).  He is a founder of the Critical Languages Institute, obtaining the first support grants and serving as Director from 1991-7.</p><p>Professor Croft's professional publications focus on linguistic iconicity, on theformal aspects of poetry and poetic translation, and on the mnemonotactics of language learning. He is one of the department's leading grantspersons and has won several awards for excellence in teaching and student mentorship. Like Professor Couch, he is a recipient, as well as the fund founder and supervisor, of the Joe Malik, Jr. Arizona Slavic Studies Award.</p><p><a href='croftspubs.html'>Sample Scholarly Publications</a></p></p>";

case (name="Ekmanis"):
	textSwitch.innerHTML = "<img src='images/facultyPlaceholder.jpg'><p>Rolfs Ekmanis, Ph.D. : Professor</p><p>A native of Riga, Latvia, Professor Rolfs Ekmanis came to ASU in 1963 from a teaching position at Florida State University. After finishing his doctoral work at the University of Indiana, Bloomington, he set about to establish our university's scholarly credibility in the field of Baltic literature, publishing numerous books, articles, and reviews, and working as a bibliographer for the Modern Language Association's yearly compilations of scholarly contributions. It was he who began and sustained the growth of ASU's library holdings in Russian and East European languages and literatures until their dimensions merited dedicated in-house management in the mid-1970's.</p><p>He has attained much international visibility in the years since the break-up of the Soviet Union as a long-time contributor (pseudonymously before 1992 as 'Maris Rauda') to the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty broadcasts. His work as Director of the RFE Latvian Broadcasting Department in Munich and his setting up of the first RFE/RL News Bureau on former Soviet territory in Riga in 1992 earned him important commendations. His teaching at ASU focuses on the literature of the Soviet Period and on the literatures of the former-Soviet minority nationalities.</p>";

case (name="Owen"):
	textSwitch.innerHTML = "<img src='images/facultyPlaceHolder.jpg'><p>Jeanette Owen, Ph.D. : Assistant Professor</p><p>Jeanette S. Owen received her Ph.D. in Russian and Second Language Acquisition at Bryn Mawr College, where she also received an M.A. in Russian literature. Her graduate education included studies at the Herzen Institute in Leningrad and the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language and Literature in Moscow, followed by an academic year conducting research in Russia under the auspices of ACTR/ACCELS (American Councils). <br><br>Jeanette's research focuses on the acquisition of pragmatic competence (the ability to use language to accomplish communicative tasks) by non-native speakers of Russian, and cross-cultural pragmatics (variation in how native and non-native speakers formulate specific speech acts). In addition, Jeanette's interest in the use of technology for language instruction contributes to her role as editor of the <i>American Association of Teachers of Slavic and East European Languages Newsletter </i>column on technology and language learning, and to the development of internet-based activities for her courses. Her teaching experience includes courses in Russian language, linguistics, second language acquisition, as well as 19th and 20th century Russian literature and culture. </p>";
