<P>McCarthy, Justin. <I>Portraits of the Sixties</I>. London: Unwin, 1903.
Contents: The early sixties; Charles Dickens; W. M. Thackeray; Thomas Carlyle--Alfred
Tennyson; Richard Owen--The brothers Newman; Richard Cobden; John Bright;
Sir Stafford Northcote; A parlimentary group; Another parlimentary group;
From commons to lords; &quot;Crownless sovereignties;&quot; Sir Richard
and Lady Burton; Two philanthropists; Ruskin and the pre-Raphaelites; John
Arthur Roebuck; Italy's English sympathisers; Stars that rose in the sixties;
Lord Clarence Paget--Thorold Rogers; Goldwin Smith; The Keeleys, Robson,
and Webster; The Bancrofts; Three queens of song; Three stage graces; Some
queens of society; Last words. The work includes many portraits of those
mentioned. The work is written as a personal account of the time period
and people discussed. McCarthy uses a collection of photographs taken from
the Sixties and characteristic of the epoch as a basis for organizing the
work. These portraits &quot;do not profess to be anything like a complete
gallery of pictures of the eminent men and women who were conspicuous figures
of English life thoughout those years.&quot; The author has chosen to portray
the Sixties since they &quot;constitute an epoch of great change in almost
every department of England's public and social life, and many of the changes
which are still only in process of develpment owed their beginning to some
of the men and women whose portraits I offer to the public, around which
I have intertwined recollections of my own&quot; (480-1). PRB-18</P>

<P>---, Tr. <I>Old French Romances, Done into English by William Morris</I>.
Introduction by Joseph Jacobs. London: Allen, 1896. Bookplate of Charles
Bain Hoyt. Contents: The tale of King Coustans the emperor; The friendship
of Amis and Amile; The tale of King Florus and the fair Jehane; The history
of over sea. Morris translated the five tales in Norwelles Francaises en
Prose du xiii-ieme Siecle. Readers had been able to enjoy English translations
of Aucassin et Nicolete for many years, but the other four stories were
not previously available. According to Joseph Jacobs' introduction, Morris
has succeeded in his translation in reproducing &quot;the tone, the colour,
the charm of the Middle Ages.&quot; The five stories have been bound into
one volume &quot;in a form not unworthy of their excellence but more accessible
to those lovers of books whose purses ahve a habit of varying in inverse
proportion to the amount of their love.&quot; PRB-28</P>

This work contains seven Socialist lectures which were given at various
times. Two of these lectures were previously printed as pamphlets, three
had previously appeared in the Socialist weekly The Commonweal, and two
are printed here for the first time. Morris apologizes for any repetition
among the lectures since the very nature of the audiences requires that
&quot;certain elementary propositions--such, e.g., as the encessity for
the abolition of monompoly in the means of production&quot; will be stated
in each lecture. Morris feels that his lectures give a different perspective
on Socialism since Morris himself is neither &quot;a professional economist
nor a professional politician.&quot; PRB-35</P>

Brinkerhoff Cary]. &quot;The first book to be printed on [Morris'] Kelmscott
'Chaucer' Press by the Press of the Woolly Whale.&quot; Bound in quarter-vellum
with embossed paper boards. Morris opens his essay on medieval ornamented
manuscripts by noting that the two most important productions of art are
first the beautiful house and then the beautiful book. &quot;To enjoy good
houses and good books in self respect and decent comfort, seems to me to
be the pleasurable end towards which all societies of human beings ought
now to struggle.&quot; Morris then continues with his discussion of the
production of medieval ornamented manuscripts. Following Morris's essay
this work contains a history of the Morris press which was used to print
the Kelmscott Chaucer as well as the present volume. PRB-105</P>

190.&quot; Morris and Bax explain in the Preface that they are not duplicating
the information found in various pamphlets, but instead are giving an historical
approach to the subject, even though this is &quot;a less exciting method
than the building up of ?practical' Utopias, or than attempting the solution
of political problems within the immediate purview of the Socialist struggle
of to-day.&quot; The authors trace the development of society from antiquity
to the present, ending with &quot;what may be reasonably expected from
the new society when it has at last supplanted the ever-increasing confusion
of the present day&quot; (17). PRB-30</P>
