<H3><b>Major Events and Accomplishments</b></H3>

<b>CAPS Web Page</b><br>
Lise Hawkos volunteered to put a Web page together to replace the list server that 
has been used to communicate with the general academic professional community at ASU.  
She put together a text page with the committee roster, meeting minutes, bylaws, 
committee purpose and goals and the "AP white paper".  The address is 
http:Hwww.asu.edu/provost/CAPS. This web page has been a very useful communications 
tool over the past year.  A new committee officer of "Web Master" was added to the bylaws 
to maintain this tool.
<P>
<b>Procedures for Release of Academic Professionals: 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd508-05.html">ACD 507-05</a> 
(subsequently renumbered 508-05)</b><br>
One of the major goals for the commiittee this year was to get the revision of 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd508-05.html">ACD 507-05</a> 
(Release of Academic Professionals) through the administrative process to be adopted 
as University policy.  A letter, which outlined the process which had occurred over 
the previous four years, was sent to Provost Glick from the committee in September.  
We also asked what further steps needed to be taken to move this revision along.   
As a result of this letter the general consul's office looked at the proposed revision 
and rejected it on technical grounds.  The committee was then asked by Vice Provost 
Harris to draft a new revision of the policy in collaboration with the Academic Senate 
Personnel Committee.  This task was accomplished by March and the new revision was 
approved by the full Academic Senate in April.  President Coor signed the 1997 revision 
of <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd508-05.html">ACD 507-05</a> into 
official University policy in early July.
<P>
<b>CAPS Bylaws Revision</b><br>
The second major goal of the committee for 1996-97 was to revise the 1991 Bylaws of CAPS.  
Several major changes had occurred in the way committee members are nominated and elected 
which were not yet included in the bylaws.  Karl Weiss volunteered to lead the revision effort.  
By December all changes had been made and agreed upon by the committee.  On February 6 an 
open forum was held to allow any AP to comment on or offer revisions to the proposed bylaws.  
A number of different units and colleges were represented.  The revised bylaws were sent 
to all APs on the main ASU campus at the end of February for their vote for or against 
ratification by March 24.  Dr. Ann Yates, temporary AP caucus convener, reported that 
all 56 ballots returned before the deadline were for ratification.  The new bylaws took 
effect in April.
<P>
<b>Provosts Advisory Committee on Academic Professionals (PACAP)</b><br> 
PACAP members were invited to attend the October 3 CAPS meeting.  At this meeting they 
were encouraged to elect a chairperson and recorder to get the committee in motion 
for the current year.  A chair and recorder were elected from the PACAP members who 
attended.  Several PACAP meetings took place over the course of the year.
<P>
<b>AP Caucus</b><br>
CAPS invited all University academic professionals to attend our October 31 meeting 
to get acquainted with their representatives, voice any concerns and work with the 
committee to set an agenda for the year.  The committee considered making this an annual 
event and including it in the bylaws as such.  Provost Glick and Vice Provost Harris 
were both invited to address the caucus.  Dr. Harris attended and addressed several 
concerns that had been relayed by the Conunittee Chair to the Provost's office.  He  
also fielded questions from the APs who attended.  Due to the very low attendance 
at the caucus and the other public forums sponsored by CAPS this year, no further 
formal organization of this type of meeting was deemed necessary.
<P>
<b>Sabbaticals: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd705.html">ACD
705</a></b><br>
The committee briefly revisited the perennial question of whether or not APs are being 
de facto discriminated against in the process of granting sabbatical leaves.  The 
conclusion of the discussion was that the problem appeared to be localized in a 
few departments in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS) and University 
level action was not warranted at this time.  The main reason being that sabbaticals 
are considered to be a privilege and not an entitlement.  PACAP was asked to act 
as a clearing-house of sabbatical leave policies on the local level across the University.  
We hope that through continued vigilance any pattern of discrimination can be detected 
and appropriate action taken in a timely manner.
<P>
<b>Salary Adjustments: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd511-01.html">
ACD 510-01</a> (subsequently renumbered 511-01)</b><br>
An AP from CLAS requested a review of the University policy which sets procedures 
for distributing salary adjustments.  The AP complained specifically that his department 
did not create a separate pool for AP employees in the past two salary adjustments.   
The source of funds was through reallocation of University resources and not a 
legislative appropriation.  Technically <a
href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd511-01.html">ACD 510-01</a> 
only applies to appropriated funds.  The committee determined that the AP had not 
filed a grievance in the matter and that this appeared to be a local problem.   
No further action was taken.
<P>
<b>Post Continuing Status Review</b><br>
Vice Provost Harris announced at the January 30 PACAP meeting that the Arizona Board 
of Regents (ABOR) had created a "Work group on Continuing Status Employees and Part-time 
Faculty" of which he was a member.  The primary focus of the work group was to produce 
a document for APs similar to that which had been recently completed on post-tenure review 
for Faculty.  In addition, justification for the granting of continuing status was to be 
given on a job description level for each type of AP.  Statistical information on the total 
number of APs with continuing status and continuing-eligible was also required.   
Vice Provost Harris asked for three members of PACAP to serve on the work group and 
indicated that three members of CAPS would also be requested.  Alison Ewing, chair 
of PACAP, Heather Lineberry, AP Senator, and Gary Hembree, chair of CAPS, met with  
Tom Callarman, President of the ASU Academic Senate, to discuss how APs could most 
effectively use the information obtained during the faculty's experience with 
post-tenure review.  PACAP and CAPS decided to form an ad hoc committee to draft 
some of the requested items in advance of a formal request from the ABOR work group.  
Members of both commnittees met with a representative from ASU West several times 
during the spring semester to discuss strategy and draft a state level post 
continuing review document modeled on the Arizona Faculty Council version for 
post-tenure review.  Information from peer institutions on professional employees 
was gathered and a document on justification of continuing status was drafted.   
Statistical information was distilled from a Human Resources listing of all ASU 
AP employees.  Since no further requests were received from the ABOR work group 
the documents will be held by the respective committees' recorder or archivist 
until they are needed.
<P>
<b>Evaluation for Continuing Status and/or Promotion: <a
href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd506-09.html">ACD 506-09</a></b><br>
At the request of an AP in CLAS the committee sent a one sentence revision of this 
policy to Vice Provost Harris in March.  The revision made explicit a thirty day 
time limit for reviewers to return their evaluations of Academic Professionals.  
This policy revision has been forwarded to the Academic Senate Personnel Committee 
for action in the Fall of 1997.
<P>
<b>Review of AP position descriptions</b><br>
The committee began reviewing the AP positions which were advertised in the ASU 
Insight employee newsletter.  The main concern is whether the APs in these positions 
will be made aware of the expectations of the AP classification at ASU.  One position 
in the School of Music appeared particularly troubling.  The position description 
was obtained and forwarded to the Provost's office with a cover letter.  The  
committee requested that the position be thoroughly reviewed as to whether or not 
it had been placed appropriately in the AP category.  Vice Provost Harris replied 
that he had made numerous inquiries and had determined it had been appropriately placed.  
A total of four positions were reviewed, two continuing-eligible and two year-to-year.
