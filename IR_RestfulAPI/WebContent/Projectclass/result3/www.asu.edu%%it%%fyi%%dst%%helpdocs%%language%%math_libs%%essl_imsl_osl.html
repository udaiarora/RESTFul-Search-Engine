<h3><a name=general>GENERAL INFORMATION</a></h3>

<p>
This write-up deals with the often used libraries :  the Engineering
and Scientific Subroutine Library (ESSL), the International Mathematical
and Statistical Library (IMSL), and the Optimization Subroutine Library
(OSL).  It gives introduction and guidance for effective access to
the libraries. Reference manuals are available in the Customer 
Assistance Center and in some sites.

<h3><a name=essl>THE ESSL LIBRARY (On RS/6000 only)</a></h3>

<p>
ESSL (Engineering and Scientific Subroutine Library) is a set of high
performance mathematical routines for use by FORTRAN, C and assembler
language programs.

<p>
Manual: Engineering and Scientific Subroutine Library - Guide and
Reference.  The reference manual contains information for using ESSL
with programs written in FORTRAN, C or assembler.  Copies of this
manual are available at the Customer Assistance Center.

<p>
The various routines in ESSL follow a standard naming convention based
on the first letter of each routine name as described below:

<code>
<ul>
<li> S - Short-precision real (about 6/7 decimal digits)
<li> C - Short-precision complex
<li> D - Long-precision real (about 14/15 decimal digits)
<li> Z - Long-precision complex
<li> I - Integer (4 byte length)
</ul>
</code>

<p>
The variables used by the routine must be at the same precision level
as the routine; i.e., use double precision variables with a double
precision routine.

<p>
The nine mathematical areas of ESSL are:

<ul>
<li>Linear Algebra
<li>Matrix Operations
<li>Linear Algebraic Equations
<li>Signal Processing
<li>Interpolation
<li>Numerical Quadrature
<li>Random Number Generation
<li>Utility Subroutines
</ul>

To link your FORTRAN program on RS/6000 with ESSL, simply type :

<blockquote><code>
xlf program.f -lessl
</code></blockquote>

<p>
The xlf compiler also allows users to optimize their program by making
use of the ESSL routines.  The XLF optimizer can detect area of FORTRAN
code that can be replaced by highly optimized ESSL routines and optimize
the program.  To make use of that feature, one of the following xlf 
options need to be included:

<code>
<ul>
<li> xlf -Pv -Wp,-ej -O3 program.f -lessl
<li> xlf -Pk -Wp,-lc=essl -O3 program.f -lessl
</ul>
</code>

<p>
For more on the xlf compiler options refer to the "XL FORTRAN" compiler
manual at the Customer Assistance Center.

<p>
To access the FORTRAN written ESSL routines in C language type :

<blockquote><code>
xlc program.c -lessl -lm -lxlf
</code></blockquote>

<h3><a name=imsl>THE IMSL LIBRARY</a></h3>

<p>
IMSL is a library of FORTRAN and C subroutines designed to handle many
many mathematical and statistical applications. The subroutines cannot
stand alone. You must write your own FORTRAN or C program to handle input
and output, initialize variables, and make the calls to the desired
IMSL subroutines.

<p>
Complete details on how to link the IMSL libraries in Fortran or in C
are contained in vendor-supplied README files. A required setup command
is described in the corresponding README file, and is illustrated in the
<a href="#syntax">syntax summary</a> at the top of this document.
If desired, the setup command can be placed in ".profile" or in ".login".

<P>
NOTE: The setup command differs depending on the shell.

<P>
NOTE: The setup command for Fortran differs depending on the cluster.

<p>
The locations of the README files are shown below:

<ul>

<li>For information on linking the IMSL libraries with FORTRAN, read the
file <br> 
<code> /usr/local/vni/CTT5.0/notes/f90/README </code>

<li>For information on linking the IMSL libraries with C, read the
file <br>
<code> /usr/local/vni/CTT5.0/notes/cnl/README </code>

</ul>

<H4>Documentation</H4>

<p>
On-line documentation is available for IMSL in the form of PDF
documents. If you have Adobe Acrobat Reader 4.0 or later, you can
click on the following link to view the PDF files: 

<blockquote>
<a href="CTT5.0/imsl.pdf">IMSL PDF Documents</a>
</blockquote>

<p>The documents may also be downloaded from the general or research
unix servers. Their location is "/usr/local/vni/CTT5.0/help".

<p> 
The IMSL routines are organized into areas as described below.
Most of the subroutines are available both in single and double precision.
The subroutines are standard and the same interface is found on the
many hardware versions that span the range from personal computer
to supercomputer. 

<blockquote>
<dl>

<dt>In the MATH/LIBRARY:
<dd>
Linear Systems, Eigensystem Analysis, Interpolation and Approximation,
Integration and Differentiation, Differential Equations, Transforms,
Nonlinear Equations, Optimization, Basic Matrix/Vector Operations
and Utilities.

<dt>In the STAT/LIBRARY:
<dd>
Basic Statistics, Regression, Correlation, Analysis of Variance, Categorical
and Discrete Data Analysis, Nonparametric Statistics, Test of Goodness
of Fit and Randomness, Time Series Analysis and Forecasting, Covariance
Structures and Factor Analysis, Discriminant Analysis, Cluster Analysis,
Sampling, Survival Analysis, Life Testing and Reliability, Multidimensional
Scaling, Density and Hazard Estimation, Line Printer Graphics, Probability
Distribution Functions and Inverses, Random Number Generation, Utilities
and Mathematical Support.

<dt>In the SFUN/LIBRARY:
<dd>
Special Functions and Integral Routines.

</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
The IMSL Library in FORTRAN includes single and long precision routines
and has the same rules for the first letter of the routine names as
the ESSL Library.  In C language, similar naming convention is used.

<p>
Except when expressly stated otherwise, the names of the variables
in the argument list follow the default FORTRAN naming convention for
integer and floating point variables.  The arguments passed into the
routines must match the routine's precision.

<p>
When writing programs accessing the IMSL Library, you should choose
FORTRAN and/or C names that do not conflict with names of IMSL subroutines,
functions, or named common blocks.  You can avoid any conflict with
IMSL names if the following rules are observed:

<ul>

<li>Do not choose a name that appears in the Alphabetical Index of
Routines, at the end of the User's Manual.

<li>Do not choose a name consisting of more than three characters
with a numeral in the second or third position.

<li>Do not have the arguments, passed into an IMSL routine, in COMMON
or EQUIVALENCE statement(s) unless is required by IMSL.

</ul>

<p>
The quickest and safest way to use an IMSL routine is to find an example
similar to your problem and then mimic the example as much as possible.

<p>
The CTT5.0 IMSL setup commands for the korn shell and the c-shell
are, respectively:

<ul>
<li><code>. /usr/local/vni/CTT5.0/ctt/bin/cttsetup.sh</code>
<li><code>source /usr/local/vni/CTT5.0/ctt/bin/cttsetup.csh</code>
</ul>

<p>
The CTT4.0 IMSL setup commands for the korn shell and the c-shell
are, respectively:

<ul>
<li><code>. /usr/local/vni/CTT4.0/ctt/bin/cttsetup.sh</code>
<li><code>source /usr/local/vni/CTT4.0/ctt/bin/cttsetup.csh</code>
</ul>

<p>
The commands to compile and link IMSL for FORTRAN and C programs are,
respectively:

<ul>
<li><code>$F90 $F90FLAGS -o program program.f $LINK_F90</code>
<li><code>$CC $CFLAGS -o program program.c $LINK_CNL</code>
</ul>

<h3><a name=osl>THE OSL LIBRARY</a></h3>

<p>
OSL (Optimization Subroutine Library), available on RS/6000 only,
is a collection of high-performance mathematical subroutines for use
by application programs that solve optimization problems.  The OSL
subroutines are FORTRAN written subroutines and can be called
from FORTRAN and C programs* at different levels: high-level routines
can solve a problem without need of detailed knowledge of mathematical
programming.  Low-level subroutines gives the flexibility to structure
algorithms without having to write programs from scratch.  Thus,
OSL is ideal for use in making business decisions, as well as for use
in research of new algorithms and techniques.

<p>
Mathematical programming technique can be applied to problems where
a function needs to be minimized or a maximized, subject to set of
constrains.  OSL finds the solutions of several types of optimization
problems using linear programming, mixed-integer programming,
and quadratic programming.

<p>
Manual: Optimization Subroutine Library - Guide and Reference
The reference manual contains information for using OSL with programs
written in FORTRAN or C.  Copies of this manual are available at
the Customer Assistance Center.

<p>
The various routines in OSL begin with EKK to help prevent name conflicts.
The variables used by the routine need be fullword integers (INTEGER*4)
and doubleword real (REAL*8).

<p>
Two linear programming methods are offered by OSL: a simplex method,
which includes a primal and a dual algorithm, and an interior-point
barrier method. Mixed-integer problems are linear programming problems
where some of the variables are constrained to be integers.  The quadratic
programming problems solved by OSL have a convex quadratic objective
function and linear constraints. There are also subroutines for solving
parametric quadratic problems.

<p>
To access the OSL library on RS/6000 interactive server, for FORTRAN
or C respectively, type:

<code>
<ul>
<li> xlf program.f -losl
<li> xlc program.c -losl -lm -lxlf
</ul>
</code>
