<B><P>3. &#9;Announcements and Communications.</P>
<P>3.A  Senate President's Report</B> (William Davey).</P>
<P>I would like to thank senators for their participation this year.  I would like to thank President Coor and Provost Glick for their help on faculty issues.  I think at ASU we have a special relationship between our faculty and our administrators, which has been mutually beneficial.  </P>
<P>As part of my farewell remarks, I would like to carry on the tradition of recognizing individuals who have made a special contribution to faculty governance over the years.   I would like to make two such presentations today.  This year's awards are presented to Daniel Landers, Chair of the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure; although he had a very heavy schedule, he did a wonderful job this year.  He is leaving the Senate in June and this award is for his continued work over the years in faculty governance.   The second award is presented to a colleague who was forced to resign from the Senate this year because of illness, Kevin Carroll, former chair of the Senate Personnel Committee.  He has made a significant contribution over the years, particularly in the areas of post-tenure review and the Whistleblower Policy.  He worked with me on the university task force for the Freshman Year Experience, under President Russ Nelson.   Kevin was an excellent committee member and he always does 110% on any university governance activities in which he participates.  Kevin is not here today, but we recognize his service.</P>
<P>The results of the Academic Assembly Election Ballot are as follows: the new President-elect is Douglas Johnson from the School of Accountancy and the new (and continuing) secretary is Dawn Bates, Department of English.  New members elected to the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure: Craig Allen, Journalism and  Telecommunication, Michelle Hegmon, Anthropology, and Thomas McGowan, Elementary Education.  New members elected to the Governance Grievance Committee: Horst Theime, Mathematics and Margi Waller, Social Work.  The Academic Senate's representative to the University Promotion and Tenure Committee is Barbara Kerr, Women's Studies/Psychology in Education.  Elected to the Academic Professional Grievance Committee: Alison Ewing, Law Library, and the Committee on Academic Professional Status: Linda Shackle, Noble Library and Santos Vega, Hispanic Research Center.  </P>
<P>We are conducting an election ballot for the new members to the Senate standing committees today.  I will turn this activity over to the Chair of the Committee on Committees, Tim Karcher.</P>
<P>Senator Karcher: Everyone has a ballot and a pencil.  Please notice how many people are required for each committee.  There are two vacancies for the Committee on Committees, four vacancies on the Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee but we must have each of those colleges represented.  On the Personnel Committee, there are nine vacancies and we have twelve candidates; therefore, it took more than one number.  This required us to use 3a-e, 4a-e, and then 5a and b.  Those are all equal choices for that committee.  For the Student-Faculty Policy Committee, there are two candidates to be elected and for University Services and Facilities, there are two candidates to be elected.  </P>
<P>Senators voted and the ballots were collected by Senator Karcher.</P>
<B><P>3.B  University President's Report </B>(Lattie Coor).</P>
<P>I want to thank your faculty leaders this year for their service, but especially your retiring President Bill Davey for carrying on the tradition of leadership that we have been so fortunate to have at ASU.  It is not a question of having different points of view; it is a question of how those points of view are handled.  I just saw a report from the Association of Governing Boards noting the profound difference between institutions that sought to find ways to work out differences of opinion that led to constructive results, as contrasted with those that did not.  So, to you, with deep gratitude, go our thanks, for the year that you have brought us.  To David as he takes the gavel at the end of the meeting, and to Doug Johnson, congratulations, and to Dawn Bates for her reelection.  We look forward to working with you as the next academic year gets underway.  </P>
<P>You have on the agenda today a major issue, a report on streamlining the curriculum.  It is not my practice to comment on any matter before you, but since I have been a strong proponent of this I want to underscore my view of its importance, and my sense of how carefully, and well this process has gone in bringing this motion to the Senate today.  It seems to me that with the basic motivation of seeking to improve undergraduate instruction, and getting the rules out of the way of the interaction of faculty and students, we will make substantial headway on our larger goals.   I believe this motion before you accomplishes that.  Secondly, I tip my hat to Chuck Bantz and his committee, and to many in this room and elsewhere on all three campuses; the level of consultation has been impressive to me.  I don't know how to aggregate them all, but as many as 400-500 people have at one time or another participated in this ongoing discussion and it has resulted in some modifications, important ones in some instances, making the document better and better each time.  I believe this is a very important step for ASU to take; it paves the way for a number of other improvements, many of which are now being developed, for the improvement of undergraduate education.  I commend those who have made it possible and I commend the project.   I will refrain from reviewing the history of the entire project because you have received information on this project as we moved through the academic year. </P>
<P>We had our meeting of the Capital Campaign fund raising committee today and are able to report that we are at the $271 million mark.  We are only 18 months into the full public phase of this campaign, and have two years to go.  We still need to raise $130 million.  I am touched by the degree of enthusiasm and support we have received from the larger community for this campaign.  </P>
<P>Have you all seen the WW III sized headlines in the Arizona Republic, regarding the plans for $200 million dollars of renovation to Sun Devil Stadium?  I have not seen that plan.  We have for some time now requested studies on the stadium, and how it can be kept a competitive collegiate stadium.  The City of Tempe is interested in that.  Dean John Meunier from the College of Architecture did quite an impressive study two years ago, one that would add more adequate restrooms for women, broaden the concourses and add other improvements.  It even included some additional shaded areas.  I want to assure everyone that when we finally do see the plans for upgrading the stadium, $200 million is not our agenda.  None of us will know the outcome of the larger stadium issue and that really is for the voters of Mesa and its companion cities to decide.  Our interest is in a much more modest vein.  </P>
<P>I want to thank you all for a very constructive year at ASU.  I am pleased to be a part of all endeavors that you have underway.  </P>
<P>Senator Linder: To put it mildly, I was disappointed in January when the budget statements came out; the JLBC budget was a terrible disappointment; the Governor's Office was milder, but it was still very unpleasant to see the disregard, it seemed to me, in which we were held.  This theme has emerged so often in the last few years that it is almost trite to repeat it; the disconnection between the progress we make as an institution and the respect we have in the business community and the larger community in Arizona, and at the same time we are treated so shabbily by the legislature.  Last year at one point I remarked that we should stay engaged and talking but do it by our rules of rationality and civility.  After this year, I am beginning to question this.  I hope not to become cynical about it, but could you comment on things that we might as an institution undertake that could change that relationship?  </P>
<P>President Coor: It is an important question and it must actively be on our agenda.  None of us know what the legislature's first biennial budget means.  There are three ways that an adjourned session of the legislature takes place.  In Texas, a vivid example of one end of the continuum, there simply is no adjourned session.  They meet for a fixed number of days established by the constitution.  They set a biennial budget and that is it.  The other end of the continuum is that the biennial budget adopted has real figures for the first year and plugged figures for the second year.  They go back and take matters denoveau, and I frankly do not know how many states fall into that category.  Not many fall into the first category.  The third or middle position is that only unusual matters are considered in the second session of the legislature.  We hear that rhetoric now.  I think our reason for turning to this very quickly, first of all, is to discern whether as we get a better view of the revenue, what the chances might be in any fashion for a round in the next year of the biennium.  If anything is to be done there, that has to take shape early in September.  </P>
<P>On both the immediate front and on the broader front, I think we must be sobered by what occurred this year.  I still accept rational judgements for why very little attention was paid to issues beyond K-12.  That is such a dominant issue in the eyes of the governor and in the larger conversation, and is such a larger commitment in the state.  Let us not forget just this past year the state, by assuming responsibility for funding schools, something that had previously been a local tax base, attached the equivalent of 8% of the total state's general fund, in new money, onto the budget.  That, coupled with the additional support for K-12 this year, meant that there were not other conversations going on.  I do accept that as a fact of life, but at the same time in a year in which both the State is having one of the best it will ever have, when there is capacity, clearly the JLBC budget was designed, from our point of view, to put us in enough of a hole to begin with that all of our energy had to be spent getting back to ground zero, using revenue projections that simply cannot be justified.  We must find a way conceptually to get the university's case more fully before the governor and the legislature.  Whatever the nature of the adjourned session, we certainly in the next biennium need to take a stronger role through our existing political mechanisms, our corporate leadership, USPAN, and through our legislative network.  I join you in the thought that we collectively need to take a more energetic role in the process.  I think USPAN and others are a way to do that, but district by district, legislator by legislator, people have to stand up and be counted in terms of where American universities are.  We are gathering the information right now.  The 2% salary pool which now moves to an April start date, if they move it much further we will have one year that is not funded.  The 2% in April loads that into the following year, so it looks like a new obligation to us.   Compare this with other states and it is simply non-competitive.  We need a much more energetic strategy in terms of the arguments we make and the way in which we position them.  Even including some specific strategies for an adjourned session, we need a much fuller use of our existing political liaisons and alliances.  We will be examining that over the summer.  I would like to make sure that we keep the leadership of the Senate involved.</P>
<P>Senator Higgins: Can you update us on the sick leave and the retirement program?</P>
<P>Provost Glick: We have been signaled by the Attorney General's Office that they want to find a way to make that work and any way they can, they will.  There was an amendment introduced this morning; they have appointed a conference committee to look at it and the reason Brent Brown is not here is that I asked him to call a colleague that is on that committee and find something out for us.  We hope in the next 24 hours to get an amendment which would make it possible for the Attorney General's Office to sign off on it.   </P>
<B><P>3.C  ASASU President's Report</B> (Paul Frost).</P>
<P>&#9;This is my last Senate meeting and my last week of classes at ASU.  I plan to attend graduate school and study public policy.  I am not sure where yet.  I have enjoyed this experience and working with President Davey and President-elect Burstein.  I attended a USC football game with Dr. Burstein and I found there is a different way of looking at a football game when you go with a scientist!  I learned a lot actually; he was very analytical about it.  Dr. Davey has also been good to us; he has endured our ASASU Senate meetings this year, staying for most of the meeting, which is a big chore in itself.</P>
<P>&#9;I am sure you all know that Jesse Jackson did not make it to ASU.  He was successful in his endeavors in Kosovo and we are glad for that.  He called and said that he would like to try to reschedule something to come in the fall.  We are looking at Gammage Auditorium to see what dates are open in the fall semester for him to possibly come to lecture then. </P>
<P>&#9;A couple of weeks ago, there was an article in the State Press about the course evaluation program and about a cut to the program funding.  I just wanted to set the record straight that the ASASU Senate actually moved the funding out of that program into the executive contingency fund, which is not a major event, because next year's executive officers will simply move it back over again to the program in the fall.  At any rate, the new president, Jennifer Holsman, will continue working with that program, and hopefully we will have good results next year.</P>
<P>&#9;Streamlining the graduation requirements has been a project that I have been involved in and I have enjoyed working with Chuck Bantz on that.  I think the proposals are good ones, and I appreciate Dr. Coor's efforts to make that happen.</P>
<P>&#9;<B>3.D  President-elect's Report </B>(David Burstein).</P>
<P>&#9;As president-elect, I had two primary duties this year.   I have submitted my two reports to the Senate today on these activities (contact Darby at the Senate Office for copies as you wish 965-9245vm).</P>
<P>&#9;The President-elect now serves on the ICA Board and I was the first one to serve in that capacity.  In addition the President-elect also serves on the Athletic Compliance Audit Committee, then separately I served on the Faculty/Staff  ICA Committee that develops Staff Recognition Day.  </P>
<P>&#9;Briefly, a summary of the ICA Board activities that affected faculty this year: The Board has now elected to have faculty who serve on the Board also serve as liaisons to specific sports.  Namely, as liaisons they will be expected to go to practices, get to know the coaches, get to know the players, and be very supportive of that particular sport.  That program will begin in the fall of 1999.  The academic progress of student athletes is monitored by Jerry Kingston, the Faculty Athletic Representative, and commendation was given to eight sports that had good graduation records.  They expect that the five sports that require improved graduation rates will improve in the coming year.  President Coor's 34 recommendations related to ASU athletics (May 1994) were reviewed as to implementation; a detailed report was generated and most but not all of the recommendations have been implemented; good reasons were given for the few recommendations that were not implemented.  A complete revision of ASU's Philosophy of Intercollegiate Athletics was submitted to the Senate in the fall and passed.  Revision was in the works for five years before that.  Jerry Kingston clarified how a student can address incoming academic deficiencies in a way that is fair to the student, the ICA and to the University.  Kevin White, the ASU Athletic Director has held open houses at his home for the past two years for the faculty, and from my point of view it would be nice if more faculty not directly involved with the ICA or the Academic Senate office would show up to these functions, if invited.  I would encourage any of you who are invited to go these very nice affairs.  </P>
<P>&#9;To summarize the ACAC this year, I am an outside observer on this committee.  As Paul Frost said, I am a scientist and it appeared to me that even the best ICA in the best university in this country, if put under the same microscope as our university, and the same NCAA rules, we would compare favorably; because it is amazing that we have as few violations as we have.  </P>
<P>&#9;To summarize my work with the ICA Faculty/Staff Committee, this year we instituted Faculty/Staff Days, for women's basketball, men's basketball, softball and baseball games.  A few of you showed up at each of those games, and I am pleased to report that there was noted increased attendance at each of those games over  attendance.  We hope that this becomes a faculty/staff tradition, as much as the football game in the fall has become.  In this way, we can get more faculty and staff interaction with the ICA. </P>
<P>&#9;My other report deals with the survey of the university for the Student Information System usage.  In the fall of 1998, Bill Lewis, Vice Provost for Information Technology; Lou Ann Denny, ASU Registrar, Darrel Huish, Director of IT Information Systems; and I organized a team of twelve people from Main, East and West to survey the three campuses asking the same three questions: What do you use the system for now?  What would you like to use the system for that it doesn't do now?  What would you like to use the system to do but you don't think is necessary?  The three questions were meant to cover everybody's idea of what went on.  You could give us information via the web, via email, by direct letters to me, through the Senate Office and via fifty interviews our team did on all three campuses, during the period of January, February and the beginning of March.  What was nice about the information we gathered is that it seems there is a great deal of redundancy in what people would like to see a new system do.   In fact, if we can see three things in the new system, 90-95% of our problems can be solved: 1) Put the system on the web -- make it very interactive with Outlook and any other system you have; the SAP update will do this.  2) Make the time-out on the system variable, that is right now it is a straight 15 minute time-out if you are on the system; make it so that you can time out on the system anywhere from 15 minutes to 30-45 minutes.  IT is looking at doing that with the current SIS system; certainly in the new system, we can do that.  The biggest thing is to be able to do what you currently do with Outlook and other Window based systems: access multiple files in parallel rather than having to download serially, or to go up serially.  That will be instituted in the SAP update as well as we can do it in any computer system, a few windows at a time.  Two important things to note: 1) Most groups we spoke with emphasized the need to have an integrated computer business system on campus that permits easy coordination among Student Information Systems, Human Resources, finance and research support.  We heard that repeatedly that it would be nice to have a system that allows interaction between all facets of the university.  2) As currently constituted at ASU, the SIS system is separate from what we call the Data Warehouse.  In the SAP upgrade, these two systems will be combined into one.  There is a Web Page that you can now log onto, to look at what is going on in the SAP update (www.asu, edu/improved/sapiq/iq.htm). </P>

<B><P>4.  &#9;Open Forum.  </B>There were no items brought forward for discussion.</P>

<B><P>5.  &#9;Unfinished Business (Committee Motions).</P>
<P>&#9;5. A.  Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee </B>(Linda Johnson).</P>
<B><P>5.A.1  Senate Motion #18 (1998-1999) (second reading): The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal from the President's Committee on Streamlining ASU's Undergraduate Requirements </B>(motion w/rationale attached)(copies of the document are available by calling the Academic Senate Office 965-9245vm).</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: We are considering this motion as a committee motion, which does not require a second.  We are considering the motion as a whole, and the 15 recommendations attached.</P>
<P>Senator O'Grady: Could you clarify what recommendation 4 actually means--what is free choice? </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: I will defer to Vice Provost Bantz who chaired the committee.</P>
<P>Vice Provost Bantz: Number 4 is not a requirement; it is an encouragement, a hope that students will be able in their curriculum to select a course that is not specifically required in the last and the first years.  Paul Frost made the point effectively that if we are successful in educating an undergraduates, if by the time they end their studies, they would very much like to pick a course, a capstone to add to the curriculum, they should be allowed to do so.  At the same time, the committee did not specifically state that you had to do this in the curriculum.   Many courses of study have blocks at the end of the terms, i.e. student teaching.  You cannot force this situation.  It is a hope that we would like people to design into their curriculum.</P>
<P>Senator Linder: At the last meeting, there was something mentioned about a potential conflict between recommendation #2 and recommendation #14, which deals with literacy and critical inquiry and recommends that at least one of the two LCI courses be taken preferably within the major.  If we were to specify, for example in my department of Psychology, a menu of LCI courses that are required, we would conflict with recommendation #2.  </P>
<P>Vice Provost Bantz: After that meeting, we looked at this recommendation again. In fact, Senator O'Grady is the person that raised this concern.  It is a thoughtful one.  The committee I believe intended that the preference expressed in recommendation #14 be exactly that.  In that sense, I do not mean to split hairs here, but it is in fact a preference that a student would do that, but not a requirement.  Several of our curricula we discovered, in fact, do not require being in the major and the rule currently is a preference.  That is actually not a change.  I hope this clarifies it.  It could be entered to say "except for literacy and critical inquiry," the problem being those students do complete that sometimes not in their major.  ASU currently does not require it.</P>
<P>Senator Matt: Departments need direction on how to interpret this.  How then would the check sheets reflect that an L2 course would perhaps satisfy an N3 requirement, which in the current catalog there is also an indication that there is encouragement in the department to streamline our own check sheets.  Will we be adding items instead?</P>
<P>Vice Provost Bantz: The question that I would put to the Senate at the risk of an amendment from the floor; if the Senate felt that literacy and critical inquiry needs to be an option, if it needs to be exempted from 2b or included in the language and that would clarify things that would help.  The committee felt that possibility was available and I will give as one example, my own department, Communication.  We require courses in the department--COM 308 for all students, which happens to be a literacy course.  It was required before there was a literacy course and it was required after.  It happens to be a course that allows students to double dip under 2A.  A student, however, could take an L course elsewhere, if they had met that requirement somehow.  I don't know if this explanation clarifies things.  The committee did not believe this was an absolute prohibition because it was reflected in the current situation.</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: This is a type of philosophy document about what we want to do and perhaps President Coor can respond to this, that next year we would be working specifically on implementation measures to make those changes and to provide assistance to academic advisors to ensure that those check sheets and a variety of other implementation issues would happen.</P>
<P>President Coor: That is correct.  </P>
<P>Senator O'Grady: Again on recommendation #14, a free choice in your first year and your final year would amount to about six credits.  Currently there is a 35-credit requirement in the General Studies Program and there is a 35 hour major requirement, and there is a 6-credit requirement in a proficiency.  Do these six credits fit in any of those?  Are they part of the major?  Are they part of the General Studies?  Are they simply six additional credits that a student is required to take?  Are they free electives totally, so a student could in theory take basket weaving?  Are they free electives in the sense that they are part of the General Studies requirements?  In addition, on the flow charts we put one of them in the first year and one of them in the last year.  </P>
<P>Vice Provost Bantz: In a quantitative sense in the way you framed it, in Engineering, for example, you assume the Engineering major is 87 hours.  We know we have 41 hours of General Studies and composition.   In fact, if that were true, those two points, there is no way that totally free electives are possible.  That is why in effect that these are reflected as a whole.  However, the vast majority of our students are not in Engineering.  They are majors, which in fact do not specify the entire 120 or 128 hours.  The suggestion that Paul Frost was pointing to was the notion that some majors set it up sequentially, so that a student is unlikely to have a choice in the last semester.  The committee was convinced by Paul's point that a student may in fact be the best judge of what additional course they need to take.  It would not only effect the individual student; it would affect a substantial number of those majors that do not require the full maximum number of hours.  That is why it was written.  It is not a requirement; if it were an accounting like requirement, the rest of the report would have to be rewritten.  </P>
<P>Provost Glick: I do not want to wordsmith but it seems to me that the report carefully chooses when to say "should" and when to say "must."  It means those to be different.  I worry that the casual reader would not have given as much credence to that differentiation and maybe the introductory stuff we need to attach should make it clear that "should" and "must" are there deliberately, not accidentally.  The casual reader, as Senator O'Grady has raised, will see should and must as casually interchangeable and they are not meant to be.  Perhaps someplace in the cover there should be a clear statement added.</P>
<P>Senator Higgins: If the casual reader will become confused, what will happen to the students?  For example, in 2b:Students should not be required to meet University General Studies with major or college-required courses without Presidential approval.  My department requires 21 hours of Math starting at Math 270.  If you say "should" it seems to me that, some of this stuff will make for more student confusion.  Engineering College specifies the L1 and L2 courses.  I know that Engineering is going to ask for a waiver on some of this stuff because basically we have about 30 hours where the students can elect something and have a choice, but the choice is either in Humanities or technical electives, not free choices.  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: I think the committee always recognized that Engineering would probably have to ask for waivers because of accreditation issues and largely because of the way their curriculum is structured.  That is not in a negative way at all.  I hope in the implementation phase we will be able to iron out these specific interpretive questions.</P>
<P>Paul Frost: I was just going to say that I realize these recommendations are going to be different for each college.  It will effect the college requirements differently.  The implementation will be unique to each college.  I am sure that Engineering will be requesting some waivers.</P>
<P>Senator Jacob: If it is going to be different for each college then what is the purpose of this at all.  My second question is do I understand correctly what recommendation 4 says, that a student should be able to select another couple of courses beyond 120 or 126 hours to graduate?</P>
<P>How many majors at this university have not already been squeezed to the bare bones?  Engineering has explained why it cannot do that.  Physics cannot do that very well.  </P>
<P>Vice Provost Bantz: I can respond in terms of the collegiate differences are fundamental ones that we have assumed from the beginning, in Nursing and in Engineering, because of accreditation needs they have a very structured curriculum.  There is one free elective in 120 hours.  There is one General Studies choice in 120 hours.   Engineering has accreditation requirements which most of you are familiar with.  The question in terms of the number of majors, and we have not analyzed all of them, we know that there are a number of majors that have many students in which there is some flexibility.  I give you one example of Communication, with 1100 students, is able to add an elective in it, and journalism has electives in it and has about the same number of students.  Psychology probably has room for electives, as does Exercise Science with an equal number of students as well.  There are a significant number of students as well as majors.  The committee was trying to recognize from the onset that one of the riches of the university is that we do have dramatically different majors that are available on this campus.  We cannot try to make them lock-step similar; we need to make it flexible so students can move through majors without losing significant hours of credit.  Last year, 10% of the students at ASU changed their majors.  2400 students changed their colleges, not majors, in the fall of 1997-98.  That is why we indicated when we started this process that we were aware of these differences.  </P>
<P>Senator Linder: There is an alternative recommendation to recommendation #15.  Is this clear in our vote on this which action we are adopting?  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: It is my understanding that we came forward with the alternative recommendation.</P>
<P>Vice Provost Bantz: The Executive Committee recommended the alternative recommendation.</P>
<P>Senator Linder: I would like to speak in favor of this proposal.  I think it will move us ahead significantly and our college considered it very closely.  We believe that the concerns we raised were heard, which led to modifications as we moved through the process.  I am hoping that in the implementation process, the presidential committee is good at communicating these requests.   </P>
<P>Provost Glick: If some of us are concerned, reflect on how the students will react.  Remember that this is not what the students will see.  These are instructions to colleges and departments and the university.  I assume that once these are adopted, that we would then write a very clear statement to the students as to what they must do.  Any of these are directed to the colleges and departments, but in the implementation process, these must be clarified for the students.  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Hearing no further discussion we will move to a vote on this item.  A yes vote accepts the recommendations of the Streamlining Committee.  Senate Motion #18 passed by vocal vote with three nay<B> </B>votes duly recorded.       </P>
<B><P>5.A.2  Senate Motion #19</B> <B>(1998-1999)(second reading)</B>: <B>The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to establish a BS in Biochemistry </B>(motion w/rationale attached) (copies of the document were previously distributed and are available by calling the Academic Senate Office 965-9245vm).<B>  </P>
</B><P>Senator Johnson: Are there any concerns or questions about this motion?</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Hearing no further discussion we will move to a vote.  A yes vote for Senate Motion #19 establishes a BS degree in Biochemistry.  Senate Motion #19 passed unanimously by voice vote.   </P>
<B><P>5.A.3   Senate Motion #20</B> <B>(1998-1999):</B> <B>The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to establish a BS in Molecular Biosciences/Biotechnology</B> (motion w/rationale attached)(copies of the documentation may be obtained by calling the Academic Senate Office 965-9245).  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Is there discussion on this motion?  Hearing no discussion, we will move to a vote.  A yes vote establishes a BS in Molecular Biosciences/Biotechnology.  Senate Motion #20 passed unanimously by voice vote.    </P>
<B><P>          5.A.4  Senate Motion #21 (1998-1999)</B>: <B>The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee</P>
<P>recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Fine Arts to establish a Post-Bachelor's Artist Diploma Certificate</B> (motion w/rationale and documentation are attached).  </P>
<P>&#9;Senate President Davey: Are there questions about this motion?</P>
<P>&#9;Senator O'Grady: I do not understand why they simply do not give the students a masters degree.  It would seem to me to be a higher degree than a diploma, yet this seems to be more work than a masters degree.  </P>
<P>&#9;Senate President Davey: Is there someone here from the College of Fine Arts that can respond to that question?</P>
<P>&#9;Senator Solis: I would suppose that is a more rigorous degree than a master's degree, purely oriented toward artistic performance.  The people that created this proposal feel that this diploma would be make us more comparable to what other institutions are doing.   </P>
<P>&#9;Senate President Davey: Hearing no further discussion we will move to a vote.  Senate Motion #21 unanimously passed by voice vote.</P>

<B><P>7.   &#9;Passing the Gavel.</P>
</B><P>&#9;Senate President Davey: I appreciate the quality of the discussions that we have had in the Senate over some very serious issues this year and I appreciate the dedication of some of the senators who have taken to read this material and pay serious attention to it.  As my last act, I will pass the gavel to Dr. David Burstein.</P>
<P>&#9;Incoming Senate President Burstein: As it is also a tradition, the incoming president has a few things to give the outgoing president.  In this case, I have chosen the moon and stars motif for my wrapping paper, appropriate for my discipline.  </P>
<P>&#9;Dr. Davey opened his presents which were a souvenir gavel and plaque to commemorate his Senate service and person gifts.   </P>
<P>&#9;Incoming Senate President Burstein: Bill gave us leadership as not only the Senate President but as President of the Arizona Faculties Council this year.  He did an excellent job on our behalf with AFC this year, and we owe him a vote of gratitude for this. </P>
