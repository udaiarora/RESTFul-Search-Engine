<h1 class="storyhead">The New Explorers: Joe Fernando</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p><em><strong>Engineering professor applies expertise to tsunami research</strong></em></p>
<p>When Harindra Joseph Fernando made a vacation trip to his homeland of Sri Lanka in July 2004, he saw something that, in retrospect, he will never forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My family and I, after a day of activities, were returning to the Yala Safari Resort where we were staying,&rdquo; says Fernando, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, and the leader of ASU&rsquo;s environmental fluid dynamics program. &ldquo;I saw a huge amount of coral being transported. Two trucks were full of coral reefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was talking with my wife and said it looked like they might be mining coral off the coast. Or there might be some problem with the coral with warming or warm currents. Or they may have been blast fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="images/20060424_Fernando_new.jpg" width="255" height="172" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">The next time Fernando set foot on his homeland, he saw an island nation in ruins. It was two weeks after a massive tsunami had hit Sri Lanka, wiping out towns, villages and resorts in a pattern that appeared random at first glance.</p>
<p>The Yala Safari Resort, where Fernando and his family stayed five months before, was destroyed. As he went around the area, gathering evidence of the tsunami &ndash; noting physical markers like water lines on buildings and trees, listening to the stories about the &ldquo;churning wall of water,&rdquo; and taking note of how everything was strewn about &ndash; he began to piece together what may have happened. </p>
<p>The tsunami hit hard in specific parts of Sri Lanka, says Fernando, who studies ocean waves and atmospheric dynamics. The effects of the wall of water could be seen up to a mile inland in some areas &ndash; areas like Peraliya, where it carried a passenger train 50 meters (200 feet) off its tracks, killing about 1,700 people.</p>
<p>But in other areas, there was little &ndash; if any &ndash; destruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I went through the southwestern part of Sri Lanka, suddenly it struck me that the major destruction of the area might be partly due to the coral mining that had taken place,&rdquo; Fernando says. &ldquo;While the wave came from the east, certain southwestern parts of the country also were hammered by the wave.</p>
<p><img src="../200512/200512_images/NewExplorer_Logos_000.gif" width="100" height="100" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">&ldquo;I sent some divers along that path &ndash; the area where I saw the coral mining and an area further away &ndash; and we looked at the mark of the head corals. The area (where the corals were removed) that really got hammered, like up to 1.5 kilometers (one mile) inland, had gotten a 30-foot wall of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fernando had been studying various kinds of ocean waves for 20 years when the tsunami of Dec. 26, 2004, changed the course of his research. Until that event, his wave work was mainly specialized in nature &ndash; and primarily for the Navy.</p>
<p>Now he was crawling on beaches, drilling sand cores and studying sand grain orientation to learn where the wall of water came from. All the while, he was formulating ideas as to what may have happened on that December day, when it seemed like the world was ending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the water came in, the coral that remained would act as a resistance to the water wave underneath,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So as water heads ashore (to shallow water), the wave will go the least resistant path, basically getting deflected and magnified to the areas where the coral were removed. It just shoots in there, amplifying the force of the wave. That is what happened for the doomed train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fernando has been back to Sri Lanka five times since the tsunami hit. He first gathered forensic data, then pieced that data together to understand what happened when the tsunami hit. From there, Fernando and his colleagues (including Philip Liu of Cornell, Costas Synolakis from the University of Southern California and Jim Goff from New Zealand) and students began hypothesizing about why some areas of the Sri Lanka coast were devastated and others relatively unscathed. Finally, they tested their ideas in the wave tank on campus.</p>
<p><img src="images/20060424_fernando_scenic.jpg" width="255" height="194" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">All through the process, Fernando and his colleagues were in contact with the governments of the hardest-hit countries, suggesting changes that could be made to help avoid the catastrophe of another tsunami. Since the tsunami, those governments have pitched in $60 million and are installing a tsunami warning system: a series of six large, strategically placed buoys to provide an early warning should another wall of water be on its way.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka also appears to be taking some of Fernando&rsquo;s reef findings to heart, as evidenced on his last trip to his homeland.</p>
<p>One of the big lessons learned is the need for education, says Fernando, who recently was appointed by the U.S. Department of Interior to the Louisiana Coastal Area Restoration Program Science Board for his post-tsunami studies. Education would help inform the public that, when the ocean significantly recedes and exposes the coral reef, it is a sign to leave the area immediately. Education also would help the public understand the function of Sri Lanka&rsquo;s natural barriers and respect them.</p>
<p>In late March, Fernando saw a series of billboards along the coast of the reef belt of Sri Lanka. The billboard asks citizens to protect the reefs, as they are protectors of communities. He also saw berm-like structures built to help strengthen areas that are more vulnerable to beach erosion and wave inundation. It gave Fernando deep satisfaction that his research is helping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was interesting to see that following our work, the papers we published, the many visits with the government and the public commentaries, that the government is now taking strict measures to curb coral reef poaching,&rdquo; Fernando says.</p>
