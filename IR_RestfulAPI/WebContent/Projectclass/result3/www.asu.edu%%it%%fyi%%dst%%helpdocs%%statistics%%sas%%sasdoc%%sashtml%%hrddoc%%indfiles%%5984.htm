SAS Technical Report R-105, Computing MIVQUEO Estimates of Variance Components
</H1><P>
Presents computing methods for variance component estimation. These        methods are designed to handle large sample survey or animal breeding
experiments in which the random effects may have thousands of levels.      The underlying theoretical technique, MIVQUEO (with V=1), has been
shown to yield unbiased, locally best, admissible, and asymptotically      consistent estimators.
