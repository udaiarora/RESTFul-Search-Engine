<p><b>1. Call to Order.</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting was called to order

at 3:16 p.m. by Past Senate President David Burstein.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past President Burstein: I am taking

Doug Johnson?s place today because he is down at the legislature dealing

with health insurance issues.&nbsp; There will be a press release in the

near future, but first it has to pass the joint legislative budget committee.&nbsp;

The bottom line is that whatever happens, we will have to pay more next

year.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minutes were approved as written.

<p><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Announcements and Communications.</b>

<p><b>3.A&nbsp; Senate President?s Report</b> (David Burstein for Douglas

Johnson).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a faculty member or an academic professional in

the Senate, we deal with one or two substantive issues each year that we

will review seriously, because those new policies will directly affect

us.&nbsp; We are blessed this year with four items, and three of them have

been well discussed in the Senate already.&nbsp; It is my opinion that

the changes to the ASU Promotion and Tenure policies will only make them

more consistent with one another.&nbsp; What has occurred is that these

policies have been built up over time; the most recent change to them was

the addition of the post tenure review guidelines.&nbsp; The net effect

is that things were explained in four different places in the ASU policies,

somewhat differently.&nbsp; The changes we propose will make those consistent.&nbsp;

We also are holding true to what the Regents have set out for us (excellence

in teaching, research and service as well as service to the state).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it is now the end of the year for our Senate,

we have asked Dean Schneider who chairs the Promotion and Tenure Taskforce,

to make her presentation on the revisions to the Senate in the fall.&nbsp;

The revisions are very important to all of us.&nbsp; In the meantime, what

I do ask you to do as senators is to take back to your departments that

those policy revisions are posted on the web.&nbsp; There is a summary

sheet on the front and then each item is explained.&nbsp; I urge all members

of the Senate to read the policies because whether we like them or not,

the revisions will be adopted at some point and you should be well informed

about the changes.&nbsp; What kind of revisions we pass will depend on

what kind of input we receive from the faculty and academic professionals.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second issue is the revision of the Intellectual

Property Policy with regard to electronic publishing.&nbsp; A policy like

that can be put together in a curious way in that the options could be

either&nbsp; a) giving faculty all the power and none to the university

or b) giving all the power to the university and none to the faculty.&nbsp;

Harvard University has adopted regulations that are like the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In other words, at Harvard, anything that the faculty does, the university

has a part in.&nbsp; Our policy as it was initially proposed, went much

more toward the faculty than the university.&nbsp; The Deans, when they

heard of this, decided to revisit the policy.&nbsp; The net effect is that

we will be considering modifications to the ASU IP Policy in the fall.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third issue is one that will not go away.&nbsp;

We will all be dealing with the new Arizona Regents University, for the

rest of our careers.&nbsp; What the ARU is going to be like--we will ask

Tom Trotter to comment on, but stay tuned to various places on the web

if you want to give input and follow up on the progress being made on this

item.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth issue is one that I just learned about

last week; it involves the Intellectual Property Policy but is separate

from it.&nbsp; It involves the definitions and rules of&nbsp; ?fair use.?&nbsp;

We as faculty all use copyrighted materials in our classrooms, but when

it comes to putting such material on the Web, it turns out that we do not

have the complete fair use of those materials.&nbsp; I do not want to explain

details about why, but the ASU General Counsel Office is studying the issue

and will inform us of what we can and can?t do in the near future.&nbsp;

I have asked the General Counsel staff to email the web address to us so

that we can view their Cliff Notes.&nbsp; Connected with this is that up

until now, the ASU Purchasing Office has indicated the fair use issues

for us.&nbsp; There are packet deadlines for fair use issues.&nbsp; For

first summer session you must have those packet deadlines available to

the ASU Copy Centers for the first day of summer classes submitted by May

29, for second summer session by July 2, and for fall by August 20.&nbsp;

Packet with copyright article deadlines for first summer session are due

April 20--for the second summer session due May 18?for fall due May 25.&nbsp;

Packet only is due May 18, for first summer session, June 4 for second

summer session, June 18 for fall.&nbsp; But June 18 seems like a misprint.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connected to that is cost purchasing due to fair

use adjudication.&nbsp; Our ASU Purchasing Department does not have the

money to do that.&nbsp; It may still be ASU Purchasing that handles this

function if other monies are found, and it may even be done similar to

how it was done before.&nbsp; How it will be different, I cannot say right

now until we hear from General Counsel?s Office.&nbsp; Are there further

questions?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morton Munk could not be with us today, and Tom Trotter

is sitting in for Milton Glick.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Technology-Focused Courses for the New Economy

</b>(Dr.

Johnson was to address this issue, and he will update everyone at the April

30th Senate meeting. (a handout is available from the Academic Senate Office)

and you may click on the hyperlink below to see a list of those courses.

<p><b>3.B&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President-elect?s Report </b>(Mort Munk).&nbsp;

No report.

<p><b>3.C&nbsp; University Provost?s Report</b> (Tom Trotter for Milton

Glick).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had an opportunity to visit with Dr. Glick and

Dr. Church about what I would tell you today.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three

things: raises, appropriations and tuition increases.&nbsp; We agreed that

there is nothing new to report, because all these issues are currently

up in the air and we do not know how they are going to come down.&nbsp;

First, there is a complex negotiation process going on at the legislative

level, and second, the whole political environment in which tuition increases

are decided is up in the air at this time.&nbsp; I wish I could say something

more definitive, but I am afraid I just can?t.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are all aware of the problem with the Social

Sciences Building.&nbsp; It is going to have to come down in time.&nbsp;

After the routine annual inspections by our Physical Facilities personnel

this year, we decided to get the opinion of an outside consultant.&nbsp;

We brought one consultant to campus in December, and then had a second

consultant come in at the beginning of the New Year.&nbsp; These consultants

gave a conservative estimate.&nbsp; They indicated that the fourth floor

of the Social Sciences building must be vacated this summer and the entire

building should be vacated in the next two to three years.&nbsp; That is

exactly what we will do.&nbsp; How that will be done is yet to be determined.&nbsp;

If you can imagine, we must take out an entire department this summer and

park it in places across the campus.&nbsp; We have been telling academic

units all along that we have no such places, but now we must find them.&nbsp;

The Department of Political Science has been very fair in their response

to us about relocating.&nbsp; I would like to thank them and their staff

for the cooperation they have shown.&nbsp; I also want to thank the Physical

Facilities Department because they are going to have to deal with finding

space.&nbsp; This move will also require some fine-tuning to our long-range

capital plans.&nbsp; This is a sudden change, as we are talking about a

building that is going to be razed at some point, and two weeks ago this

was not on the table.&nbsp; One of the questions that has been asked is?Is

this situation typical; are there other buildings with similar problems?&nbsp;

To the best of my knowledge the answer is no.&nbsp; It is a very unique

problem connected only with this building.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has to

do with the design parameters and the use of a particular kind of technique

in the concrete.&nbsp; Social Sciences is the only building on campus designed

and constructed with this technique.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the e-learning item that David mentioned,

the Arizona Regents University, I would like to say more.&nbsp; I will

give you the short summary of where we are with this item.&nbsp; During

the first portion of the academic year, the notion of having a tri-university,

cooperative, e-learning entity was broadly discussed.&nbsp; The Board of

Regents hired a team of external consultants, and they were looking at

this from a very broad perspective.&nbsp; At one time they thought that

the ARU would be an entity that was independent from the three state universities,

having its own accreditation, staffing, personnel, operating budgets, physical

location, etc.&nbsp; In the end, a very conservative decision was made

to have Arizona Regents University be a very thin and narrow organization,

which will basically be a shell.&nbsp; It will coordinate and facilitate

e-learning activities that the three public universities in Arizona are

already doing.&nbsp; It will NOT have its own courses, faculty, or degrees.&nbsp;

There will be no change from established academic procedures on the three

campuses.&nbsp; Currently the vast majority of students who are taking

e-learning classes are regular students with a presence on one of the three

universities, and all of the studies show that this will continue for the

conceivable future.&nbsp; It will be mainline students who are supplementing

their traditional studies with some type of online experience.&nbsp; We

already have thousands of students doing that right now.&nbsp; Through

ARU this will not be different and so, ARU for these students will mean

no change whatsoever.&nbsp; Over time it may be the case that the ARU will

be the first point of contact with students who have never experienced

ASU, NAU, or UofA.&nbsp; We envision that such a student will first contact

the ARU web link, and then through ARU will be routed to one of the three

universities for registration purposes.&nbsp; That university will become

the home campus for the student.&nbsp; The home campus will then be responsible

for making it possible for the student to enroll electronically in any

of the e-learning classes at any of the three universities.&nbsp; The home

campus will handle all business transactions in addition to registration,

financial and admissions, etc.&nbsp; If a student attempted to accomplish

all these tasks on foot, they would have to drive all around the state.&nbsp;

The total staff to be associated with ARU is envisioned to be 1.5 FTE.&nbsp;

The Director and one assistant, and a very modest operating budget of approximately

$15,000 per year.&nbsp; Given the range of possiblities that were on the

plate at one time, this is a real victory for conservatism.&nbsp; I think

the university is going to be well served by the ARU.&nbsp; Right now a

project management team has been assembled with one member from each of

the universities, and this team reports directly to the Board of Regents

and the Council of Presidents.&nbsp; The team has been charged with making

the Arizona Regents University a reality in the shortest amount of time.&nbsp;

I have been appointed to be the ASU representative on this management team.&nbsp;

Right now I am spending about one third of my time and one full day per

week down at the Board headquarters, working with the other representatives

and trying to bring this project to fruition.&nbsp; We have an important

tri-university workshop on April 18 in which the bursars, registrars, directors

of the financial aid, etc. will begin to sort out the business services

side of ARU.&nbsp;&nbsp; In time, the issues of having an academic program

will be dealt with as we enhance the things that the universities already

do with e-learning experiences.&nbsp; Are there problems ahead, yes there

are.&nbsp; There are some important issues that need to be worked through.&nbsp;

One is how do we sustain and maintain academic quality in an e-learning

environment.&nbsp; This is an issue in which the faculty are deeply involved,

with or without the Arizona Regents University.&nbsp; It will be a big

job that will be studied over time.

<p>Senator Grossman: You mentioned that the ARU will have 1.5 FTE, a budget

of $15,000 and what will essentially happen is that a web site to direct

traffic will be developed.

<p>Tom Trotter: I would say a little more than that.

<p>Senator Grossman: I can?t say much more than that given that level of

resources.&nbsp; What struck me in your comments, and I ask you, does it

sound like ARU will be a symbolic reassurance on the point that there is

no real commitment?&nbsp; So the participants can?t say, we are attending

an online university?

<p>Tom Trotter: It is more complicated than that.&nbsp; The funds from

Proposition 301 go to the Board directly and then dispersed to the universities.&nbsp;

There will be approximately 2 million dollars per year to support activities

through the ARU, for up to the next 20 years.&nbsp; That is not a huge

sum of money; many states have spent between 10 and 40 million on such

types of activities.&nbsp; Two million is a relatively modest amount.&nbsp;

For the first couple of years, those monies will be spent on academic program

development and go directly to each of the universities, to do the kinds

of things they would like to do.&nbsp; We will have to price and figure

out the business processes that will enable student services to offer the

students a seamless registration.

<p>Senator Grossman: So what you are saying is that the money will be invested

in the universities, not in the ARU?

<p>Tom Trotter: This is correct.

<p>Senator Komnenich: If a student who is assigned a home university takes

classes from all three universities, then who will award the degree?

<p>Tom Trotter: The only kind of degree that can be pursued is one that

ASU, NAU, or UofA award.&nbsp; There are also a few tri-university degrees.&nbsp;

You have to satisfy the requirements.&nbsp; You may take any one of the

e-learning courses that are offered by any of the three universities, but

your degree will be awarded from only one of the universities.

<p>Debby Losse: Where will assessment be factored into the ARU?&nbsp; It

is rolled into our normal degrees.

<p>Tom Trotter: This project will have a longer lasting mission than the

other issues.&nbsp; How do you get financial aid systems and other student

systems talking to one another is simple enough in concept, but it involves

complicated computer programming behind the scenes.&nbsp; Issues like how

a student will receive financial aid when they are taking classes at more

than one campus and the issues of quality assessment are ongoing.&nbsp;

The faculty will have to widely review and give input on both of these

topics.

<p>Senator Burg: Will this extend to graduate programs as well?

<p>Tom Trotter: Already there is a tri-university degree, Master of Engineering

that has been assembled over the last three years.&nbsp; So, in short the

answer is yes.&nbsp; I think that over the next short while we will emphasize

developing programs out of the College of Nursing and the College of Education

to address widely perceived workforce shortages in those areas.&nbsp; E-learning

will be only a small part of the solution but nevertheless it will be a

part.

<p><b>3.D&nbsp; ASASU President?s Report</b> (Alex Bainbridge).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are still down at the legislature working very

hard.&nbsp; Tuition is still undecided, and the AFAT bill is being heard

this afternoon.&nbsp; We are also waiting to hear on the College Savings

Plan. It looks as though we will withdraw our separate bills, and then

have one university bill on financial aid.&nbsp; I will talk to you more

on that later.&nbsp; Right now, along those lines, I will share that President

Coor has come out with a $200 tuition increase for in-state tuition and

a $500 out-of-state tuition increase.&nbsp; The Arizona Students Association,

this morning, came out with a straight across-the-board 5% for in-state

and out-of- state tuition increase, so that goes a bit below what President

Coor?s recommendation is.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Tuesday, we will have a Tuition Town Hall on the

North side of Memorial Union between Noon and 1:00 p.m (a flyer was distributed).&nbsp;

President Coor will be there and we will answer questions and hand out

tuition information packets to everyone who attends.&nbsp; There will be

some copies of the Regents? task force reports available, and the report

from the Attorney General, which says that if we are to provide as nearly

free as possible education in Arizona, we can go to the top of the bottom

one-third (the 30th percentile) of our peer list.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the ASASU web page, we have established a chatroom

available to take student surveys, talk about issues on campus, and at

the same time allow us to receive feedback from the students on what they

want to see changed.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Arizona Board of Regents will have a tuition

setting hearing on Thursday evening between 5-8 p.m. in the BAC building.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of very exciting things that will happen

this week?Devils in Disguise, a new student run, student led, and student

involved, community service project will be held this weekend on Saturday.&nbsp;

It will be very exciting and it is their first annual event.&nbsp; As a

part of the Insuring Tomorrow program, a speaker will be brought in to

inform and encourage students to find out about the 75 opportunity areas

in Phoenix where they can volunteer to help out in the community.&nbsp;

There will be a free bus ride, lunch provided, and the event will last

from 9:00 to 3:00 p.m. on Saturday (a flyer was distributed to senators).&nbsp;

Following that event at 5:00 p.m., we have the Second City coming into

town.&nbsp; It is a comedy troupe that includes people that got their start

on Saturday Night Live and Mad TV, and now they have gone on this group.&nbsp;

This is a big event on campus.&nbsp; Also, from the ASASU Activities Office,

we have the Real World (those of you familiar with MTV) on campus Wednesday

night, on PV Beach.

<p><b>3.E&nbsp; Past President?s Report</b> (David Burstein). No further

report.

<p><b>3.F&nbsp; ASU West Senate Report</b> (Afsaneh Nahavandi).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major thing for West Senate this year has been

the request to offer lower division courses.&nbsp; We had our orientation

already, and 217 students were admitted, more than the 200 that we originally

anticipated.&nbsp; We know that 15 of those will not be attending ASU West.&nbsp;

Out of those who are attending, 71 have scholarship merit awards.&nbsp;

Our first orientation for the students and their parents was last Thursday

night.&nbsp; Out of all the students that registered, 57% are female which

is typical at our campus; 62% are Caucasian; 17% Hispanic; and 5% Black,

and we have other minority groups represented as well.&nbsp; Things seem

to be going along quite good.&nbsp; I am not sure we can keep it at 200

students, but we are getting ready to serve them.&nbsp; The entering students

will have a choice of four learning communities to participate in.

<p>David Burstein: We wish you all a lot of luck.

<p><b>3.G&nbsp; ASU East Senate Report</b> (Andy Jackson).&nbsp; No report.

<p><b>3.H&nbsp; Electronic Reserve &amp; Library Services </b>(Ginny Sylvester).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a presentation to the Senate?s University

Affairs Committee a couple of weeks ago, and they asked me to come to the

Senate and make my presentation.&nbsp; I find it very fortuitious that

I came on a day that we are talking about ?fair use.?&nbsp; With all these

new rules, we need to keep informed.&nbsp; Although we do follow fair use

guidelines at the University Libraries, we will mount anything to our Web

site that you wish to put on reserve (one time only)--if you have something

that is copyrighted we will scan it up once.&nbsp; We will take your tests,

your notes and your syllabi.&nbsp; We will have them up within 24 hours

to be available to your students 24 hours a day.&nbsp; We will take articles,

first time only.&nbsp; We will take your packets (those without a deadline),

and if you have never had them on reserve before, we will take them and

scan them up to the Web site as well.&nbsp; So, if you miss those packet

submission deadlines, you still will have an opportunity to place them

on the Web through us.&nbsp; My handout explains what we have available.&nbsp;

Students can download it, then print it out.&nbsp; That will not be a problem,

and printing will be available at Hayden, Noble, and the Architecture Library.&nbsp;

It is free to students.&nbsp; You may email me any questions about the

web sites on the hand- out at ginny.sylvester@asu.edu.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding interlibrary loan, there is a certain amount

of concern because of the recent serial cancellations and concern about

the processing of interlibrary requests, and any delay in document delivery.&nbsp;

I am here to tell you today to try us again, because we have streamlined

many of our procedures and currently there is no backlog of requests.&nbsp;

As of the first of March, we changed our online request forms to connect

us to a national database that allows us to immediately send your request

without any reprocessing, within one day.&nbsp; If the request does have

a problem that is readily identifiable, you will be delayed only one more

day.&nbsp; On the second of March, we began a project with eight other

associations of research libraries, and we have promised jointly to get

articles scanned and back the same day to the lending institutions.&nbsp;

We have cut our turnaround time in half at this point.&nbsp; Although it

is not nice to cancel serials, and that has already had to happen, I believe

that our Interlibrary Loan can work for you, once again.&nbsp; Just as

a reminder, all faculty can register for DirectDoc (articles directly to

your desktop through Interlibrary Loan).&nbsp; There are several web site

request locations where you can enter your requests online all hours of

the day and night, and it is free.&nbsp; These are on my hand-out.

<p>Senator Mayer: We currently have to bring our tests in for scanning.

Will that be handled by email in the future?

<p>Ginny Sylvester: We will talk more about the use of email attachments

in the future; we may even have library express handle this.

<p>Senator Fouquette: How about the percentage of a monograph that may

be loaded to the Web?

<p>Ginny Sylvester: We will be able to handle a percentage of a novel,

even complete articles (on a one-time basis) but not several articles from

the same publication, and not entire books. We do have to break some long

files on the reserve system.&nbsp; Books can be put on regular reserve.&nbsp;

Just email me if you have any further questions.

<p>Senator Guleserian to Past President Burstein: Do you know any more

about the health insurance discussion and whether there will be an indemnity

option?

<p>Past President Burstein: There is no further news, because Doug Johnson

when he took this assignment was asked to seal his lips.&nbsp; We will

all know when there is something to know.&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been a

lot of push from the universities about having an indemnity option, and

we are hopeful to have it but we are not assured of that at this point.

<p><b>4.&nbsp; Open Forum</b>.&nbsp; No issues were brought up under open

forum.

<p><b>5. Unfinished Business.</b>

<p><b>5.A&nbsp; Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee </b>(Michael

Mayer).

<p><b>5.A.1&nbsp; Second reading for Senate Motion # 9 (2000-2001):</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends

Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Business

to change the name of a degree program from MS in Information Management

to <u>MS in E-Business and Information Systems</u>.?

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rationale:</b> The reasons for the name change

are that advances in technology have changed and&nbsp; continue to markedly

change the global business landscape.&nbsp; Terms such as E-Commerce and

E-Business are now very much part of the vocabulary.&nbsp; In response,

to market their programs, universites have increasingly responded by re-branding

their technology rich programs with names such as Master of E-Commerce

or Master of E-Business.&nbsp; Prospective employers and prospective students,

in their search processes, now look for these names.

<p>Past President Burstein called for additional questions on this motion,

and there were none.&nbsp; <b>Senate Motion #9 was unanimously passed by

voice vote.</b>

<p><b>5.B.2&nbsp; Second Reading for Senate Motion #10 (2000-2001):</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends

Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Fine

Arts for the disestablishment of a Degree Program, BFA, major in Theatre

Education.?

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rationale:&nbsp; </b>Previously, the request to

disestablish the Theatre Education concentration was approved.&nbsp; As

a follow-up, it is now requested that the BFA degree in the Theatre Department

be eliminated, as well.&nbsp; The Theatre Department no longer will have

any BFA degree or concentration.

<p>Senator Guleserian: Will the Theatre Department be offering any degree?

<p>Senator Anderson: The degree that is being offered is a B.A. not a BFA.&nbsp;

That is the difference that throughout the country most universities are

not offering the BFA because they are conservatory degrees, whereas the

BA is an academic degree.

<p>Senator Grossman: So, the BFA as it stands is an ?option? for students

right now?

<p>Senator Anderson: Yes that is true.

<p>Past President Burstein called for additional questions on this motion,

and there were none.&nbsp; <b>Senate Motion #10 was unanimously passed

by voice vote.</b>

<p><b>5.B.3&nbsp; Second Reading for Senate Motion #11 (2000-2001):</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee

recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted by the College

of Liberal Arts and Sciences for the establishment of an Undergraduate

Certificate in Classical Studies.?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Rationale:</b> The certificate program in Classical

Studies will benefit both the students and the university in a number of

ways.&nbsp; By means of the certificate program in Classical Studies, students

will be able to augment and enrich their degree programs in related fields

with an organized and consistent curriculum which will expose them to many

aspects of ancient language and culture, and they will also be prepared

to pursue advanced studies in Classical Studies or in related fields in

Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Ancient History, English, Art History,

or Philosophy with the strength of an approved program behind them.

<p>Senator Guleserian: Forgive my ignorance, but Classical Studies seems

to be a dying breed and I am glad to see that a certificate is being offered

here.&nbsp; What I do not know is what the term certificate exactly encompasses.

<p>Past President Burstein: I will defer to Tom Trotter on this issue.

<p>Tom Trotter: It has had at least three different meanings, but in this

case it means a certain number of hours (18 hours).

<p>Senator Guleserian: A minor has 18 hours.&nbsp; How would a certificate

be different from a minor?

<p>Senator Mayer: This particular certificate is interdisciplinary, and

in fact most cerficates are.&nbsp; It is not only related to Languages

and Literatures, but Art, Anthropology, English, History, Latin, and Humanities.&nbsp;

Those are areas from among which the individual can take courses.

<p>Tom Trotter: It actually allows following a trend rather than establishing

a minor.&nbsp; It also produces a specific mark on a student?s transcript,

whereas the minor does not.

<p>Past Senate President Burstein called for additional questions on this

motion, and there were none.&nbsp; <b>Senate Motion #11 was unanimously

passed by voice vote.</b>

<p><b>6. New Business </b>(Committee Reports/New Motions).

<p><b>6.A.&nbsp; Executive Committee</b> (Doug Johnson).&nbsp; No report.

<p><b>6.B&nbsp;&nbsp; Committee on Committees</b> (Brent Brown).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to report that the paper ballots will

be mailed this week to members of the Academic Assembly.&nbsp; I encourage

you to vote and send in your ballots.&nbsp;&nbsp; By next year we hope

to be able to vote electronically.&nbsp; We were not able to do that this

year.&nbsp; When you come to your last Academic Senate meeting, we will

distribute a ballot to you for filling vacancies on the Senate standing

committees.&nbsp; We will vote at the meeting.&nbsp; Those two things are

coming up.&nbsp; Thanks to the members of the Committee on Committees for

their work this year, and to Darby who organized the work of our committee

and kept us on schedule.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Congratulations to Senator Betsy Burns who was elected

to chair the committee next year.

<p><b>6.C&nbsp; Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee</b> (Mike Mayer).&nbsp;

No futher report.

<p><b>6.D&nbsp;&nbsp; Personnel Committee</b> (Jose Cobas).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a new idea, the committee report was attached

to the Senate agenda.&nbsp; You may also view it as an attachment to the

February Senate agenda on the web.

<p><b>6.E&nbsp;&nbsp; Student-Faculty Policy Committee</b> (Craig Allen).

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee will meet on Tuesday, April 10th, and

hear a report from Dean Anne Schneider who chaired the task force to revise

the ASU promotion and tenure guidelines.&nbsp; These revisions will be

fully presented to the Senate in the fall.&nbsp; We will also consider

a plan coming from ASASU to resuscitate the Course Evaluation Program online

this time, rather than in the classes.&nbsp; We look forward to hearing

details on that.&nbsp; I will report more at the April 30 Senate meeting.

<p><b>6.F&nbsp;&nbsp; University Affairs Committee </b>(Renu Sharma).&nbsp;

No report.

<p><b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adjournment.</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There being no further business,

the meeting adjourned at 4:15 p.m.
