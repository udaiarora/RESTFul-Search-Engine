This work is considered one of the monuments of the English language.
  Even though its medical recommendations have long been superseded by
 modern medicine, it is still a book of interest.  Reprints continued
 into the 20th century, and probably more copies of modern editions have
 been sold than were ever printed of earlier ones.  Gerard was appointed
 superintendent of the gardens of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, who was
 one of the most influential people in the court of Elizabeth I.  Gerard
 also had gardens of his own where he raised many exotic plants from
 foreign lands.  His illustration of the potato was probably the
 first to appear in any herbal; he learned of it from Raleigh and
 Drake, who had been to the New World.  He was raising potatoes
 in his own garden before they became commonly known.  Gerard's
 <i>Herball</i> has been described by some as Dodoens' <i>Herball</i> fashioned
 to appeal to the English.  He used charming turns of phrase, as
 in his description of the dandelion as "a floure. . .thick set
 together, of colour yellow, which is turned into a round downy blowbal
 that is carried away with the wind."  His description of Eye-bright
 states that it "taketh away all hurts from the eyes, comforteth the
 memorie, and cleareth the sight."  Even though there are many errors
 in identification of specimens, Gerard's <i>Herball</i> dominated its time,
 and remains one of the best known and most frequently quoted of English
 herbals.  The woodblocks, which were collected by Tabernaemontanus
 and used in his <i>Eicones</i> in 1590, were acquired by the printer, John
 Norton, who used them to illustrate this first edition of Gerard's
 <i>Herball</i>.  This book was printed in a clear Roman type which made it
 much easier to read than many earlier works printed in black-letter type.
