      <h2>Novak builds student risk management program at ASU </h2>
      <p>Kim Novak could be called a troubleshooter, but her job is much more than that. She&rsquo;s an educator, problem-solver, prognosticator, analyst and counselor.</p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/novak.jpg" width="180" height="257" align="right">As the first assistant director for student risk management in ASU Student Life, Novak helps student organization leaders, members and their advisers deal with the risks involved in their activities. That means helping them identify all the potential and perceived risks, whether physical, emotional, financial, legal or affecting reputation &ndash; and deciding how to limit, eliminate or accept these risks.</p>
      <p>Novak, who joined ASU in July, also works with Student Affairs to teach staff members about managing risk.</p>
      <p>ASU is thought to be the first university in the nation to approach student risk proactively at the division level, without a precipitating critical event.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting to be building a program from the ground up, and to be doing it because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do,&rdquo; Novak says. &ldquo;This is a cultural shift, to train both students and staff in good decision-making at this level. The old school of thought was that institutions don&rsquo;t have a duty to be engaged with student organizations beyond allowing them to exist. But things have changed, and we&rsquo;re moving back to a middle ground. We want to educate and empower students to make intelligent, fair and reasonable choices.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Novak was the coordinator of student judicial services at Texas A&amp;M University, the site of a disastrous student bonfire that collapsed and killed 12 students in 1999. The bonfire had been a school tradition for many years, and though A&amp;M had a good critical response team, there were no student risk management programs in place at that time.</p>
      <p>Novak led the implementation of such a program, following an independent review. A year later she became program coordinator for risk management and organizational development.</p>
      <p>She gained a national reputation from that and has been invited to speak at national conferences and at campuses around the country on topics including critical decision-making strategies, higher education law and policy, and proactive risk management. She also has served as faculty for several nationally sponsored professional institutes.</p>
      <p>Novak was contacted by Nancy Tribbensee, ASU&rsquo;s associate vice president for legal affairs, about creating a program at ASU. Now she is training ASU student groups and advisers to identify and deal with potential problems during their activities. She also plans to conduct workshops for staff members.</p>
      <p>Novak recently helped student organizations and Residence Life create a comprehensive plan for the Tropical Tiki Luau during Sun Devil 101, covering insurance, contract reviews, a contingency plan for weather, health codes for food vendors, safety regulations for setting up the stage and other issues.</p>
      <p>She reminds students of the impact on emotions or reputation that a controversial speaker might have for participants. While she doesn&rsquo;t act as a censor, she asks students about their core values and stresses making good decisions.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Although ASU has many effective programs in place, Kim has already suggested ways to take the campus to the next level,&rdquo; Tribbensee says. &ldquo;She brings great enthusiasm and nationally recognized expertise to student risk management. Her efforts promote successful student events and student affairs initiatives, and she provides excellent resources for students and advisers. She is a real asset to ASU, and I am very excited to have the opportunity to work with her.&rdquo;</p>
