<H2>The OBSERVED= Option  </H2>
<P><A NAME="idxexp0095">&#13;</A>The values of the CONVERT statement OBSERVED= option are as follows:
<P><DL>
<DT>BEGINNING
<DD>indicates that the data are beginning-of-period values.
OBSERVED=BEGINNING is the default.
<BR><BR><DT>MIDDLE
<DD>indicates that the data are period midpoint values.
<BR><BR><DT>ENDING
<DD>indicates that the data represent end-of-period values.
<BR><BR><DT>TOTAL
<DD>indicates that the data values represent period totals for the time interval
corresponding to the observation.
<BR><BR><DT>AVERAGE
<DD>indicates that the data values represent period averages.
<BR><BR><DT>DERIVATIVE
<DD>requests that the output series be the derivatives of the
cubic spline curve fit to the input data by the SPLINE method.
</DL>
<P>If only one value is specified in the OBSERVED= option, 
that value applies to both the input and the output series.
For example, OBSERVED=TOTAL is the same as OBSERVED=(TOTAL,TOTAL),
which indicates both that the input values represent totals over the
time intervals corresponding to the input observations
and that the converted output values also represent period totals.
The value DERIVATIVE can be used only as the second OBSERVED= option value,
and it can be used only when METHOD=SPLINE is specified 
or is the default method.
<P>Since the TOTAL, AVERAGE, MIDDLE, and END cases require that the
width of each input interval be known,
both the FROM= option and an ID statement are normally required if one of these
observation characteristics is specified for any series.
However, if the FROM= option is not specified,
each input interval is assumed to extend from the ID value for the observation 
to the ID value of the next observation,
and the width of the interval for the last observation is assumed to be
the same as the width for the next to last observation.
<P><H3><I>Scale of OBSERVED=AVERAGE Values</I></H3>
The average values are assumed to be expressed in the time units defined by 
the FROM= or TO= option.
That is, the product of the average value for an interval and the width of
the interval is assumed to equal the total value for the interval.
For purposes of interpolation, OBSERVED=AVERAGE values are first converted to
OBSERVED=TOTAL values using this assumption, and then the interpolated
totals are converted back to averages by dividing by the widths of the
output intervals.
For example, 
suppose the options FROM=MONTH, TO=HOUR, and OBSERVED=AVERAGE are specified.
<P>Since FROM=MONTH in this example,
each input value is assumed to represent an average rate
per day such that the product of the value and the number of days
in the month is equal to the total for the month.
The input values are assumed to represent a per-day rate 
because FROM=MONTH implies SAS date ID values that measure time in days,
and therefore the widths of MONTH intervals are measured in days.
If FROM=DTMONTH is used instead, 
the values are assumed to represent a per-second rate,
because the widths of DTMONTH intervals are measured in seconds.
<P>Since TO=HOUR in this example,
the output values are scaled as an average rate per second such
that the product of each output value and the number of seconds in an
hour (3600) is equal to the interpolated hourly total.
A per-second rate is used because TO=HOUR implies SAS datetime ID values
that measure time in seconds, 
and therefore the widths of HOUR intervals are measured in seconds.
<P>Note that the scale assumed for OBSERVED=AVERAGE data is  
important only when converting between AVERAGE and another OBSERVED= option,
or when converting between SAS date and SAS datetime ID values.
When both the input and the output series are AVERAGE values,
and the units for the ID values are not changed,
the scale assumed does not matter.
<P>For example, suppose you are converting a series
gross domestic product (GDP) from quarterly to monthly.
The GDP values are quarterly averages measured at annual rates.
If you want the interpolated monthly values to also 
be measured at annual rates, 
then the option OBSERVED=AVERAGE works fine.
Since there is no change of scale involved in this problem,
it makes no difference that PROC EXPAND assumes 
daily rates instead of annual rates.
<P>However, suppose you want to convert GDP from quarterly to monthly
and also convert from annual rates to monthly rates, so that the
result is total gross domestic product for the month.
Using the option OBSERVED=(AVERAGE,TOTAL) would fail, 
because PROC EXPAND assumes the average is scaled 
to daily, not annual, rates.
<P>One solution is to rescale to quarterly totals
and treat the data as totals.
You could use the options TRANSFORMIN=( / 4 ) OBSERVED=TOTAL.
Alternatively, you could treat the data as averages 
but first convert to daily rates.
In this case you would use the options
TRANSFORMIN=( / 365.25 ) OBSERVED=AVERAGE.
<P><H3><I>Results of the OBSERVED=DERIVATIVE Option</I></H3>
If the first value of the OBSERVED= option is BEGINNING, TOTAL, or AVERAGE,
the result is the derivative of the spline curve evaluated
at first-of-period ID values for the output observation.
For OBSERVED=(MIDDLE,DERIVATIVE), the derivative of the function
is evaluated at output interval midpoints.
For OBSERVED=(END,DERIVATIVE), the derivative is evaluated
at end-of-period ID values.
