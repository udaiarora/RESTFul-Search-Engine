LIST's Newsletter<br>
February, 2003

</center>
<br>
This month LIST is busy as usual, and here are some of the highlights.
<p><br>

<h3>
Games Filter Test on Public Workstations</h3>

In consultation with the Libraries? Administrative Council, LIST has started testing a technique to reduce the use of games on the public workstations during peak hours. The goal is to target the majority of abuse while having minimal impact on our patrons? research.  
<p>
The test is being conducted on the 26 workstations located on the upper concourse of Hayden, and was in place beginning Monday the 17th.  The location selected for this test allows LIST staff to observe the performance of the software, as well as quickly make any required changes.
 <p>
LIST established a basic set of rules that err on the side of allowing access to sites.  The goal is to avoid blocking anything research related, and LIST has conducted considerable testing to see that this does not happen. With this in mind, please report any possible problems to the SOS desk at 5-9093 or using the online problem report at <a href=http://sos.lib.asu.edu>http://sos.lib.asu.edu</a>. This includes situations where a game that should be blocked is being missed by the filter.  
<p><br>

<h3>Electronic Journals List from Serials Solutions</h3>
The January Serials Solutions holdings report is now online at 
<a href=http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/ejournals.htm>http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/ejournals.htm</a>.
<p>

<b>Did you know?</b>
<ul>
<li>
Serials Solutions generates their reports from information supplied by our e-journal vendors and aggregators.  Some vendors report monthly, some quarterly and some semi-annually or less regularly.  So the data is dependent on how often a vendor sends the information to Serials Solutions.</li>
<p>
<li>The e-journals list is replaced every other month with the latest information from Serials Solutions. </li> 
<p>
<li>As changes to subscriptions, cancellations and renewals happen, the Technical Services Serials staff enters the new data in the Serials Solutions Client Center.  These changes take effect within 24 hours.  While this is not reflected in the bi-monthly report, all changes can be accessed through the journal search link on the E Journal pages, which searches the live database at Serials Solutions.  This search always reflects the most current information on e-journals (see search box example below).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Current information on e-journals, product maintenance and updates can also be found on the General Information and Reported Problems Page: <a href=http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/ejh/problems.html>http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/ejh/problems.html</a>.
<p>
Questions and comments concerning e-journals and the e-journals list can be sent to <a href=mailto:ejournalcomments@mainex1.asu.edu>ejournalcomments@mainex1.asu.edu</a>.
