NEW FEATURES

-   More protection : Automatic identification and 
    removal of viruses delivering the next generation
    of best-of-breed anti-virus scanning engines. 
    It offers improved protection against existing, 
    new and potential threats and increases the depth 
    and breadth of the protection we provide.

-   It's faster than before : We've listened to our 
    customers who asked for a faster Engine and it 
    delivers superior performance to current McAfee 
    Anti-Virus products on all supported platforms.

-   Support for many more packed-executable formats 
    in which known malware is often re-packaged 
    for obfuscation purposes.

__________________________________________________________
INSTALLATION

1. Download the appropriate distribution
   package for your UNIX system into a
   temporary directory on your computer.

   The distributions for evaluation or licenced 
   versions, listed according to their operating
   systems, are:

       AIX              vaix510e.tar.Z
       FreeBSD          vbsd510e.tar.Z
       HP-UX            vhpx510e.tar.Z
       Linux	        vlp4510e.tar.Z
       Solaris          vsun510e.tar.Z

       AIX              vaix510l.tar.Z
       FreeBSD          vbsd510l.tar.Z
       HP-UX            vhpx510l.tar.Z
       Linux	        vlp4510l.tar.Z
       Solaris          vsun510l.tar.Z

2. Change to the directory where you downloaded
   your distribution package, then enter this
   command at the command prompt:

      zcat <package name> | tar -xf -

   Here, <package name> is the complete file
   name of the package you downloaded. Do not
   type the angled brackets.

3. Enter this line at the command prompt:

      ./install-uvscan <installation directory>

   Here, <installation directory> is the target
   directory where you want to install the
   software. Do not type the angled brackets
   shown in the example. If you do not specify
   an installation directory, the software is
   installed in /usr/local/uvscan.

   If the target installation directory that
   you specify does not exist, the program asks
   whether you want to create it.

   NOTE:
   To create an installation directory for the
   software, you must have the necessary WRITE
   and EXECUTE permissions.

As the installation continues, the script asks
whether you want to create symbolic links to
the uvscan binary, the shared library and man
pages. We recommend that you create the default
links shown.

4. If you do not create the default links or
   use a standard directory, you will need to
   set an environment variable to the
   installation directory that you specified.
   The environment variables, listed according 
   to their operating systems are:

   AIX                  LIBPATH
   FreeBSD              LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   HP-UX                SHLIB_PATH
   Linux                LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Sun Solaris          LD_LIBRARY_PATH


LIST OF FILES 

The type of files that are installed in the
installation directory differ according to the
distribution you choose.

The following files reside in the installation
directory of each distribution of the
software.

   uninstall-uvscan     Uninstallation file
   uvscan               Executable file
   uvscan_secure        Script, uses --secure option

   clean.dat            Virus definition file
   names.dat            Virus definition file
   scan.dat             Virus definition file

   license.dat          License file
   messages.dat         Messages file

   e5100upg.pdf         Product Guide

   contact.txt          Contact information
   license.txt          License information
   readme.txt           This file
   signlic.txt          Third-party license information
   uvscan.1             On-line help, 'man' pages

The installation adds one of the following
library files to the installation directory, 
according to the distribution that you choose:

   AIX                  libaixfv.a
   FreeBSD              libbsdfv.so.4
   HP-UX                libhpxfv.4
   Linux (Intel)        liblnxfv.so.4
   Sun Solaris          libsunfv.so.4

and one of the following symbolic links to the
library, where this is required:

   AIX                  (not applicable)
   FreeBSD              libbsdfv.so
   HP-UX                libhpxfv.sl
   Linux (Intel)        liblnxfv.so
   Sun Solaris          libsunfv.so


REMOVING THE SOFTWARE 

To remove the software by a script: 

1. Go to the directory where you installed the
   software and type this line at the command
   prompt to start the uninstallation script:

      ./uninstall-uvscan

2. Follow the instructions and respond to any
   prompts shown in the script to remove the
   program files from your computer.

3. Delete the script, uninstall-uvscan. 

   NOTE:
   If you created any symbolic links when you
   installed the software, you must delete
   those yourself to completely remove the
   software from your computer.


To remove the software manually:

1. Go to the directory where you installed the
   software.

2. Use the rm command to remove all the program
   files in that directory.

   If you created any symbolic links when you
   installed the software, you must delete
   those yourself to completely remove the
   software from your computer.

   NOTE:
   To see a list of the program files for each
   UNIX distribution, see "List of Files" earlier 
   in this file. 


__________________________________________________________
KNOWN ISSUES

1. Some mail clients (such as PINE, Eudora,
   Netscape, and Pegasus Mail) use a file
   structure similar to concatenated MIME as
   their mailbox format. Scanning these
   mailboxes with mime detection enabled may
   produce unexpected errors (e.g. scanner
   reports files could not be opened). To avoid
   this, we recommend that either these files
   are excluded from scans, or the --mailbox
   switch is used in conjunction with --mime.

__________________________________________________________
ENGINE END-OF-LIFE (EOL) PROGRAM

Important information from AVERT and the McAfee
Engine Development Team:

   Is your engine up-to-date? - Anti-virus is only
   as good as its last update!

-  Updating your DAT files regularly is essential
   and a MUST!

-  Updating your engine is just as important and a
   MUST.

-  An old engine WILL NOT catch some of today?s
   threats.

-  Sometimes architectural changes to the way that
   the DAT files and virus-scanning engine work
   together make it critical for you to update your
   engine.

AVERT says it makes sense to have as part of your
Security Policy Program, an Engine Update process to
take advantage of the latest technology and stay
protected!


THE PROBLEM

Between 250 and 400 new detections are added to the
DAT files monthly by AVERT. If you are not
up-to-date, you are vulnerable to any one of them
that gets a foothold in the field (also known as "in
the wild").

McAfee AVERT(TM) releases regular DAT files,
ensuring that full protection is added to all McAfee
products. The DAT files contain the information
required to detect and remove threats - what to look
for and where to look for it.

However, today?s threats are evolving almost on a
daily basis. Software providers continue to make
changes to operating systems and applications that
can change the way a program acts or works, and a
virus-scanning program may not understand the
changes.


THE SOLUTION

Taking this into account, McAfee regularly
updates its virus-scanning engine used by ALL McAfee
virus-detection and removal products. The
engine understands all the different structures in
which a virus could lurk - EXE files, Microsoft
Office files, Linux files, and so on. Occasionally
these changes require us to make significant
architectural changes to the engine as well as the
DAT files.

AVERT strongly recommends that users of ALL McAfee
anti-virus products update the engines in the 
products they have deployed as part of a
sound security best-practices program.

To check your engine version, right-click the McAfee
shield in the system tray, select "About" and look
at the "Scan engine" version number. If you need to
update, you should update your scan engine
immediately from our download site.


THE ENGINE END-OF-LIFE PROGRAM

Because of the evolving malicious code threat, users
should update their engines as soon as possible upon
the release of McAfee?s latest scanning technology.

When a new engine is released, the existing engine
will begin its countdown to its end of life, and
will therefore no longer be supported by McAfee.

Information on the McAfee Engine End-of-Life policy 
and a full list of supported engines and products 
can be found at:
