        <p> ItÂ?fs really hard not to make editorial comments when I read these quotes regarding whether or not the University should preserve their electronic records:</p>
        <p> Â?gThey can have them if they want Â?c I donÂ?ft really care Â?c who knows what someone would be interested in in a thousand years.Â?h (exactly the crux of appraisal decisions)</p>
        <p> Â?gEmail including meeting minutes â?? I havenÂ?ft encountered any in my career that would be considered historically significant.Â?h</p>
        <p> Â?gNo, most of mine is just documentation.Â?h</p>
        <p> Â?gÂ?c If I were to leave this job and someone were to replace me, then there would be useful documents for the program, but most of those are on floppy.Â?h (oh, joy â?? maybe 5 Â¼Â?h floppies?)</p>
        <p> Â?gI just donÂ?ft think I have anything that would be interesting or of use outside this department.Â?h (belief that someone in the department is retaining all interesting or useful information forever? No knowledge of University Archives or its function)</p>
