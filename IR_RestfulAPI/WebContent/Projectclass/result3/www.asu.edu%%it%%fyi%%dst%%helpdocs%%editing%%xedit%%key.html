<h3>uni-XEDIT Keyboard Mapping</h3>

<p>The following command is used to create a uni-XEDIT keyboard mapping 
file:

<blockquote><code>
key
</code></blockquote>

<p>You do not need to create a keyboard mapping file, but doing so is 
strongly recommended. The text below describes why and how to create a 
uni-XEDIT keyboard mapping file and when to create more than one 
keyboard mapping file.</p>

<p>uni-XEDIT uses a 3270-type keyboard mapping similar to that used by 
XEDIT on the IBM mainframe computers; however, you are probably not 
using a 3270-type terminal. You are probably not even using a terminal, 
but instead are using a microcomputer (e.g., pc or mac) to emulate a 
vt100 or other terminal. Establishing a customized keyboard mapping will 
simplify use of uni-XEDIT. If you do not customize the keyboard mapping, 
you need to memorize a table of <a href="generic.html">escape-key and 
control-key sequences</a> which correspond to various 3270-type keys 
such as PFx keys, reset key, erase-eof, etc.</p>

<p>If you only use one Unix system and always use the same microcomputer 
and terminal emulator to access the Unix system, you need establish only 
one keyboard mapping file; otherwise, you may need to establish multiple 
keyboard mapping files. Differences in vendor implementations of Unix, 
terminal emulators, terminal types, and other hardware/software 
differences usually preclude a specific keyboard mapping from working in 
all situations.</p>

<p>The first screen to appear after you enter the <code>key</code> 
command provides a short <a href="key01.html">menu of options</a> from 
which you choose "u" to perform "keybind maintenance".</p>

<p>The second screen prompts you to <a href="key02.html">enter a 
filename</a>. The keyboard mapping statements (SET KEYBIND) will be 
saved in the indicated file. If the file already exists, the statements 
will be appended to the existing file; otherwise, a new file is created. 
Environment variables and the tilda cannot be used in the file name.</p>

<p>If you are going to have only one keyboard mapping file, 
".profile.xedit" (without the quotes) is the recommended filename. If 
you are going to have multiple keyboard mappings, (for example, one for 
the stats machines and one for the research machines) you may want to 
use "stats.xedit" for one mapping file and "research.xedit" for the 
other mapping file.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: You MUST enter a valid name at this point. If you enter an 
invalid name, no error message is given until after you have completed 
the keyboard mapping and attempt to save the file.</p>

<p>The third screen contains a <a href="key03.html">menu of 3270 
keys</a> which can be mapped. Use your cursor keys to move the cursor to 
the name of a 3270 key and press enter. You will be prompted to <a 
href="key04.html">press the corresponding key</a> to be mapped to the 
selected 3270 key. IMPORTANT: Press only one key and then wait. (A 
control key sequence is considered only one key.) You will then be 
prompted to <a href="key05.html">type what is printed</a> on the key you 
pressed (for documentation purposes) and then press enter.</p>

<p>For example, if you wanted to define the pc keyboard F8 key to be the 
3270 PF8 key, you would (1) use the cursor keys to move the cursor to 
the PF8 name on the screen and press enter, (2) press the pc F8 key, (3) 
type "F8" as documentation and press enter, and repeat the process. The 
menu of 3270 keys continues to be redisplayed so you can define other 
3270 key mappings. When you have finished mapping all keys, press 
control-X to exit.</p>
