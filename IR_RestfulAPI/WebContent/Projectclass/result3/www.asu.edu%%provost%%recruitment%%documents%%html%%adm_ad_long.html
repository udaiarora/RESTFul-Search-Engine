        of the metropolitan region. This strategy must enhance the College&rsquo;s
        research profile, increase the diversity of the College, maintain and
        strengthen nurse-managed clinics, address the development of the nursing
        programs operated by the College at the East and West campuses, initiate

        at <br>
        the future Downtown campus of ASU, which will be a leading center for
