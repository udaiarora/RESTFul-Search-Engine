<h1 class="storyhead">ASU names Kim dean of Herberger College of Fine Arts</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p><strong><em>Innovator in musical education brings new framework for change to fine arts education</em></strong></p>
<p> Kwang-Wu Kim, an outspoken advocate for the arts and proponent of the need to expand the role of the arts in society and rethink the way that artists are educated, has been named dean of the Herberger College of Fine Arts at ASU, one of the nation's top-ranked fine arts programs.</p>
<p><img src="images/20060404_kim2.jpg" width="185" height="273" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right">&quot;There are two challenges before us. First, there is the challenge of continuing to build traditionally defined excellence throughout the core of the fine arts as we understand them,&rdquo; Kim said. &ldquo;But there is an equally exciting challenge in addressing questions about the future of these art forms, their interactions and their place in the larger world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim has served as president of the Longy School of Music in Cambridge, Massachusetts, since 2001. The Longy School of Music, unlike more traditional conservatories, commits itself to preparing musicians to make a difference in the world. While it offers the same level of rigorous training expected of all major conservatories, it is unique in requiring all students to learn to utilize their talents working with nontraditional audiences and in nontraditional settings. This requirement is designed to connect students with the outside world and to help them learn about themselves and their relationship with society in the process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happen to believe that the arts &mdash; whether we are talking about visual arts, performing arts, music or other forms &mdash; express our basic humanity and that the experience of the arts will always be relevant. However, in many cases artists, in the way they are educated, are increasingly isolated rather than connected to the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim believes that current educational approaches in the fine arts encourage the isolation of artists, as opposed to orienting them to find new ways of sharing their gifts in the world and connecting to people and society. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am concerned because that which gifted young artists have to offer is valuable and necessary, but too often it is not being shared with the world. I tend to think that one of the problems is that something is not right about the educational model,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Kim's rethinking of purpose and models in fine arts education fits the mission of ASU President Michael Crow, whose New American University vision is reshaping the educational landscape at this Phoenix-based comprehensive university.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kwang-Wu Kim is a first rate intellect who will bring tremendous energy and creativity to the already outstanding Herberger College,&rdquo; said ASU President Michael Crow. &ldquo;In addition he is deeply connected to the broader community and will provide leadership to our social engagement objectives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In visits to ASU, Kim was intrigued by what he describes as an enormous sense of possibility. He saw multiple examples of the exploration of diverse solutions to difficult problems within a climate that is supportive of creative thinking and commitment to society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kwang-Wu Kim has the will and ability to take up an idea with passion, reason and exacting critical skills,&rdquo; said Duke Reiter, dean of ASU's College of Design and chair of the search committee responsible for Kim's selection. &ldquo;Kim clearly intends to build upon the substantial foundation that was laid by [current dean] Bob Wills while, at the same time, taking on the complex questions that will impact the future of the arts-performance, audience, digital media, research, community engagement, and, of course, funding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a diverse and talented pool of applicants and believe that Kwang-Wu Kim will be an outstanding leader of this important college,&rdquo; said Milton Glick, ASU executive vice president and provost. &ldquo;Kim is able to clearly articulate the complex issues that will impact the future of the arts. He is committed to traditional arts while, at the same time, understands how the arts must change to serve future generations as well as they have served our predecessors. He has a passion for excellence as well as a passion for opening the arts to much broader segments of society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim's drive for innovation and redesign extends beyond fine arts education. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If the question is about relevance, there has to be discussion about change in the arts that factors in new technologies, new thinking, new understanding of what the world looks like,&rdquo; Kim said. &ldquo;We no longer have the luxury of parochial thinking. We've really got to be thinking: no borders, no boundaries. If you are inclined to traditional thinking about the arts, the challenge is how we, within this traditional framework, rethink education so that what young people are developing can flow into the world. If your focus tends to the non-traditional, the challenge is to define a framework for determining what is valid, what is real. There has to be a fundamental commitment to experimentation and exploration but also an equally fundamental commitment to clear-sighted evaluation. In a climate in which the new is highly valued, you also want to make sure there is critical judgment being applied to the content, so that it's not only about new surfaces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Herberger College is one of the nation's leading centers for the study, practice and development of the arts. The college comprises four academic units &ndash; the schools of art, music, and theatre and film, plus the department of dance. All are among the top programs in their field of study according to various ranking organizations, including <em>U.S. News &amp; World Reports</em>. It also operates the ASU Art Museum and a graduate research program called Arts, Media and Engineering in conjunction with ASU&rsquo;s Fulton School of Engineering. </p>
<p>Kim&rsquo;s prior experience includes artistic and administrative director positions with El Paso Pro-Musica and the El Paso Chamber Music Festival, which he co-founded. He has held teaching positions with the Longy School of Music, the University of Texas at El Paso, the Peabody Institute and Dickinson College. Kim holds a doctor of musical arts degree from the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University and a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in philosophy, magna cum laude, from Yale University.</p>
<p>Kim&rsquo;s other professional activity includes guest faculty and speaking engagements at Stanford University and the Harvard Graduate School of Education, juror and panelist positions with the International Piano Competition for Young Musicians in the Netherlands, the National Association of Schools of Music, and in Boston, at the New England Conservatory, the Boston Conservatory, and the Boston Arts Academy. A student of legendary pianist Leon Fleisher, Kim gave his debut at New York&rsquo;s Metropolitan Museum of Art and was presented at the Marlboro Music Festival by then Artistic Director Rudolf Serkin. Since that time, he has continued to perform around the world as orchestral soloist, recitalist, and chamber musician.</p>
<p>Kim will follow J. Robert Wills, who has served as dean of the Herberger College for the past twelve years. Wills will retire as dean in June 2006.</p>
