				<h1>School-centric Process Extends Choices For Enrollment</h1>
				
				<p class="article">At the request and in collaboration with undergraduate admissions and the registrar,  has developed a new process that supports school-centric enrollment, a goal of the university. The new process became available and was first used in the summer of 2005 for admissions to the Fall 2006 semester.</p>
				<p class="article">The school-centric admissions process takes over the review of requests from new and transfer students for admittance to professional programs. A computer application was created by Administrative Information Systems in <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> to make the program requests part of regular admissions.</p>
				<p class="article">Academic departments that elect to use the school-centric system define their requirements and provide rules to the Undergraduate Admissions Office to implement. Departments can revise the requirements as needed. Optimization of the process has the potential to help departments keep programs competitive, balance the enrollment size, and attract and retain qualified students.</p>
				<p class="article">The new admissions system first decides if a student can be accepted to the university according to Arizona Board of Regents requirements. The system then can assess credentials to determine if a student meets the additional requirements set by an academic department for admission to a professional or pre-professional program. The process also can evaluate an applicant for a degree emphasis within a school.</p>
				<p class="article">A benefit of the process is that students now can select three choices of degree program when completing an application. If not admitted to the first choice, the student is immediately considered for the next choice. If not admitted to a professional program of choice, the student can still enroll in University College.</p>
				<p class="article">To better understand some of the advantages, consider two freshmen entering college about the same time. Student A does not know what degree he wishes to pursue. He can take general studies courses for his first two years, explore options and then declare a major. Student B also has to take general studies requirements. But Student B already knows what career he wants.</p>
				<p class="article">There is no expectation that one of these students will be more successful than the other. However, Student B may be more likely to continue with his degree plan and graduate if he begins at the university in the school where he wishes to study. Resources are available to provide academic and social support for the studentâ??s degree choice, such as moving the student directly to school-specific advising.</p>
				<p class="article">Though the school-centric admissions system has reduced work for the university, and provided more options for applicants, it does have limitations. A computerized process cannot evaluate some admissions criteria used by academic areas. For example, a portfolio review or an audition cannot be quantified for evaluation by the system.</p>
				<p class="article">The school-centric admissions process is available to all academic departments and at present is in use by the W.P. Carey School of Business, the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, and the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communications at <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym>.</p>
