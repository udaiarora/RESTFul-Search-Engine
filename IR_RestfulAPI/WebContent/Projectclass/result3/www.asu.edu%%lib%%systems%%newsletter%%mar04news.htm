              Workstations Now Support USB Thumb Drives</h3>
            <p> The public workstations now support USB &quot;thumb drives.&quot; 
              What makes these small portable devices so useful is that they have 
              much more storage space than a floppy disk. Most floppy disks hold 
              1.44 Megabytes (MB) of information, while thumb drives can hold 
              16 MB or more. The thumb drives have the added advantage of being 
              faster and more reliable than floppies. They also come with handy 
              ways of storing them, such as a built-in clip or attached key ring.</p>
            <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
              <tr>
                <td width="23%"><img src="thumb.jpg" width="200" height="172"></td>
                <td width="77%">The drive plugs into the USB port, which is located on the 
                  front of our black workstations behind the gray panel. On the 
                  older white workstations, the USB ports are located in the back. 
                  Once the drive is plugged in, a dialog box will pop up notifying 
                  that the drive has been found. When the dialog box is finished, 
                  the drive is ready and files can be saved just like a floppy 
                  disk. Typically the drive will show up as &quot;Removable Disk 
                  D:.&quot; Before removing the drive, it is important to make 
                  sure it is properly shut down. This is accomplished by clicking 
                  the &quot;Unplug or Eject Hardware&quot; icon in the lower right 
                  (has a green arrow), and choosing to stop the device. A message 
                  will pop up on the screen saying the device can safely be removed, 
                  and the drive can be unplugged. If this step is not properly 
                  taken, all data on the drive may be lost.</td>

            </table>
            <p>Please note that it is not guaranteed that all drives will work, 
              though testing has not revealed any problems. If you are interested 
              in more information about these drives or their technology, please

            C6-West Classroom Ready For Use</h3>
          <div align="left"> 
            <p>With the completion of the wireless network installation on the 
              concourse levels of Hayden, the C6-West Wireless Classroom has been 
              reopened. Although similar to the equipment in C6, there are few 
              distinct differences in operations of the projector and audio. If 
              you would like a review on the operation of the classroom equipment 
              contact <em><strong>Rob Fidler</strong></em> at <em><strong>5-4922</strong></em> 
              to schedule a meeting in C6-West. As with C41 and C6, the new classroom 
              may be reserved through Library Administration at 5-3417.</p>

            New Public Workstations Being Added To Hayden</h3>
          <div align="left">
            <p>During Spring Break the new computer tables were installed on the 
              Lower Concourse near the Reserve stacks. LIST is in the process 
              of building the new workstations and will soon secure them at the 
              new locations. </p>

            (1470-1900) An ongoing digitization project of the Fundaci&oacute;n 
            Historica Tavera and made available on a 150+ CD-ROM collection. Begun 
            in 1996, this virtual library project aims to include all classic 
            and key works of the history of Spain and Iberoam&eacute;rica in every 
            field of learning. Full collection includes more than 5,000 full-text 
            works originally printed between the 16th and 19th centuries in Spain, 
            Portugal, Latin America, and the Philippines.<br>

          <p align="left"><strong>Q. <em>&quot;What does it mean when LIST staff 
            say they&#8217;re &#8216;building&#8217; a workstation? Can&#8217;t 
            they just take it out of the box and plug it in?&quot;</em></strong></p>
          <div align="left"> 
            <p><strong>A.</strong> New workstations arrive with an operating system 
              (OS) and a variety of software preloaded on them, but these are 
              not library-specific. This is why we have to &quot;build&quot; workstations, 
              by erasing everything already on them, and installing all the essential 
              library programs. On all public workstations, we install our specially-configured 
              Windows 2000 OS, Viruscan 7.0, printer drivers, Adobe 6.0, Quicktime, 
              and local database applications, and set the computer up on the 
              network so it can receive auto-updating patches. The workstation 
              is then ready to use the Library databases and other library tools. 
              The same process is involved in &#8220;rebuilding&#8221; a workstation 
              after it has been infected with a virus or has stopped working properly.
