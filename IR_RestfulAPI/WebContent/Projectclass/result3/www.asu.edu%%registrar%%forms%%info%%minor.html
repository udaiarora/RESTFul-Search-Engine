<b><h3>Instructions for Verification of Minor</h3></b>
</center>
<br>
Academic minors are offered by many colleges and departments at ASU. The 
list of minors is in the  <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/catalogs/">ASU General Catalog</a>.  More 
detailed
information on each minor can be found in this Catalog, in the 
description of the academic program of the unit offering the minor. 
<br>
<br>
A student wishing to pursue a specific minor is strongly encouraged to 
consult an academic advisor in the unit offering the minor.  Some minors 
(for instance, Dance) may be
pursued only with the permission of the department or college.  It is 
each student's responsibility to make sure that she or he is 
satisfactorily completing all
requirements of the minor. 
<br><br>
The Verification of Minor form is used to indicate the minor a student 
is pursuing and to record the courses the student has taken and/or 
will take to complete the
minor.  Consult the advisor in the minor unit to find out when the 
Verification of Minor form should be filled out and submitted, and 
what signatures need to be
obtained on this form before it is submitted.<br><br> 
This form does not apply to teaching minors.  Please see College of 
Education for more information on teaching minors.
