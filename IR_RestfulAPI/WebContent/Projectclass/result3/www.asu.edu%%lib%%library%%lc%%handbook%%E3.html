                  <h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                  <p></P>
                  <P><br>
                  These requirements apply to personnel actions for retention, continuing appointment, and promotion at every level of review and recommendation. In addressing each of the three criteria the academic professional is expected to clearly demonstrate and explain the <strong>nature</strong> of their contributions and the <strong>significance</strong> of each activity or achievement for the benefit of any evaluator or review body. The academic professional should assume that the reviewing bodies will not have any foreknowledge of the activities referenced in the packet. </P>
                  <P><br>
                  The required standard under each criterion for retention, continuing appointment, and promotion is qualitative rather than quantitative. Some of the activities require a higher level of involvement and/or application of professional expertise than others. Because retention and advancement are contingent upon the academic professional's ongoing growth and development, a higher level of achievement is expected at each successive step: A level of performance that satisfies a criterion at one step will not continue to be adequate at the next. </P>
                  <P><br>
                  What constitutes an appropriate balance between the criteria may vary over the course of a single academic professional's career, as well as between academic professionals, both by design and in response to changing circumstances in the Libraries, the University, and the profession. The criteria at each level allow for a considerable measure of individuality in shaping career choices, and no single model is given preference. Reviewers are urged to use discretion, insight, and wisdom in evaluating an academic professional's achievements singly and as a whole.</P>
                  <P><br>
                  A description of the character and level of performance and achievement appropriate at each stage of an academic professional's career will be found in the definitions of ranks found in <A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/lib/library/lc/handbook/D2.html"> <I>Librarians' Handbook</I>, D.2</A>. It is from these definitions that the requirements for retention, continuing appointment, and promotion are derived.</P>
                  <h3><br>
                  JOB PERFORMANCE</h3>
                  <P><br>
                  For all personnel actions, assessment of job performance is provided by the cover letters from the academic professional, the primary evaluator, and any other appropriate documentation. The paramount criterion leading to retention, promotion, and continuing appointment is high professional achievement in carrying out the responsibilities of one's position. Job performance will be judged on elements which may include: consistency of performance, grasp of library methods, command of their areas of specialization, continued growth in their fields, judgment, leadership, originality, ability to work effectively with others, and ability to relate their functions to the more general goals of the Libraries and the University.No advancement can occur when job performance is inadequate. A superior record in Professional Development and Contribution and in Service may not be used to offset a poor record of job performance in the University Libraries. Nevertheless, job performance alone, no matter how superior, without evidence of an appropriate level of accomplishment in Professional Development and Contribution and in Service will not be sufficient to secure retention, continuing appointment, or promotion.</P>
                  <h3><br>
                  PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONTRIBUTION, AND SERVICE</h3>
                  <P><br>
                    The activities presented in the packet in fulfillment of the criteria of Professional Development and Contribution and of Service do not need to be carried on simultaneously. Academic professionals are not expected to participate in every activity, but they are required to meet the standards for the personnel action under consideration in the ones they select. Each activity will be judged by its utility or professional efficacy rather than by its visibility. An academic professional may make a contribution of distinction in Professional Development and Contribution and in Service within the University Libraries as well as in a larger professional context.
