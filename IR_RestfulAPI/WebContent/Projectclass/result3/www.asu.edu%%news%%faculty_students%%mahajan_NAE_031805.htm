          <h2>National Academy of Engineering welcomes Fulton School&rsquo;s Mahajan </h2>
          <p>Subhash Mahajan, professor and chair of ASU&rsquo;s Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering in the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, has been elected to membership in the National Academy of Engineering, one of the most prestigious honors awarded to an engineer.</p>
          <p>An election to the NAE represents an individual&rsquo;s &ldquo;outstanding contributions to engineering research, practice, or education.&rdquo; Mahajan was selected for this honor for advancing &ldquo;understanding of structure-property relationships in semiconductors, magnetic materials and materials for light-wave communication,&rdquo; an area in which he is internationally recognized.</p>
          <p>His work shows how growth and processing affect the introduction of defects in materials &ndash; and, ultimately, the performance of devices employing those materials.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;To be elected to NAE membership is such a positive feeling and a true recognition of lifetime achievement by peers who have made outstanding contributions,&rdquo; Mahajan says. &ldquo;I feel this honor reflects positively on the quality of the academic atmosphere at Arizona State University, and specifically in the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Mahajan&rsquo;s election gives the Fulton School eight NAE members, an impressive accomplishment considering the rapid growth it represents. In one year&rsquo;s time, the Fulton School has increased its faculty NAE membership by five members. This increase was possible because of the investment in engineering education made by Fulton and the subsequent strategic initiatives that arose for the school.</p>
          <p> This year, 74 new members were elected, bringing total NAE membership to 2,195. </p>
          <p>Mahajan&rsquo;s research focuses on developing fundamental knowledge on the integration of dissimilar materials and the development of efficient systems incorporating these principles.</p>
          <p>The research has several potential public applications:</p>
          <p>&bull; Bioterrorism response efforts could be improved through the use of portable devices that allow short-wavelength ultraviolet light to analyze molecules for greater efficiency, effectiveness and safety.</p>
          <p>&bull; Information technology could be improved by the transmission of data through glass fibers using lasers, which would allow for more information transmittal at a cheaper cost.</p>
          <p>&bull; More affordable telephones and compact discs with a higher density storage capability are other possibilities.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I am extremely pleased about Subhash&rsquo;s elevation to the NAE ranks,&rdquo; says Peter Crouch, dean of the Fulton School. &ldquo;I believe his new status is a just reflection of his leadership role in the materials community at large &ndash; not only in his own research, but also his tireless service on behalf of the materials engineering community.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I am also thrilled that we have pursued this goal together since he first arrived at ASU to strengthen the materials programs and his wider leadership of the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering. He brings enhanced respect and maturity to our programs.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Mahajan is serving as coordinating editor of the <em>Acta Materialia Journals,</em> the leading journals in materials science and engineering. He co-edited an 11-volume &ldquo;The Encyclopedia of Materials: Science and Technology,&rdquo; and he has contributed to more than 200 articles in leading journals. He also co-authored a textbook titled &ldquo;Principles of Growth and Processing of Semiconductors.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Mahajan received a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in science from Panjab University in India, where he was ranked first. He also received a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in engineering in metallurgy from the Indian Institute of Science, where he again ranked first. He earned a doctorate in materials science and engineering at the University of California-Berkeley.</p>
