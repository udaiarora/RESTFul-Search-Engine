                      <DD>
                        <P>The academic professionals in all categories are to have annual performance evaluations. Annual performance evaluations, except those for academic professionals with visiting status, follow the same schedule and are conducted at the same time in the spring. The Schedule of Personnel Actions is issued by the Assistant Dean for Personnel. For procedures for academic professionals with visiting status, see the <A HREF="#visiting">last paragraph</A> of this section.</P>
                      <DT>
                        <h3>CONTENT</h3><br>
                      <DD>
                        <P>The Self-Review and Goals Statement is the academic professional's evaluation of work done since the last annual evaluation, combined with a statement of new and continuing goals for the coming review period. The Self-Review is a critical appraisal of the level of success in meeting the goals, including any obstacles which may have prevented progress on or completion of the goals. It should also include any projects or activities which were not anticipated in the prior Goals Statement. This self-evaluation should provide the evaluator(s) with sufficient analysis to measure and evaluate the past year's performance. The Goals Statement should provide information sufficient to enable the evaluator(s) to understand and and support the planned goals. The Goals Statement should also note areas where special support may be needed, e.g., administrative or staff support, equipment, financial resources.</P>

                        <h3>FORMAT</h3><br>
                      <DD>
                        <P>The format follows the three main areas of the Criteria, i.e., job performance, professional activities, and service. Under each area the academic professional should list the goals set for the previous year. This is followed by a narrative discussing the activities toward meeting the goals, or any obstacles which may have prevented it. The narrative can be included under each goal or written after all goals are listed for that area. The second section of the document consists of a statement of goals for the next year using the academic professional's current position in the job performance area.</P>
                      </DL>
                  <h3>THE ACADEMIC PROFESSIONAL:</h3>
                  <OL TYPE=A>
                    <LI>
                      <P>Submits names of appropriate supplementary evaluators, if any, to the primary evaluator, who solicits the evaluations. (See<A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/lib/library/lc/handbook/G1_2.html"> <I>Librarians' Handbook</I>, G.1.2</A>)</P>
                    <br><LI>
                      <P>Writes a self-review, analyzing and evaluating his/her performance and the accomplishment of the stated goals for the past year. This review should not exceed five pages. The self-review is a critical appraisal of the academic professional's level of success in meeting the goals, including any obstacles that may have prevented their completion. The self-review should also describe projects or activities that were not included in the prior goals statement. The document should provide the primary evaluator with sufficient evidence to evaluate the academic professional's performance during the past year. The format of the self-review follows the three Criteria, i.e., job performance, professional development and contribution, and service.</P>
                     <br> <P>Writes a goals statement for the next evaluation year. (See <A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/lib/library/lc/handbook/F2.html"> <I>Librarians' Handbook</I>, F.2</A>) The goals statement follows the same format as the self-review, i.e., job performance, professional development and contribution, and service. Goals must be developed for all three Criteria. The goals statement should provide sufficient information to enable the evaluator to support the planned goals.</P>
                    <br><LI>
                      <P>Submits the self-review, the goals statement, and any relevant accompanying materials to the primary evaluator. In some cases, documentation should also be provided to supplementary evaluators. (See <A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/lib/library/lc/handbook/G1_2.html"> <I>Librarians' Handbook</I>, G.1.2</A>.)</P>
                  </OL>
                  <h3>THE PRIMARY EVALUATOR:</h3>
                  <OL TYPE=A>
                    <br> <LI VALUE=4>
                     <P>Reviews the academic professional's performance, based on his/her current job description, the goals statement from the previous year, and the self-review. If supplementary evaluations have been solicited, these should also be considered. The primary evaluator's comments should be sufficiently detailed to provide the academic professional with a clear idea of the reviewer's perception of the performance. These comments should acknowledge special strengths and achievements and identify areas where improvement is needed. Criticism must be coupled with constructive and concrete suggestions for improvement. Encouragement should be generously dispensed and so should merited praise; either will be more meaningful if tied to specifics rather than conveyed in general terms.</P>
                      <br><P>Reviews and comments on the goals set forth in the new goals statement. These comments will provide the basis for discussion with the academic professional concerning the proposed activities, the way in which they can best be accomplished, and how they contribute to departmental and/or library objectives.</P>
                     <br> <P> Sets the time and place for the annual evaluation conference. The primary evaluator gives the academic professional a copy of the written evaluation, including any supplementary evaluations, at least 24 hours before the annual evaluation conference.</P>
                  </OL>
                  <h3>PRIMARY EVALUATOR AND ACADEMIC PROFESSIONAL:</h3>
                  <OL TYPE=A>
                    <LI VALUE=5>
                      <P>Discuss the evaluation at the annual evaluation conference, and reach agreement on the goals for the coming year. They also review the academic professional's position description at this time and revise it if appropriate.</P>
                      <br>
<P>If the conference results in a need to reassess the situation or if goals have been substantially altered, the primary evaluator prepares a synopsis of the annual evaluation conference. This synopsis must be mutually agreed upon, signed by the primary evaluator and the academic professional, and added to the evaluation packet. The synopsis is required only if either the academic professional or the primary evaluator request that it be done.</P>
                     <br> <P> The academic professional and the primary evaluator sign the <A HREF="/lib/admin/forms.htm#ap">Annual Performance Evaluation Cover Sheet</A> to signify that the evaluation process has been completed.</P>
                      <br><P> The primary evaluator forwards the completed packet to his/her primary evaluator, who sends it to the Assistant Dean for Personnel. </P>
                     <br> <P> An academic professional who disagrees with the outcome of the annual performance evaluation may appeal to the next administrative level. (See <A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd506-08.html">ACD 506-08</A>)</P>

                          <br><P>Academic professionals who have not had a previous annual performance evaluation will follow the same basic procedures as all other academic professionals. The only difference is that there will be no previously set goals to address. The self-review will simply be a review of activities and accomplishments since the date of hire.</P>
                         <br> <p><strong>PROCEDURES FOR ACADEMIC PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE NOT ON CAMPUS</strong></p>
                         <br> <P>Annual performance evaluation of an academic professional who is not on campus at the time of the review will be handled on a case-by-case basis under the direction of the Assistant Dean for Personnel. Arrangements should be made before the academic professional leaves campus. </P>
                         <br> <p><strong>PROCEDURES FOR ACADEMIC PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE HAD AN EVALUATION IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR</strong></p>
                         <br> <P>Academic professionals who have had a previous evaluation in the current fiscal year will use that evaluation as their annual evaluation, and may, in addition, provide a self-review update and revise their goals. The self-review update should not exceed two pages. The evaluations should clearly place each individual's performance at one of the performance levels as required by current university policy.</P>
                         <br> <p><strong>PROCEDURES FOR ACADEMIC PROFESSIONALS WITH YEAR-TO-YEAR APPOINTMENTS</strong></p>
                         <br> <P>Academic professionals with year-to-year appointments who have been given a rank of Assistant, Associate, or Full will follow the standard procedure. Their packets will be forwarded to the primary evaluator's primary evaluator and then to the Dean, who will make the reappointment decision. Their packets will not go to the Review Committee unless applying for promotion.</P>
                   
                        <br><DD><A NAME="visiting"></A>
                            <p><strong>PROCEDURES FOR ACADEMIC PROFESSIONALS WITH VISITING STATUS</strong></p>
                            <br><P>Academic professionals with visiting status will have a performance evaluation if they have been employed for one full year in the same position. Annual evaluations will be conducted on the academic professional's anniversary date rather than during the usual evaluation cycle. The evaluation will consist of a brief narrative by the primary evaluator, who will then meet with the academic professional to discuss the evaluation. The academic professional may add written comments to the evaluation. Both parties should sign the evaluation and forward it to the Assistant Dean for Personnel. Academic professionals with visiting status are not eligible for merit pay adjustments, continuing appointment, or promotion.
