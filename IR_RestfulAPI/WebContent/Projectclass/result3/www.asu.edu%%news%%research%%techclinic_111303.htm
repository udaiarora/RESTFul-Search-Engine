      <h2>New ASU technology venture clinic gives students real world experiences
        in bringing discoveries to market</h2>
      <p>TEMPE, Arizona - A new venture clinic at Arizona State University is
        accelerating its technology commercialization efforts by tapping into
        the energy and expertise of top students, who will gain real world experience
        on the front lines of technology venturing.</p>
      <p>The Technology Venture Clinic will serve as a teaching laboratory but
        will be run as a robust market-focused enterprise driven by commercial
        metrics. </p>
      <p>Some of the university's brightest students, from several disciplines
        -- including law, business, engineering and science -- will be recruited
        to work as members of this technology transfer team, gaining first hand
        knowledge of what works best in bringing new ideas to market. Student
        interest is high, as ASU's College of Law filled its initial prerequisite
        course on technology transfer for students interested in enrolling in
        the clinic. </p>
      <p>The Technology Venture Clinic is housed within Arizona Technology Enterprises
        (AzTE), ASU's technology transfer operation, which was started earlier
        this year as a subsidiary of the ASU Foundation. The clinic will be privately
        funded by the law firm of Rogers &amp; Theobald LLP, Phoenix, and the
        Wasatch Venture Fund, a Salt Lake City based venture capital company.</p>
      <p>The clinic will be sufficiently resourced to handle the many technology
        innovations generated by ASU faculty and will help advance those innovations
        into viable commercial products. </p>
      <p>The clinic will function as an interdisciplinary enterprise, drawing
        students from the College of Law, the W.P. Carey School of Business,
        the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering and the College of Liberal Arts
        and Sciences. </p>
      <p>"Today's university does not operate in a vacuum and neither should
        its students," said ASU President Michael Crow. "We believe that the
        rich experiences ASU students can get by preparing a technology for commercialization,
        working with innovators and helping form fledgling businesses will give
        that student a huge competitive advantage upon graduation. Those are
        the experiences we expect our students to get from the Technology Venture
        Clinic."</p>
      <p>"We're excited to be leveraging the intellectual capital within the
        student body of ASU to accelerate the success of Arizona Technology Enterprises,"
        said AzTE Chief Executive Officer Peter Slate. "It's a tremendous opportunity
        for students to gain valuable business skills that will be used throughout
        their professional careers. </p>
      <p>"It is a situation where everyone benefits," Slate added. "The students
        provide new ideas and perspectives for technology commercialization and
        we provide a learning experience like no other in the field of technology
        venturing. Sponsorship and participation in the clinic by Rogers &amp; Theobald,
        an entrepreneurial law firm, and the Wasatch Venture Fund, a top venture
        capital firm, will truly make this a unique experience for the students." </p>
      <p>Arizona Technology Enterprises will coordinate the clinic under the
        direction of venture capital industry veteran Charlie Lewis, who joins
        the company from Arris Ventures, where he was managing partner. At Arris
        Ventures, Lewis, an ASU alum, focused on Arizona-based early-stage companies
        in the technology sector. </p>
      <p>Activities of the clinic will include identifying portfolios for technology
        venturing, analyzing technology portfolios, developing commercialization
        strategies and business plans, analyzing markets and partners for technology
        venturing, working with faculty to incubate technology venturing ideas
        and participating in intellectual property review processes. </p>
      <p>Students will be nominated by each of the four participating colleges
        and up to 12 students will be selected for each clinic. Students will
        earn class credit for their efforts. </p>
