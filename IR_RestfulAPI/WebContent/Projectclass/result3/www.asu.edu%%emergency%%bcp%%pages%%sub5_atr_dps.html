			<h4>Introduction (current document developed 1995, revised 1998)</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				Public Law 93-288, as amended by Public Law 100-707, "Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief 
				and Emergency Assistance Act," November 23, 1988 - The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief 
				and Emergency Assistance Act, P.L 93-288 as amended, provides an orderly and continuing 
				means of assistance by the federal government to state and local governments in carrying 
				out their responsibilities to alleviate the suffering and damage that result from 
				disasters. The State of Arizona Revised Statutes 26-301 through 26-353 provides for the 
				preplanning and preparation necessary to carry out emergency functions, other than 
				functions which the military forces or federal agencies are primarily responsible to 
				prevent or minimize the loss of life or property caused by disasters of every kind. 
				Procedures to accomplish the above mentioned programs are outlined in the Federal 
				Response Plan, dated April, 1992, as amended, and the State of Arizona Emergency 
				Response and Recovery Plan, dated 1998. Arizona State University (ASU) Emergency Plans 
				and Procedures complement state and federal authorities. 
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				The plans written at each level for the appropriate laws, and this plan written for
				ASU in particular, are designed to address the consequences of any disaster or 
				emergency situation in which there is a need for response assistance at any and 
				all levels of government. This plan is applicable to natural and man-made disasters 
				and other incidents requiring assistance under the aforementioned Acts. 
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">

				This document is the ASU Emergency Operations Plan (BOP) for <i>major</i> disasters that occur 
				on university property. Emergency response to any major disaster will be conducted within 
				the framework of this plan, and any exceptions or changes to the outlined procedures must 
				be approved by the university President or designee before implementation. The plan is 
				designed to effectively coordinate the use of university and community resources in order 
				to protect life and property immediately following a <i>major</i> natural or accidental disaster 
				on the ASU campus. 
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				The plan is divided into two primary sections: <i>Pre-Emergency Planning</i> and <i>During an 
				Emergency Operation</i>. It is placed into operation whenever an emergency affecting the 
				campus cannot be controlled through normal channels. The emergencies addressed in this 
				plan include, but are not limited to: 
			</p>

			
			<ul>
				<li>Aircraft Accident</li>
				<li>Bomb Threat</li>
				<li>Civil Disturbance</li>
				<li>Earthquake</li>
				<li>Evacuation Fire</li>

				<li>Flood</li>
				<li>Hazardous Materials Incident</li>
				<li>Power Outage</li>
				<li>Severe Weather</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="body">
				This EOP does not include procedures <i>for</i> a war-related emergency. War-related 
				emergency procedures <i>for</i> ASU are contained in separate city of Tempe and Maricopa County 
				plans. The plan and procedures describe the basic structures and mechanisms by which 
				resources will be mobilized and activities conducted to augment ASU and other local 
				response efforts. 
			</p>

			
			<p class="body">
				This plan serves as the foundation <i>for</i> the further development of detailed 
				procedures to enable efficient and effective implementation of response activities. 
				Each university unit will develop its own emergency operation procedures which will 
				be added as part of this overall plan as completed. 
			</p>
			
			<h4>Purpose</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				The purpose of the EOP is to: 
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Protect the lives and property of university personnel by establishing functional 
				guidance that provides the procedures necessary for immediate response of ASU agencies 
				and departments to a campus disaster.</li>
				
				<li>Establish a mutual understanding of authority, functions, and responsibility.</li>
				
				<li>Provide step-by-step instructions to university personnel for emergency response.</li>
				
				<li>Provide for the orderly maintenance or restoration of academic and residential 
				programs and services.</li>

				
				<li>Identify the university's role for mutual aid to local, state, and federal 
				agencies.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h4>Responsibility</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				The EOP is under the executive control of the university President (or designee) - the 
				Emergency Policy Executive (EPE) - and is managed and directed by the Director of the 
				ASU Department of Public Safety (DPS) - the Emergency Manager (EM). In the event of a 
				major disaster, the EPE will govern by emergency proclamation and will impose all 
				necessary regulations to limit loss of life and property and preserve the peace and 
				order of the university, which may include but is not limited to: 
			</p>

			
			<ul>
				<li>Imposing curfews in all or portions of the campus. Suspending regular academic 
				activities</li>
				<li>Closing public access to any building, street, or other public area</li>				
				<li>Calling upon regular or auxiliary law enforcement agencies and organizations 
				within or outside of ASU </li>
				<li>Requesting additional mutual aid such as federal assistance or Red Cross, and</li>
				<li>Procuring mitigation funds for designated projects.</li>
			</ul>

			
			<p class="body">
				Any delegation by the university President of the EPE responsibility and control will be 
				done in writing. The original letter of delegation will be maintained by the office 
				receiving the letter. Copies of the letter of delegation will be provided to: Tempe Fire 
				Department, Tempe Police Department, Arizona Board of Regents, ASU Department of Public 
				Safety, and other offices of the university as deemed appropriate. In the event of a 
				major disaster, the EOP will be implemented in one of the following ways. If telephone 
				services are operational: 
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>The EM will activate the EOP and will open the Emergency Operations Center (EOC). 
				(See Section 3, "Emergency Operations Center.")</li>
				<li>ASU DPS Dispatch Center will immediately begin calling the Emergency Policy &amp; 
				Operations Group (EPOG) members and advise them of the nature of the emergency and the 
				location of the designated EOC (if the primary EOC :is not operational). (See Section 
				ii, "Emergency Personnel &amp; Phone Numbers.")</li>

				<li>EPOG members will immediately report to the designated EOC.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p class="body">
				If telephone services are not operational: 
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>EPOG members will go to the primary EOC as soon as they are aware of an imminent 
				disaster or that a major disaster affecting ASU has occurred. If for some reason the 
				primary EOC is unavailable, members should go to the second and then the third designated 
				EOC sites.</li>
				<li>If EPOG members do not respond to the EOC within a reasonable amount of time, ASU DPS 
				officers will be sent either to their offices or homes to inform them of the situation 
				and the EOC location.</li>

				<li>EPOG members will then immediately report to the designated EOC.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h4>Off-Hours Emergencies</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				In the event an emergency occurs before or after regular university hours, or on a holiday 
				or weekend when most departments and offices are closed, the structure of this plan 
				remains the same, however, its implementation may vary depending upon available resources 
				and staffing. Until the time that authorized officials can be notified, the highest 
				ranking individuals who are available at the time of the emergency will assume emergency 
				operations responsibility. These individuals should follow the guidelines of this plan, 
				while simultaneously making an effort to reach EPOG members. 
			</p>

			
			<p class="body">
				The university President (if unavailable, then the next highest ranking individual) will
				 proclaim a campus emergency under the following circumstances and in the following 
				 manner. 
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				An emergency situation is or is likely to become beyond the control of the campus's 
				response agencies, and the efforts of the city, county, or state are required. 
				(A declaration of a campus emergency should not be confused with a declared State of 
				Emergency by the Governor, although they may coincide.) Once an emergency is declared, 
				the university President (or designee) orders activation of this plan. External 
				indications of emergency status can include:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The Governor of Arizona declares a State of Emergency that affects the state of 
				Arizona, and the university President (or designee) transmits this information and orders 
				the appropriate university response.</li>
				<li>A county emergency is declared by the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, and the 
				university President (or designee) transmits this information and orders the appropriate
				university response.</li>

				<li>A city of Tempe emergency is declared by the Mayor or City Council, and the university 
				President (or designee) transmits this information and orders the appropriate university 
				response.</li> 
			</ul>
			
			<p class="body">
				The university President (or designee) should contact the EM and the Public Information 
				Advisor (PIA) to develop a public emergency declaration statement, as well as a plan for 
				its delivery.

			<h4>Scenario Planning - Emergency Tabletop Exercises to test the 
				Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
			</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				Scenario 1
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				Date: September 7, 2002 Time: 6:55 p.m.<br />
				Location: Sun Devil Stadium 
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				In remembrance of Sept. 11, ASU scheduled numerous events revolving around the 
				game to be played on Sept. 7, 2002. 
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">

				The field size American Flag will be displayed and a fly over will be done by jets 
				from Luke AFB
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				At 6:55 p.m., as the jets are doing a fly over, an external fuel tank is dislodged from 
				the right wing of a jet. It falls into the east seats and impacts the Loge above and 
				section 34. There is a large explosion which causes secondary fires. Numerous people on 
				the entire east side are affected by the explosion. Most notably are patrons in the 
				student sections and handicap area's located at the top of each section. Electrical 
				wires are exposed from the loge level and are hanging into the sections below. Debris 
				closes the lower moat blocking patrons and emergency crews from entering or leaving 
				out the bottom of the section. 
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				Scenario 2
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				Date: September 17, 2002
