Departments selling property from its point of use must use the off-site surplus property sealed bid process.  The sale must be made following the off-site bid sales procedures below. <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Property Not Allowable in Sealed Bid Sales</b></font><p>Computers, small mainframes, or any component that has a hard drive or stored data is not sold via the sealed bid process.  Neither is office furniture (e.g., desks, chairs, office-size bookcases in small quantities).  If a department has large amounts (a minimum of 50 desks, chairs, bookcases, etc.) and wants to sell them as one lot, an arrangement for office furniture sales can be made.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Successful Bidder Payment and Property Pick Up</b></font><p>Successful bidders will be given two working days in which to make payment for the property on which they successfully bid and five working days beyond the date they make payment to pick up the property from the sale location.<p>The only acceptable forms of payment on bid sales are cash and cashier&#146;s check.  Credit/debit cards, personal checks, and business checks will not be allowed.<p>All payment is made at the Surplus Property Warehouse.  A receipt will be issued when payment has been made.  This allows the bidder to remove property from the bid sale site.<p>Rebates to departments on bid sales will not follow the same percentage as rebates on those items of property received at the Surplus Property Warehouse.  A 70 percent rebate will be paid on the net sales total (after sales tax) when total sales do not exceed $5,000.  A 75 percent rebate will be paid on the net sales total (after sales tax) when total sales exceed $5,000.<p><img src="pcshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Procedure</b></font><a href="pcs1002-09table.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">D</font></a></center><img src="pcshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p><hr noshade><table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1><tr><th>Responsibility<hr></th><th>Action<hr></th></tr><tr valign=TOP><td>Department selling property</td><td><ol><li>Complete a Property Relocation Authorization (PRA) form and send it to Surplus Property and Recycling.<p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>One PRA may be submitted for many items with an Excel spreadsheet attached stating: item #/lot #, item description, ASU property control #, and minimum bid amount, if applicable (established by the department).</td></tr></table>	<p>	If desired:</li><p><li>Arrange and pay for newspaper advertising.</li></ol></td></tr><tr valign=TOP><td>Surplus Property and Recycling</td><td><ol start=3><li>Send <a href="pcs1002-09a.pdf">letters</a> to prospective customers announcing the sealed bid sale.
