</H1><P>
Discover how you can get the most from your decision support               environment by getting multidimensional views of business data using
multidimensional databases (MDDBs). This title provides SAS/MDDB Server    Software administrators with the key facts they need to set up and
maintain their MDDBs and to provide the most efficient and effective       data resources for users' OLAP requirements.  A detailed description
illustrates the power of using MDDBs, and you are introduced to the        storage, reporting, and performance benefits of SAS/MDDB Server
Software. Also, step-by-step instructions show how to create and update    MDDBs from SAS data sets using a variety of methods. You will also learn
how to use MDDBs most effectively in your enterprise and how MDDB          benefits can be extended to include other SAS Software tools that make
up your site's Data Mining and Data Warehousing business solutions.
