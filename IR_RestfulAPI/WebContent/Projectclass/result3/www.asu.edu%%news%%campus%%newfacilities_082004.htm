      <h2>University breaks ground on two new major facilities</h2>
      <p>The state of Arizona's investment of $185 million in research infrastructure construction at Arizona State University is evident across the university as new grade-A research buildings go up on the Tempe campus, the East campus and in downtown Phoenix. </p>
      <p>A groundbreaking ceremony on August 18 celebrated two of the projects under way - the Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Buildings 1 and 2 (ISTB1 and ISTB2), which are rising on opposite corners of the science quadrant on the Tempe campus. </p>
      <p>During the ceremony, ASU president Michael M. Crow and others thanked the members of the Arizona Legislature who sponsored the Research Infrastructure Bill and helped get it passed. State Representative Gary Pierce (District 19) and State Representative Mark Thompson (District 17) attended the ground </p>
      <p>breaking event, as did Tempe Mayor Hugh Hallman, Tempe Vice Mayor Mark Mitchell and Tempe City Councilman Hut Hutson. <br>
"This is all part of a process for ASU. We now are in the midst of an accelerated evolution to ensure the state of Arizona is ready, as it grows to 7 million people, to have a quality of life at the highest possible level," said Crow. "One way to do that is to have a major research university in metropolitan Phoenix, which ASU is, but it is a fledgling in need of these research buildings to get it to a competitive fighting weight." </p>
      <p>Crow said he approached the state legislature as an investment committee, laying out the need for investment in those things that could not be funded through other sources - homes for research. ASU's promise is a several-fold return on the investment. </p>
      <p>"With this investment from the state we are now able to create an environment that will nurture and grow a broader, more robust and diverse economy," said Crow. </p>
      <p>The two buildings, which will house active research from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, have the word "interdisciplinary" in their names for a very good reason. </p>
      <p>"Interdisciplinary research is where science is heading, and it is very much what we need to be doing now," said David Young, ASU vice president and dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. "These buildings represent the knocking down of barriers between the sciences and the applied sciences and engineering, between theory and application, and between science disciplines themselves." </p>
      <p>Young said ASU's new School of Life Sciences, which will have some of its newest research projects housed in ISTB1, exemplifies efforts to expand and enhance the university's research efforts. </p>
      <p>Peter Crouch, dean of the Fulton School of Engineering, said he sees the buildings as another step forward for ASU as a New American University. </p>
      <p>"This is a very dynamic place, and we are now at the center of where science and engineering are coming together so ASU, the state of Arizona, and the entire nation will prosper," said Crouch. </p>
      <p>Crouch characterized the Fulton research areas that will be housed in the buildings under two themes - Neural Engineering, which applies engineering methods to fundamental bioscience research to understand and respond to neuro-degenerative diseases, prevention and rehabilitation; and Environmental Engineering, which addresses the critical need for sustainable environments, particularly focused around air quality, water quality and sustainability. </p>
      <p>Jonathan Fink, vice president for Research and Economic Affairs, said the history of the construction of the two buildings goes as far back as seven years ago, when a study was done to determine the extent of ASU's research infrastructure capacity deficit. </p>
      <p>"At the time, we laid out what ASU needed for faculty to go in new directions, knowing there was a lack of funding to get it done," Fink said. "Two years ago, Michael Crow showed up and said, 'Tell me what you need in order to advance, and I will help you get there.' He is the real architect and designer of all we are celebrating today and have to look forward to in the future." </p>
      <p>The two buildings recognized in the groundbreaking ceremony are: <br>
. Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building 1 (128,000 sq. ft.)&nbsp; - Preliminary construction and infrastructure work is underway on the facility scheduled for completion in January 2006. Located north of the ASU Bookstore, the facility will include state of the art laboratory space and graduate education space. </p>
      <p>. Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building 2 (60,000 sq. ft.) - Construction is beginning on the facility located between the Goldwater Research Center and McAllister Avenue. The high-bay research facility will house laboratories, offices and support functions and is scheduled to be complete in August 2005. </p>
