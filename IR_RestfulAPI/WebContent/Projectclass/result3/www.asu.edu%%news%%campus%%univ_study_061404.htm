      <h2>Regents OK study of university system </h2>
      <p>The Arizona Board of Regents voted to examine Arizona's university system in order to meet the anticipated growth in student enrollment, during a study session held June 3, at ASU. </p>
      <p>At the start of the meeting, Governor Janet Napolitano offered three fundamental issues that should be considered with the redesign - access and affordability; quality "of world-class nature;" and fit with community, "It (the university system) must interact with different regions of the state." </p>
      <p>"Think long-term about what the system should look like as Arizona continues to grow," Gov. Napolitano said. "We are serving the ball to the net. I would encourage us to listen to the model and other suggestions as well. Every Arizonan is a stakeholder in the system." </p>
      <p>The proposed operating model would involve the creation of two new free-standing "regional universities" that would help Northern Arizona University, Arizona State University and the University of Arizona to better serve Arizona. As their core mission, the regional universities would consist of Northern Arizona University, Central Arizona University (currently ASU West Campus) and Southern Arizona University (currently University of Ari zona South and Northern Arizona University-Yuma). These universities would center their attention on specific areas of the state and concentrate on undergraduate and masters-level education. </p>
      <p>David Longanecker, executive director of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, presented the background information regarding the projected university enrollment demand in Arizona, perspectives on how other states are structured to meet their demand for higher education and how Arizona is positioned to meet projected demand. </p>
      <p>Arizona's three university presidents said they support the concept of the redesign proposal and expressed how it would affect their universities' growth and development. </p>
      <p>"ASU is a university that has a complex mission," said ASU President Michael Crow. "We need to stay focused on building the greatest public university system, and I believe we can do that." </p>
      <p>"It's an inevitable next step," said UA President Peter Likens. "As we have embraced differentiation with other universities, we have all grown and the future is in need of a change." </p>
      <p>NAU President John Haeger said the university is important to the economic growth of Flagstaff and needs to seek out other funding options in order to continue serving its surrounding <br>
  community. </p>
      <p>"We are one of the prime economic developers of that community," he said. "The current system assumes that undergraduate education is cheaper to offer, but that's not the case. We need a change." </p>
      <p>Members of the public also voiced their opinion on the redesign. Most of the comments supported the efforts to examine the current university system and some offered additional proposals and ideas on how to improve the state's university system. </p>
      <p>The ABOR members said they welcome any additional proposals to redesign Arizona's university system. All proposals must be submitted to the Regents' Central Office, 2020 N. Central Ave., Suite 230, Phoenix, AZ 85004-4593, by July 1. </p>
      <p>ABOR President-elect Gary Stuart appointed current ABOR President Chris Herstam to oversee the redesign study. Longanecker, who assisted the board with developing the Changing Directions initiative in 2002, will continue to serve as a consultant with the new study. </p>
      <p>The next Arizona Board of Regents meeting is scheduled June 24-25, at NAU. For information about ABOR, visit (http://www.abor.asu.edu/). </p>
