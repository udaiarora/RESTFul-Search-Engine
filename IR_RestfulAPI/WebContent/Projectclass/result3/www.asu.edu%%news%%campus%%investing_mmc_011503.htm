      <p>Message from the President <br>
        January 15, 2003</p>
      <h2>Investing in people and programs necessary even in tough times </h2>
      <p>When I joined Arizona State University as president last summer, I knew 
        it was a great university with immense potential to be even greater. Something 
        I didn't know, but that I learned very quickly, is that ASU is beloved.</p>
      <p>ASU has made remarkable progress during the past decade. Many talented 
        individuals have contributed to that success. My predecessors have laid 
        a great foundation from which we can launch a new era.</p>
      <p>At my inauguration November 8, I outlined a vision for ASU that, hopefully, 
        will be embraced by the internal ASU community, as well as by our external 
        supporters who recognize that a strong, high quality research institution 
        is imperative to the Valley's economic future. Also imperative is our 
        strong commitment to ensure all of our students receive the high quality 
        education they expect and deserve.</p>
      <p>The looming state fiscal crisis certainly puts added stress on our momentum, 
        but we can't stand still under any circumstance. We are obligated to take 
        our fair share of cuts while trying to protect, to the extent possible, 
        our core academic mission. We have made selective budget reductions targeted 
        primarily at the margins of the University. At the same time - and perhaps 
        this is difficult to comprehend during a time of tight budgetary constraints 
        - we have continued to make strategic investments: investments in people 
        and investments in programs. This is part of our effort to move from an 
        agency model to an enterprise model - something we must do, given the 
        fiscal stress and reduced contribution from our principle investor - the 
        state of Arizona.</p>
      <p>Make no mistake, I am painfully aware that the impact of the cuts we've 
        made has landed squarely on the shoulders of faculty, staff, and administrators, 
        who are being asked to do more with less. We have committed to address, 
        within these fiscal constraints, the salaries of our most critical faculty 
        and administrators, and to provide some relief to our lowest paid staff. 
        Still, this doesn't solve the larger problem of underpaid productive faculty 
        and staff that has plagued ASU for the past decade. More than $15 million 
        of internal resources were reallocated during Fiscal Year 95 through Fiscal 
        Year 2001 into faculty and staff pay raises to address market issues and 
        general salary needs. This investment has not closed the market gap, but, 
        until recently, kept us from falling further behind our peers.</p>
      <p>It is during times like this that a university is most vulnerable to 
        raids from other institutions targeting our best and brightest. We cannot 
        let this happen. It is far more expensive to respond to external offers 
        for our most competitive faculty and staff than to address issues preemptively. 
        To that end, we will have addressed the salaries of more than 100 faculty. 
        We also are aggressively competing in national markets to recruit more 
        top faculty to ASU. In some cases, we are using resources from the Capital 
        Campaign, such as endowed chairs and professorships, to reward, retain, 
        and recruit the most competitive faculty.</p>
      <p>As part of a comprehensive reorganization of my administration in July, 
        some positions were eliminated and some were newly created or greatly 
        enhanced, while the total operating budget for executive compensation 
        remained the same. As part of this effort, the salaries of some key administrators 
        were adjusted following a national salary survey of comparable positions. 
        The result is that the total cost for the executive leadership of the 
        University remains constant over a two-year period. Some media accounts 
        of this reorganization and the associated salary increases give the impression 
        we are somehow moving large amounts of the University's budget into executive 
        salaries to the detriment of core academic teaching or research programs. 
        This simply is not true. </p>
      <p>We must find ways to move ASU into as competitive a position as possible. 
        This will happen if we make strategic investments in selected programs, 
        but only if we have the best leadership and the strongest faculty and 
        staff possible.</p>
      <p>With the help of Proposition 301 revenue and other funds, we are making 
        key investments even while we make difficult budget reductions and reallocations. 
        Some of the selective investments include:</p>
      <p>$30 million of Prop 301 funds invested during FY02 and FY03 into economic 
        drivers such as biosciences, bioengineering, information science, materials 
        science, manufacturing, technology transfer and workforce development. 
      </p>
      <p>More than $8 million from indirect costs and other state and local funds 
        invested or to be invested during FY02 and FY03 in strategic initiatives 
        such as, religion and conflict resolution, K-12 teacher preparation and 
        improvement, creative writing, and a new school of life sciences.</p>
      <p>Other states are investing in their research capacity to position themselves 
        competitively to leverage research dollars into high value jobs. It is 
        imperative that Arizona is positioned to do the same.</p>
      <p>As president of ASU, I accept that many of my decisions will be questioned 
        and challenged and I will enjoy meeting the challenges. In addition, I 
        am committed to joining with the faculty and staff in the pursuit of excellence 
        for ASU and the state of Arizona. </p>
