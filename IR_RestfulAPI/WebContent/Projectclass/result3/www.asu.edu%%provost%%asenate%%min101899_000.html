<p><b>1</b>. <b>Call to Order.</b>

<p>The meeting was called to order by Senate President David Burstein,

at 3:20 p.m.

<p><b>2. Approval of Previous Minutes. (September 13, 1999).</b>

<p>The minutes of September 13, 1999, were approved with editorial correction:

Senator Fafitis' name was misspelled under attendance.

<p><b>3. Announcements and Communications.</b>

<p><b>3.A. Senate President's Report </b>(David Burstein)<b>.</b>

<p>Last week the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that colleges' and universities'

governance grievance proceedings do not give people due process. As we

are meeting, so are the universities' legal counsels to decide how that

ruling will affect our governance grievance procedures in the ACD Manual.

Right now, we do not have a complete answer.

<p>There is a name you will all get used to over the coming months, it

is the "Arizona Regents University." This is an idea that Lattie Coor presented

to the Regents at their last meeting. It would be wise in Dr. Coor's way

of thinking to form an umbrella organization, e.g., an Arizona Regents

University, and adjudicate distance learning issues among the three universities.

Many people in the state have the idea that there are certain disciplines

in which the need for degrees is unmet. By having those degrees delivered

through distance learning, we can award them. Dr. Coor put this idea forward,

and six members of the committee appointed to consider the concept considered

it along with a wide range of options. The concept is being considered

and I would ask you to take this idea back to your departments and discuss

it thoroughly. If anyone has additional ideas, please email them to me

as quickly as possible and I will forward them on. All ideas should be

on the table right now. This same process is going on at NAU and UofA.

However, it has to be one voice from the university system in the end.

<p>A committee has been appointed to consider streamlining issues that

do not pertain to General Studies, the University Requirements Review Committee

(URRC). We have had our first meeting and afterwards we will want to communicate

with many of the departments and schools within the university. What I

hope you will take back to your departments is that we in the committee

do not want to be viewed as policemen, but as friends who will work with

you for the better understanding of the students. This will be a process

that we hope will make our university more transparent to the students.

Right now, it is not.

<p>Two committees are in the process of being formed to look into matters

concerning 1) The status of lecturers on campus; how we currently treat

them and how we may treat them in the future and how they interact with

the faculty as a whole. 2) The status of promotion and tenure; what we

say about promotion and tenure from the university's end, in light of the

revisions of the post-tenure review guidelines.

<p>On class scheduling, the email address that you can address your problems

with room scheduling to is (david.techau@asu.edu) or (rooms@asu.edu). He

reports to Vice Provost Mernoy Harrison. What you should be aware of is

that the spring semester was scheduled with the same program that the fall

semester was scheduled with. I urge everyone to check out the schedule

that you now have for the spring semester, and if there are problems get

in touch with David Techau immediately. We will try to work with Mernoy

and David to get a better set up for class scheduling. If I had my druthers,

I would have the program give priority to what the classroom is used for

first and then the number of seats considered.

<p>Legislative coffees began last week. We have had a good turnout. Tomorrow

night (Tuesday, October 19) they continue. Many of you have given your

names and addresses to Bill Davey. You should be receiving an email well

in advance of the coffee in your district. If you have any questions, please

email the past Senate President (william.davey@asu.edu). He is in charge

of our legislative networking effort.

<p>One of the tasks put forward to the Arizona Faculties Council this year

by the Arizona Board of Regents is to define "learner-centered." The AFC

has wordsmithed a document; the Regents' office has also wordsmithed a

document and the Chief Academic Officers have also produced a document.

Tomorrow there will be a conference call to see if we can all agree on

our definition. If you looked at the <i>AZ Republic</i> today, you read

an article by Beverly Medlin highlighting issues pertaining to "learner-centered"

education. What I was struck with in her article was how many of those

things are we doing already on this campus.

<p>Doug Johnson could not be with us today because he is representing the

faculty; in fact all of the faculties at the three universities, on one

of the Governor's task force work committees. The Task Force on Higher

Education itself has 16 appointed members, including the three presidents

of the universities. Faculty and students are not on this group. Faculty

and students have input to this Task Force through its working committees.

The Board of Regents has requested us to appoint at least one faculty member

to each of its working committees, more than one on some.

<p>Senator Landers: Could you elaborate on the supreme court decision as

to what they do not like about our due process?

<p>Senate President Burstein: They did not like that our lawyers were restricted

to just an advising role.

<p>Senator Goggin: Who will chair the committee that deals with the status

of lecturers?

<p>Vice Provost Harris: We are working on the charge right now. The committee

has not yet been set up.

<p><b>3.B Provost's Report </b>(Milton Glick).

<p>I told you last time that I wanted to explore some topics in depth this

semester at your meetings. I asked you all to send in issues. Senator Landers

sent two items to me: an update on the BIS degree and the other is an update

on changes in the commencement guidelines.

<p>I have received many questions about the BIS degree and there has been

a lot of misunderstanding on this. There are all kinds of numbers floating

around. We appointed a committee in 1993, chaired by Professor Ron Alvarado,

which was composed of mostly faculty. Ron was a faculty member from Zoology

and chaired Zoology at one time. This committee recommended that we establish

a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies. They recommended a two-fold agenda.

There had been a growing interest from the students on being able to put

together two or more disciplines without greatly expanding the length of

their degree. That was especially true in our adult population. Secondly,

there was a concern with the professional schools, having set minimum gradepoints

for entrance, displaced some students who wanted a degree in business and

were floating in the system because they had a gradepoint average of 2.5-2.8.

They were qualified to be at the university and they were being forced

into majors they did not want. It was a combination of trying to provide

for these displaced students and trying to provide increased access to

interdisciplinary degrees. The Strategic Planning and Budget Committee

recommended later that we establish this program. The other universities

already have it; UofA and NAU have very large programs of this type. We

brought this plan to CAPC (Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee)

who recommended it February 13, 1995. The Academic Senate approved it unanimously.

I have had questions from you about whether faculty had input to this degree,

and my answer is, yes, at every point the faculty were in the leadership

role. President Coor approved the Senate recommendation of March 20, 1995

and on September 30, 1995, the Regents approved this.

<p>What is the curriculum for the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies?

One of the requirements was to have some substance to the degree. Tom McGovern

at West Campus was instrumental in helping us shape this program. An advisory

committee was appointed after the degree was approved that had membership

from every college in the university. There is still faculty input into

this degree. The degree itself has the same General Studies courses as

our other degrees. The student needs to have two areas of emphasis, which

at least must have as a minimum 18 hours, in each of two areas; each of

those must have 12 hours at the upper division level. There is a minimum

of 40 hours in two emphasis areas, 24 hours of which must be upper division.

In addition, to make sure that something binds this program together, there

are four upper division core BIS courses that the student must take. That

makes between a total of 52-63 hours in the BIS "co-concentration." Every

concentration must be approved by the faculty of that discipline; e.g.,

the Chemistry concentration is approved by the Chemistry faculty. Finally,

there are electives. The nature of the BIS degree is roughly the same as

for our baccalaureate degree.

<p>One of the questions is: what are the enrollment trends? Before signing

up for the BIS, a student must have taken two courses in each concentration.

That is a "pre-BIS" requirement. Students were first allowed to sign up

for that degree in the spring of 1997, and as you can see from my overheads

it has grown and appears to be steady state now. In fall 1998 we had a

total of 514 pre-BIS students, in the spring of 1999, 542 pre-BIS students

enrolled, and now pre-BIS enrollment has dropped back to 448. We believe

the major is probably now in a steady state environment (1,200 students

divided between pre-BIS and BIS). If you look at what was the declared

major of the students (in spring of 1999) before moving into the BIS degree

program (85 were Pre-Business, 46 were no preference, 24 were Communication,

10 were Broadcasting and the rest are scattered all over the map). If we

ask what happens to the no-preference ones, if we go back before the BIS

existed, and look at the no-preference students, we find that out of 3,600

students, approximately 1/3 remained no-preference one year later. Another

1/3 of them declared a major other than the BIS because it did not exist

at that time. Roughly, another 1/3 left the university. If we look at what

happened after the implementation of the BIS, 1/3 of the students continued

as no-preference, 1/3 still declared a major other than the BIS and a little

less than 1/3 stayed at the university and then appear to have moved into

the BIS degree. This is a big shift. It does not seem to take many majors

away from traditional disciplines, but rather the first cut takes the students

who would have left the university and moves them into the BIS program.

If we look at what are the top ten academic concentrations, remember it

takes two 18-hour concentrations, each of which must be taken 12 or more

hours at the upper division. I believe this is a well done proposal with

safeguards for the quality of the program, and that it has maintained its

integrity thus far. The biggest concentration is business, not surprising,

next is communication, sociology and justice studies, then history and

on down from there. If we ask how concentrations go together, what we find

is the largest is Business and Communication. Those were the two most popular

intended majors but secondly when we talked to the community, their highest

demand other than for technical people, is with business background and

communication background. We hear this again and again. After that combination

no more are dominating. If you ask who is carrying the courseload for the

BIS, or how the SCH hours are distributed, you find them in three places,

Business, the BIS (in the core courses), Liberal Arts and Sciences and

Public Programs. The growth from fall 1998 to fall 1999, roughly doubled

the number of hours, although it seems to have leveled off at this point.

One could argue, how many credit hours since this program has been implemented

might Liberal Arts have been teaching, if not for the BIS? At best, we

can tell Liberal Arts might have had 2,400 more credit hours. To give you

an idea, Liberal Arts' total credit hour production is 240,000 hours. It

could be said that the BIS has probably cost CLAS about 1% of its SCH.

What is the GPA distribution? It is a normal bell curve distribution, which

has a median somewhat below the institutional median at graduation, which

follows since one of the audiences we tried to address is the audience

that could not get into professional programs. You would expect this many

credit hours to be displaced. Nevertheless, it is represented by a normal

bell curve, with a small but significant number of our very brightest students.

I told you at one point the highest score on the GMAT last year, in the

nation, was scored by a BIS student. Finally, the last question that came

up was why is it housed in the Graduate School. It is not. It reports through

the Division of Undergraduate Academic Services (DUAS) to Chuck Bantz in

my office and through the advisory committee has had its course numbering

scheme placed in the Graduate School. Since 1970, the student information

system did not allow us a new place to put it into. Chuck Bantz has reassured

me that by fall of 1999 the BIS will actually have its own code for its

courses.

<p>The last item I want to address is that every program on this campus

goes through a seven-year review. The BIS program will be reviewed at the

appropriate time, when we will have had enough graduates to know what is

working and what is not working. We already know the first generation had

many problems with those core courses because we were inventing them from

scratch. Chuck Bantz can back me up on this, but I understand there has

been considerable progress on refining those courses and who teaches them,

so that they are a much more solid set of courses than when we began. I

have tried to give you the big picture of this degree.

<p>Senator Crawford: This is also the vehicle by which Motorola and Intel

deliver adult education. What kind of an impact will they have on these

numbers?

<p>Provost Glick: They are small numbers so they will not impact heavily.

We have a program which is taught at the request (through extended education)

of Motorola and Intel and it is for an interdisciplinary program between

Communication and Business and has about 44 students. It does not have

a major impact on the numbers but how to deliver that kind of program off

campus and to other such corporate sites, is a serious issue that we have

to deal with. The way we are doing it now is very expensive education,

and we have to find a way to deliver it at less cost if we are going to

continue to serve these communities. I think it is very important to deliver

this program, which is of interest to a number of corporations, in a way

that is high quality but is at best neutral and definitely not a cost center.

<p>Senator Jacob: Are BIS students required to receive academic advisement

from advisors in their programs of study?

<p>Provost Glick: They are. They must have an advisor from the BIS program;

in addition, they must have advisors from both their concentrations.

<p>Senator Jacob: So, if a student tells you they are a BIS major because

a) it is easy and b) they don't have to get the proper advisement, they

would be wrong?

<p>Provost Glick: They would be wrong on the latter, I cannot tell about

you about the former. Students may believe that they do not have to have

advisement. We have some students at ASU who have not seen an adviser in

their entire career, but the rule is that they must have approval for the

two concentrations and advise from the BIS advisors on this degree.

<p>Vice Provost Bantz: Yes that is right. The proposal made that very clear

and in addition to that the units have made a decision about how that is

carried out. The units with many students will have a somewhat different

arrangement than units with a small number of students.

<p>Provost Glick: That is then the decision of the concentration department

as to how that advisement will be delivered.

<p>Senator Jacob: You said it is 12 hours of upper division in the core?

(Yes, in each of the concentrations).

<p>Provost Glick: Eighteen hours altogether in each concentration.

<p>Senator Jacob: Is this a minimum? (Yes.) Could more be required after

the 18?

<p>Provost Glick: The minimum for both is 40 hours in the combined concentrations,

therefore, theoretically, one concentration department could require 22,

if the other concentration only required 18.

<p>Senator Jacob: You said that the departments actually devised and approved

the concentrations. I cannot recall that having happened in my area. Was

it an option for the department to opt out? (Yes.)

<p>Vice Provost Walter Harris: The advisory committee was extraordinarily

conservative initially and said that only concentrations could be approved

minors by the departments. We were then able to say that faculty had designed

the concentration, by designing the minor. In fact, some of our colleagues

in Liberal Arts and Sciences are now relooking at their minors, because

this degree program is showing us that they have created minors without

thinking about a coherent structure to the minor. They said take five upper

division courses without thinking about this.

<p>Provost Glick: That is an important point, in some units a minor is

18 hours, in other units it is about six courses. That is within the power

of the unit as to how much flexibility the unit wishes to give. One of

the important reasons for having advising from the BIS advisors is it would

be better if the two minors fit together well. Chuck Bantz has been working

on this issue (e.g. marrying concentrations so that you get an organizational

degree that gets half of its credits from Business and half of which come

from Communication).

<p>Senator Solis: Is there any perspective on what effect this might have

on interdisciplinary humanities majors?

<p>Provost Glick: Humanities majors are small in number. I think that degree

captures a different set of students altogether. They seem to be thriving

and are not helped or hindered by the BIS.

<p>Let me move on then to the issue of commencement. Walter Harris is here

to any questions you may have. President Coor asked to establish a task

force to look at commencement. The reasons were 1) as he has encouraged

the colleges to have their convocations with a more personal experience.

That has really worked and thrived. The convocations are in many ways more

popular than commencement. While there are presidents who are bothered

by that, President Coor is not. What has happened is that the June commencement

gets smaller every year. The question is how to make this work for us.

2) Often some of the convocations are overlapping final exams, in the present

schedule. There are some students either who cannot come to commencement

or who cannot come to convocation because they have a final exam. That

is problematic. He has asked us to look at how to increase visibility and

attendance at Commencement, while not decreasing the success of the convocations

and how to bring constituents to a comfortable ASU setting. Walter Harris

chaired a committee and David Burstein served on it, which made recommendations

on the structuring of the Commencement experience. They made recommendations

in three categories and I am ready to put my stamp of approval on it if

the Senate does not object. The recommendations concern 1) attendance 2)

program flow and 3) cohesion. Let me just comment that our friend Brian

Foster said, when we last tried to improve commencement, that it is very

dangerous to mess with rituals that work. We do this with some hesitation

then because commencement does work at this university, in spite of its

size. Here are the recommendations:

<p>Attendance. 1) Change the calendar governing the last day of classes

so that no finals occur on the last two days of the term. What that really

means is taking one day out of classes. We took this to the deans and associate

deans and asked them if they wanted to do this (Yes they do). We asked

them if they wanted to a) eliminate Reading Day or b) eliminate one day

of classes. They uniformly said they wanted to keep Reading Day and eliminate

one day of classes. 2) Position the university ceremony so it becomes the

lead event from which all convocations flow. It is the first event, other

than the Honors College, whose ceremony will immediately proceed the commencement

and it is a university event, not unlike commencement. 3) Establish a new

commencement theme, ASU in Review, which will have a large professionally

done video playing during the marching and throughout the event at different

times, so viewing ASU is your last look back. 4) Having a special commencement

speaker. Lattie, as you know, has not encouraged a commencement speaker,

but he will now consider it is we get people who really add intellectual

and social quality to the ceremony.

<p>Program Flow. 1) The movement of the lines for commencement will be

improved by using four lines instead of two. 2) Eliminate the hooding and

individual recognition of Juris Doctorate students. The Dean of the Law

School is comfortable with that idea. Eliminate the hooding of Masters

students, it will be done by the college that confers the degree. 3) We

will videotape judiciously, to enhance the visual effect, using split screens

to project the view of our students as they are coming in. 4) Recognize

graduating student cohorts; this could mean anything, but it was meant

to recognize students with common groupings who may not be in the same

majors or colleges. 5) Eliminate or redirect the routine speakers. The

President has accepted all but ABOR and himself.

<p>Cohesiveness. 1) There will be one written program book, which will

include information for every college convocation plus information on commencement

itself. Rather than having commencement appear to be unrelated to convocations,

these two things will now be considered as a single program. 2) All convocation

and commencement materials, including invitations will mention both events.

We want to encourage parents to attend both ceremonies because they serve

different functions.

<p>Those are the committee's recommendations on Commencement which have

been approved by the Council of Deans and President Coor is ready to embrace

them unless you have strong objections.

<p>Senator Landers: Let me say, the reason I brought this issue up was

that the last time it seemed like faculty were being recruited to attend

a party to which no one cared about attending. That is a little disturbing.

So, I appreciate the work of the committee and its recommendations. I attended

the last Commencement in the parent role, and I heard students saying that

they did not like to go to an event where their names are not announced.

Can we put them on a screen as a part of the videotaping, particularly

when a college is announced? At least their parents can see their names

up there for a quick moment.

<p>Provost Glick: Can you look into that, Dr. Harris? I think we have all

been to commencements that varied from totally impersonal to quite personal.

We should find ways to make the university commencement more personal.

I am always impressed with the number of faculty that turn out for commencement,

and it is discouraging when a college may only have two students show up

at commencement.

<p>Senator Prust: Has any thought been given to reducing the number of

commencements per year?

<p>Provost Glick: I do not think so, but I will ask Walter Harris to answer.

<p>Vice Provost Harris: In fact, we did talk about eliminating the summer

commencement, but it did not carry.

<p>Provost Glick: I promise you all that if I decide to explore one issue

in depth with you at a meeting again soon, I will be briefer than I have

been today. However, I want to say that I appreciate the opportunity to

address issues that you wish to hear about. Keep sending them to me by

email (Glick@asu.edu) because I will use the opportunity afforded under

my announcements to cover your material, just not as much time.

<p><b>3.C ASASU President's Report </b>(Wyatt Smith for Jenny Holsman).

<p>Wednesday night this week (October 20), we will sponsor a Meet the Legislators

Night. The legislators will be on campus and we can meet and greet them.

About 25 people have committed to be there Wednesday night. We are inviting

students, faculty, and staff to attend and support us. Their roles can

be in meeting the lawmakers, making them aware and keeping them accountable.

Meeting them is important because later throughout the year they will be

taking legislative action. Having met them previously, we will contact

them more readily and make our views known. We will be following the actions

and positions taken by our legislators this year, we intend to hold them

accountable. We need the support of faculty and staff to accomplish this

goal. The event will be in the Arizona Ballroom, on Wednesday night, 7:00-9:00

p.m. Senator Peterson will give a few remarks and then Jenny Holsman. A

forum will follow.

<p>One of our goals is to have at least five students at each legislative

coffee. They are distributed evenly throughout the Phoenix area. We are

working on this. You as teachers could mention this to your students in

class.

<p>We are doing the S.A.V.E. (Students are Voting Everywhere) program again

this year. We are in competition with UofA and NAU to register new student

voters. This program is important every year, but presidential elections

in 2000 it will give it even more meaning.

<p>The Intern Program still has spots. About 12 students are now working

under ASASU executive officers, and sitting on the committees. They are

doing meaningful projects and they are enjoying the opportunity to get

involved because some will consider running for positions themselves next

year.

<p>The Insuring Tomorrow program will have a notable keynote speaker. We

are in the planning stages; an advisory committee has been formed among

the student leaders from the various coalitions on campus. The date has

been set for April 1, 2000, in Gammage Auditorium. Suggestions are welcome.

Please send them to me (wyatt.smith@asu.edu).

<p><b>3.D ASUW Senate Report</b> (Jane Carey).

<p>We are moving forward on all the things that I discussed last time so

I will not cover that today.

<p>The first legislative coffee was held in our District 16 and it went

very well. District 19 will be on Wednesday, October 20. This is my district.

We certainly would welcome any of you that can attend coffees on the West

Side.

<p>Aside of our committees beginning to form their work, as yours are,

we are doing something novel. We have a proposal for our November meeting

format, to have a debate. One of our core values is to have the integration

of teaching and scholarship and we may debate that topic. We have people

ready to go and discuss this with the Senate. Our hope is to make the Senate

a more vital place for debate.

<p>We are finding that some of the records we thought we had historically

documented were not readily accessible. We are making sure that institutional

memory is on paper.

<p><b>3.E ASUE Senate Report </b>(Andy Jackson).

<p>Our 21-day official student count is in now and we are up 34%. Our count

is 1,456 students. We have four new programs that are in various stages

of planning and implementation: MA Applied Psychology, a Business Administration

in General Business is beginning, a BA in Education has just been approved

and our own BIS version will begin in the Fall.

<p>We are in the process of revising our constitution, we found we had

a few problems with a succession issue and we are resolving that.

<p>I would like to invite all of you to attend our Homecoming events on

November 12. We are having a barbecue and a dance for Homecoming. Send

an email and I will provide details, or look on the Net for the ASUE site.

<p><b>4. Open Forum.</b>

<p>Senator Jacob: I raise the issue of a constituent, regarding pending

difficulty with the faculty locker room in PE West.

<p>Senator Karady: I can support this issue of the disappearing locker

room; I have received several emails from constituents concerning this

matter.

<p>Senate President Burstein: This issue involves PE West Complex and comes

to us because of the relocation of the Bookstore into the Memorial Union

and the pending expansion of the MU into the area now occupied by the PE

West Building. I will pass your concerns on to Mernoy Harrison if you will

send them to me by email (david.burstein@asu.edu). We are working with

Mernoy's office to resolve this issue.

<p><b>5. Unfinished Business (Motions from Senate Committees for SECOND

Reading).</b> There were no items of unfinished business to consider.

<p><b>6. New Business (Committee Reports and New Motions for FIRST Reading).</b>

<p><b>6.A Executive Committee </b>(David Burstein). No new business.

<p><b>6.B Committee on Committees</b> (Brent Brown).

<p>Senate President Burstein: Brent is not with us today, so I would ask

you to remove the Mini-Preference Survey for Senate Standing Committees

from the agenda packet and fill it out. Either pass it forward or mail

it to the Academic Senate Office, 2202, as soon as possible. We will also

send the form to those senators who are absent today.

<p><b>6.C Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee </b>(Jack Fouquette).

<p>There are two items to report. One is an information item. With your

approval, I will abbreviate for you. On September 29, CAPC approved the

following the establishment of parallel concentrations in the College of

Liberal Arts and Sciences in Spanish Literature and Spanish Cultural Studies

in their Ph.D program. The other item is entitled Senate Motion #1: The

Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval

of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to

disestablish the BS in History (for a copy of this motion w/rationale please

contact the Academic Senate Office, 965-9245vm). This is a first reading

of the motion and the second reading and debate will occur at the November

8, Senate meeting.

<p><b>6.D Personnel Committee</b> (Kathleen McCoy). No new business.
