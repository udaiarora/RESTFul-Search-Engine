        <td width="60%" height="505" valign="top"><div align="left"><font size="4"><strong><font color="#990033">ASU to Offer Tiered Parking Rates, Better Mass Transit</font></strong></font></div>
          <div align="center">
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> TEMPE, Ariz. &ndash; (April 6, 2006) &ndash; With a 5 percent increase in enrollment in the 2005-2006 academic year, Arizona State University&rsquo;s Tempe campus has become the largest single university campus in the country. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Planned development of new high-density condominium towers near University Dr. and Mill Ave. will add to the mounting traffic congestion on and around the Tempe campus.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tempe campus parking is expensive to maintain; however, parking rates are priced below market and significantly below the cost to maintain existing parking facilities, let alone build new facilities.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As ASU advances academically and continues to build additional residence halls and research facilities, the campus will experience a reduction in parking availability rather than an increase.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For these and other reasons, a university-wide task force developed recommendations to address parking and public transit concerns on the Tempe campus. The task force, which consisted of student, staff and faculty representation, evaluated several parking and transportation issues, including the increase in traffic congestion in and around campus, a need for improved public transit services and added convenience for individuals who need to commute to campus. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I am pleased the task force was able to identify opportunities for ASU to address sustainability on all of its campuses,&rdquo; says Carol Campbell, Chief Financial Officer for ASU. &ldquo;This diverse group of talented individuals produced realistic solutions for the university&rsquo;s transportation concerns that will help prepare ASU for the future.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The task force sought external consultation from a top research firm that specializes in transportation initiatives to assist in devising feasible recommendations. The firm helped the task force facilitate various focus groups on campus, review best practices at other institutions and analyze positive impact studies before making recommendations.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Additionally, the task force considered the funding needed to address parking concerns. As a self-funded department at ASU, Parking and Transit Services (PTS) utilizes revenue from parking decal sales to maintain existing facilities, services and operations, as well as build new facilities. Current rates do not provide adequate funds to address existing and projected needs. In its evaluation, the task force compared ASU&rsquo;s parking systems and rates with other PAC-10 universities, peer institutions and privately-owned garages in metropolitan Phoenix. The analysis revealed that ASU&rsquo;s parking rates are significantly lower than comparable universities and private parking garages. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To further illustrate this point, PTS needs increased funding to develop new projects that will alleviate the parking dilemma on the Tempe campus. PTS is contemplating development of parking structures along the light rail route in Tempe and near the University Services Building (USB), which would cost approximately $14,000 per parking space to build. Increasing the frequency of shuttle service between Tempe, Polytechnic and West campuses would cost an additional $1 million per year. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, the task force concluded parking rates must be increased to meet the needs of this growing campus and provide improved public transit services. Moving forward, parking rates will be designed to balance convenience and demand with price. Parking decals will be structured on a tiered pricing scale, with the highest rates applied to the most convenient parking spaces on campus. Low cost options are available, including Lot 59E and a future remote parking site. New parking decal rates for the 2006-2007 academic year will range from $150 to $540 at the Tempe campus. To view a breakdown of the Tempe campus parking rates by location, visit www.asu.edu/pts. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For those who need to park at one or more of the ASU campuses on a regular basis, reciprocity between the Tempe, Polytechnic, West and Downtown Phoenix campuses will be provided in designated parking lots that meet the lowest parking decal rate. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the next few years, revenue generated from parking decal sales will be reinvested to enhance integration with mass transit and improvements in existing parking areas. Through collaborative efforts with Department of Public Safety (DPS) and other ASU departments, existing parking facilities will receive upgrades such as better lighting, brightened parking structures and improved security technology and services. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While an estimated 35,000 vehicles travel to the Tempe campus daily, only 19,600 parking spaces accommodate this traffic volume, and university expansion plans call for a 25 percent reduction of parking availability over the next five years. Therefore, the task force recognized the need to establish long term solutions to ultimately decrease the community&rsquo;s reliance on vehicles. The task force recommended creating sustainable programs that promote alternative means of transportation, including carpooling and increased mass transit participation. The following new programs and service enhancements have been approved for implementation: </font></p>

            </ul>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ASU is a diverse community with various needs, and the task force developed recommendations that also address concerns of commuters and students living in residence halls. For those who need to commute to campus by vehicle, the task force provided recommendations for reducing the travel time from the parking area to an individual&rsquo;s final destination on campus. These recommendations, listed below, also benefit students who live on campus and rely on the FLASH service for travel on and around campus. </font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;As ASU continues to flourish with its student body and academic capabilities, we must create sustainable programs for university operations to maintain a high level of functionality. This includes finding solutions for transportation and parking that not only accommodates our current needs, but also will address any future concerns,&rdquo; says Campbell. </font></p>
