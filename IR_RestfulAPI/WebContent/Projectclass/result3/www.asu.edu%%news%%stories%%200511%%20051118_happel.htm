<h1 class="storyhead">Happel captivates students with passion for economics</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p> The same characteristics that make economics professor Stephen Happel a hot commodity on the speaker circuit &ndash; sharp intelligence, quick wit, a powerful speaking style &ndash; are the ones that mesmerize his students and help them understand economics. </p>
<p> Yet he&rsquo;s never too busy to talk to a student outside of class or help with a project, they say. His passion for his subject extends to his students. </p>
<p> Happel has been named the ASU Featured Faculty for November, for cultivating his students&rsquo; development inside and outside of the classroom. More than 65 faculty members have been nominated by their students. </p>
<p> The award program was started two years ago by Co-Curricular Programs and Activities to recognize and celebrate the contributions of faculty in enhancing student learning outside of class. Three faculty members will be chosen by a panel of students each semester, and each will receive an honorarium. </p>
<p> &ldquo;Dr. Happel captivates the classroom and really takes the time to use teaching methods that work well with college students,&rdquo; says Lindsey Mayfield, an ASU senior who nominated him. &ldquo;He uses his passion for economics to get students excited about school. </p>
<p> &ldquo;He is constantly invited to be a keynote speaker at all different types of events, but he is always available to his students. Even during a semester when I was no longer his student, he still made time for me to come into his office to help with a project I was doing for a class.&rdquo; </p>
<p> Mayfield remembers that when the presidential debate was going to be held at ASU last fall, Happel explained to the large class she was in what issues would be covered. He carefully explained every topic and every point that would be made by both candidates. </p>
<p> &ldquo;When he was done, he asked the class if there were any questions, comments or objections,&rdquo; Mayfield says. &ldquo;In a class of 300 people and a topic as touchy as politics, not one person in the room was offended. Dr. Happel had the ability to simply teach us about politics without his political views skewing the presentation. I think there are very few people who could pull off what he did that day.&rdquo; </p>
<p> Happel has been teaching at ASU for 30 years and is a former associate dean, continuing to teach large undergraduate classes and a graduate class in managerial economics for the evening MBA program. </p>
<p> He has received many teaching awards, including the Distinguished Teacher honor from the ASU alumni chapter and the Professor of the Year for Arizona from the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education. He often is quoted in the <em> Wall Street Journal</em> and other news outlets, and he serves as a consultant to state government agencies and private firms on population issues. </p>
<p> &ldquo;What I enjoy most about being an ASU faculty member is working with extremely bright and motivated students who love to learn the truths of modern economic thought and then apply them to their day-to-day lives,&rdquo; Happel says. &ldquo;I also enjoy interacting with wonderful colleagues in the Economics Department who help me become a better, more insightful scholar.&rdquo; </p>
