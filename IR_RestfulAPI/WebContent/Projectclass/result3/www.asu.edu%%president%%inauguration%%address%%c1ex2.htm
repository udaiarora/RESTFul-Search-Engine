In a metropolitan region with a         population that exceeds three million, a population, moreover, that includes         a significant number of aging adults and families with inadequate medical         care, quality health care is a major social issue. There has been periodic         discussion of developing a medical school at ASU, but the University of         Arizona already has an excellent emerging medical school. At this point         I believe it would be redundant, and a duplication of resources, for ASU         to launch a second medical school. </font></p>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To address         the significant local need for enhanced biomedical research and service,         Arizona State University, in partnership with the University of Arizona,         will develop complementary interdisciplinary research programs in what         will be the major growth industries of the 21st century&#8212;biotechnology         and the biosciences. We are already moving forward with the Arizona Biomedical         Collaborative, an initiative that will prove groundbreaking in its scope,         and will complement the academic programs and health care services of         the medical school of the University of Arizona, and the scientific research         taking place at the University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University.<br>        </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font> </p>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></p></td>    <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   </font> </p></body></html>
