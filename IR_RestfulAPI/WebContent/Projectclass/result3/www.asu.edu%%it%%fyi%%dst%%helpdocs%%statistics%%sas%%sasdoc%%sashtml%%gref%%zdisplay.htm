 If you want to see your graphics output immediately or
preview it before generating a hardcopy, you can send it to your monitor or
terminal. </A>
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are using a terminal or PC that
emulates a terminal, it must be a graphics terminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<P>In most environments, SAS/GRAPH automatically
displays graphics output in the GRAPH window.  If your environment does not
support the GRAPH window, SAS/GRAPH displays
your graphs with the direct display method. See  <A href="#z-direct">Displaying Graphs with Direct Display</A>.
<P>You can suppress the display of
graphics output with
the NODISPLAY graphics option.  Suppressing a display is useful when you want
to create only a catalog entry.

<P><A name="z0748051">&#13;
 The <B>GRAPH window</B>, which is available in the SAS
windowing environment, displays catalog entries of type GRSEG.  You can use
this window to view either the graphics output that you are currently generating
or graphics output that has been stored in a catalog.  You can scroll backward
and forward through the catalog entries.</A>
<P>Some devices allow you to use up to four graph windows:
GRAPH1, GRAPH2, GRAPH3, and GRAPH4. By default, the GRAPH1 window displays
the graphs in the default catalog, WORK.GSEG, or the catalog that you specified
with the GOUT= option.
<P>The GRAPH window acts like other SAS windows:  you can
resize it and move it, and you can submit global SAS window commands from
it.  For details on sizing windows, see the SAS documentation for your operating
environment.  For a description of SAS window commands, see <B>SAS Language:
Reference</B>.
<P>GRAPH window commands control how the graphs appear
in the window. For a description of these commands, refer to the SAS Help
facility for the GRAPH window.
<BR><H3>Opening and Closing the GRAPH Window</H3>


<P><A name="z0748055">&#13; 
The GRAPH Window opens automatically when you submit a procedure that produces
graphics output, or when you select a catalog entry from the PROC GREPLAY
window or from the SAS Explorer window.  You can also open the GRAPH window
with the GRAPH<B>n</B> command. The GRAPH<B>n</B> command opens
the default catalog WORK.GSEG, or a catalog you specify, or a specific entry.</A>
<P><A name="z0748056">&#13;
The GRAPH<B>n</B> command has the following form:</A>
<P>
<TABLE cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2">
<TR valign="top"><TD>
GRAPH<I>n</I> &lt;&lt;<I>libref</I>.&gt;
<I>catalog-name</I> &lt;.<I>entry-name</I>
&lt;.GRSEG&gt;&gt;&gt;
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<DL>
<DT><B>n</B></DT>
<DD>is a number from 1 to 4 that indicates which
GRAPH window to open.<P></DD>

<DT><B>libref</B></DT>
<DD>points to the library where the catalog
is or will be stored.<P></DD>

<DT><B>catalog-name</B></DT>
<DD>is the name of the catalog whose contents
you want to view.  The default is WORK.GSEG.  If the specified catalog does
not contain any graphics entries, the window opens but is empty.  The catalog
assignment is temporary and remains in effect only while the GRAPH window
remains open.  To change the catalog, resubmit the GRAPH<B>n</B> command.<P></DD>

<DT><B>entry-name</B></DT>
<DD>is the name of the catalog entry that you
want to view.  If you omit <B>entry-name</B> or the entry does not exist,
the last graph in the catalog is displayed.  If you specify <B>entry-name</B>, you must also supply the libref and catalog
name.<P></DD>

<DT>GRSEG</DT>
<DD>is the type of catalog entry.<P></DD>
</DL>

<P>To close the GRAPH window, issue the END command.
<BR><H3>Sizing the GRAPH Window</H3>


<P><A name="z0748068">&#13; The default size of a GRAPH window depends on
the display device. </A><DL>
<DT><B><FONT color="FF00007">CAUTION:</FONT></B></DT><DD><B>Resizing the GRAPH window after you have displayed a graph can
distort the graphs.</B>
If you replay a graph
in a GRAPH window that is a different size from the size at which you created
the graph, the graph may be distorted. Distortion occurs if the new HSIZE
and VSIZE values do not maintain the width-to-height ratio of the original
window.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"></DD></DL>
<P> 
<P>Doing any of the following may change the HSIZE and
VSIZE values and consequently the size of the GRAPH window: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>changing the device driver<P>

<LI>specifying a target
device<P>

<LI>specifying dimensions with the HSIZE= and VSIZE=
graphics options.<P>
</UL>

<P>In addition, resizing the GRAPH window can reduce the
number of cells available for the output. In order to display some types of
graphs in a reduced GRAPH window, you may need to increase the number of cells
either by using the HPOS= and VPOS= graphics options or by modifying the device
driver. To ensure that graphs have an adequate number of cells, use a full-size
GRAPH window when creating the graphs.You can then reduce the window to replay
the graphs. For more information on dimensions and cell size, see <A href="zprocout.htm#z-modgoa">About the Graphics Output Area</A>.
<P>If you create most
or all of your graphs at the same
size or with the same aspect ratio, you can avoid distortion if you size the
window before you draw the graphs and then use the WSAVE command to save the
position and dimensions of the window. If you resize the GRAPH windows and
do not use the WSAVE command, the new size is not saved, even in the same
SAS session.

<TR valign="bottom"><TD><HR></TD></TR>

<P><A name="z0748077">&#13;
 Environments that do not support the GRAPH window use the direct
display method. With this method, your display is cleared and the graph appears
when you run a graphics procedure.</A>
<P>If the procedure produces more than one graph, you are
prompted to press ENTER between each graph for the next one to be displayed.
 To return to your program, press END or ENTER after the last graph.
<P>You can display the graphs automatically and control
the amount of time between each graph with the GWAIT= and NOPROMPT graphics
options. GWAIT= specifies the number of seconds before the next graph is drawn.
NOPROMPT suppresses the delay between the graphs displayed. In this case, SAS/GRAPH automatically
returns to your program after the last graph displays. (See <A href="z0713550.htm">Graphics Options and Device Parameters Dictionary</A> for a complete description
of these graphics options.)
<P>With the direct display method, you cannot scroll to
other graphs in the catalog.  To redisplay graphs, you must rerun the procedure
or replay the catalog entries. For information on replaying graphs, see <A href="zlaychap.htm">The GREPLAY Procedure</A>.
