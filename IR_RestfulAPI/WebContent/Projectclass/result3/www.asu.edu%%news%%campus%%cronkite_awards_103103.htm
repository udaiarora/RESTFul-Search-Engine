      <h2>Cronkite Luncheon to recognize broadcaster Andy Rooney</h2>
      <p>        <img src="campus_images/andy_rooney_103103.jpg" width="180" height="202" align="right">His voice and style on television are immediately recognizable to millions
          of Americans. His words provoke laughter, anger, discussion, thought
          and action, the marks of an excellent commentator. His career has spanned
          decades on some of the most well-known news programs ever to air in
      the United States.</p>
      <p>This year, ASU and the Walter Cronkite School of
            Journalism and Mass Communication will recognize Andy Rooney with
        the Cronkite School's top honor Nov.
            6. Rooney, the long-time commentator for CBS's "60 Minutes,"
            will receive the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism
          and Mass Communication at the School's annual luncheon, hosted by Walter
            Cronkite, at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel. More than 900 people are
        expected to attend to honor Rooney.</p>
      <p>Rooney is known for the wry, humorous and sometimes
          controversial essays that have been the signature end piece of "60
        Minutes" for a quarter
          of a century. The 2003 - 04 season marks Rooney's 26th year doing these
          unique reports, "A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney," which became a regular
        feature on the show in September 1978. </p>
      <p>He's won three Emmy Awards for
        those essays, which now number more than 800. </p>
      <p>Rooney has always considered
          himself a writer who appears on television. In addition to his "60
        Minutes" essays, he has written a national newspaper
            column for Tribune Media Services since 1979, published articles
        in major magazines, and is the author of 13 books, the most recent, "Common
            Nonsense,"
          published in 2002 by Public Affairs. </p>
      <p>Rooney's rich body of work was recognized
          by the National Society of Newspaper Columnists when he was presented
          with its Ernie Pyle Lifetime
        Achievement Award in June. </p>
      <p>"Ernie Pyle's life and work eloquently captured
          the hopes and aspirations of the common man. Andy Rooney's work is
        in that fine tradition," said
          the society's president. Rooney was a friend of Pyle, the famous World
        War II correspondent who was felled by a sniper in the war.</p>
      <p>"The most
          felicitous nonfiction writer in television" is how Time magazine once
          described Rooney, who has won the Writers Guild Award for Best Script
          of the Year six times, more than any other writer in the history of
        the medium. </p>
      <p>Rooney wrote his first television essay, a longer-length precursor
          of the type he does on "60 Minutes," in 1964, "An Essay on Doors."
        From 1962 to 1968, he collaborated with the late CBS News correspondent
        Harry
          Reasoner - Rooney writing and producing, Reasoner narrating - on such
          notable CBS News specials as "An Essay on Bridges" (1965), "An Essay
          on Hotels" (1966), "An Essay on Women" (1967), "An Essay on Chairs"
        (1968) and "The Strange Case of the English Language" (1968). "An Essay
        on War"
          (1971) won Rooney his third Writers Guild Award. In 1968, he wrote
        two CBS News specials in the series "Of Black America." His script for
        "Black
        History: Lost, Stolen or Strayed" won him his first Emmy.</p>
      <p>He also wrote,
          produced and narrated a series of broadcasts for CBS News on various
          aspects of America and American life, including "Mr. Rooney
          Goes to Washington," for which he won a Peabody Award, "Andy Rooney
        Takes Off," "Mr. Rooney Goes to Work" and "Mr. Rooney Goes to Dinner." </p>
      <p>Rooney
          joined CBS in 1949 as a writer for "Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts,"
          a top-10 hit that was number one in 1952. He also wrote for "The Garry
          Moore Show" 1959 - 65, helping it to achieve hit status as a top-20
        program. At the same time, he wrote for CBS News public affairs broadcasts
        such
          as "The Twentieth Century," "News of America," "Adventure," "Calendar"
          and "The Morning Show with Will Rogers, Jr."<br>
        Rooney was born Jan. 14, 1919, in Albany, N.Y. He attended Colgate
          University until he was drafted into the Army in 1941. In February
          1943, he was
          one of six correspondents who flew with the Eighth Air Force on the
          first American bombing raid over Germany.</p>
      <p>The Cronkite School, part of ASU's
          College of Public Programs, boasts one of the largest and most successful
          mass communication programs in
          the country, preparing 1,700 undergraduates and 85 graduate students
          for careers in journalism, media management and public relations. The
          School has compiled one of the best records in the nation in regional
          and national student journalism contests over the past decade. <br>
        Each year the Cronkite Endowment Board, a group of more than 30 leaders
          from the Phoenix media community, sponsors the Cronkite Awards Luncheon,
          working with Walter Cronkite to select an exemplary professional for
        the award. </p>
      <p>Prior Cronkite Excellence Award recipients include Charles
          Kuralt, Bill Moyers, Ben Bradley, Bob Woodward, George Will, Katharine
          Graham, Bernard
        Shaw, Cokie Roberts and the "60 Minutes" team.</p>
