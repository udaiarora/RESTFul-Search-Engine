      <h2><strong>Intel Foundation Sponsors Entrepreneur Competition at ASU </strong></h2>
      <p>Arizona State University (ASU) announced today that the Intel Foundation has committed $100,000 in funding for Entrepreneur 2004, the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering's 3rd annual entrepreneur competition, and entrepreneurial programs in the Fulton School. Intel funds will help winning student teams turn their business plans into start-up companies by financing initial technology development in preparation for obtaining future investment. These start-up companies will be incubated at ASU, receiving professional coaching services to get their idea off the ground and running. </p>
      <p>Entrepreneur 2004 has grown since the original competition into a remarkable collaboration between industry and academia. This year, twenty-one ASU student teams submitted proposals for the competition. This is the first year that winning entrants receive a combination of cash and services designed to turn their business dreams into reality. </p>
      <p>"The Intel Foundation is committed to innovation in education and ASU's Entrepreneur Competition takes learning beyond the classroom," said John Mascarenas, strategic investment manager for Intel Capital, Intel's strategic investment program, and an Entrepreneur 2004 judge. "Additionally, Intel Capital has a 10-year history of fostering new companies with emerging technologies and Entrepreneur 2004 is a great opportunity for us to spur local entrepreneurialism and fuel economic growth and development in the community." </p>
      <p>ASU previously secured commitments from Greenberg Traurig, Steptoe and Johnson, ASU Technopolis, The Business Leadership Development Corporation , and the Enterprise Network to provide legal, management, marketing, entrepreneurial, and financial consulting services that will total over $50,000 for the winners of the competition. Teams have also received the services of professional mentors; industry specialists from a variety of firms who volunteered their time to coach team members on the preparation of their business plans and presentations for the final competition. </p>
      <p>This year's competition also introduced students as consultants to the competing teams. ASU's College of Law, under the direction of Professor Doug Sylvester, formed a student consortium that prepared a handbook of legal information for entrepreneurs and provided consulting services on intellectual property and other issues. The College of Architecture and Environmental Design organized a student consulting team, under the direction of Professor Paul Rothstein, to advise entrants on issues related to industrial design, such as product packaging and appearance. </p>
      <p>"Economic impact studies show that investments in research and business development routinely generate ten or more times their initial value, once the direct and indirect benefits of the investment are fully accounted for," said Michael Kozick , professor of electrical engineering and director of entrepreneurial programs at ASU. "At a minimum, then, the Intel Foundation's donation of $100,000 can be expected to generate $1 million worth of economic benefit to Arizona . But what if one of the competition winners starts a new industry or grows into a major new business? The return on Intel's investment in Arizona is even greater." </p>
      <p>But for the engineering, business, law and industrial design students participating in this year's competition, the benefits of the experience are priceless. </p>
      <p>Final presentations and judging for Entrepreneur 2004 will take place on April 8 at 1 p.m. in the Carson Ballroom of the Old Main Building on ASU's main campus. The event is open to the public. For more information, visit the competition's website at <a href="http://www.fulton.asu.edu/innovation">www.fulton.asu.edu/innovation </a>. </p>
