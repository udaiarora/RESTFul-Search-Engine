His research interests are in the areas of computer aided lighting design, building energy simulation, daylighting, and lighting for green buildings. As part of two research contracts administered by the Lighting Research Center, he focused on the energy optimization of toplighting and sidelighting strategies for green buildings. Sponsored through the MASCARO Sustainability Initiative at the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Moeck is collaborating with a faculty member in Mechanical Engineering on the development of LED luminaires for general illumination. Moeck performed industry-supported research in daylight systems analysis for museums with multimedia displays and public computing spaces in New York City and Washington, D.C., and served as a lighting and display consultant for two major automotive companies. Dr. Moeck developed various teaching and research laboratories, including research/instructional laboratory facilities for flexible light installation using plug-and-play electrical connectors, digital dimming ballasts and relay switches, and new digital light controls (DALI).
