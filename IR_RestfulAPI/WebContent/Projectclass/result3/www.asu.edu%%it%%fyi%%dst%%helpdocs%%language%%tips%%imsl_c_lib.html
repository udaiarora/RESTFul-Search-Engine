Finding IMSL C-Libraries
</center></h2>
<p>
Q. I am trying to find canned subroutines for C language (similar to 
IMSL for Fortran).  Can you tell me where can I find information 
(such as the name of this collection of subroutines, the directory in 
which it is located, info. for the manuals, how to link it to my 
programs, etc.?  I will be using the cc compiler in the research 
cluster.
<p> 
There are IMSL C language libraries, but they have different variable 
types and look different from the FORTRAN IMSL libraries.  There is a 
separate manual for the C-libraries.
<p>
The IMSL C-libaries are in the /usr/lib directory and the libraries are:
<pre>
      libimsl.a       <-- FORTRAN
      libimslcmath.a  <-- C Math Lib.
      libimslcstat.a  <-- C Stats. Lib.
      libimslexp.a    <-- FORTRAN Exponent Graphics Lib.
</pre>
The include files are in /usr/include
<p>
RESEARCH 31 > ls *imsl*
<pre>
imsl.h     imslerr.h  imsls.h    imsls_e.h
</pre> 
To find out more about the C Language IMSL Libaries, you need to go to  
the Customer Assistance Center (formerly COMPASS) and find out about the 
routine name and routine you would like 
to use/call.  The Customer Assistance Center is 
located on the second 
floor of the Computing Commons and has the IMSL C-lang. Library Manuals.
<p> 
Another way to use IMSL is:  use FORTRAN IMSL  routines (if you have 
the manual) and to call them from C on the research cluster you need 
to follow the following rules:<ol>
<li>add "_"  to the end of the routine name when calling from C
<li>The routine name is in small letters (with "_" addition)
<li>Store the values of 2 and higher dim. arrays in reverse order 
(by column as FORTRAN does), C-Lang. is opposite (what it is is 
basically the way C stores M a 2D matrix , to be equivalent in  
FORTRAN store it as its transpose in C, then you'll get M in 
FORTRAN).
<li>All variables are passed as pointers(single pointers == address) .
</ol> 
Once the program is written, and if you need assistance with linking 
it correctly, you may send an email message to "unix-q@asu.edu".
