<p><b>1</b>. <b>Call to Order.</b>

<p>The meeting was called to order by Senate President William Davey at

3:10 p.m.

<p><b>2. Approval of Previous Minutes </b>(October 26, 1998).

<p>The <i>Minutes </i>of the October 26, 1998 Senate meeting were approved

by voice vote. The secretary will correct the <i>Minutes</i> to reflect

that Senator Dent was present.

<p><b>3. Announcements and Communications.</b>

<p><b>3.A Senate President's Report </b>(William Davey).

<p>You will receive a copy of the November edition of the

<i>Academic Senate

Newsletter</i> in the campus mail. Please make this copy of the

<i>Newsletter</i>

prime reading. It contains the initial report from the presidential committee

that is dealing with curricular simplification. The report was distributed

in the <i>Newsletter</i> to the university community. This is the first

phase of the project. The next phase deals with the philosophy of the committee,

the charge to the committee, and some of the basic issues surrounding the

curriculum at ASU. The next issue of the <i>Newsletter</i> will contain

the recommendations of the committee. Please review the November<i> Newletter</i>

and give me your response to our article, and I will forward them to Chuck

Bantz.&nbsp;

<p>The second featured item in the <i>Newsletter</i> is the announcement

of the new Arizona Faculties Council Interactive Dialogue on Higher Education

Futures in Arizona. This web page provides a series of dialogues on the

Arizona Board of Regents' focus areas for this year. It is a cooperative

project for the three universities, and all members of our university community

are invited to participate. The login instructions are available in the

<i>Newsletter</i>

and the web location is noted at the top of these Minutes<i>.</i>

<p>I am happy to report to you that the Arizona Board of Regents at their

meeting at ASU accepted the first Post-Tenure Review Report. Everyone here

owes a debt of gratitude to Provost Glick, who made the presentation on

the part of the three universities.&nbsp;

<p>In front of you is a copy of the draft Whistleblower Policy. You may

recall last year that a bill was put before the Arizona House of Representatives

seeking to take the university exemption to the Arizona Whistleblower Statute

away from the university, and put the adjudication of any whistleblower

personnel issue into the hands of the Department of Administration (DOA).

The Council of Presidents proposed a joint memorandum to the legislature

indicating they would set up committees on each of the university campuses;

each the universities individually and severally were asked to put together

a whistleblower policy that would keep the whistleblower issues inside

the university personnel practices, but would allow external arbitration

services. Simultaneously, the three universities, working with their legal

counsels and through their respective governance structures, are presenting

draft whistleblower policies for final approval. The final policies will

be approved (receive a second reading) in January at our respective academic

senate meetings. What we are considering today is a first reading of the

ASU document.&nbsp;

<p>We are trying to identify what a whistleblower case is at the very beginning,

as early as possible, in order to provide fair and equitable service to

people who are filing those grievances. We want to keep the cases within

the university structure and we will keep you informed of where we are

on this issue.&nbsp;

<p><b>3.B University President's Report</b> (Lattie Coor).

<p>It is hard to believe that this is the last regular meeting of the Senate

for the semester. I will touch on three issues that have been central to

our activities since the beginning of this semester. The first one Dr.

Davey has already spoken about, the report to the Regents on the Post-Tenure

Review study. I agree that Dr. Glick and his colleagues did a fine job.

There was considerable apprehension as we presented our first Post-Tenure

Review report, due to the fact that if our plan had not been viewed as

credible, two to three years of careful work could have been in jeopardy.

I feel we have a mechanism now that will work. Stay alert, however, because

this will become the essential instrument we use to describe our work to

the Board of Regents.

<p>Another item that we hoped would have been brought to closure is the

Faculty Workload Measures study. The one remaining item that the Regents

asked for additional work on has to do with one regent's desire to separate

out full-time Lecturers and Senior Lectures and Instructors from the current

definition we use for ranked faculty. We had hoped that issue would be

resolved by including all ranked faculty. Now, we will be working on the

best way to respond to this Regental request.&nbsp;

<p>There was a dramatic headline in the <i>State Press</i> today, a discussion

of salaries (it was not Regent salaries). The Regents did not vote salary

increases for the next three years either. What did happen was significant.

For some time, we have been pursuing among the three universities an effort

to get state funding to bring salary pools to the fiftieth percentile of

our peers. ASU and UofA have a blended set of peers. The likelihood of

that being totally funded is not what drives us, but keeping it actively

before the governor and the legislature is. The debate that took place

at the Regents meeting was on whether we should move totally to the fiftieth

percentile in the first year, and sustain our position in the out years,

or whether it should be spread over the next four years. We need to follow

what other state agencies are doing. It is too early to know how receptive

the State of Arizona will be both to that, and to our budget. You may have

seen the sobering news late last week that there is a projected $280 million

deficit in Fiscal 2000. It is that time of year that concerns about next

year's revenue are strong as budgets are put together. At the same time

it is clear, that there were some major commitments made a year ago that

will be difficult to absorb in the budget. I say to you now, that the whole

of the university budget, plus the salary piece, will be very much on our

minds and in our discussions between this Senate meeting and the spring

Academic Assembly meeting. By then, the Governor will have made up her

budget proposal and announced it publicly, as will the Joint Legislative

Budget Committee.&nbsp;

<p>We have raised the goal of the private fund raising drive to $400 million.

Our figures at our last moment of closing are at about $233 million. We

hope to be at $250 million by December of this year and then we have two

and one half years of very energetic work to do to complete the $400 million

goal. The last third of our campaign will be twice as hard as the first

two-thirds, yet I am optimistic. I am deeply impressed with how people

have come forward to make all of this happen.&nbsp;

<p>My final observation is to draw to all of our attention to the issue

of streamlining the curriculum that Dr. Davey mentioned today in his announcements.

I encourage you to read this issue of the <i>Academic Senate Newsletter</i>

because that too will remain an active part of our agenda as we move into

the spring semester.&nbsp;

<p>Senate President Davey: In case you did not know, our Board of Regents

is a voluntary board, therefore, increasing their salaries is not possible.

<p><b>3.C ASASU President's Report</b> (Paul Frost).

<p>The tuition-setting hearings gave the students an opportunity to come

and express their concern about rising tuition rates. It also was a great

opportunity to have an open dialogue with President Coor and Provost Glick

about where the tuition dollars will go for the next year. We look forward

to having increased dialogue and being a part of that process in the future.&nbsp;

<p>At last week's Student-Faculty Policy Committee meeting, we brought

forth some new material about the Course and Teacher Evaluations that I

wanted to tell you about. In the Student Senate meeting last week, evaluations

were presented to the Senate for any questions. Some of the senators expressed

concern that the evaluation questions do not accurately tell the student

enough about what they would like to review about the instructor's performance.

We brought that issue to the Student-Faculty Policy Committee for discussion.

What we are going to do is evaluate 100-200 classes this semester and continue

to work with the pilot program. After that, we would like to assemble some

students to get some feedback about the course evaluation program and how

useful they feel it would be to them. We will keep you updated, and Dr.

Crawford will keep you posted of any changes that are being made to the

program.

<p>I want to thank Dr. Davey and others who have worked on the web page

for the Board of Regents. It is an opportunity for everybody to give some

direct input. It should be a profitable dialogue about important issues

within the Board of Regents.&nbsp;

<p>We in Associated Students are also interested in streamlining the graduation

process. We look forward to continuing our participation. I was a student

representative on the committee that worked throughout the summer on the

recommendations. I have a vested interested in the outcome of that project.&nbsp;

<p>The Homecoming festivities went well and I appreciate everyone's participation.&nbsp;

<p>Senate President Davey: I think it was the sense of all who saw the

students participating in the tuition discussion that they did it in an

extremely professional manner and, I think, they caused the Regents to

rethink the way they set tuition. The director of ASA was very astute and

brought forth the student concerns in probably the best manner I have seen

since I have been active in the Senate.

<p><b>3.D. Senate President-Elect's Report</b> (David Burstein).

<p>As an update, the team that has been assembled to review the Student

Information System is almost ready to begin its work. I would like to ask

you to take back to your departments that we will be contacting the departments

through the colleges, as to the uses that people in your departments have

made of the Student Information System. It may be you as faculty; it will

certainly be the staff within the departments. I would like to make clear

to all of you that our study does not mean we will automatically get a

new information system. However, if we are ever going to have a new system,

we have to understand what it does right now. Right now, we do not know

the scope of that usage. Over the next three months, everyone will have

an opportunity to give input into defining a new student information system;

to have his or her voice heard. We will not only be contacting everyone

through the departments; we will be setting up a web page and there will

also be an email address for you to give us input. If you have information

please let me know now. I will be the one assembling these data.

<p>Senator O'Grady: How will we get this information to you?

<p>President-Elect Burstein: You can do it off the web page or by e-mailing

me (david.burstein@asu.edu). The informing process will begin at the college

level, and proceed to the departments and parts of the university that

have accounts on the SIS system. They will be contacted directly.

<p><b>3.E ASU West Senate President's Report </b>(In<font face="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</font>

s Chisholm).

<p>Senate President Davey: In<font face="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</font>

s asked me to give her report because she cannot be with us today. Last

week In<font face="WP MultinationalA Roman">J</font> s and I established

a dual campus committee to look at some of the student transfer issues

between main and west campus. We had our first meeting last week. The outcomes

of that discussion were very positive in terms of wanting to smooth out

the transition for students. We raised the issue of residency hours and

the implication for DARS implementation and other similar issues. We will

be having two more meetings in the next couple of months. We will come

forward with recommendations to make the transitional process between the

campuses easier.&nbsp;

<p><b>3.F ASU East Academic Assembly President's Report</b> (Ernest Hirata

for Andy Jackson). No report.

<p><b>3.G</b> <b>Faculty Athletic Representative's Annual Report</b> (Jerry

Kingston).&nbsp;

<p>Jerry Kingston presented the annual academic report of the Faculty Athletics

Representative. A one-page summary sheet (call Senate Office 5-9245 for

a copy) was distributed to the members of the Senate at the time of the

presentation. The report focussed on measures of the academic preparation,

academic performance and graduation rates of student-athletes.&nbsp;

<p><u>Academic Preparation</u>.&nbsp;

<p>Professor Kingston reported that the mean (recentered) SAT score for

scholarship student-athletes who entered ASU during the 1994, 1995, 1996

and 1997 academic years (Column 2) was 986, compared with a value of 1078

for non-athlete students. The gap between the two groups has narrowed over

the past four reporting periods. Team average SAT scores tended to be higher

for female than for male student-athletes.&nbsp;

<p>The mean high school core GPA statistic (Column 3) is calculated on

the basis of 13 high school core courses, including 4 years of English,

3 years of mathematics, 2 years of natural/physical science, 2 years of

social science and 2 years of other courses (typically foreign language).

This GPA is used as a part of the NCAA eligibility formula for entering

freshmen student-athletes, and is not calculated for non-athlete students.

The mean value of this GPA for scholarship student-athletes who entered

ASU during the 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 academic years is 3.15. This measure

of high school academic preparation has increased over each of the last

four FAR reports to the Academic Senate.&nbsp;

<p><u>Academic Performance</u>

<p>The academic performance of enrolled student-athletes (both scholarship

and non-scholarship) is indicated by the GPA values reported for the Fall

and Spring semesters (Columns 4 and 5). The mean value of the Fall semester

GPA for student-athletes enrolled during the 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997

academic years is 2.74, compared with a value of 2.77 for all students.

The corresponding values for the Spring semester are 2.68 for student-athletes

and 2.80 for all students. The gap between student-athletes and all students

has narrowed each year over the past four reporting periods.&nbsp;

<p><u>Graduation Rates</u>

<p>Six-year graduation rate statistics are now available from the NCAA

for the 1991 entering class (Column 7) and for the entering classes of

1998, 1989, 1990 and 1991 combined (Column 6). The statistics for student-athletes

relate only to scholarship student-athletes who entered ASU as freshman.

These data indicate that the graduation rate of scholarship student-athletes

in the 1991 entering class was only 35%, and this represents a decline

from 53% recorded for the 1990 entering class. This decline was largely

due to the attrition of scholarship student-athletes in the sport of football

who entered in the fall of 1991 and left in response to the change in the

Head Coach which occurred shortly thereafter.&nbsp;

<p>The information for the entering classes of 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991

combined indicate that: (1) the graduation rate for scholarship student-athletes

exceeded that of all entering freshman (48% vs. 46%); (2) the graduation

rates for female student-athletes exceeded that of male student-athletes

(68% vs. 37%); and (3) some sports?notably men?s tennis, men?s basketball

and baseball?experienced very low graduation rates.&nbsp;

<p>Evidence now available for the entering class of 1992 indicates that

the graduation rate of scholarship student-athletes will return to its

previous level (above 50%). The Department of Intercollegiate Athletics

has established a goal of a 70% graduation rate for the 1996 entering class.

The Department has completely reorganized its Academic Services division

and several new staff members have been added to improve the academic support

services provided to student-athletes. Professor Kingston stated that the

new Athletics administration is strongly supportive of improving student-athlete

academic success.&nbsp;

<p><b>4. Open Forum</b>. There were no items of discussion.

<p><b>5. Unfinished Business</b> (Motions from Senate Committees) (<b>Second

Reading</b>).

<p><b>5.A</b> <b>Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee</b> (Linda

Johnson).

<p>Senate President William Davey acted for Linda Johnson in her absence

to bring Senate Motion #8 before the Senate for a second reading. He said

the motion is a request from the College of Law to establish a Certificate

Program in Indian Law. Materials are attached to the agenda. Hearing no

further discussion from the house on the motion, Senate President Davey

moved to a vote. Senate Motion #8 was approved by voice vote<b> </b>(Call

Senate Office 5-9245 for a copy of Appendix A).&nbsp;

<p><b>5.B Personnel Committee </b>(Kevin Carroll).

<p>Senate President Davey: I am sorry to have to accept the resignation

of Kevin Carroll for the Senate due to medical reasons. Senator Ronald

Hoffmeister will take over the operations of the Personnel Committee until

another chair can be elected. I am bringing forward three issues on behalf

of the committee.&nbsp;

<p><b>5.B.1 </b>Senate Motion #9. "The Personnel Committee recommends Academic

Senate approval of proposed revisions of the <i>ACD Manual</i>, section

506-12, Promotion from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer policy." The motion

and documentation are attached to your agenda; is there discussion of this

motion? Hearing no further discussion from the house, we will move to a

vote. Senate Motion #9 was approved by voice vote (Call Senate Office 5-9245

for a copy of Appendix B).

<p><b>5.B.2 </b>Senate Motion #10. "The Personnel Committee recommends

Academic Senate approval of proposed revisions to the <i>ACD Manual, </i>section

702-02, Health Related Leave." There is one additional motion regarding

this item. The Senate Executive Committee passed a motion based upon the

advice of University Legal Counsel and University Budget Office, suggesting

the change from four-hour increments to one-hour increments. Four-hour

increments are against federal law; this change makes us in compliance

with the law. The bill that was distributed last time, plus the Senate

Executive Committee motion to amend the motion from four-hours to one-hour

increments is what we are considering. There is an amended motion on the

floor; Senate Motion #10; is there discussion? Hearing no further discussion,

we will move to a vote. Senate Motion #10 as amended<b> </b>was approved

by voice vote (Call Senate Office 5-9245 for a copy of Appendix C).

<p><b>5.B.3 </b>Senate Motion #11. "The Personnel Committee recommends

Academic Senate approval of proposed revisions to the <i>ACD Manual</i>

section 704-02, Vacation Leave for Fiscal Year Appointments." The motion

is attached to the agenda; is there any discussion? Hearing no further

discussion from the house, we will move to a vote. Senate Motion<b> #</b>11

was approved by voice vote (Call Senate Office 5-9245 for a copy of Appendix

D).&nbsp;

<p><b>6. New Business</b> (Reports and Motions).

<p><b>6.A Executive Committee</b> (William Davey). No report.

<p><b>6.B Committee on Committees</b> (Timothy Karcher). No report.

<p><b>6.C Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee</b> (Linda Johnson).

<p><b>6.C.1</b> Action Item:

<p>Senate President Davey gave the CAPC report. On October 28, the Committee

advanced <b>Senate Motion #12,</b> a request from the College of Engineering

and Applied Sciences to change the name of the department of Industrial

and Management Systems Engineering <b>TO</b> Industrial Engineering. I

have been requested, in order to meet Catalog deadlines, to ask the house

for a motion to suspend the rules to vote upon the motion. I now entertain

a motion to suspend the rules. This motion is not debatable and requires

2/3rds approval. The motion was moved and seconded. Is there any further

discussion from the house? Hearing no further discussion, we will move

to a vote. The Chair rules the vote is a two-thirds majority. Motion to

suspend the rules is in effect. We are now considering Senate Motion #12

for second reading. Is there any discussion?

<p>Senator Landers: Can someone from Engineering speak to the reason why

one part is being dropped?

<p>Senator Beckman: It was a request to expand the general statement of

their department name; the management part is an older construction.

<p>Senate President Davey: It is a request to bring the terminology up

to more modern times, because the term "management" was an old term, and

is not necessarily reflective of the current conditions.&nbsp;

<p>Senator Karady: At most other universities, Engineering would have Industrial

Engineering, which is a manufacturing process. This is an appropriate change

and says what the department is doing.&nbsp;

<p>Senate President Davey: Hearing no further discussion from the house,

we will move to a vote which will then change the name of the department

to Industrial Engineering. Senate Motion #12 was approved by voice vote

(Call Senate Office for a copy of Appendix E).&nbsp;

<p><b>6.C.2 </b>Information Item.

<p>Senate President Davey: This is a proposal from the College of Fine

Arts to disestablish the following concentrations under the Bachelor of

Arts in Theatre: Acting, Design and Technical Theatre, Directing and Stage

Management, History, Theory and Criticism. That requires no Senate action.

<p>Senator: So, what is left?

<p>Senate President Davey: Is there a senator from Theatre present who

can inform us?

<p>Provost Glick: It is just the elimination of names of concentrations;

they are still teaching the same curricular material.

<p><b>6.D Personnel Committee </b>(Kevin Carroll).

<p>Senate President Davey: The Personnel Committee introduces a draft Whistleblower

policy, which was distributed to you today. The Senate Personnel Committee

reviewed this, as did the Consultative Committee, university administrators,

the Council of Deans, and the Arizona Faculties Council. The document before

us today is a revision based on all the input from the groups I mentioned.

There are some issues that remain, including the reporting that has to

be reported to the university officer at the provost level or higher. At

every level of review of the document, this particular issue came up. I

have asked Mary Stevens to be at our next Senate meeting to give legal

input on these kinds of issues. Right now, we are in first reading of this

document. Are there any non-substantive or procedural questions about this

motion?

<p>Senator O'Grady: I remember receiving an e-mail from someone outside

the university on this subject; it went to all the members of the Senate.

Does this include the information that that person sent? Or not? You said

it was considered by a number of different groups.&nbsp;

<p>Senate President Davey: What the universities have done is respond to

the Council of Presidents committee that suggested the universities put

forward policies at the three universities. The emails that you received

are from an outside agency that recommends additional legislation be put

forward. The Arizona Faculties Council at the last Board meeting discussed

this issue; we came to the considered conclusion that the policies we received

from the three universities satisfy the mandates of the Presidents' agreement,

and that we would not support any additional legislation. The person who

sent you the e-mail was informed this morning that we would not participate

in any legislative action, and that we were going forward with the three

presidents' policies.&nbsp;

<p><b>6.E Student-Faculty Policy</b> (John Crawford).

<p>Senate President Davey: Senator Crawford is ill today and I will give

his report. At the last SFPC meeting, they welcomed two guests from ASASU

Student Senate. They discussed the status of the ASASU effort to create

a teacher evaluation program for the campus. There is a strong feeling

among current ASASU Senate members that the ongoing effort that was begun

three years ago is not focused on teaching with appropriate questions and

open comment opportunities. There will be an attempt to explore a different

kind of evaluation technology in the near future. For the moment, it was

agreed that ASASU has committed considerable resources to this issue, and

that at this time the program will continue with a 100-class pilot project

with the results not being published. The results of this semester's pilot

will be used as a stimulus for student focus group explorations of the

evaluation questionnaire and other more general project evaluation needs.

The Academic Senate will receive a detailed report of this entire evaluation

in the January or February of next year.&nbsp;

<p><b>6.F University Services and Facilities Committee</b> (Rodney Rogers).&nbsp;

<p>Senate President Davey: Senator Rogers is ill today. The Committee is

meeting with Mernoy Harrison and Jon Rose, a senator from the Law College,

who has been active on state committees dealing with compensation, and

is reviewing the health care provider situation in a serious way. Next

week, Mernoy and Jon will be meeting with several people from downtown

and the USFC to develop a discussion of that issue.&nbsp;

<p><b>7. Adjournment.&nbsp;</b>

<p>There being no further business, the Chair entertained a motion to adjourn

at 4:15 p.m.
