      <h2>ASU Downtown Center hosts diverse lecture series in March</h2>
      <p>        In March the ASU Downtown Center will be presenting a collection of lectures
          that focus on Women's Recognition Month, Aloha Fridays, diversity and
          workplace issues.<br>
        Each of the lectures will be presented from noon to 1 p.m., on assigned
        weekdays, at the ASU Downtown Center, 502 E. Monroe St., Phoenix. A complete
        list of the free lectures can be found at (www.asu.edu/xed/lectures).
        To R.S.V.P., call (480) 965-3046 or go online to (http://xedreg.asu.edu/).</p>
      <p>The
          first lecture will be presented March 4 by Cinda Dior, an expressive
          arts therapist with Courageous Creativity, a Phoenix company that encourages
          the use of art as therapy. Dior will present "Bring it On: How to SuperCharge
          Your life With Prosperity," a presentation focusing on personal excellence
          as the most powerful of all self-practices, and a means to lift one's
          level of prosperity in all areas of your life.</p>
      <p>"Everyone wants to be the
          best person they can be," Dior says, "and what I am planning to present
          is really an interactive workshop that addresses
          prosperity and discovering the true meaning of the word; so that others
          will learn about the art of becoming mindful and having gratitude." </p>
      <p>Dior, whose company offers therapeutic art programs for schools and companies,
      says it's important for everyone to discover their own personal greatness. </p>
      <p>"I think that more and more people are thinking about how to become more
        excellent in how they conduct themselves, their work performances and
        personal relationships, but I don't think people know where to begin
        to make changes for themselves," she says. "I love hearing what people
        have to say and responding to what their needs are. I think many people
        will benefit from my workshop."<br>
      </p>
      <p>For information about Courageous Creativity, call (602) 882-1444.</p>
