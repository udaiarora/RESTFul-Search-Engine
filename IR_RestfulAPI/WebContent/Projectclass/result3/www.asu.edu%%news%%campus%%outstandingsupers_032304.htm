      <h2>Seven Honored as 2004 Outstanding Supervisors </h2>
      <p align="center">The correlation is unmistakable. Constructive, inspirational supervisors make for motivated, productive employees. </p>
      <p>Seven ASU supervisors, nominated by their employees for exceptional leadership, were honored March 4 at the 2004 Outstanding Supervisor Awards ceremony, sponsored by ASU's Classified Staff Council. </p>
      <p>Veronica Chambers, support system analyst for the ASU Bookstore, coordinated this year's event. She says the annual awards were established in 1998 to recognize outstanding supervisors and to educate the ASU community about those qualities crucial to making a supervisor successful. </p>
      <p>"A great supervisor and leader opens doors for employees and supports them to expand their goals, their knowledge, and their contribution to the success and growth of the department and the organization," Chambers says. </p>
      <p>Recently Chambers and a small group of volunteers sorted through 108 Outstanding Supervisor nomination forms, and narrowed the group down to seven supervisors who exemplified the very best of the best. </p>
      <p>Kris Ewing, interim director of the ASU Intergroup Relations Center, received an award and describes the honor as one of her most meaningful moments at ASU. </p>
      <p>"I was, and remain, very honored to be recognized by the IRC staff," Ewing says. "Being advocates and allies for social justice and educational equity is their way of life. Their commitment, knowledge and intergroup relations skills elevate the center's contribution to ASU, the valley communities and higher education as a whole. </p>
      <p>Fellow recipient Nancy Jordan, associate vice president of community development for Public Affairs, says she is thankful for her capable staff and for the many opportunities ASU has afforded her. </p>
      <p>"I've been very fortunate to always have great assignments, have very interesting things to do and to work with very good people," Jordan says. "In our area, we work with people internal and external to the university on projects that can make a difference to our community as well as to the university. I consider myself very lucky." </p>
      <p>Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Neal Woodbury says good supervisors are made possible by good employees. </p>
      <p>"I am extremely fortunate to work with a group of individuals (staff, students, post-docs, senior researchers) that is extraordinary," Woodbury says. "It is easy to appear to be a good supervisor when the people you work with are all competent and professional." </p>
      <p>David Bernick, an applications systems analyst principal for ASU's Information Technology Department, describes the award as a totally unexpected honor. </p>
      <p>"I don't think of them as my staff at all - we're a team," Bernick says. "They're dedicated, responsible and trustworthy. They accomplish tasks that I couldn't and work very hard to further the goals of Student Business Services and the university." </p>
      <p>Sharon Ayres, business manager, senior, for the Del E. Webb School of Construction, says she was amazed to learn her staff had nominated her for the award. </p>
      <p>"I am fortunate to work with good people who are professionals who care about the students," Ayres says. "The Del E. Webb School of Construction is often described as a family unit, and I think the description fits." </p>
      <p>Scott Spurlock, a building automation specialist supervisor with Facilities Management, says he loves working at ASU. </p>
      <p>"My co-workers are the best part of the job," Spurlock says. "It's nice to be able to come to work each day and enjoy being part of a team." </p>
      <p>Also honored was Jack Dyer, a grounds assistant supervisor with Facilities Management. </p>
