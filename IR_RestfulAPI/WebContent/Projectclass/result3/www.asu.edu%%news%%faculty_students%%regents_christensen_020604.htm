      <h2><strong>Imaginative science: regents professor reaches beyond </strong></h2>
      <p align="left">When your career is built upon the scientific study of distant places never seen by human eyes, it is important to have a healthy imagination and the ability to apply a lot of creativity to your research agenda. For Philip Christensen, Korrick Professor of Geological Sciences and a leader in humanity's current exploration of Mars, success has depended on being able to look at his subject in a new way and, literally, see geology in a whole new light. </p>
      <p align="left"><img src="facstudents_images/phil_christensen_020604.jpg" width="288" height="188" align="right">Christensen, who currently has four scientific instruments operating on or around the Red Planet, is a science innovator who has pioneered the study of how infrared light emissions - light that objects give off that no human eye can see - can be used to analyze the chemistry and mineralogy of rocks and other geological materials from a distance. And like many original thinkers, his creativity is not limited to one area of accomplishment, but also appears in many parts of his research, teaching and service. </p>
      <p align="left">Christensen is one of eight new Regents Professors, one of the university's highest honors for faculty members. The others include Charles Arntzen, molecular biologist and the Florence Ely Nelson Presidential Endowed Chair; Ronald Carlson, English professor and author; Gene Glass, professor of educational leadership and policy studies; Luis Gomez-Mejia, Horace Steel Arizona Heritage Chair in management; Stephen Pyne, life sciences professor and authority on fire; Psychology Professor Irwin Sandler, director of the Center for Prevention Research; and Mary Lee Smith, educational leadership and policy studies professor. </p>
      <p>Growing up in Los Angeles, not far from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Christensen avidly followed the progress of NASA's explorations of the moon, the solar system and Mars. As an undergraduate at UCLA, he got a job working on the Mariner 9 project and found himself really hooked. This led him to graduate school, where he worked on the Viking missions to Mars, and in particular with the Viking Orbiters' Infrared Thermal Mappers, which used infrared sensing to tease out Martian geological secrets. </p>
      <p>Mapping the rough character of the Martian surface led Christensen to consider the more sophisticated capabilities of infrared sensing, and to develop an instrument known as the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES). Having learned that different materials have characteristic patterns in the infrared wavelengths when they emit absorbed energy, Christensen realized that he could use an infrared spectrometer to find signatures of different minerals at a distance. The remote-sensing capability of such an instrument was critically important, since it's difficult to land a spacecraft on Mars, not to mention one with the capabilities of a laboratory geologist onboard. </p>
      <p>NASA was impressed with TES and selected the instrument for the Mars Observer spacecraft, a complex orbiter that tragically disappeared on its way to Mars in 1993. The loss was devastating to Christensen and his team, but TES was re-built and re-flown on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which successfully went into Martian orbit in 1997. </p>
      <p>"The failure of Mars Observer made me, and all of the students, scientists, programmers, and data processors who worked on Mars Observer, very aware of how complex and risky sending spacecraft to other planets can be," says Christensen. "Fortunately, it made all of us even more determined to make the project work and carry on the exploration of Mars." </p>
      <p>And TES really did work. Christensen found large quantities of deposits of volcanic minerals proving Mars' volcanic past, as well as deposits of hematite and olivine, indicating alternately the past presence and absence of water on Mars. His hematite finding led NASA to select Terra Meridiani as the landing site for the current Opportunity rover. TES was also important for what it did not find - large quantities of carbonate minerals, indicating that historically Mars has been largely a cold, dry place. </p>
      <p>NASA selected Christensen to put instruments on three other spacecraft - the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) on the Mars Odyssey orbiter and Mini-TES on the two Mars Exploration Rovers. THEMIS has since had its own spectacular series of discoveries, including finding layers of rock, which imply a changing Martian climate, and deposits that Christensen argues are snowbanks on the walls of Martian craters. </p>
      <p>The high-resolution camera on Mars Global Surveyor has imaged numerous gullies on the sides of Martian craters that appear to have been recently carved by liquid water. However, Mars' thin, cold atmosphere makes flowing water virtually impossible on the surface. Christensen noticed that snow deposits occurred alongside gullies and, in a burst of insight, realized that the snow deposits could account for the flowing water by melting underneath and protecting the resulting flow from evaporation or freezing. </p>
      <p>"I saw this 'pasted-on' terrain and as you come around there are all these gullies," says Christensen. "I saw it and said 'Ah-ha!' It looks like these gullies are being exposed as this terrain is being removed through melting and evaporation." Christensen's idea was compelling enough to get the finding published in journal Nature, which ran the story on the cover. National Geographic Magazine ran a similar story on its cover last month. </p>
      <p>It's Christensen's imagination, creativity and vision that have landed his instruments on the Red Planet. After all those years of creating and waiting, it's time for the rovers to do the research to prove his theories and help with his next major discovery. </p>
