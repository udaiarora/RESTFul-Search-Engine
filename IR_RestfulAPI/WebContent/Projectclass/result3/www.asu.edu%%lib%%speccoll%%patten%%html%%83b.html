Acosta was a Portuguese soldier and physician who travelled
 widely, visiting such exotic places as Persia, India, Malaysia,
 and perhaps even China.  He landed at Goa in 1568 a few months
 after the death of Orta, and was appointed physician to the
 Royal Hospital of Cochin.  After some years of studying
 the plant life of India, he returned to Portugal where
 his manuscript was published.  This first edition of Acosta's
 work concentrates on the drugs of the East, drawing heavily
 on what had already been published by Orta.  Although it is
 primarily a translation into Spanish of Orta's work,
 authorities have stated that Acosta was knowledgeable
 on this subject.  In his translation he clarifies Orta's
 text and adds to its usefulness.  Many of the illustrations
 are from accurate drawings created by Acosta himself.
