      <h2>Lynk to serve as faculty athletics representative </h2>
      <p>ASU Law Professor Myles Lynk, the Peter Kiewit Foundation Professor of Law and the Legal Profession in the ASU College of Law, will become the university's new faculty athletics representative as of July 1. </p>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/Lynk00.jpg" width="180" height="270" align="right">Jerry Kingston, who has served in the position since 1987, will return to teaching full time in the economics department within the W. P. Carey School of Business at ASU. </p>
      <p>"Throughout his tenure Jerry Kingston provided steadfast leadership in representing ASU's Intercollegiate Athletics interests on campus, in the Pac-10 and through the NCAA governance structure," ASU President Michael Crow says. "Building on that solid foundation, Myles Lynk will be a strong advocate for academics and our student athletes. His experience as an accomplished attorney and educator will serve the university well in this role." </p>
      <p>Lynk, who will serve a five-year appointment, says the position will have three major components - representing the university's interest in helping ICA meet all ASU, Pac-10 and NCAA academic eligibility rules and regulations; working closely with ICA's Office of Compliance to monitor the eligibility of all of ASU's 400 student athletes; and helping the student-athletes make the most of their educational opportunities while at ASU. </p>
      <p>"The first word in 'student-athlete' is 'student,'" Lynk says. </p>
      <p>In many ways, he will serve as an advocate for ASU's administration, faculty and student-athletes. </p>
      <p>"The goal is to connect with the athletic department to make sure there is not tension in this process," he says. "We are all on the same page. We want our student-athletes to develop their gifts as athletes within an academic environment that promotes integrity and encourages success." </p>
      <p>Lynk, who has been at ASU since 2000, is a member of the Intercollegiate Athletics Advisory Board. He is also a member of the board's Academic Committee. As faculty athletics representative, Lynk will remain on the board. </p>
      <p>In the College of Law, Lynk teaches corporate law, civil procedure and professional responsibility and has written and lectured on federal civil procedure and federal election law compliance. He also is a faculty associate of ASU's Center for the Study of Law, Science and Technology and chairs the American Bar Association's Special Committee on Bioethics and the Law. </p>
      <p>Before joining ASU in 2000, Lynk taught at George Washington University and the University of Maryland School of Law and was a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of a national law firm, where he practiced in the areas of complex corporate transactions and commercial litigation. An elected member of the governing Council of the American Law Institute, Lynk received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1976. </p>
      <p>"Myles has been a tremendous asset to the university and he will be an excellent faculty representative," says Eugene Smith, ASU executive director of athletics. "We are looking forward to the association between ICA and Myles." </p>
      <p>Campbell, with Media Relations &amp; Public Information, can be reached at (480) 965-7209 or (garycamp@asu.edu). </p>
