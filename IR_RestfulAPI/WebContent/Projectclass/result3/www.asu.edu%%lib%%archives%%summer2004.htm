    <td><p>During the summer, the Center is open from 1 to 5 Monday-Friday, and
        by appointment. Following, are a few remarks excerpted from &#8220;Reflection
        Papers, written by students in History of Indian Education 410/510: </p>
      <p>&#8220;I felt very comfortable like there was a place where I can catch
        up with Native Americans across the country. I felt like I was back at
        home at one of the Native American museums.&#8221; - Sonia Bahe</p>
      <p>&#8220;. . .a great visit to see a room full of Native American Knowledge.&#8221; -
        Lalainia Harnell</p>
      <p>&#8220;The environment that was created in the Labriola gave one a sense
        of belonging and that I was important. The greatest value that I have
        for the Labriola is that I felt my tuition money is being well spent
        by the Hayden Library as it created this information center.&#8221; -
        O. Gruber</p>
      <p>&#8220;As an American Indian student I feel good knowing that ASU values
        research pertaining to American Indian issues. There is a large population
        of Native students attending ASU. I believe it is so important for them
        to know that their heritage is valued by this institution of higher learning.&#8221; -
        Shannon Manuelito</p>
      <p>&#8220;I did not expect to see so many Native American articles or for
        that matter, the art that decorated the walls. As a Native American woman
        I felt very honored and a strong sense of pride to see that there is
        a special area for Native American students in one specific location.
        I was very surprised and touched to see that the Labriola had language
    tapes that were of the Blackfoot/Blackfeet tribes.&#8221; - Cherie Pruneela</p></td>

  The Center is grateful to the many generous donors who help build our collections
  with one-of-a-kind material, and in this way support the educational mission
  of the University.
      <p>
  Dr. Scott White, who recently received his Ph.D. from ASUs History Department
  with the publication of his dissertation, &#8220;A History of the Poncas in
  Nebraska: A Struggle for Survival,&#8221; has donated audio tapes and transcripts
  of his interviews with the Ponca people. The Ponca Oral History Collection
  can be viewed online at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/ponca.htm">http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/ponca.htm</a>
      <p>
  The interviewees tell the story of suffering through a long history of military
  incursions, forced removal, termination, and ultimately restoration of recognition.</p>
      <p><font size="+1"><a name="VIDEO">Video Collection of Roland G. Tharp, Ph.D.</a></font><p>
  Dr. Tharp is Director of the Center for Research on Education, Diversity &amp; Excellence
  and Professor of Education and Psychology at the University of California,
  Santa Cruz, and has donated a valuable collection of educational research material.<p>
  The collection, containing some 600 video recordings, is actually two collections
  of research material resulting from well-known projects, KEEP/Navajo (Kamahamea
  Early Education Program) conducted at Rough Rock Demonstration School on the
  Navajo Reservation between 1983 and 1987, and CREDE/Zuni, conducted at Zuni
  School on the Zuni Reservation, New Mexico, between 1996 and 2001. <p>
  CREDE is a federally funded research and development program focused on improving
  education of students whose ability to reach their potential is challenged
  by language barriers, race, geographic location, or poverty. There are also
  a number of classrooms in California and Alaska operating by the CREDE Teaching
  Alive! Standards for Effective Pedagogy.<p>
  Dr. Tharp has compiled Five Standards of Effective Pedagogy. These are: 1)
  Teachers and students producing together; 2) Developing language and literacy
  across the curriculum; 3) Making lessons meaningful by connecting school to
  student lives; 4) Challenging activities to teach complex thinking; and 5)
  Instructional conversation: teaching through conversation and involving students
  in dialog. </p></td>

    <td><font size="+1"><a name="GILCREASE">The Gilcrease Story</a></font><p>
Back in March 2004, the Labriola Center received a surprise package from the
  Gilcrease museum in Tulsa, Oklahoma. That museum holds the largest collection
  of western art in the world, including works by Albert Bierstadt, Thomas Moran,
  Frederic Remington, Charles M. Russell, Charles Banks Wilson, and George Catlin. <p>
There are some noted non-western artists in the collection as well: James McNeil
Whistler; John Singer Sargent: Winslow Homer; John James Audubon; and more. A
visit to the museum is of course, a very special experience.<p>
The museum was named for Thomas Gilcrease, who acquired the collection over many
years. As a youngster, he lived with his family in the Creek Nation, Oklahoma.
Since his mother was a member of the Creek tribe, Gilcrease received his allotment
of 160 acres when the Federal Government distributed Indian lands into private
ownership at the turn of the century, As it turned out, oil was discovered on
those 160 acres and became one of Oklahoma&#8217;s major oil fields. Thus, Gilcrease
established an oil company bearing his name. About this time he began collecting
western art.</td>

  Catlin (1796-1872), was one of the earliest artists to record Native peoples

    book containing fifty watercolors painted by Catlin accompanied by his penned
    descriptions of the painting. </p>
      <p>
        The publication of this one-of-a-kind volume was made possible by benefactors
    Henry and Joanne Roath who viewed the original in the Gilcrease Museum Library
    and believed that this singular treasure should be made available in places
    where scholars, students, and collectors who are not able to visit Tulsa,
    can study
    the book.</p>
      <p>
        A special box has been ordered to house our new treasure. However, it
          is available to all researchers and students. Ask for E77.C38 2003
      Folio.</p>
      <p>
        This is also a good time to mention that the Center has purchased the
          complete works of George Catlin on CD-ROM, produced by the University
          of Cincinnati
    Digital Press. In addition, M<em>cKenny &amp; Hall&#8217;s History of the

        In 1936, the Oklahoma Historical Society teamed with the history department
            at the University of Oklahoma to obtain a Works Progress Administration
            (WPA)
  writers&#8217; project grant for an interview program. The project employed
  some 100 writers scattered across the state, with headquarters in Muskogee,
  where Grant Foreman served as project director. Foreman was a well-known historian
  with such publications as <em>Advancing the Frontier</em>; <em>Indian Removal:
  Emigration of the Five Civilized Tribes</em>; <em>The Five Civilized Tribes: Cherokee, Chickasaw,
  Choctaw, <br>
Creek, Seminole.</em></p>
      <p>
        Asked to &#8220;call upon early settlers and record the story of the migration
to Oklahoma and their early life here,&#8221; the writers conducted more than
11,000 interviews, edited the accounts into written form, and sent them to the
project director who completed the editorial process into more than 45,000 pages.
These are reproduced on some 40 reels of microfilm, which is in the Labriola
Collection under call number FILM 9958. Reels #38 and 39 contain a name/subject
index, and reel #40 is addenda to the collection. </p>

      <td>There are three distinct groups of Maidan-speaking people in California:
        Maidu or Mountain Maidu; the Konkow or Northwestern Maidu; and the Nisenan
        or Southern Maidu. Though the languages were all derived from the Penutian
        family, there were also some twenty dialects. 
        <p>
These stories of the Mountain Maidu were first written down some one hundred
years ago by a Harvard anthropologist, Roland Dixon, under the direction of Alfred
Kroeber at the University of California, Berkeley. Dixon&#8217;s informant was
the tribe&#8217;s last great storyteller, H&aacute;nc &#8216;ibyjim, and he wrote
down the stories word for word - there were no recording devices at that time. <br>
In 1954, William Shipley, also a Berkeley grad student in linguistics, lived
with the Maidu to learn the language and he compiled a grammar which ultimately
became his dissertation.<p>
In 1991, Shipley published an English translation of the myths, <em>The Maidu
Indian
Myths and Stories of H&aacute;nc &#8216;ibyjim</em>, where he wrote &#8220;What I
would hope from this book is that it bring home to its readers at least a sense
of the Maidu as real people-interesting, vital, sexy, full of fantasies and dreams-in
short, like people everywhere. . .(Heyday Books, 1991, p. 4).<p>
Now, the Center has the first two spectacular volumes with the texts in both
English and the original Maidu by William Shipley: <em>The Creation as the Maidu
Told It = P&uacute;ktim</em> (Volume I, 2002) and <em>The Adversaries = Hompajtotokycom</em>(Volume 2, 2003). Santa Cruz artist, Daniel Stolpe&#8217; magnificent woodcuts
grace the first volume, while his hand-pulled lithographs illustrate the second.
<p>
Published in an edition of 65 numbered and signed copies, the books are printed
in Weiss Roman and Doulos linguistic fonts on Arches Cover White by Peter Koch,
Berkeley. Full linen, hand sewn binding with cover paste down by Taurus bindery,
San Francisco. <p></p>They were purchased with funds from the Frank &amp; Mary Labriola
endowment.
