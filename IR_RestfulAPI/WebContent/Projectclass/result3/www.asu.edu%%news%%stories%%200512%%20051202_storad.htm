<h1 class="storyhead">Storad's book plays integral role in governor's literacy project </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p><img src="200512_images/20051202conrad.jpg" width="250" height="167" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">A room full of rowdy, noisy first-graders can be an intimidating situation for most people, but not for Conrad Storad. With a nearly 15-year history of writing and reading children&rsquo;s books, he calmly strides into a first-grade classroom with his book in one hand and a colorful puppet on the other.</p>
<p>The room becomes silent &ndash; and a sea of young, curious faces peer at Storad admirably. As a local &ldquo;celebrity&rdquo; among Arizona&rsquo;s children, Storad immediately grabs the crowd&rsquo;s attention and begins a story &ndash; not just a typical fantasy story, but a real story.</p>
<p>Storad has a knack for explaining the facts. For nearly 20 years, Storad has been the director of research publications at ASU, serving as the editor of nationally award-winning <em> ASU Research Magazine</em> and the founding editor of <em> Chain Reaction,</em> a science magazine for younger readers.</p>
<p>In addition to his responsibilities at ASU, Storad has written 17 children&rsquo;s books, some of them coloring books, nonfiction books and what he likes to call &ldquo;fun nonfiction&rdquo; or picture books. With a lifelong fascination for science and nature, Storad says it can be a complex subject to learn, so he tries to teach youths about science with visually stimulating books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be a scientist &ndash; an oceanographer, to be exact,&rdquo; Storad says. &ldquo;But writing opened doors for me that I never expected, and I blended the two disciplines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After receiving a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in mass media communication from University of Akron in 1979, Storad served as a science writer for the National Cancer Institute at Kent State University. He relocated to Arizona in 1982, obtained a master&rsquo;s degree from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication and became editor of <em> ASU Research Magazine</em> in 1986. Soon thereafter, a close friend approached Storad to write a children&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Initially I thought, &lsquo;No way! I can&rsquo;t write a children&rsquo;s book.&rsquo; But as I thought about it more, it sounded like a new and different experience, so I tried it,&rdquo; Storad recalls. &ldquo;Writing for children really challenges you as a writer. You need to polish the story and make every sentence sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Storad says he contemplated all possible topics for his first book, including exotic creatures and unusual plants, but he finally decided on a familiar desert plant: the Saguaro cactus. In 1992, after several story revisions, Storad published his first nonfiction children&rsquo;s book, titled &ldquo;Saguaro Cactus,&rdquo; which teaches students about Arizona&rsquo;s unique, native plant. </p>
<p>Since it can be difficult to engage children long enough to read a book cover to cover, Storad&rsquo;s books have a few important elements to keep children engaged in the story: vivid illustrations, simple explanations and rhyme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Books have to compete with many things for a child&rsquo;s attention,&rdquo; Storad says. &ldquo;Every word and sentence must be interesting, or the book is short-lived in the child&rsquo;s mind. Kids want the real story, not so much fantasy. But, they want the real story in a fun way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="200512_images/20051202conrad-books.jpg" width="250" height="179" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">After rave reviews on the first book, the requests began to roll in, one after another. Storad continued writing nonfiction books and was soon approached to write a picture book. He spent a year writing the most popular of his books, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Call Me Pig! (A Javelina Story),&rdquo; which depicts a javelina&rsquo;s life in the desert. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Call Me Pig,&rdquo; published in 1999, took Storad to the next level as a children&rsquo;s author. In 2001, Storad was named the Arizona Children&rsquo;s Author of the Year by the Arizona Library Association, and the book itself was awarded the Arizona Children&rsquo;s Book of the Year by the Arizona Book Publishing Association.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most notable achievements for Storad occurred in November, when &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Call Me Pig&rdquo; was chosen by Gov. Janet Napolitano as <em> the</em> book to read. As part of the governor&rsquo;s commitment to improve literacy in Arizona, she provides a free book to every first-grader in the state. In her third year of this promise, Napolitano selected Storad&rsquo;s javelina tale as this year&rsquo;s book to distribute to Arizona&rsquo;s 90,000 first-grade students.</p>
<p>At a book reading at Galveston Elementary School in Chandler on Nov. 17, Storad observed as Napolitano read his book to 150 first-graders, who all knew the book and happily screamed aloud, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Call Me Pig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the book reading, the governor actually introduced me to the crowd &ndash; which was, in a simple term, awesome,&rdquo; Storad says. &ldquo;How many times does that happen in a lifetime? I was absolutely honored to the core.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Storad spent his time writing children&rsquo;s books, he says the &ldquo;hobby&rdquo; has helped him excel at ASU. Through his relationships with teachers and librarians, Storad recognized a need for a quality, informative science magazine for young readers. Thus, Storad received the financial backing to create <em> Chain Reaction</em> in 1999, which covers science, learning and creative activity taking place at ASU.</p>
<p><em> &ldquo;Chain Reaction</em> is a great example of ASU being an integral part of the community,&rdquo; Storad says. &ldquo;Since the late &rsquo;90s, ASU&rsquo;s research publications have appeared in Arizona&rsquo;s classrooms from kindergarten to high school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the past 10 years, Storad has visited more than 500 schools, reading his books to more than half a million children. When asked what he is trying to accomplish with his books, Storad smiles and says, &ldquo;I just want to tell fun stories about real things. I want to create awareness of what&rsquo;s around us and teach kids to respect it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Storad is working on a few upcoming books that will cover such topics as the earth&rsquo;s crust, fossil fuels, meerkats and pack rats. His newest book, &ldquo;Life In The Slow Lane (A Desert Tortoise Tale),&rdquo; hits bookstores and libraries in December.</p>
