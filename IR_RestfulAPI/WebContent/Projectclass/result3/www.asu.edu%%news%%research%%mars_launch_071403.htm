      <h2>Opportunity launch presents anticipation for ASU, NASA</h2>
      <p>        On June 28, 40 minutes before the projected midnight launch of Opportunity,
          the second Mars Exploration Rover that NASA plans to land on Mars early
          next year, mission scientist Philip Christensen was in a kitchen at
          a rented condo at Cape Canaveral, Florida busily cutting and serving
      a counter full of pies to hungry fellow scientists.</p>
      <p>No, eating pie at
            midnight isn't a space launch tradition, just a matter of finding
        a way to cope with the tense minutes, hours and days of waiting
          for the launch. Christensen and his ASU colleague, mission scientist
          Jim Rice, were among a hundred or so people floating in and out of
        the room, passing the time until the much-anticipated launch. </p>
      <p>After a seemingly
          endless series of delays, the waiting paid off as Opportunity was launched
          at 11:18 p.m., (EDT) July 7, from Cape Canaveral Air Force
          Station, Fla. Flight controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
          in Pasadena, Calif., received a signal from the craft 83 minutes later
        that it was out of the Earth's orbit and was on course toward Mars.</p>
      <p>The
          launch of Opportunity is the culmination of years of work for many
        of the scientists involved, and their plans for future Mars study absolutely
          depend on everything going right at many stages during the six-month
          trip. Whether research careers will be made or not in the coming years
          requires that many difficult and technically complex hurdles be overcome,
          and the launch is the first big one. After that comes the trick of
        landing
        on a planet 70 million miles away.</p>
      <p>It's not just any launch. The rocket
          carrying Opportunity to Mars is a Delta II Heavy and this is the design's
          inaugural flight. Though the
          engineers are confident, nothing is certain in spaceflight, particularly
          when something is being done the first time. Before the craft was finally
          sent into space there have been problems - the launch was delayed for
          four days by cracks that have appeared in the rocket's skin and for
        an additional two days by a battery problem. </p>
      <p>Christensen is in charge of
          the lander's Mini Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES), a high-tech
          robotic geologist capable of identifying minerals
          at a distance. It's the culmination of a series of similar instruments
          he has developed, and may have the biggest science payoffs yet. The
        Opportunity lander, expected to reach the planet Jan. 24, is planned
        to explore a
          Mars site known as Meridiani Planum, where a previous Christensen instrument
          on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft identified big fields of specular
        hematite, a mineral that forms on Earth in the presence of water.</p>
      <p>The
          Opportunity launch follows the June 10 launch of its twin rover, "Spirit."
          As of July 7, Spirit had traveled 48 million miles. It is
            slated to reach Mars in early January and explore a giant crater
        halfway around
          the planet from Opportunity's landing site.</p>
