          <h2>Parents target inadequate education funds in survey </a></h2>
          <p>A statewide survey conducted to obtain Arizona parents&rsquo; opinions about pre-kindergarten through 12th-grade education in the state has revealed for the second straight year that parents view inadequate funding as the biggest challenge facing Arizona&rsquo;s public schools. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;The survey suggests that Arizona parents do not point to school-related polices and practices as the primary cause of low test scores and student dropout rates, but rather view home and family factors as more likely reasons for student academic difficulties,&rdquo; says David Garcia, assistant professor of educational leadership and policy studies and assistant director of the Education Policy Studies Laboratory at ASU. </p>
          <p> <img src="comm_images/AEPI.jpg" width="288" height="432" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right">The Arizona Education Policy Initiative (AEPI) is a collaboration of ASU, Northern Arizona University and the University of Arizona. AEPI is administered by the ASU Education Policy Studies Laboratory. Launched in September 2003, AEPI uses the expertise of faculty at Arizona&rsquo;s public universities to provide policy makers and the public with high-quality information about Arizona education policies and practices. </p>
          <p> The survey was conducted for AEPI by Garcia; Alex Molnar, an ASU professor of educational leadership and policy studies and director of the Education Policy Studies Laboratory; and Bruce Merrill, an ASU professor in the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism. </p>
          <p> The survey was administered via telephone in March to a random statewide sample of 398 Arizona parents, plus an additional statewide sample of 93 Hispanic parents with children attending public schools. Results were separated by Anglo and Hispanic parents, making it possible to compare differences in opinion between Arizona&rsquo;s two largest racial and ethnic groups. </p>
          <p> The results offer a broad glimpse of Arizona parents&rsquo; opinions in 2005 as provided in a report released this week titled &ldquo;Parent Attitudes about Education in Arizona: 2005.&rdquo; AEPI organized a panel discussion involving key Arizona education decision makers and stakeholders to coincide with the release of the survey findings. The activity took place May 2 at the Arizona State Capitol Building. </p>
          <p> The panelists included Tacy Ashby, deputy Superintendent of the Arizona Department of Education; Amy Besing of the Scottsdale Parent Council; Andrew Morrill of the Arizona Education Association; Janice Palmer of the Arizona School Boards Association; Pete Turner, superintendent of the Liberty Elementary School District; and Ann Kirkpatrick, District 2 representative. </p>
          <p> When asked to rate their schools, the Arizona parents surveyed exhibited a pattern consistent with parents nationally. The survey suggests that Arizona parents perceive the schools that their children attend more favorably than Arizona public schools in general, with more than three-fourths of the respondents grading the school their oldest child attends an &ldquo;A&rdquo; or a &ldquo;B&rdquo;, while 39 percent of those surveyed graded all Arizona public schools an &ldquo;A&rdquo; or a &ldquo;B&rdquo;. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;The majority of parents continue to oppose private school vouchers, perhaps because they do not regard vouchers as a means of improving public schools,&rdquo; Molnar says. </p>
          <p> This conclusion is supported by the finding that a considerably larger percentage of parents this year expressed the belief that providing public dollars to private schools will have a negative effect on public schools. Support for tuition tax credits, however, has increased compared to last year. </p>
          <p> The survey report and the technical appendices, which contain the survey methods, survey questions, and technical information about the tables in the report, are available on the Education Policy Studies Laboratory Web site at (<a href="http://www.asu.edu/educ/epsl/AEPI/AEPI_2005_annual_survey.htm">www.asu.edu/educ/epsl/AEPI/AEPI_2005_annual_survey.htm</a>). </p>
