                <p><strong>HST-200: The Atlantic World: The Age of Piracy<br>
                </strong><strong>Dr. R. Burg<br>
                </strong><strong>INTERNET </strong></p>
                <p>This class is designed for students who are self-motivated and able to work on their own. There are numerous required readings, and in addition to these materials, students will be expected delve into the unparalleled richness of the World-Wide Web to examine articles, documents, and controversies relevant to the period under study. In addition to websites, you may also use any books, articles, library resources, and whatever other materials you select to complete the modular assignments. Over the semester, you will come to understand more than simply what occurred in the Atlantic world and the Caribbean during the seventy-five years from the time the first buccaneers established themselves on Hispaniola to final suppression of piracy in the western Atlantic and the Caribbean in the 1720s. When you have completed HST-200, you will have a deeper and more complete understanding of the forces and processes that created and directed, and ultimately destroyed piracy of the sort practiced by men such as Henry Morgan, Blackbeard, Long Ben Avery, and Bartholomew Roberts.<br>

                <p>(Im)Migrants have always shaped and altered societal trajectories and demanded recognition. The course will look at immigrants' encounters with receiving societies and their social, political and cultural negotiations. Ethnic communities provided the framework for institution building and identity construction, they also function as a stepping stone to move beyond. Because community formation is a complex process and a historically contested issue, it is also a useful concept to historical &quot;tools.&quot; It will introduce a broad range of sources as well as the various historical theories and methods (cultural vs. social historical analysis, quantitative methods, oral history, &quot;classical&quot; hermeneutics, construction and deconstruction). The course will focus on U.S. , Canadian and European experiences, questioning the old vs. new immigration country paradigm and U.S. exceptionalism.</p>

                <p><strong>HST 300: Japan and the World<br>
                </strong><strong>Dr. Ian Miller<br>
                </strong><strong>TTh 10:40-11:55<br>
                </strong><strong>SLN 16801 </strong></p>
                <p>On July 8, 1853, Commodore Matthew C. Perry steamed into Japan 's Edo Bay with a squadron of four heavily armed United States Navy warships. Two were the so-called ?black ships,? ominously painted, coal-burning steamships of the latest design. There, anchored close to the poorly defended capital's port and within view of a stunned populace, Perry issued an ultimatum: open the country to trade or face unstoppable bombardment. Thus began Japan 's modern engagement with the outside world, a new chapter in the broader encounter between ?East? and ?West.? For the US , the visit signified a victory in an international contest for diplomatic, political, and economic superiority in the Pacific. For Japan , Perry's black ships ended an age of feudal isolationism, heralding what some have called the ?dawn to the West.?</p>
                <p>This version of HST 300 introduces students to the discipline through modern Japan 's history of cultural and international encounter. You will learn how to evaluate source materials, using them to craft your own approach to the analysis of the past. This is a writing-intensive course and you will be asked to hone your writing and research skills through a series of exercises culminating in a final paper.<br>

                <p><strong>HST 300: THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION<br>
                </strong><strong>Dr. Laurie Manchester<br>
                </strong><strong>MW 1:40-2:55, EDB 212<br>
                </strong><strong>SLN 39119 </strong></p>
                <p>T he Russian Revolution ushered into power the world's first totalitarian dictatorship. In terms of both its breadth and its extremity, it is considered by many to be the greatest revolution in history. The Marxist revolutionaries who came to power in October 1917 ruled Soviet Russia until 1991, initiating a Cold War that divided the world into communist and capitalist spheres of influence for most of the 20th century. Domestically the Russian revolution was responsible for the most profound social upheavals to have ever occurred on a single geographic territory within a short period of time. Because of the scope of its influence, the Russian revolution has received a great deal of attention and has been the subject of great controversy. In this course we will read excerpts from the major debates that have erupted between historians over the Revolution, examine how Russian filmmakers, poets and artists have depicted it over the decades, and survey a wide variety of primary sources, including memoirs, diaries, letters, folkart, political treatises and translations of newly released archival documents such as peasant petitions and secret police reports. By examining different interpretations of the Russian Revolution, as well as primary sources, this course will introduce you to historical methodology by encouraging you to challenge the assumptions that other historians make about the event's origins, outcome, and significance, while also asking you to develop your own interpretations and analysis through the writing of numerous papers.<br>

                <p><strong>HST 302: The Western Medical Tradition<br>
                </strong><strong>Dr. Monica Green<br>
                </strong><strong>TTh, 1:40-2:55, ARCH 321<br>

                <p>Recent scares over anthrax, smallpox, ?emerging diseases? like avian flu, and drug-resistant strains of common microbes have shaken the confidence in modern medicine that reigned throughout most of the 20th century. We are now perhaps better able to appreciate the fact that disease and attempts to relieve suffering from disease have been and will always be part of the human condition. The manner in which individuals have suffered, however, and the ways in which societies have organized medical knowledge and care have always been in flux. This course will trace the many manifestations of the western medical enterprise?that nexus of theory, therapeutics, and social organization?from the time of the ancient Greeks up through the beginning of the 21st century when ?western medicine? is no longer the property of just the West but of the whole world.<br>

                <p>This course will focus on reading Confucian texts from the 11th and 12th centuries in the literary and colloquial Chinese of the era. Primary attention will be given to Zhu Xi, who is widely credited with reconfiguring and systematizing Confucian traditions so effectively that his version of Confucianism became the basis for intellectual and state orthodoxy in China until the 20th century.<br>

                <p>?The Civil Rights Movement? examines the African American struggle for civil and human rights in American from the end of World War II (1946), to the present. Although this course will focus primarily of the black freedom struggle in the United States , it will also connect this struggle for justice and equality to similar movements, both domestic and foreign, that were influenced by America 's black freedom struggle (i.e. the Chicano Movement, the Native American Movement, the Feminist Movement, and Anti-colonial movements in Africa , etc.). In doing so, this course will closely examine the transformation and transitions of African Americans and emphasizes their creation of a unique culture of struggle and resistance as they sought to give meaning to freedom. Students will analyze the Civil Rights Movement by exploring challenges to the nation's ?separate-but-equal' doctrine, ?Jim Crow,? disfranchisement, political marginalization, and economic exploitation.<br>

                <p>Origins of Civil Rights: From Slavery to Segregation treats the historical development of civil rights in U.S. law as it emerged to consider what, if any, personal characteristics control the legal relation of an individual to others and to the community at large. Many commentators and historians trace the law as emerging in blacks' general emancipation from slavery at the time of the Civil War (1861-1865). They especially see civil rights concepts developing from the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that in December 1865 outlawed ?slavery? and ?involuntary servitude?. Such attention provokes questions about personal status within the United States , about the role of personal characteristics in determining status, about the character of the nation as a social community and as a community constituted by the rule of law, and about the character of law and character of government. </p>
                <p>The course focuses on the years between the U.S. Supreme Court's 1857 decision in Scott v. Sanford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, in which Chief Justice Roger B. Taney declared that blacks in the United States had ?no rights which the white man was bound to respect,? and its 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, which sanctioned racial segregation. Such a focus demands attention to the contours of legal theories and constitutional doctrines relating to race and rights. It requires attention to changing and diverse issues and questions within the historical development of public policy related to &quot;legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group,&quot; as U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo L. Black put it in Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 216 (1944). The basic text is Thomas J. Davis's Origins of Civil Rights ? From Slavery to Segregation: Documents and Commentary on U.S. Law, available in the ASU College of Law copy center on the first day of the semester. <br>
