        Competitive Advantage and Economic Growth in Arizona:<br>
        Strategic Investments in Bio, Info and Nano Technologies <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></h2>
      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Body" --> 
      <p> <span class="underline"><strong>Overview</strong></span><br>
        Arizona&#8217;s most effective route for creating new and high value economic 
        opportunity for its citizens is through increasing the research and innovative 
        capacity of its universities. The future will belong to those regions 
        that have strong knowledge-based economies, built on the success of their 
        universities as knowledge producers. </p>
      <p>Arizona State University, therefore, requests a catalytic investment 
        in new facilities to enhance our ability to produce world-class research 
        in science and technology. Developing such new capabilities will provide 
        a high and sustained rate of return to the State&#8217;s economy and contribute 
        to the creation of entire new industries.</p>
      <p class="underline"><strong>The value of research and development infrastructure</strong></p>
      <p>Research capacity building in science and technology is the most critical 
        factor in deciding the economic fate of regional economies [Milken Institute, 
        October 1, 2002]. Universities in particular have unique roles as knowledge 
        producers. The emergence of Arizona State</p>
      <p>University as a research engine, intellectual property generator, and 
        innovative force in the life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering 
        is fundamental to the State&#8217;s ultimate ability to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Diversify and balance its economy </li>
        <li> Create a broader tax base and a more vibrant business and economic 
          climate</li>
        <li> Attract and create more jobs in high-wage sectors</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our competitor states are making, and have made, very substantial investments 
        to increase the research capacity of their systems of higher education. 
        Arizona&#8217;s choice is simple &#8212; invest or get left behind in 
        the competition for economic prosperity.</p>
      <p class="underline"><strong>Provide broad benefits</strong></p>
      <p>Investment now will provide broad benefits. New knowledge creation and 
        discovery will push innovation into the private sector in Greater Phoenix 
        and throughout the State, anchor the creation of new economic clusters 
        and enhance the competitiveness of existing clusters by: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Providing a robust, skilled and technically literate workforce at 
          all levels.<br>
          There is ample evidence that workers with higher levels of formal education 
          are able to earn consistently higher wages. ASU engages the needs of 
          its community, providing programs to meet the increasingly high-demand 
          for higher education in all sectors of the economy. </li>
        <li> Providing opportunities to partner with government and business to 
          grow, retain and attract companies for Arizona.<br>
          ASU provides the strong educational and research base that the business 
          community recognizes as necessary for the continued success of established 
          and emerging industries. Educational institutions are a strong draw 
          for knowledge intensive, high wage industries and a catalyst for new 
          ventures&#8212;both spinoffs generated by university research and new 
          companies attracted by access to ASU&#8217;s research capacity.</li>
        <li> Engaging in partnership ventures with other innovators.<br>
          Through ASU&#8217;s work with TGen, and with our sister institutions, 
          we are building a path to continued economic success and increased resiliency 
          in Arizona&#8217;s economy.</li>
        <li> Creating a new research and technology base for the region&#8217;s 
          economic identity.<br>
          Research universities are integral to the success of economic centers, 
          providing the base of cutting edge knowledge and expertise that workers, 
          companies and industries seek. ASU&#8217;s research strengths can help 
          to enhance the visibility and impact of metro Phoenix.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="underline"><strong>Accelerate success</strong></p>
      <p>Our investments over the past decade have increased the monetary value 
        of ASU&#8217;s research funding portfolio from $47 million to $114 million. 
        Our research portfolio growth is accelerating, with annual growth rates 
        of 18% per year in each of the last two years. </p>
      <p>Remarkably, ASU has achieved this success without benefit of substantial 
        new additional research space (the last research building to come on line 
        was the Goldwater Center in 1993). </p>
      <p>ASU&#8217;s phenomenal growth has not been coupled with substantial capital 
        investment. Unfortunately this places ASU&#8217;s continued success and 
        strong new research initiatives at risk.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The most recent annual Arizona Board of Regents space management 
          and utilization report identified ASU&#8217;s current research laboratory 
          space deficiency in life and physical sciences and engineering in excess 
          of 400,000 net assignable square feet. </li>
        <li> Conservative projections point to a shortage of at least 600,000 
          square feet by 2004. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is clear that reprogramming of existing space alone is not an option. 
        The shortfalls are too great, and the Bio:Nano:Info initiatives that will 
        be most beneficial to ASU and to Arizona as a whole require a new kind 
        of space &#8211; facilities and environments that foster open-exchange, 
        collaboration, interdisciplinarity, and entrepreneurism. </p>
      <p>A strategic investment in new research space will enable ASU to build 
        on our successes and on our strong base of interdisciplinary science and 
        engineering research excellence in three signature areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Biotechnology, including biomedical engineering, genomics, vaccines, 
          and plant biology,</li>
        <li> Nanotechnology, including nanoelectronic devices, single molecule 
          biophysics, and nano-biological interfaces, and</li>
        <li> Information Technology, including embedded systems for internetworking 
          applications, wireless communications, and network development.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These rapidly moving transcendent technologies promise to drive vibrant 
        economic growth, and through innovation and convergence, dramatically 
        improve our quality of life. </p>
      <p>A strategic investment in research infrastructure will enable ASU to 
        intensify our efforts, and reap great returns for the state of Arizona. 
        ASU is, therefore, requesting a $14 million investment from the state 
        that will enable $185 million in construction spending. This investment 
        will provide dramatic, sustainable and documentable economic benefits. 
      </p>
      <p class="underline"><strong>Economic benefits</strong></p>
      <p><span class="underline"><em>Immediate benefits </em></span><br>
        Immediate benefits will arise directly from the building construction 
        activity. The $185 million in construction spending will create approximately 
        3,000 jobs (person years). The economic multiplier for such large-scale 
        construction is significant. This investment will yield $330 million in 
        total immediate, local economic impact. The investment will also generate 
        a total of about $15 million in tax revenue:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> $10.2 million in state taxes</li>
        <li> $2.3 million in county taxes </li>
        <li> $2.3 million in city taxes </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="underline"><em>Medium-term benefits</em></span><br>
        In the immediate term this new space will enhance ASU&#8217;s capability 
        to attract and conduct new research conservatively estimated at $50 million 
        per year (new external funding from federal, industry and private foundation 
        sources). </p>
      <p>Evidence suggests that $1 of expenditures creates $5 to $7 of regional 
        economic activity. Therefore this additional $50 million will yield a 
        minimum <strong>$250 million per year return</strong> on the $14 million 
        annual investment required to create this economic chain reaction. </p>
      <p><span class="underline"><em>Long-term benefits</em></span><br>
        Finally, there will be long term value. Arizona can reasonably anticipate 
        that a host of new companies-- and perhaps entire new industry clusters--will 
        be created by intellectual property and technological innovations developed 
        within these new ASU facilities. ASU is rated a &#8220;top ten&#8221; 
        university in spinning off new startup companies (per total research expenditures). 
        The nature of such ventures makes ultimate economic return difficult to 
        predict, but it is reasonable to conservatively assume a direct <strong>additional 
        economic impact of $25 million per year</strong>. </p>
      <p>In order to effectively leverage ASU&#8217;s growing portfolio of federal 
        and private research Arizona must invest in substantial, additional high 
        quality multidisciplinary research space. The additional capacity will 
        have a profound multiplier effect on economic development in Arizona. 
      </p>
      <p>Scientific research and technological innovation take place in a fast-paced, 
        globally competitive environment. Arizona and ASU face a very real shortage 
        of the infrastructure to support such research, and are threatened with 
        a huge opportunity cost if we do not invest now in the implementation 
        of the following capital projects: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> $60 million for construction of AZBiodesign Institute Phase II. This 
          facility will be integrated with the $69 million Phase I building now 
          under construction to complete the AZBiodesign Institute and the biotechnology 
          corridor along the new eastern gateway to the University. The Institute 
          will provide space to enable interdisciplinary use-inspired research 
          in biologics, therapeutics, and integrated nano-bio systems. </li>
        <li> $53 million for construction of a building for the newly created 
          School of Life Sciences that will provide interdisciplinary research 
          and instructional space for biology, microbiology and plant biology. 
          A suite of creative learning and discovery environments incorporated 
          in the facility will promote development of the knowledge and skills 
          needed by life scientists in the 21st century. </li>
        <li> $35 million for construction of an Information Science and Engineering 
          Center (ISEC) building. This interdisciplinary facility will provide 
          an environment where our rapidly growing hardware and software information 
          technology capabilities can flourish and converge. The Center will enable 
          ASU to create novel embedded technologies with exciting new applications, 
          including wireless networks of distributed sensors for the environment 
          and assistive-living smart rooms for the handicapped. </li>
        <li> $13 million for construction of a Nanotechnology and High Tech Materials 
          building that will include an 8000 square foot joint-use cleanroom facility. 
          When fully operational, this state-of-the-art facility will enable fabrication 
          and testing of a wide range of nano-scale devices and systems by the 
          entire ASU research community, including those in the AZBiodesign Institute 
          and the ISEC. </li>
        <li> $14 million for ASU West for construction of a research center and 
          integrated learning environments to explore information science and 
          technology-driven cross-dimensional issues embedded in growing metroplexes 
          like Phoenix, including for example the role of technology in enhancing 
          K-12 education, and geographic information systems to address urban 
          development issues.</li>
        <li> $10 million for ASU East for construction of an Applied Biological 
          Sciences Research Complex including a research building to facilitate 
          collaboration with researchers in the AZBiodesign Institute, and a Health 
          Sciences Center to provide the infrastructure for a Healthy Lifestyles 
          Institute. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="underline"><strong>Step up to the plate and compete</strong></p>
      <p>Long term economic growth and prosperity, like proverbial &#8220;good 
        fortune,&#8221; favors the prepared. Many other states, in spite of the 
        current economic cycle and their own financial difficulties, are finding 
        it wise to strategically invest in biotechnology, information technology 
        and nanotechnology arenas. For example, in early 2001, <strong>California</strong> 
        announced a commitment to invest $300 million over four years to create 
        the following three multi-university research institutes: The California 
        Institute for Bioengineering, The California Nanosystems Institute, and 
        the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology. 
        In October 2002, <strong>Illinois</strong> announced $123 million in new 
        investment to build a Post Genomic Institute, a National Center for Supercomputing 
        Applications, and a Micro/Nanotechnology Laboratory at the University 
        of Illinois. In September 2002, <strong>New York</strong> announced a 
        $50 million capital investment for a Center for Excellence in Cancer Genomics 
        at SUNY-Albany and a Center for Bioengineering and Medicine at RPI; a 
        separate earlier investment of $400 million has been committed to create 
        a Microchip R&amp;D facility at SUNY-Albany. Within the last year, <strong>North 
        Carolina</strong> has funded almost $600 million in research infrastructure 
        with state-financed bonds, including broad-based commitment to biotechnology-related 
        projects across the state and a new Nanotechnology R&amp;D building at 
        NC State University. In the face of this stiff competition, it is paramount 
        that we invest now to strengthen our capacity if we are to assume a leadership 
        position.</p>
      <p class="underline"><strong>Build for the future</strong></p>
      <p>The national economy is in transition. However, science and engineering 
        innovation are accelerating and will certainly drive the next period of 
        economic expansion. Arizona is positioned to become a world leader in 
        science and technology and can substantially grow its economy by achieving 
        this status. However, we are currently at a crossroads where this leadership 
        position can be accomplished only if strategic investments are made to 
        build the research and development infrastructure of our state&#8217;s 
        universities. A modest, yet fundamental investment of $14 million per 
        year will enable Arizona not only to maintain but to enhance its competitiveness, 
        grow its economy, and assume a national leadership role in science and 
        the technologies of the 21st century. <br>
