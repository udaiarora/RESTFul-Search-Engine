      <h2>Indonesian gamelan finds home at ASU</h2>
      <p>Ted Solis, ethnomusicology professor in the Katherine K. Herberger College
        of Fine Arts School of Music, spent spring semester unwrapping packages
        of instruments and then spreading them out on every available flat surface.
        Individually, the instruments were impressive by their total number.
        Now assembled, they have become something much more to behold - a traditional
        Indonesian gamelan.</p>
      <p><img src="arts_images/gamelan.jpg" width="288" height="187" align="right">Sometimes incorrectly referred to as a single instrument,
          a gamelan is actually a percussion orchestra that is used in both traditional
          Indonesian
          and Balinese dance and theater. The gamelan orchestra that Solis set
          up is from Central Java and was associated with court dances. It was
          brought to the U.S. by a musicologist at the University of Illinois
        17 years ago and was recently purchased by the ASU School of Music. </p>
      <p>"The
          gamelan produces an endlessly challenging, wonderful sound," Solis
        says. "All the instruments behave in their own way, but all the layers
          relate to a central theme or melody."</p>
      <p>In order for the gamelan to produce
          melodies, two sets of all the instruments are necessary: one provides
          the major key, the other set produces the
          minor one.</p>
      <p>A number of gamelan instruments, such as the various kinds
          of drums, are most prized when crafted of bronze. "Bronze drums are
        the best
            because the older they get, the better the tone," says Solis. A gamelan
            orchestra
            also includes glockenspiels, gongs, strings, sitars and flutes. Singers,
            both female and male, provide a vocal component. </p>
      <p>He explains that learning
          to play is an oral tradition, one learned by ear. </p>
      <p>"Learning to play the gamelan is available to anyone, although it
          takes years and years to become a master because there is an enormous
          amount
        to learn. It's much like learning a complex language."</p>
      <p>On sabbatical spring
          semester, Solis used the time to study the gamelan with trips to the
          University of Hawaii, Dartmouth College and Grinnell
          College to study with accomplished gamelan musicians. This fall, he
        is introducing the gamelan orchestra in a new ethnic ensemble course
        offered
        by the School of Music. </p>
      <p>"Teaching the gamelan provides a wide variety
          of skills for students, from simple to complex. There is something
        for everyone in the class.
        My goal is just to stay ahead of the students." </p>
      <p>Solis and his students
          will put what they have learned to use and will host an open house
        "Gamelan Taster," from 2 to 3:30 p.m., Oct. 22, in
          Gammage Auditorium room 206 as part of Southeast Asian Culture Week,
          Oct. 20 - Oct. 24. The event is sponsored by the Program for Southeast
        Asian Studies (PSEAS) and Students' Association for Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>Solis,
          who received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois, Urbana, has
        carried out field research in India, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Hawaii
          and the San Francisco Bay area. He is the director of the School of
        Music's Marimba Maderas de Comitan, which is a Mexican/Latin marimba
        ensemble.
          In addition to his current interest in the gamelan, Solis' research
        interests within the field of ethnomusicology include music/dance relationships,
          acculturation, the Caribbean, urban Hispanic American musics and diasporic
          relationships among musical traditions. His field recordings have been
          released by Original Music and Smithsonian/Folkways, and he has published
          in the Journal of the Society for Ethnomusicology, the World of Music
          and the Latin American Music Review. Solis is also one of the core
        faculty
        members in the PSEAS at ASU.</p>

          Arts, can be contacted at (480) 965-3587 or (mary.brennan@asu.edu).<br>
