<p><b><font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="5" color="#92BAE7">Q: When was your 
sorority founded and what do you stand for? </font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Lucida Sans Unicode" color="#AE9DFF">Theta Nu Xi 
Multicultural Sorority, Inc. was founded in 1997 on the campus of the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill by seven undergraduate women. Its mission is to 
promote leadership, multiculturalism, and self-improvement through academic 
excellence, involvement in and service to the campus and community, as well as 
being living examples of sisterhood across different races, cultures, religions, 
backgrounds, and lifestyles. Our five tenets are Scholarship, Leadership, 
Service, Multiculturalism, and Sisterhood. Every member pledges to uphold these 
tenets and all our activities revolve around these ideals. Since being founded 
in 1997, our phenomenal growth rate has been doubling our membership every year. 
In August of 1999, we founded our National Organization, ratified our National 
Constitution, and elected our first National Officers. We are currently engaged 
in several expansion projects.</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#92BAE7" size="5" face="Lucida Sans Unicode"><b>Q: Why do you 
call yourselves multicultural and what does that stand for? <br>
</b></font><br>
<b><font color="#AE9DFF" size="4" face="Lucida Sans Unicode">The seven original 
founders saw a need for a sorority that crossed the societal boundaries of race, 
religion, culture, and class. Although part of their vision included creating a 
sisterhood that physically exemplified the transcendence of those boundaries, 
their primary goal was to bring women together who believe in the ideal of 
multiculturalism and want to promote multiculturalism in their everyday lives. 
While other Greek organizations are and continue to grow more diverse, our 
organization explicitly seeks members with multicultural ideals and interests; 
we seek to use our sorority as a vehicle to educate the surrounding campus and 
community on issues of diversity. We recognize that diversity is not limited to 
race, and we are proud to say we have achieved a sisterhood which is quite 
diverse with respect to not only race, but religious heritage, geographic 
origin, socio-economic class, nationality, political ideology, and even choice 
of major and career. Ultimately, however, we call ourselves multicultural 
because the one belief we share is that there is inherent value in discovering, 
understanding, and appreciating all the ways in which people are different from 
each other. It is for this reason that we differentiate ourselves, in name and 
in purpose, from other greek organizations with the word &quot;Multicultural.&quot;</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#92BAE7" size="5" face="Lucida Sans Unicode"><b>Q: What is your 
pledge process like? <br>
</b></font><br>
<b><font color="#AE9DFF" size="4" face="Lucida Sans Unicode">Similar to other 
greek organizations, we keep our pledge and initiation rituals private. However, 
the Sorority has a standard intake procedure which includes informal rush 
events, general interest meetings, formal interest meetings, a rigorous 
application, an in-depth personal interview, and a period of intake during which 
the aspirants learn the key information about the organization and participate 
in activities designed to cultivate the lasting bonds of sisterhood. The process 
is designed to be flexible yet provide the women with the knowledge, skills, and 
support they will need to both contribute to the Sorority and cultivate 
themselves as leaders.</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#92BAE7" size="5" face="Lucida Sans Unicode"><b>Q: Why is your 
chapter size so small? </b></font><br>
<br>
<b><font color="#AE9DFF" size="4" face="Lucida Sans Unicode">Although our 
membership is growing steadily, we do not expect any college chapter to ever 
have more than thirty members, the approximate/average size currently being ten 
members. Our reason for maintaining a small membership is to preserve and 
enhance the experience of sisterhood we offer to each of our members. It is our 
belief that if the chapter grows too large, we will lose the overall closeness 
that each sister feels with every other sister, and the close personal 
friendships we currently have are integral to maintaining the quality and 
success of a diverse sisterhood.</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#92BAE7" size="5" face="Lucida Sans Unicode"><b>Q: What are your 
standards? </b></font><br>
<br>
<b><font color="#AE9DFF" size="4" face="Lucida Sans Unicode">Our National 
Organization requires that the members of each chapter: (a) maintain a 
semesterly and cumulative GPA of at least 2.5; (b) perform at least 24 hours of 
voluntary service per semester; (c) adhere to the Sorority's and host 
university's policies on hazing and the use of controlled substances; (d) pay 
semesterly dues; and (e) have a faculty or staff advisor. Standards are 
described in more detail in our National Constitution.</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#92BAE7" size="5" face="Lucida Sans Unicode"><b>Q: How does your 
National Organization operate? </b></font><br>
<b><font color="#AE9DFF" size="4" face="Lucida Sans Unicode"><br>
Every chapter and colony, on the undergraduate level and on the 
graduate/professional/alumnae level, reports to the National Organization twice 
a year. The National Organization has an annual convention, to which each 
chapter sends a proportionate number of delegates and at which the National 
Board of Officers is elected. The National Board is composed of a President, 
Vice-President (overseeing Expansion), Executive Director, and Treasurer. 
Together, they coordinate the operations of the Sorority and carry out other 
duties enumerated in the National Constitution.</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#92BAE7" size="5" face="Lucida Sans Unicode"><b>Q: If 
multicultural education is your goal, why have you chosen to be a greek 
organization? </b></font><br>
<br>
<b><font color="#AE9DFF" size="4" face="Lucida Sans Unicode">There are two 
reasons we have chosen to be a multicultural sorority instead of a multicultural 
student organization. The first is that we have a yearning to be in a sisterly 
relationship with people who significantly differ from us. The reason greek 
organizations have selective membership is because through their rituals and 
values they share something special with their brothers and sisters. We desire 
not only to experience this special relationship first-hand through sharing a 
sisterhood with diverse women, but also to show others that the ideal of 
sisterhood is truly ideal in this sense - that it can transcend the barriers 
which have historically kept women (and men) apart. The second reason is more 
practical and relates to the impact we desire to have on college campuses. 
Although much progress towards racial integration and cross-cultural interaction 
has been made on college campuses, for the most part the social aspect of 
college life has remain segregated, largely by choice. We believe that greeks 
play a central role in collegiate social life, and we think that one antidote to 
voluntary segregation is voluntary integration. We do not want to be 
misinterpreted as passing judgment on other groups, for we recognize that the 
natural gravitation towards those of one's kind has a value for some people. 
However, we would like to use our greek organization as a vehicle to encourage 
cross-cultural interaction on a social and voluntary level, and we believe that 
by doing so we will be contributing to the overall quality of campus life. We 
are very proud of the difference we have made so far on college campuses 
regarding cross-cultural social and educational interaction, and being a Greek 
organization has been crucial to our success.</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#92BAE7" size="5" face="Lucida Sans Unicode"><b>Q: How diverse 
is your membership? </b></font><br>
<br>
<b><font color="#AE9DFF" size="4" face="Lucida Sans Unicode">At its inception, 
Theta Nu Xi did not specifically strive to bring together a multicultural group 
of women - our goal was to bring together women who were &quot;multiculturally-minded&quot; 
- who shared the common goal of appreciating and learning from each others' 
differences. Our founders were united in 1997 not by their obvious racial 
differences, but by their internal desire to bring about a greater appreciation 
of diversity in their campus and community. <br>
As a result of questions from the press and from interested women, the Sorority 
undertook a survey in 2001 to determine how diverse the sisterhood had become. 
The Sorority conducted a poll with the first 75 women who had joined the 
organization. The results were outstanding! Simply by promoting 
multiculturalism, education, leadership, sisterhood, and service, Theta Nu Xi 
had achieved an extremely diverse membership. <br>
The sisters were diverse with respect to race, culture, religion, ethnicity, 
socio-economic background, nationality/language-spoken, politial views, 
geographic origin (both domestic and international), and even in the category of 
our academic majors. We found that while we still have a ways to go, we are 
significantly more diverse than the overall American population, and especially 
the American college population.</font></b></p>
