      <p align="left">The abolitionist movement gathered friends and allies  beginning in the early 1830s.&nbsp; This was  the first organized political movement in the United States in which blacks and  whites met in common cause.&nbsp;Abolitionism motivated&nbsp;a&nbsp;minute handful of&nbsp;whites to take great risks in behalf   of slaves.</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="images/torreyLG.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/torrey.jpg" alt="Rev. Charles T. Torrey" width="500" height="394" hspace="8" border="0" align="right" /></a>One of these was <strong>Rev.  Charles T. Torrey</strong> (1813-1846), a Massachusetts  minister who joined the practical work of abolitionist resistance. &nbsp;While living in York   County, Pennsylvania, just north  of the Maryland  border, Torrey helped operate the Underground Railroad and went south to assist  many fugitive slaves to freedom.&nbsp; In 1843  he took his last trip south and was arrested in Baltimore on charges of aiding slaves to  escape.&nbsp; He was sentenced to six years in  prison and sent to the Maryland  state penitentiary, where he contracted tuberculosis and died on May 9, 1846.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">During his imprisonment numerous efforts were made to obtain  Torrey&rsquo;s release.&nbsp; In Boston in August 1844, African American  citizens held a rally in Torrey&rsquo;s behalf.&nbsp;  They declared &ldquo;We call upon all the friends of the anti-slavery cause in  general, and on our colored friends every where in particular, to rally to the  aid of him who is now suffering in behalf of down-trodden humanity, and to make  use of his case to stir up fresh opposition in the public mind to the accursed  system of slavery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thousands attended  Torrey&rsquo;s funeral in Boston  two years later.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">Joseph Cammet Lovejoy (1805-1871), editor of <em>Memoir of Rev. Charles T. Torrey, who Died  in the Penitentiary of Maryland,  where he was Confined for Showing Mercy to the Poor</em> (Boston:  John P. Jewett, 1847), assembled Torrey&rsquo;s biography from his diaries and  writings.&nbsp; Joseph Lovejoy was the brother  of another abolitionist martyr, Elijah Lovejoy (1802-1837), an antislavery  newspaper publisher killed by a mob in Alton, Illinois, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Owen Lovejoy (1811-1864), a congressman from Illinois and Underground Railroad activist.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>William Still</strong> (1819 or 1821-1902) was one of the most famous Underground Railroad  operatives.&nbsp; His parents escaped from  slavery in Maryland and settled in rural Burlington County, New    Jersey.&nbsp; His  mother, Charity, was recaptured and escaped again, but without her two sons, who  were sold and sent to Alabama.&nbsp; Later, Still recorded how he interviewed a  fugitive in the Philadelphia  office of the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery and suddenly  realized he was speaking with his lost brother Peter.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left"><a href="images/stillrailroadLG.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/stillrailroad.jpg" alt="from The Underground Rail Road: A Record of Facts, Authentic Narratives, Records, &amp;c., Narrating the Hardships Hair-Breadth Escapes and Death Struggles of the Slaves, as Related by Themselves or Witnessed by the Author " width="400" height="276" hspace="8" border="0" align="left" /></a>During his career working for the Philadelphia Vigilance  Committee during the 1840s and 1850s, Still managed escape routes; provided  food, shelter, and clothing for fugitives; and arranged transportation  northwards with tickets and small sums of pocket money.&nbsp; He was essentially an underground social  worker for many hundreds, perhaps several thousand, fugitive ex-slaves.&nbsp; <em>The  Underground Rail Road: A Record of Facts, Authentic Narratives, Records,  &amp;c., Narrating the Hardships Hair-Breadth Escapes and Death Struggles of  the Slaves, as Related by Themselves or Witnessed by the Author</em> (Philadelphia: Porter &amp; Coates, 1872), an encyclopedia compendium based on  his secret archive of interview and personal notes, records the cases or names of  nearly 650 fugitives.&nbsp; In terms of number  of escapes assisted, Still and white abolitionist Isaac Hopper were the leading  Underground Railroad agents on the Atlantic seaboard.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Still, who owned a coal yard and real estate, was a  practical business-man.&nbsp; <em>The Underground Rail Road</em> was a  subscription volume.&nbsp; Still provided  sales agents with sample books and sent them to collect orders from African  American communities and white supporters of African American rights.&nbsp; In the 1870s Pennsylvania blacks were organizing to  obtain equal civil rights.&nbsp; One of the  implicit messages of Still&rsquo;s <em>Underground Rail Road</em> publishing project was that the achievements of the African American struggle  against slavery and its example of community unity could serve as an example  for present and future struggles for equality.</p>

    <td><h2 align="left" class="style20">RELIGIOUS ANTISLAVERY  LITERATURE</h2>
      <p align="left"><a href="images/cheeverLG.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/cheever.jpg" alt="God Against Slavery: and the Freedom and Duty of the Pulpit to Rebuke It, as a Sin Against God" width="307" height="500" hspace="8" border="0" align="right" /></a>Many antislavery texts emerged from religious traditions and  disputation.&nbsp; <strong>George Barrell Cheever</strong> (1807-1890) was a white clergyman and  well-known controversialist.&nbsp; A graduate  of Andover Seminary in 1830, he became minister of a Congregational Church in  Salem, Massachusetts, and then the editor of the <em>Evangelist</em> and a preacher in New York City.&nbsp; While a radical opponent of slavery, Cheever  differed from William Lloyd Garrison in being an antislavery constitutionalist  dedicated to preservation of the Union.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">Cheever published widely and <em>God Against Slavery: and the Freedom and Duty of the Pulpit to Rebuke  It, as a Sin Against God</em> (Cincinnati: American Reform Tract and Book  Society, 1857) reinforced his reputation as a passionate opponent of African  American slavery.&nbsp; He denounced slavery  in apocalyptic language:</p>
      <p align="left">&ldquo;The brand of ignominy which you put upon the slave, when  you call him a chattel, and treat him as such, is the brand burned deeper in  your bargain, in your complicity with robbery, in the immorality of your legal  title, than in his soul; and generation after generation cannot cover it up,  can not eliminate it; can not vulcanize it, but that the fires of the last day  itself will only bring out more clearly its essence of oppression and  iniquity.&rdquo; (113)</p>
      <p align="left">Cheever&rsquo;s use of apocalyptic ideas was increasingly typical  of religious antislavery rhetoric from the last decade prior to the Civil War.</p>
    <p align="left">This copy was owned by Alfred Stinson, a blacksmith in Thetford, Vermont,  who apparently loaned it out with the inner cover notation &lsquo;Return next  Sabbath.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Project acquired this copy  from Stinson&rsquo;s descendant.</p></td>

    <td><h2 align="left" class="style20">ANTISLAVERY TRACTS</h2>
      <p align="left"><strong><em><a href="images/antislaveryrecordLG.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/antislaveryrecord.jpg" alt="The Antislavery Record" width="307" height="500" hspace="8" border="0" align="left" /></a></em></strong>Tract literature drove the antislavery movement and created  an intense debate in the United    States over the nature and limits of free  speech.&nbsp; Postmasters in slave states  routinely confiscated antislavery journals and tracts mailed from the  north.&nbsp; Despite US constitutional First  Amendment guarantees, possession of these &lsquo;seditious&rsquo; materials was illegal in  some states.&nbsp; A few people were sent to  prison for having or receiving antislavery tracts.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong><em>The Antislavery Record</em></strong> was a monthly publication of the  American Anti-Slavery Society.&nbsp; Its July  1835 issue, exhibited here, contained articles on the fate of recaptured  fugitive slaves in New York City; the kidnapping  and sale of a young African American woman in Ohio;  arguments against the colonization movement that proposed sending African  Americans to Liberia;  reports on state and local abolitionist meetings; and a list of  contributors.&nbsp; Note that the tract is  cheaply printed but illustrated, and its small size enables it to be folded for  easy mailing.&nbsp; The sale of tracts  provided an important financial mainstay for the usually-impoverished  antislavery movement and its traveling speakers.</p>

    <p align="left">This tract, <em>Put Up Thy  Sword: A Discourse</em> (Boston: R.F. Wallcut, 1860), was a sermon Furness  delivered as a guest at the Music Hall, the popular site of Theodore Parker&rsquo;s  church-less ministry in Boston.&nbsp;At  the point Furness delivered the sermon in March 1860, the United States was  less than one year away from civil war and the probability of domestic conflict  was increasingly clear following John Brown&rsquo;s raid in October  1859.&nbsp;Furness responds to this growing division of northern and southern  opinion with a call both against slavery and against a violent fight over  slavery.&nbsp;</p></td>

      <p align="left">This commonplace book &ndash; a blank or printed book that is used  to paste clippings &ndash; was the property of George Russell, an anti-Garrisonian  abolitionist and the secretary of a local Massachusetts antislavery society.&nbsp; Russell used Moses Stuart&rsquo;s <em>Course of Hebrew Study</em> (Andover: Flagg  &amp; Gould, 1830) to paste in poetry from 1839-40 editions of the <em>Massachusetts Abolitionist</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hand-written annotations identify some of  the pseudonymous poets.&nbsp; Russell&rsquo;s choice  of an unused study text in biblical Hebrew speaks to the religious background  of many members of the antislavery movement.</p>

      <p align="left">One of the  Antislavery Literature Project&rsquo;s current efforts is to create a series of  antislavery comics to tell the history of African American struggles against  slavery.&nbsp; The sample comic here provides an interpretation of the  famous &lsquo;fight with Covey&rsquo; scene from Frederick Douglass&rsquo; 1845 narrative.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong><a href="images/Planche-3LG.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/Planche-3.jpg" alt="bosomba hissa nsoli" width="369" height="500" hspace="8" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>The artist, <strong>Bosomba Hissa Nsoli</strong>,  was born in 1964 in Mbadanka, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.&nbsp; Largely self-taught, he began by taking part  in a group of young artists who attended a film animation course. He studied  comics in 2000 in a workshop run by professional comic artists such as Barly  Baruti and Eric Warnauts. He became an illustrator and comic artist for  magazines such as <em>BleuBlanc</em> and <em>Afrique Avenir</em>. His work was selected  for the Matite africane exhibition (Bologna, 2002), and he obtained a Mention  in the 2003 Africa e Mediterraneo Award for his comic strip <em>P&eacute;nitence</em>, scenario by Patrick De  Meersman. He recently published <em>L'ile aux  oiseaux</em> (Lai-momo, 2006), a graphic novel dealing with African labor  migration to Europe.</p>      </td>
