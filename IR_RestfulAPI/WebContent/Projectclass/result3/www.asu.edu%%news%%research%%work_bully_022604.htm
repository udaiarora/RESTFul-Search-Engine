      <h2><strong>ASU researchers begin study of workplace bullying</strong></h2>
      <p>TEMPE, Ariz. - The schoolyard bully, long an icon during childhood, may be more than just a memory. Data suggest they exist in corporate life as well; doing basically the same thing a schoolyard bully might do, coercing others through intimidating behavior. But the dynamics of such workplace interactions are less understood than other social interactions. </p>
      <p>Now, three Arizona State University researchers are beginning the first detailed study in the U.S. to assess workplace bullying. The study -- which will include a survey, focus groups and interview sessions -- is designed to learn about the prevalence of such interactions, assess its effects and find out where in corporate America these interactions take place. </p>
      <p>"Workplace bullying is a repeated pattern of aggression and hostility directed at one or more persons over an extended period of time," said Sarah Tracy, an assistant professor in the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication at Arizona State. "This is different from other forms of harassment, like sexual harassment, in the workplace. It is not as well defined nor is it as well recognized as sexual harassment." </p>
      <p>But its effects can be significant. </p>
      <p>"The target of workplace bullying can eventually be made to feel alone and crazy," said Jess Alberts director of the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication. "Targets usually cannot function properly in this type of environment. They say they are unable to defend themselves and stop the abuse." </p>
      <p>Tracy and Alberts are working with Pamela Lutgen-Sandvik, a doctoral candidate, on the study. On March 1, they will launch the American Workplace Survey, a confidential Internet survey to assess such social interactions. The survey will continue until April 30. </p>
      <p>Concurrent with the survey, the researchers will conduct three focus groups of 12 people each to assess some of the effects of bullying in the workplace in an effort to understand its nuances. They also will conduct interviews of targets of workplace bullying to get a better understanding of the emotional effects resulting from this interaction. </p>
      <p>"We want to document the stories and experiences of the targets of bullying," Alberts explained. "We also want feedback from people who have witnessed workplace bullying and talk to family members of the target to understand how and why bullying occurs and how it may change the target's behavior." </p>
      <p>Other goals of the study are to learn more about the behaviors and communications tactics of those doing the bullying and those bullied; explore the workplace structures that encourage or "normalize" bullying behavior; and understand the "bleed over" effects of bullying on the organization in which it occurs and families it impacts. </p>
      <p>"Scandinavian and European countries have studied workplace bullying," Alberts added. "But no large, comprehensive study has been done in the U.S." </p>
      <p>The few U.S. studies that have been completed have yielded some interesting statistics, said Pam Lutgen-Sandvik. For example, 20 percent of Michigan workers surveyed reported experiencing five or more emotionally abusive behaviors at work; 25 percent of employees reported being harassed, threatened or physically attacked at work in the previous year; and more than 90 percent of nurses report experiencing verbal abuse, Lutgen-Sandvik said. </p>
      <p>The study is expected to be completed in May and the ASU researchers will present their findings at the Fourth International Conference on Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace in Bergen, Norway, in June. </p>
