    Colleges Mull Which Digital Records to Save and Which to Delete
</h2>

<p class="byline">By Florence Olsen</p>

<p class="dateline">Phoenix</p>

<p>University archivists and records managers are in a quandary as they work to
identify what types of electronic documents they should try to save and what
they can safely discard.</p>

<p>A poor decision could be costly, said Robert P. Spindler, the archivist at
Arizona State University, speaking at a conference here last week on preserving
electronic records.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken the most important litigation-defense resource we
have,&#8221; Mr. Spindler said, &#8220;and placed it on the Web&nbsp;&#8212;
the most ephemeral electronic environment man has ever known.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arizona State&#8217;s decision, in December 1996, to stop printing policy
manuals in favor of publishing them exclusively on the Web was premature, he
said. A year later, the institution had to take a step backward and resume
publishing on paper to comply with Arizona&#8217;s public-records law. The
reversal, he said, has forced university officials to start thinking about the
issues that have concerned archivists and records managers for at least a
decade.</p>

<p>The raw material of future scholarship&nbsp;&#8212; and
litigation&nbsp;&#8212; is being deleted at an alarming rate, according to
archivists at the conference, which was sponsored by Arizona State. One former
university archivist said the loss of electronic data could be compared to the
destruction of historic buildings. &#8220;How did we go from a culture that
tore down old buildings without even thinking about it to a culture that now
values historic preservation?&#8221; asked Helen W. Samuels, a special
assistant in the provost&#8217;s office at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.</p>

<p>Ms. Samuels likened her archivist colleagues to the leaders of the historic-preservation movement, and said archivists&nbsp;&#8212; like preservationists&nbsp;&#8212; must encourage changes &#8220;in people&#8217;s attitudes, the law, the tax structure&#8221; to halt the loss of institutional memory.</p>

<h3>&#8220;A Brave New World&#8221;</h3>

<p>Archivists and records managers now find themselves in a &#8220;brave new
world&#8220; in which institutions don&#8217;t know what digital records should
be kept, for how long and for whom, said Clifford A. Lynch, executive director
of the Coalition for Networked Information.</p>

<p>Mr. Lynch said the course catalogue&nbsp;&#8212; &#8220;a valuable window
into the way that higher education organizes knowledge&#8221;&nbsp;&#8212; is
being replaced at many universities by an electronic data base. Administrators,
he said, are concerned about how current the catalogue is and how easily
students can get access to it. &#8220;The notion of what happened to last
year&#8217;s data base, or should happen to it, isn&#8217;t even on their
agenda.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many professors who are now using electronic grade books for courses
overwrite the grades at the beginning of each semester, leaving no electronic
record that could be used in handling grievances, said Jeremy Rowe, the head of
media development at Arizona State&#8217;s information-technology division.</p>

<p>Web-based catalogues, electronic grade books, scholarly Web sites,
electronic mail, and research papers published on line are all &#8220;digital
objects&#8221; whose preservation and future accessibility institutions need to
think about when they design new information systems, Mr. Lynch said.</p>

<p>But both the technology and the policies for building these systems are
still in their infancy. &#8220;What does it really mean to archive a dynamic
object such as a Web page?&#8221; asked Mr. Lynch. &#8220;Do you make
snapshots, or traces of its evolutionary life, or something in
between?&#8221;</p>

<p>In particular, campus-technology officials have been trying to deal with the
records-management challenges posed by the growing use of encryption and
certification technologies. Those new technologies certify a person&#8217;s
identity and protect the privacy of individuals in digital transactions. But
what happens a hundred years from now to documents containing digital
signatures that were created with today&#8217;s privacy and certification
technology? Archivists worry that over a century of technological change, the
authority and readability of the old records might be compromised.</p>

<p>An archivist&#8217;s closest allies at a university are often
information-systems analysts and internal auditors, said Philip C. Bantin,
Indiana University&#8217;s archivist. Auditors and archivists have a shared
interest, he said, in the accuracy, reliability, and authenticity of
information. They also have similar interests in secure systems and in
complying with laws and policies.</p>

<p>Mr. Bantin said he teams up with the university&#8217;s auditors on key
audits when he has concerns about the preservation of electronic records.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve had tremendous problems just getting the attention of the
information managers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Working with the auditors gives us
an entree that we didn&#8217;t have before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hard lobbying &#8220;by enough people from enough quarters&#8221; will be
needed to pressure software companies into making campus information systems
with well-thought out records-management components, said Timothy J. McGovern,
a senior information-systems project manager at 
<acronym title="Massachussetts Institute of Technology">M.I.T.</acronym>
The ideal records-management system, he said, would preserve access to all
records&nbsp;&#8212; active and inactive, on line and off line, in all
media.</p>

<p>&#8220;We desperately need elecronic records-keeping systems,&#8221; said
David A. Wallace, an assistant professor of information at the University of
Michigan School of Information. &#8220;We&#8217;re now seeing the first
generation of these systems.&#8221; But within the next three to five years, he
said, &#8220;this is going to be a huge market, not just for e-mail but for all
kinds of electronic records.&#8221;</p>
