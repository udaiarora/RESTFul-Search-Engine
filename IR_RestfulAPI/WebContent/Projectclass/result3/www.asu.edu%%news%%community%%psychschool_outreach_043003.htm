      <h2>        ASU school psychology program launches new outreach venture with local
        schools</h2>
      <p>        The College of Education's School Psychology Program at ASU
        has launched an outreach venture in collaboration with local school districts
        to
          promote the advancement of school psychology as a science and a professional
        discipline.</p>
      <p>Conceptualized and developed primarily through the efforts
          of David Wodrich, associate professor of psychology in education, the
          School Psychology
          Sharing Program (SPSP) provides school-based psychologists with access
          to recent research findings, university-based psychologists with enhanced
          access to practice issues and students with multiple role models. It
          is a forum in which to investigate role definitions and practice methods,
          and a setting where experts from various disciplines can speak. </p>
      <p>"The
          challenge for school psychology training programs, such as ASU's, is
          to train true scientist-practitioners. This program strives to bring
          science and practice face-to-face," Wodrich said.</p>
      <p>Participants in the
          SPSP education programs include all interested members of the community.
          Program material, however, is specifically targeted
          to psychologists practicing in school districts in metropolitan Phoenix;
          school psychology trainers at ASU; school psychology students at ASU;
          and school psychology interns and post-doctoral students receiving
        training in metropolitan Phoenix.</p>
      <p>"As academics we have an obligation to share
          information with the community. As trainers of school psychologists
        we must assure that our students
          learn about issues that matter to practicing school psychologists and
          educators," Wodrich said. "The program was designed to offer something
          to the university, local educational and psychological, and student
        communities." </p>
      <p>"The School Psychology Sharing Program is an effort that is representative
          of my goals and those of ASU President Michael Crow," says College
        of Education Dean Eugene Garcia, "to ensure that the College of Education
          makes a difference in the lives of the citizens of Greater Phoenix
        and
          the state of Arizona through social engagement and community embeddedness
        of its people and programs."</p>
      <p>The initial program consists of semi-monthly,
          free, 90-minute professional issues presentations by members of one
        of the targeted school psychology
          constituent groups. "Programs emphasize interaction, informality, and
          mutual learning; their style is similar to the 'grand rounds' concept
          used in medical education," said Mary Stafford, associate professor
        of psychology in education with the College of Education. "This program
          is the first step in a long-term plan to create closer links between
        ASU's School Psychology Training Program and local, school-based professionals."</p>
      <p>ASU
          and the Tempe Elementary District are sponsoring the initial series
        of presentations jointly. Presentations are open to all members of the
          school psychology community: practitioners, students and trainers.
        These
          free programs consist of a 90-minute presentation, discussion and time
        for socializing. </p>
      <p>The first presentation, which focused on the uses of
          curriculum-based assessment for school psychologists, was conducted
        on March 27 by Jennifer
          Ostrom, a school psychologist with the Tempe Elementary School District.
          The series continued on April 10 with a presentation titled "Preschool
          evaluations: Issues of identification related to low incidence or health-related
          disorders." A third presentation scheduled for May 1 will explore the
          ethical and practice issues in the psychoeducational assessment of
        linguistically diverse students. </p>
