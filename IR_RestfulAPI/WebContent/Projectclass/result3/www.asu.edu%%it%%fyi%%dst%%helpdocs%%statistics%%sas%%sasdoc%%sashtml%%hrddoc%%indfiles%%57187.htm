SAS/CONNECT User's Guide, Version 8
</H1><P>
This title contains essential information for using SAS software to        provide client/server services. The client/server capabilities of
SAS/CONNECT enable you to combine data and computational resources from    two seemingly incompatible systems. SAS/CONNECT allows you access to
files, hardware resources, and SAS software on various remote hosts to     use with a SAS session the local host. Each SAS/CONNECT service is
documented and contains information on product features and concepts,      syntax information, and gives examples. This document explains how
processing can take place asynchronous on a remote host as you continue    processing on your local host. This processing can be performed on a
periodic basis using the SAS/CONNECT agent scheduler.  You also learn how  to spread processing among remote resources.  SAS/CONNECT allows
application developers to design and develop application that communicate  directly or indirectly using message queues.  Both system administrators
and experienced SAS programmers will find this information useful.
