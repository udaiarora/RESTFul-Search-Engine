In agrievance hearing, the faculty member requests a formal hearing byone of the three faculty grievance committees.</li><p><li>Under the proposed plan, a faculty member may choose either themediation route followed (if necessary) by the grievance hearingroute or the grievance hearing route alone.</li><p><li>&#147;Faculty&#148; shall mean all <a href="acd002.html#employees" target="New">employees</a> of the ArizonaBoard of Regents in teaching, research, or service whose <a href="acd002.html#NoticeofAppointment" target="New">notice ofappointment</a> is as <a href="acd002.html#lecturer" target="New">lecturer</a>, instructor, assistant professor, associateprofessor, professor, or otherwise designated as faculty on thenotice of appointment.

Anombudsperson from the ASU Ombudsperson Committee will mediate, conciliate, and coordinate communication among the grievant, respondent, and those related to the complaint. The purpose of this process is to air differences between the parties and to resolve the complaint to the satisfaction of both parties without resorting to formal hearings. Mediation is strongly recommended.</p><p>The names of members of the ASU Ombudsperson Committee arelisted in the <i>ASU Directory</i> and the <i>ASU Roster of Boards,Committees, and Councils.</i></p><p><b>Mediation Process</b><p><ol type="1"><li>The faculty member seeking mediation shall file a complaintwith the ombudsperson within 30 days of the occurrence of theactions which form the basis of the complaint.</li><p><li>Mediation shall proceed according to procedures outlined in <ahref="acd509-01.html">ACD 509&#150;01</a>, &#147;UniversityOmbudsperson Committee Guidelines.&#148;</li><p><li>If mediation does not result in a successful resolution of thecomplaint, the faculty member may file a grievance with theClearinghouse Committee within thirty (30) days of receipt of theombudsperson&#146;s report.</li><p><li>In addition to data called for in the policy statement, theClearinghouse Committee shall keep records of the number of casesreferred to it where the grievant sought resolution at lowerlevels, and the number of cases referred to it where the grievantdid not seek resolution at lower levels. Grievant may or may notchoose to give reasons to the Clearinghouse Committee for notfollowing the recommended option. The Clearinghouse Committee shallreport annually to the Academic Senate and the president. Thereport shall include the collected data.</li><p><p><li>During mediation, the grievant shall not be represented by anattorney. He or she may have an adviser chosen from the universitycommunity who will attend meetings and review writtendocumentation.</p><p>Access shall not be given to information deemed confidentialunder federal or state laws, or if access would constitute aninvasion of privacy. If the ombudsperson denies access, all partieswill be given a written explanation. If the grievant disagrees withthe ombudsperson&#146;s determination, the grievant may terminatemediation and remove the complaint within 15 days to a hearingcommittee.</p></li><p><li>The ombudsperson shall have 30 days after receiving writtenstatements from the grievant and respondent to try to resolve theconflict.</li><p><li>If a mutually satisfactory resolution results from themediation, the process ends. If the parties cannot resolve thedifferences, the grievant may, if he or she chooses, seek a hearingbefore one of the grievance committees.</li><p><li>The result of the mediation process is a report prepared by theombudsperson and sent to the parties and to the presidentstating:</li><p><ol type="a"><li>the names of grievant and respondent</li><p><li>the length of time mediation was attempted</li><p><li>that mediation was or was not successful</li><p><li>notice that grievant may initiate grievance hearing procedureswithin 30 days of receipt of the ombudsperson&#146;s report (see <ahref="#involve the following steps">below</a>)</li><p><li>the name and office address of the chair of the ClearinghouseCommittee (see below).</li></ol></ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Grievance Hearing </b></font><p><ol><li>Whether or not a grievant has sought mediation, he or she mayrequest a hearing by a panel of one of three grievance committees:The <a href="acd002.html#committeeonacademicfreedomandtenure"target="New">Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure (CAFT)</a>,the Governance Grievance Committee (GGC), or the <a href="acd002.html#boardonequalopportunity" target="New">Board on EqualOpportunity (BEO)</a>. The hearing committee shall be selected bythe Clearinghouse Committee consisting of the chairs of the CAFT,GGC, and BEO. The chair of the Clearinghouse Committee shall berotated: chair of the CAFT first, followed by the chair of the BEO,and then the chair of the GGC.</li><p><li>The membership of the respective grievance committees isdescribed under Bylaw I of the <i>Academic Constitution.</i> Nofewer than three faculty members of a given grievance committeeshall constitute a hearing panel for that committee.</li><p><li>Chairs of grievance committees will be chosen annually by themembers of the respective committees.</li><p><li><a name="involve the following steps">Thegrievance committee jurisdiction</a>:</li><p><ol type="a"><li>Within 30 days of receipt of the ombudsperson&#146;sreport or within 30 days of the occurrence of the actions whichformed the basis for the grievance, the grievant shall make awritten request for a formal hearing to the ClearinghouseCommittee. Written requests should be marked confidential and sentto the Chair of Grievance Clearinghouse Committee, Academic SenateOffice (mail code 1703). If any policies of the Board of Regents orASU provide shorter time limits, the shorter limits will apply. <p>The request must be filed by the grievant by hand delivery or bycertified mail, return receipt requested, with the chair of theClearinghouse Committee at the Academic Senate Office address andshall state: grievant&#146;s name, address, telephone number, astatement of the complaint, remedies sought, and the name andaddress of grievant&#146;s attorney, or that grievant is proceedingwithout an attorney.</p></li><p><li type="1">The Clearinghouse Committee shall decide whichcommittee will hear the case based on the following jurisdictionalguidelines:</li><p><ol><li>Alleged discrimination. <p>If discrimination in employment, program, or activity based onrace; color; religion; sex, gender identity; nationalorigin; age; disability; or Vietnam-era or other protected veteran status is the essence of thegrievance, the Board on Equal Opportunity shall hear the case.</p></li><p><li>Alleged infringement on academic freedom and tenure. <p>All complaints of, or recommendations against a faculty member,unless specifically excepted below, shall be heard by the Committeeon Academic Freedom and Tenure whether the dispute involves thesubstance of a decision or the fairness of the procedures by whichthe decision was made, including complaints allegingdiscrimination.</p><p><ol type="a"><li>The committee shall hear any faculty allegation that adecision affecting his or her employment relation with theuniversity was not determined in substantial compliance withregular university procedures. This includes nonrenewal ofcontracts, denial of tenure or promotion, and denial of sabbatical and other leaves. When,however, the matter concerns the basis or reasons foradministrative decisions on promotion, sabbatical leaves, andleaves, the committee shall not have jurisdiction.</li><p><li>If the allegation asserts that a decision onnonretention or denial of tenure was not determined in accordancewith regular university procedures or was based on discriminatoryor other unconstitutional grounds, the committee may hear the case. In performing its function of assessing the procedural regularity of the tenure and promotion process, the Academic Freedom and Tenure Committee plays an important fact-finding role, similar to that of a board of inquiry. To the extent possible, this role should be carried out in a non-adversarial, collegial way.</li><p><li>The committee shall hear disputes on the amount ofsalary due a nontenured faculty member who has been suspended or dismissed before the expiration of the employment period.</li><p><li>When dismissal is considered for a faculty member whohas satisfactorily completed any probationary period establishedunder the existing personnel policies of the university, or afaculty member whose contract period has not expired, the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure shall proceed under ACD 501, <i>&#147;Conditions of Faculty Service.&#148;</i></li></ol></li></ol><p><ol start="3"><li>Alleged abuse of governance procedures. <p>The Governance Grievance Committee shall hear all complaints,unless specifically excepted below, alleging unfair treatmentbecause no policies or procedures exist, or existing policies orprocedures have been misinterpreted, misapplied, or violated by auniversity administrator. Where the jurisdiction of the GovernanceGrievance Committee overlaps with that of the Committee on AcademicFreedom and Tenure, the latter committee shall hear the matter.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p><b>Timelines and Steps of Hearing Process</b><p><ol><li>The chair of the Clearinghouse Committee shall forwardthe request for a hearing within seven days after it is filed torespondent with instructions to respond within 15 days. Theresponse shall contain the name, address, telephone number ofrespondent, and a statement of respondent&#146;s position on theissue, the name and address of the respondent&#146;s attorney ifgrievant elects to be represented by an attorney. Respondent is notobligated to have an attorney.</li><p><li>Within 15 days of the original request, the grievantand respondent will receive written notification from the chair ofthe Clearinghouse Committee as to which committee will hear thecase and a statement of procedures of that committee.</li><p><li>The grievant may ask the Clearinghouse Committee toreconsider its decision on case assignment. Any reconsideration bythe Clearinghouse Committee is final.</li><p><li>The chair of the designated hearing committee will seta hearing date in conjunction with all parties involved in thecase. The hearing should begin within 60 days of the date of theoriginal request. The sixty-day period includes only the time whenschool is in session. Semester breaks and summer recess are notincluded. The parties shall receive notice of the hearing date atleast 20 days before the hearing date.</li><p><li>The chair may meet with the parties and/or counselbefore the hearing to narrow the issues, discuss number ofwitnesses and documents and any related matters.</li><p><li>A grievance shall not proceed if the grievant, afterdue notice, fails to be present or fails to obtain continuance. Agrievant may withdraw his or her grievance at any stage in thegrievance procedure by writing the chair of the committeedesignated to hear the grievance.</li><p><li>The grievant shall be advised of relevant statutes oflimitation that would affect his or her ability to file for ahearing outside the university. Specifically, in the case ofdiscrimination, that the grievant must file a complaint with theArizona Civil Rights Division, U.S. Dept. of Education Office ofCivil Rights, or the U.S. Dept. of Labor within 180 days of theoccurrence of the action complained of. He or she has 300 days fromthe date of occurrence to file with the U.S. Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission.</li><p><li>If a grievant commences a grievance with an outsideagency based on the same or other grounds, the ombudsperson or thechair of the hearing committee, depending on the progress of theinternal grievance, will continue the internal grievance, unlessthe grievant desires to postpone the hearing process or withdrawthe internal grievance. The ASU Office of General Counsel willhandle complaints filed with outside agencies. <p>Grievant shall be advised by the chair of the hearing committeeto consider filing charges with an outside agency if the deadlineto file may pass pending the outcome of the internal process.</p></li><p><li>No later than 15 days before the hearing date, thegrievant and respondent will submit complete written documentationof the complaint and a list of witnesses to the chair of thehearing committee.</li><p><li>The chair of the hearing committee shall send a copyof the written documentation and witness lists submitted by thegrievant and the respondent to the committee members within threeworking days after receipt. Grievant&#146;s witness list anddocumentation will be forwarded to respondent and respondent&#146;switness list and documentation will be forwarded to grievant by thechair within three working days after receipt.</li><p><li>The chair of the committee may call witnesses uponrequest of either party or on the chair&#146;s initiative. Thechair may also require the production of books, records, and otherevidence. Request shall be made either by personal delivery or bycertified mail. In the interest of fair treatment, it is expectedthat any member of the university community called to testify shalltestify and any university community member or university officethat has access to relevant documents will produce them to arequesting party or the Grievance Committee. In the event suchcooperation is not forthcoming, the hearing committee chair hassubpoena power to do one or more of the following:</li><p><ol><li type="a">compel the attendance and testimony of witnessescalled by the parties or the hearing committee who refuse to appearwithout a subpoena;</li><p><li type="a">compel either party to produce relevant documents if a partyrefuses to do so without a subpoena;</li><p><li type="a">compel a university office/representative who is in possessionof relevant documents desired by a party or the hearing committeeto produce such documents to the hearing committee, if theoffice/representative refuses to do so without a subpoena. <p>If a party needs a subpoena, the party will request a subpoenaform from the hearing committee chair, complete the form, andsubmit it to the chair for signature. The party will then give thesigned subpoena to the appropriate witness or universityrepresentative. The chair may also serve subpoenas on thechair&#146;s initiative.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p><b>Hearing Rules</b><p>Hearings by the three grievance committees shall beconducted according to the following <a href="acd002.html#rule"target="New">rules</a>:<p><ol><li>Hearings shall be recorded on tape. Deliberations are not partof the hearing.</li><p><li>Unless overriding reasons are given to grievant, respondent,and other appropriate parties, all parties shall have access to allinformation that is presented to the hearing body at no expense tothem.</li><p><li>While a grievance is being processed, grievant and respondentshould be informed about the status of the grievance.</li><p><li>Either party may have the advice of counsel prior to thehearing. On counsel participation, the grievant must elect one ofthe following four options in making a presentation to the hearingcommittee:</li><p><ol><li type="a">The grievant may proceed without counsel at thehearing. In this event, the respondent will proceed withoutcounsel.</li><p><li type="a">The grievant may be accompanied by counsel who willact as an advisor during the hearing. The grievant will beresponsible for presenting the case (witnesses, exhibits, andstatements) and counsel may advise the grievant. In this event, therespondent may proceed with counsel as an advisor.</li><p><li type="a">The grievant may be represented by counsel at thehearing; counsel may present statements, question witnesses calledby both parties and present documents. In this event, therespondent may be represented by counsel in the same manner.</li><p><li type="a">Regardless of which option the grievant elects, thecommittee has the right to speak to the parties and witnessesduring the hearing, including the right to question and to receiveresponses from the parties and witnesses directly.</li></ol><p>If neither party is advised or represented by counsel and theuniversity general counsel has not been involved in the case onbehalf of either party, the university general counsel may provideadvice to the grievance committee and/or grievance committee chair;however, legal advice is limited to procedural, not substantive,issues related to the case.<p>If the grievant has counsel, generally, an attorney in theUniversity Office of General Counsel will advise/represent therespondent. In order to avoid a potential conflict of interest, theuniversity general counsel will not advise the grievance committeeor chair; rather, the University Office of General Counsel willsecure an outside counsel to advise/represent the committee orchair at the chair&#146;s request, if the committee desires suchassistance.</ol><ol start=5><p><li>Members of grievance committees shall not participate indeliberations when they have a conflict of interest.</li><p><li>In the interest of fair treatment, it is expected that anymember of the university community called to give testimony shalltestify.</li><p><li>The grievant and respondent shall hear all testimony.</li><p><li>Upon request of either party and for good cause shown, thechair may continue the proceedings to another time.</li><p><li>Either party may demand that witnesses be excluded except whiletestifying. Generally, the committee will allow all witnesses totestify and documents to be presented which are related to thecomplaint or the response.</li><p><li>Each party or counsel may present an opening statement of hisor her position. Generally, the grievant or counsel will thenpresent all of his or her witnesses and documents. The committeemembers may question the witnesses and ask questions aboutdocuments presented. The respondent or counsel may question thegrievant. After the grievant has presented his or her case, therespondent or counsel shall have an opportunity to presentwitnesses and documents, and the committee members may question thewitnesses and ask questions about documents presented. The grievantor counsel may question the respondent. The members of thecommittee may question the parties throughout the hearing.</li><p><li>At the completion of the hearing, the chair will notify theparties that within 30 days the committee will forward arecommendation and report to the president, who will make the finaldecision.</li><p><li>Within 30 days after the completion of the hearing, thecommittee shall submit a report to the president which will includeits findings, conclusions, and recommendations.</li><p><li>Within 45 days of receipt of the committee report, thepresident shall decide the matter and forward a written statementto the grievant, the respondent, and the members of the hearingcommittee. If the president cannot issue a decision within the45-day period, the president will notify the parties within the45-day period of a delay in the issuing of the decision, thereasons for the delay, and the date on which the decision can beexpected. The decision of the president shall be final.</li><p><li>The grievant who is dissatisfied with the decision of thepresident may request reconsideration by filing a written requestwith the president no later than 15 working days following thereceipt of the president&#146;s written decision. The request shallbe based on the following grounds:</li><p><ol type="a"><li>irregularities in the proceedings, including but notlimited to any abuse of discretion or misconduct by the committeewhich has deprived the employee of a fair and impartialprocess;</li><p><li>newly discovered material evidence, which could not have beenavailable for the presentation;</li><p><li>the decision is not justified by the evidence or is contrary tolaw;</li><p><li>the severity of the sanction.</li></ol><p>Following receipt of the request for reconsideration, thepresident shall conduct whatever reconsideration is deemednecessary to resolve the issues that have been raised. Thepresident will provide a written response to the request to allparties within 20 days of receipt of the grievant&#146;s request.The decision following reconsideration is final.</p></ol><p><ol start=15><li>To pursue the case outside the university, the employee mustfile a legal action in Maricopa County Superior Court in accordancewith <i>Arizona Revised Statutes,</i>&sect; 12&#150;901, et seq.The action must be filed in court within 35 days after receipt ofthe president&#146;s decision, if the grievant does not requestreconsideration, or within 35 days after receipt of thepresident&#146;s response following reconsideration, if requestedby the grievant.</li><p><li>The hearing report shall be provided to the parties by thepresident on request.</li><p><li>When the Academic Freedom and Tenure Committee determines thatthere has been a material failure by an <a href="acd002.html#academicunit" target="New">academic unit</a> to adhereto procedures governing the tenure and promotion process, it shouldadvise the executive vice president and provost of the university through its report tothe president, so that the following steps can be taken.</li><p><ol><li type="a">The executive vice president and provost of the university will consultwith the faculty and/or head of that unit to ensure that such afailure does not happen again.</li><p><li type="a">If the Academic Freedom and Tenure Committeedetermines that such a failure was a deciding factor in arecommendation that the candidate be denied tenure or promotion, itshould so advise the executive vice president and provost of the university.</li><p><li type="a">The advice is not the functional equivalent of arecommendation to grant tenure or promotion. Tenure and promotioncan only be granted when there has been an appropriate showing thatthe candidate has met the standards of the academic unit in whichhe or she is to be tenured or promoted. A determination by theexecutive vice president and provost of the university, based on the recommendation of the Academic Freedom and Tenure Committee or otherwise, that acandidate&#146;s review has been procedurally flawed is not ashowing that the standards of the academic unit have been met.</li><p><li type="a">The executive vice president and provost of the university will take stepsto determine whether the standards have been met. He or she mayreturn the application to the academic unit from which it arose,with instructions to reconsider the application in the followingacademic year in accordance with proper procedures.</li><p><li type="a">If, based on the advice of the Academic Freedom andTenure Committee or otherwise, the executive vice president and provost of the university determines that it is not likely that the candidate canreceive fair reconsideration from the academic unit to which theapplication would ordinarily be returned, the executive vice president and provost of the university, in consultation with the candidate and the chair ofthe Academic Freedom and Tenure Committee, will devise an ad hocprocedure to determine if the candidate has met the standards ofthe academic unit. Such a procedure, for example, might involvesubmitting the candidate&#146;s tenure (or promotion) applicationand the unit&#146;s standards to a committee consisting of facultyin the relevant discipline from another university.</li><p><li type="a">When the executive vice president and provost of the university determines that an application for tenure must be reconsidered under points(d) and (e), above, the candidate&#146;s contract should beadjusted to ensure that he or she will have an additional yearunder the terminal contract in which to find a new position (if thereconsideration results in a denial of tenure).</li></ol></ol></ol><p><b>Appeal of Dismissal</b><p><ol><li>When reason arises to question the fitness of a faculty memberwho has tenure or whose term of appointment has not expired, theappropriate administrative officers, as designated by the presidenton a case-by-case basis, should ordinarily discuss the matter withthe faculty member in personal conference. The matter may bedisposed of by mutual consent at this point.</li><p><li>If an adjustment does not result and the faculty member isrecommended for suspension without pay or dismissal, <a href="acd501.html">ACD 501</a>, <i>&#147;Conditions of FacultyService,&#148;</i> applies.</li><p><li>Other procedures for dismissal:</li><p><ol><li type="a">When an individual has been placed on disabilitystatus for more than 18 months, there is no assurance ofreemployment with the university. At this stage, the university mayutilize the procedures above for termination.</li><p><li type="a">Suspension of the faculty member during the proceedings isjustified if, in the judgment of the president, immediate harm tothe faculty member or to others is threatened by continuance or ifcontinued performance of duties would result in extreme harm to theacademic program. Unless prohibited by law, any suspension shall bewith pay.</li></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol><p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%"height="2"></p><center><font size="+2"><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"> <p>For the composition of grievance committees, see <a href="acd112-01.html">ACD 112&#150;01</a>, <i>&#147;AcademicConstitution and Bylaws.&#148;</i></p><p>For the Board of Regents&#146; official conditions policy, see<a href="acd501.html">ACD 501</a>, <i>&#147;Conditions of FacultyService.&#148;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font> <center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html"target="_top">ACD</a>&nbsp;manual |ASU&nbsp;policies&nbsp;and&nbsp;procedures&nbsp;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&nbsp;manuals |ACD&nbsp;manual&nbsp;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> |Provost&#146;s&nbsp;Office&nbsp;Web&nbsp;<a href="provost.html">site</a></font> <p><font size="-1" color="#666666">&nbsp;</font></p><p><a href="#top"><font size="-1" color="#666666">Back toTop</font></a></p></center><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
