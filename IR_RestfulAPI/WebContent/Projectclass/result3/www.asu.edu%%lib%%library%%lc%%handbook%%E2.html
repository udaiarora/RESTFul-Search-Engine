                    <P>The criteria provide a frame of reference for personnel actions leading to retention, continuing appointment, and/or promotion. The three criteria considered in evaluating an academic professional for personnel action are job performance, professional development and contribution, and service. Wide variation is possible in the appropriate combination and application of the criteria as written, but the central concept in these personnel actions is always the academic professional's achievements taken as a whole.</P>
                    <P>
                    <DL>

                  <p>In the University Libraries, academic professionals facilitate access to information in support of the teaching, research, and service mission of the University. Academic professionals are responsible for planning, implementing, and evaluating the Libraries' programs to that end. Effective job performance requires an understanding of the learning process, scholarly communication, and information seeking, processing, storage, and retrieval in support of the programs and priorities of Arizona State University.</p>
                  <p>Each academic professional's expected contribution to the mission and goals of the University Libraries is specifically defined in the individual job description. The efforts of academic professionals focus on support of learning, teaching, and research by all members of the University community. Job performance is the paramount criterion in personnel actions leading to retention, continuing appointment, and/or promotion.</p>

                  <h3>PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONTRIBUTION</h3>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Professional development and contribution comprise a wide range of endeavors that draw on the academic professional's talents and interests and that represent a commitment to the profession or to the discipline. Activities may be related to the academic professional's position provided they are beyond the scope of assigned responsibilities. The scope of activities delineated is diverse because each job affords different opportunities, and each academic professional has different talents and interests.</p>
                  <p>The following sections group similar activities together in order to illustrate the major kinds of projects and in order to organize their presentation in the personnel documents. Lists of examples cited are to be understood as illustrative rather than as exhaustive.</p>

                                <P>Active participation in any appropriate library, professional, or scholarly organization. Because many kinds of participation are possible, for example, committee work, holding office, program/meeting planning, or writing reports, the academic professional should describe the nature and extent of the activities to make the level of participation clear to reviewers. Membership in professional organizations, although not indicative of active participation, is a necessary precursor to participation, and therefore should be listed in this section.</P>

                                <P>Research is systematic inquiry or critical examination to establish facts or principles in a field of knowledge. Dissemination is the presentation of original work to an audience beyond employees of the ASU Libraries through publication in any medium, including electronic. <B>Substantial</B> library/in-house publications meeting this criteria may be included under the appropriate categories (1-10) listed below. Dissemination may convey the results of research or may represent a professional, scholarly, or artistic contribution of some other kind. To make the nature of the project clear to reviewers, the academic professional should describe the level of participation as editor, author, compiler, performer, artist, etc., as well as the type and rigor of the forum. Works in progress or not yet accepted for dissemination may be included. Activities and achievements considered as dissemination include:</P>

                                  <LI>Research projects. The academic professional is responsible for documenting each project's need, scope, methodology, results, and target audience. 
                    
                  <LI>Grant proposals written and/or grants received.
