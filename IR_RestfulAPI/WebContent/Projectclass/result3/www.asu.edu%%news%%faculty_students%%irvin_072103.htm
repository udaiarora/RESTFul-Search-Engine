      <h2>Literature scholar, administrator Irvin takes reins at East College</h2>
      <p>        <img src="facstudents_images/glennirvin_072103.jpg" width="180" height="265" align="right">Glenn Irvin, an English literature scholar and university administrator
          who has served in a series of senior academic leadership posts, including
          11 years at CalPoly, San Luis Obispo, has been named as new dean of
        East College at ASU East. </p>
      <p>The appointment comes as ASU's East Campus
            continues to implement President Michael Crow's vision for ASU East
            to become a 21st-century polytechnic
          university with a technological focus in all of its academic offerings.</p>
      <p>Irvin
        previously was at ASU West, where he was an English professor in the
        College of Arts &amp; Sciences and served as ASU West's vice provost
        for academic affairs from August 1997 to June 2002. Prior to that, he
        served as vice provost of academic affairs at Cal Poly and as dean of
        the university's College of Liberal Arts. <br>
        He also has served in a series of increasingly responsible academic positions,
        including associate vice president for academic affairs at East Texas
        State University, now Texas A&amp;M-Commerce.</p>
      <p>"Glenn's strong administrative
          background in the liberal arts and as an administrator at one of the
          nation's leading polytechnic universities
          will help guide East College as we implement a polytechnic focus for
          ASU East," said Charles Backus, ASU vice president and ASU East provost.
          "This is a critical time for East College, which is experiencing phenomenal
          growth in its academic offerings. Glenn knows how to lead this kind
        of college in a polytechnic setting, and I feel fortunate that we have
        found
          our next dean within the ASU family."</p>
      <p>Irvin succeeds David Schwalm, who
          has served as dean of East College since its founding in 1997.</p>
      <p>In that time, Schwalm also has served as ASU
          East's vice provost for academic affairs, a role in which he will continue.</p>
      <p>"While it has been
          a pleasure to serve in this dual role, ASU East needs someone in each
          of these positions to focus all of their efforts on the
          individual needs of each area," said Schwalm. "I am confident Glenn
        will lead East College to an even stronger position as I focus my efforts
          on the campus's overall academic programs."</p>
      <p>Said Backus, "We owe David
          a depth of gratitude for leading East College from its infancy. He
        is a valued member of the ASU East team, and I look
          forward to continuing to work with him in his vice provost role."</p>
      <p>East
          College is among ASU's fastest growing colleges, serving approximately
          1,000 students in a variety of professional and liberal arts programs.
          Among the college's offerings are elementary education; business administration;
          applied psychology; multimedia writing and technical communication;
        applied biological sciences; nutrition; exercise and wellness; and human
        health
          studies.</p>
      <p>Irvin said his goal as dean of East College is to nurture existing
          programs and help create the appropriate new ones as ASU East further
          develops
          its academic focus.<br>
        "My aspirations for the college are similar to those of Provost Backus
          and others at ASU East and President Crow in that we become a university
          campus with a polytechnic mission, and that East College will continue
          to develop as a unit with professional, technical, and arts and sciences
          programs that contribute to that mission," said Irvin. "We will focus
          on developing outstanding programs, research and teaching within this
          environment."</p>
      <p>ASU East has long caught the attention of Irvin, he said,
          since he came to ASU in 1997.</p>
      <p>"Right from the beginning I thought the campus was developing
          in a distinctive manner, and that a polytechnic mission might be in
        its future," he said.
          "This campus is a wonderful place to be. It has outstanding leadership,
          an excellent faculty and staff, and is on track for an exciting mission." </p>
      <p>Irvin grew up in Williams, Ariz., and earned his bachelor's degree in
          education, as well as his master's and doctoral degrees in English
        from ASU. His academic interests include Modernism, specifically 19th
        and
          20th-century British literature, British transitional literature, and
          the British and American novel. Over the course of his career, Irvin
          has been involved in a number of projects involving the arts, sciences
          and education, and has taught courses at the undergraduate and graduate
          levels in literature, composition and rhetoric. He is widely published
          in the areas of literature, composition, liberal and general education
        and public education.</p>
      <p>Irvin is married and has four children. His wife,
          Janet, is a technology consultant with the Maricopa County schools
        district. Their children
        are Meredith, Kelly, Darcy and Ryan.</p>
