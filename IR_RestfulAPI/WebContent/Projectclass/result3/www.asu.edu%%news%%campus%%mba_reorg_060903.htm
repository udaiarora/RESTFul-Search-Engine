      <h2>W. P. Carey MBA at Arizona State University Reorganizes Leadership:
        Dr. Carl H. Harris Adds Executive Director of Recruiting and Admissions
        Duties</h2>
      <p>Dr. Carl H. Harris of the W. P. Carey MBA at Arizona State University
        is heading up a new initiative designed to refocus staff and streamline
        services to more effectively compete for the best graduate business students
        regionally and nationally.</p>
      <p>The new position - executive director of recruiting and admissions -
        is an extension of his current responsibilities. For the past three years
        he has been serving as assistant dean for graduate programs at the W.
        P. Carey School, with responsibility for the W. P. Carey MBA online application
        system, alumni services and other support functions.</p>
      <p>Dr. Harris came to the W. P. Carey School from the nationally ranked
        University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business, where he was
        director of admissions. </p>
      <p>"With Carl Harris in this new leadership position, the W. P. Carey MBA
        is ready to implement strategies that come directly from the naming,
        thereby moving us toward being a top 25 school" said Dean Larry Edward
        Penley. "This reorganization -with Carl's appointment -will allow us
        to enhance the make-up and prestige of our cornerstone W. P. Carey MBA
        - Full-time Program and it will aid us in providing the finest programs
        for working professional programs in the Greater Phoenix and Arizona
        business community." </p>
      <p>Dr. Harris is known nationally in his field as an effective manager
        with outstanding strategic perspectives, and for pioneering the utilization
        of emerging technologies in the areas of applicant recruitment and on-line
        application processing, alumni services, and other electronic applications.
        Under his leadership, the W. P. Carey School Graduate Alumni Community
        was launched. This web-based tool allows alumni of the W. P. Carey MBA,
        masters and doctoral programs to stay abreast of news and network. </p>
      <p> Dr. Harris is also an elected member of the Board of Directors of the
        Graduate Management Admissions Council (GMAC). This Board is charged
        with developing the GMAC global strategic vision, new initiatives, and
        delivery of services to over 1,500 graduate management programs from
        170 countries.</p>
      <p>Before coming to ASU, Dr. Harris served for 10 years in various roles
        at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business. Immediately before
        that, he was assistant to the vice president for student affairs at Arizona
        State University from 1984 to 1989. During that time he was a Regents'
        Executive-in-Residence at the Arizona Board of Regents. His background
        also includes two years as associate dean for student development at
        the University of South Carolina and 11 years in various administrative
        posts at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. </p>
      <p> Dr. Nancy Stephens, who had served as interim executive director this
        spring, will continue as director of the W. P. Carey MBA - Evening Program. </p>
