      <h2>Live and learn in Washington DC; scholars internship program</h2>
      <p>TEMPE, AZ, December 3, 2003 - If you're an undergraduate, it's not too
        early to start thinking about your 2004 summer plans. If you want to
        develop leadership skills, check out the prestigious Capitol Scholars
        Program, sponsored by the ASU College Liberal Arts and Sciences, May
        25-July 25, 2004 in Washington, DC.</p>
      <p>The Capitol Scholars program gives undergraduates the opportunity to
        live and work in the nation's capitol. Students not only gain valuable
        work experience on Capitol Hill and in various public policy governmental
        and nongovernmental organizations, but also have the opportunity to discuss
        policy issues with elected representatives and White House appointees. </p>
      <p>&quot;The ASU Capitol Scholars Program trains future leaders by providing
        them with an educational experience rich in both academic and applied
        knowledge," said Dr. Michelle Chin, program director. "The program is
        unique in its approach to integrating theory and applied learning, and
        connecting students with the community, policymakers and alumni. ASU
        is the only state-supported university to institutionalize a program
        of this type.&quot;</p>
      <p>In 2003, Stephen Szostak worked for US Senator Jon Kyl; Lynette Summerill
        developed a media strategy for the NABRE project at the Joint Center
        for Political and Economic Studies. Jessica Snorgrass traveled to San
        Diego, CA to do press advance work for the director of the White House
        Office of National Drug Control Policy. Mike Ritchie worked on state-level
        and federal-level trucking issues at the American Trucking Association,
        then continued his research of highway/transportation issues in Ukraine
        during his internship at the US Embassy in Kiev, Ukraine. Winter Dowland
        coordinated an event for the Arthritis Foundation; they paid for her
        to return in September to attend the event. Scot Mussi worked with George
        Ramones at The Advocacy Group and took the initiative to arrange a meeting
        for the Capitol Scholars with Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. Jessie
        Sandoval prepared briefing reports for a prospective House Energy and
        Commerce subcommittee trip to Europe. Bethany Lay wrote a report on alternative
        fuels for the Federal Highway Administration Office of Transportation
        Policy. Chad Kennedy's supervisors in the government relations office
        at Amtrak were so impressed with his work that they ordered him to return
        to DC next year to continue working with Amtrak.</p>
      <p>In one of her weekly class assignments, Winter Dowland wrote: "This
        experience has been eye opening, and I would gladly do it again. This
        trip has taught me more than I could have imagined, most of which required
        me to just be here to experience things first hand. I have met so many
        fantastic people, who will serve as valuable contacts and mentors as
        I move forward."</p>
      <p>At the end of the summer, Chad Kennedy reflected, "In just seven short
        weeks I have amassed unprecedented knowledge through personal exposure
        to the intricacies of our country's political process, established various
        gratifying personal and professional relationships that will benefit
        my future, toured major cities throughout the east coast, and visited
        all of the significant historical sites that embody the heart and soul
        of America. I have grown so fond and accustomed to a city I had never
        before visited, and a job that exceeded every one of my expectations,
        so much so that I do not want to leave just yet. I have been officially
        infected with a syndrome known around the city as 'Potomac fever.' The
        only cure for the syndrome is a return in the near future."</p>
      <p>ASU Capitol Scholars also earn college credit toward graduation by participating
        in twice weekly classes and educational field trips, including one that
        took them to New York's Ground Zero. In DC, Capitol Scholars reside in
        apartment-style housing at George Washington University, in the heart
        of DC and just a few blocks from the White House, State Department, Kennedy
        Center and Watergate. </p>
      <p>The ASU Capitol Scholars program is open to all undergraduates and acceptance
        in the program is determined on academic excellence and participation. </p>
      <p>The cost of $3,532 includes housing in DC and New York, roundtrip transportation
        from DC to New York, some meals, class materials and excursions. Not
        included are tuition ($742 for 4 credits POS 498), airfare to DC, most
        meals, local transportation in DC, and incidental expenses. Scholarships
        are available. All interested applicants are encouraged to apply regardless
        of their ability to pay for the program.</p>
      <p>Applications are available online (www.asu.edu/clas/polisci/capitolscholars)
        or at the Capitol Scholars office (203 G Matthews Center, before January
        9, 2004; 6694 Coor Building, after January 11, 2004). Deadline for general
        admission and scholarship eligibility is Friday, January 23, 2004. Decisions
        will be announced February 2, 2004.<br>
