<H4>PURPOSE</H4>
<P>The purpose of a supplementary evaluation is to provide the
academic professional and the primary evaluator with an
additional assessment of the academic professional's job
performance, professional development and contribution, or
service.  There are <font color="#FF0033">two</font> 
<s><font color="#FF0033">three</font></s> situations when a supplementary
evaluation may occur:</P>
<DL>
<DD>
    <P>Supplementary evaluations are required for all probationary academic professionals 
      who have <s><font color="#008000">library instruction and/or</font></s> 
      collection development responsibilities. Academic professionals <font color="#FF0033">with</font> 
      <s><font color="#FF0033">who have</font></s> continuing appointment <font color="#FF0033">who 
      have collection development responsibilities</font> are required to have written supplementary evaluations 
      every three years, although <font color="#FF0033">collection development</font> goals need to be 
      approved annually <font color="#FF0033">by the Collection Development Coordinator</font>.</P>
<P><s><font color="#FF0033">Academic professionals who work in more than one department
     may have a supplementary evaluation.  This evaluation is not
     always necessary.  The evaluation must be part of an initial
     agreement between the department heads and the academic
     professional.</font></s></P>
<P> An academic professional <font color="#FF0033">or primary evaluator</font> may request a supplementary
     evaluation from any person who can provide additional
     information to the primary evaluator regarding job
     performance, professional development and contribution, or
     service.</P></DL>
<P>It is the responsibility of a supplementary evaluator to provide
a constructive assessment of the academic professional's
performance in areas under the evaluator's coordination or
direction.  When appropriate, a supplementary evaluator may
evaluate the academic professional's professional development and
contribution or service efforts relevant to the evaluator's area
of responsibility.</P>
<P>The supplementary evaluation process follows the Schedule of
Personnel Actions issued by the Assistant Dean for Personnel.</P>

          <font color="#FF0033">for just those</font> academic professionals with continuing 
          appointment who have not had a written supplementary evaluation in the last two 
          years. <s><font color="#FF0033">It is the mutual responsibility of the primary evaluator and 
          the academic professional to determine if this is the year when supplementary 
          evaluations are required.</font></s> <font color="#FF0033">The Assistant Dean for 
          Personnel will keep track of who requires a supplementary evaluation each year and 
          communicate that information in the written reminder sent to academic professionals in early January 
          concerning annual evaluation submissions.</font> </P>

          <s><font color="#FF0033">or the appropriate sections.  This is done</font></s>

<LI><P>The supplementary evaluator evaluates the submitted
          materials and approves the new goals.  If the goals
          need to be changed or negotiated in any way, the
          evaluator will request a meeting with the academic
          professional to resolve any differences.</P>
<LI><P>The supplementary evaluator notifies both the academic
          professional and the primary evaluator when the goals
          have been approved.  This is done even if a written
          evaluation is not necessary.</P>
<LI><P>The supplementary evaluator writes an evaluation if one
          was solicited (probationary academic professionals and
          every third year for academic professionals with
          continuing appointment).  The evaluation is sent to <font color="#FF0033">both</font> the
