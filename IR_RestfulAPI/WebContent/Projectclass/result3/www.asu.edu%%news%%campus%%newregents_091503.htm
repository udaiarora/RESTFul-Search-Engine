      <h2>Governor appoints Frank, Calderon as Regents</h2>
      <p>        Gov. Janet Napolitano appointed two new members to the Arizona Board
          of Regents on Sept. 2. Phoenix residents Lorraine Frank and Ernest
        Calderon will begin their eight-year terms in January 2004.</p>
      <p>"The Regents
            have some challenging work ahead of them as they complete the Changing
            Directions Initiative and help the universities refocus
          their efforts," said Governor Napolitano in a Sept. 2 statement. "I
        know Lorraine and Ernie will be valuable in that process, and I'm confident
          they'll make sure Arizona's university students continue to receive
        a
          world-class education."</p>
      <p>The Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR), composed
          of eight members and two student regents, is mandated by the state
        constitution to oversee Arizona's
          public university system of ASU, Northern Arizona University (NAU)
        and the University of Arizona (UA). </p>
      <p>Frank has a long history of service
          to Arizona, particularly in the areas of education and humanities.
        She is a graduate of Vassar College
            and
            was appointed president of the Council on Humanities 1993 - 97. Frank
            later became the executive director of the Arizona Humanities Council
            in 1995. She served as the director of the Regents' Commission on
        the Status of Women from 1989 to 1991 and was also awarded honorary doctorate
            degrees from ASU and UA. </p>
      <p>"I am really, really excited, because I'm extremely
          interested in higher education," Frank says. "I certainly hope to make
          a great contribution,
          and I look forward to working with them (ABOR). There are a lot of
        good people working on the board."</p>
      <p>Calderon earned his bachelor's degree from
        NAU and his law degree at the UA. He serves on the NAU Foundation and
        just completed his term as
        president of the State Bar of Arizona. Calderon practices law in Arizona
        with the law firm Jennings, Strouss &amp; Salmon, and has argued cases
        before Arizona state and federal courts and the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court
        of Appeals. Gov. Napolitano also appointed Calderon to her School Readiness
        Task Force earlier this year.</p>
      <p>"I still believe in seeking out what's best
          for the students. I hope I can help find solutions to some of the problems
          facing education,"
          Calderon says. "But for the first few months I plan to keep my mouth
          shut and listen, because I've learned that nobody learns anything when
          they're talking."</p>
      <p>Calderon says education affordability is a concern he
          plans to examine as an ABOR member.</p>
      <p>"This (public education) is the only way disadvantaged
          kids, regardless of their race, get the opportunity to experience higher
          education. Growing
          up, my mother was a cook and my father was a copper miner, and I have
          to wonder, 'Could they afford to send me to college today,'" says Calderon,
          who was born and raised in Morenci. "I doubt it."</p>
      <p>Frank agrees affordability
          is a problem facing many Arizona residents who seek a higher education.</p>
      <p>"The major problem is how students get the
          best possible education at a figure they can afford to pay," Frank
        says. "We know that our fees
          are among the lowest in the United States, but the pressure comes with
          how to keep the cost down and quality of education high."</p>
      <p>Frank and Calderon
          replace Regents Kay McKay and Don Ulrich, whose terms expire in January
          2004. Both appointed positions are subject to state
          Senate confirmation.</p>
      <p>The next Arizona Board of Regents meeting is Sept.
          25 - 26 at ASU. For information about the Arizona Board of Regents,
