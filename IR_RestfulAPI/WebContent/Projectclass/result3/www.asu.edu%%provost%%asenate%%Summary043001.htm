<p><b>3.&nbsp; Announcements and Communications.</b>
<p><b>3.A Senate President?s Report</b> (Douglas Johnson).
<p>This isn't too surprising; if you have been reading the newspapers,
you already know health insurance costs are going up nationally and health
insurance companies are loosing money in Arizona. While we have been suffering
from the health insurance heartburn here at the university, it was an (ADOA)
Arizona Department of Administration decision to reopen the bid process
on the health coverage, for all state employees. Only four bids came back
(out of the 60 requests for proposals) and none of them were attractive
for the rural counties. The selection committee that I was a member of
was faced with a difficult choice, and the most attractive alternative
was to ask bidders to provide a bid on a exclusive contract to insure coverage
for the entire state. This could make the state contract more attractive
by avoiding the adverse selection process that some insurance companies
worry about. We did get two statewide bids for insurance coverage. Of those,
the Cigna bid was easily the most favorable for employees. Cigna, in negotiations,
came down to be within the state budget parameters, added coverage, and
has also agreed to aggressively expand their network of physicians. It
appears that if you are currently served by a physician that is a part
of another HMO group, they may still be available through the Cigna plan.
If your doctor is not a member of the Cigna network, I would encourage
you to ask them to investigate that possiblity. Just send me an email with
your doctor?s name and address and phone number, I will forward that to
Cigna and ask them to negotiate with that provider.
<p>There are other good things about the new contract. It does respond
to preferences of ASU employees expressed in the survey last year. ASU
employees said wanted a low cost HMO alternative and they wanted more flexibility
and broader coverage. So, what we have ended up with is a very good HMO
at a very reasonable cost. We have a POS and a PPO that have indemnity
features in them that give you good flexibility for going outside the network.
Cigna is the company that 90% of the state employees have expressed high
satisfaction with. So if we are going to have to have one company, a financially
sound company that has quality programs in place--Cigna should be our choice.
I am glad to talk to you further about the program. I have sympathy for
those of you who received a pay raise and now are seeing it fly away. I
do thank the administration for not also increasing parking fees for the
coming year because that might put us in negative territory in take home
pay.&nbsp; Health costs are going up nationally, we had a good deal for
several years and I guess we ought to be glad we had it for awhile. You
should be able to utilize the new features of the Cigna plan and we hope
you will find them very useful. You will need to re-enroll in August and
the new plans are effective in October.
<p>Senator Chaudhuri: While the PPO cost is abit steep, it is understandable.
I just want to commend you on your role on behalf of the university.
<p>Senate President Johnson: Thank you. I do believe that Cigna is a good
company and we will have good coverage. From January through March I met
at least one day a week with the selection committee and it didn?t look
at that time there were any good alternatives at all. There has been great
progress made and I hope we have put together plans that make good sense
for the university.
<p>Senator Saenz: I sent you an email on this; will there be any possibility
of securing an indemnity plan, or will we be locked into the Cigna system
for the next several years?
<p>Senate President Johnson: The PPO and the POS plans have indemnity features.
You
can go out of network and be reimbursed.&nbsp; If you choose to stay within
the Cigna network, you can get a price break.&nbsp; But you do have indemnity
options.
<p>Senator Komnenich: What about international travel, is that still not
covered?
<p>Senate President Johnson: Covering international travel is a real challenge.
There are some good things about the new contract; if you are a state employee
who is out of state, or out of nation, you can choose the PPO plan at the
HMO price. If you were on sabbatical in Norway for instance, you would
pay the $125 plan for a family and have the PPO coverage. Cigna also has
a "guest program" at 130 plans across the country. So, if you or your son
or your daughter is away at college, you can gain access to the Cigna network
through guest privileges at one of those plans
<p>Senator Burg: Is the sabbatical provision available for one-semester
sabbaticals, or only one-year sabbaticals?
<p>Doug Johnson: These plans are elected on a yearly basis, so you would
have to make your selection of coverage in the year that you have the sabbatical
coming.
<p><b>3.B University President/Provost?s Report</b> (Milton Glick).
<p>Thank you, Doug, it is hard to think that we have gone through another
year already. I continue to be very impressed with the way our faculty
and staff continue to overachieve, more than at other universities who
have more resources.
<p>I have a couple of observations to share today. First on the health
insurance, much as the people in this room are feeling the hurt of that,
the classified staff, many of them have lost a lot more than their raise.
This is a serious issue. One of the things that I think is so frustrating
is that there doesn't seem to be any bad guys in this scenario. I don?t
think we can blame it on the state. They gave Doug as much opportunity
as we have ever had to participate in the RFP process. I think the insurance
companies? data will show that they have lost money over the last couple
of years. Nonetheless, this really is a case of settling for the least
of several evils.
<p>I want to compliment our students who worked closely with us on our
tuition issue. We really came together with slightly different numbers.
The Board meeting was a genuinely collegial discussion of what the university
needed in the way of tuition, and what changes the students will expect
to see as a result of the tuition increases. The final increases were $140
resident and $550 nonresident. One of the things that you should know about
that is our resident tution remains very low, but our nonresident tuition
is getting up toward the median and at some point we could become noncompetitive.
It is a concern. We also agree with the students that have ideas on how
the increases should be used for improvement. One of them is to enhance
technology delivered services such as online advising, realtime registration,
realtime DARS, etc. Secondly that we have programs aimed at student success;
some of which would help faculty use technology better, some of which would
provide better facilities, some of which would provide better equipped
classrooms. Thirdly that some money would be set aside for TA compensation.
The way that would be used is yet to be determined.
<p>I know Tom Trotter shared with you last time the Senate met, how the
Social Sciences building will have to be vacated eventually. What that
is going to do, if our plan works, is to expand the new social science
mediated classroom between Education B (Payne Hall) and Stauffer Hall.
One important thing is that we will gain as many as 40 highly mediated
modern classrooms. That will allow us to put in support structure for this
many classes as well. It will allow places to prepare materials. One of
the big issues we have yet to conclude is a study by our architects on
the flow of students, to see if we can really put that many students in
the building in classrooms at one time.
<p>We are moving forward on 301 money. That is a real positive this year,
although Prop 301 is very targeted. The state did support 5% merit salary
increases for April 1, 2002 and 2003. That will mean a minimum of $1500
for any employee who is performing satisfactorily. We have a building renewal
formula that is supposed to generate about $10 million per year. For the
last two years, we only received about 23% of that or about $2.5 million.
That meant that we basically fixed the roof if we had to but not much more.We
thought that this year the legislature would recognize the importance of
building renewal and the legislature did. They started budgeting at 100%
of the standard and ended up at 65% of the renewal formula, which would
have still been a good number. The problem is that the Governor, as she
did her budget calculations, believes that the legislature is still overestimating
revenues. She decided to line item veto this request. We have been trying
and we hope to get an agreement between the legislature and the Governor?s
office that there would be a trigger in the budget such that as soon as
revenues exceed the agreed upon number, the first thing funded would be
building renewal. We thought there was agreement on that, but we have not
yet got that accomplished; we are still trying.
<p>I think that the long-term health of all the campus buildings in the
state depends on regular, predictable building renewal funding.&nbsp; It
is the case of--pay me now, or pay me later. As you know, the state is
spending well over one billion dollars on fixing up public schools through
the <i>Students First
</i>initiative, and I think that can be directly
attributed to the fact that there wasn?t regular investment in building
maintenance and building renewal. We are worried about infrastructure at
the university. Fortunately we have a guaranteed rate on electrical power
in this state, but natural gas prices are going up and up, driving up operating
costs. We are seeing a substantial rise in cost there.
<p>Senator Chaudhuri: On the Social Sciences Building, given the construction
history--What is the status of the State General Fund compensating the
university?
<p>Provost Glick: We believe that the Social Sciences building should be
an insurance cost to the state; we have filed a claim on that. You need
to know however that the state pays the first million dollars of insurance
on capital items. The rest is covered by an outside insurance company.
That is a big hit on that insurance company. The check has not been written
on that as yet. It could be several years before we know, although the
claim is a strong one.
<p>Past President Burstein: Being the Social Sciences building has to be
razed and it is located in prime campus area, is there anything planned
in that space (Provost Glick:Yes.)
<p>Senator Burg: In the new Social Sciences Building, is there any minimum
specification for faculty office size specified?
<p>Provost Glick: The Board has a set of guidelines that we have to follow
with our buildings. The building is already planned this way.
<p>A Senator: So we have 10 million dollars in the building renewal fund,
and we only got 2.3 million. Where did the rest of it go?
<p>Provost Glick: Capital is never in your base. It is a formula that the
state is asked to fund on an annual basis. We just didn't receive the budget
appropriation.&nbsp; The state just decided that $2.3 million is all they
could fund. They did not go after the universities. That fund is for all
state agencies. The problem is that it turns out the universities are the
main users of this fund, because the rest of state government has a rent
pool, and so they really get it in their base, as rent for facilities.
We are the primary ones that got it out of the 57 million dollars that
was appropriated, and we probably got 32 to 33 of that. Nobody else got
the money, it was just not appropriated.
<p>If there are no further questions, in closing, I just want to thank
all the people here, because this university is one of the best ones in
the nation, because of the genuine desire of both faculty and staff to
make this a better place by giving their all. I appreciate the efforts
of each of you.
<p>Senate President Johnson: Thank you. The legislature is trying to redirect
some dollars for us but it will be a difficult task. At this point, we
should be pleased that the raise is still in tact. I am truly concerned
about whether the state has mechanisms to fund higher education over the
long term, not just in years when they have excess funds, whether or not
the tax base is adequate, whether we have mechanisms to focus attention
on the crucial role that higher education plays is a critical policy issue.
We really need a higher education task force on an ongoing basis. We need
to have a Board of Regents that is more active in advocating for our budgets.
We need each of you to become more active, and make contact with at least
one legislator. It is something that is not easy. We like to believe that
if we do a good job at the university things at the legislature will take
care of themselves. The reality is that we will have to be more aggressive
and convince people that we are a good value.
<p>Election Results. As a part of our agenda today, we will announce the
results of the recent election. It gives me great pleasure to communicate
to you the results of the 2001 Tellers Committee report. I want to thank
Antonio Garcia, Bruce Kim, Donna Landers, Alan Matheson, Orchid Mazurkiewicz,
Mary Romero, and Bob St. Louis for serving on the Tellers Committee. Particurlarly
thanks to Antonio Garcia who rebuilt our scantron machine in order to make
this possible. The statistics on the election are that there were 1725
ballots mailed to members of the Academic Assembly at East and Main Campuses.
We had a 32% response rate. There were 524 signed ballots returned; we
also received 21 that were sealed but unsigned and those were declared
invalid. Next time, when you send in your ballot, please do sign as the
instruction requests.
<p>The Tellers Committee met on April 25 and counted the ballots using
the scanner and I am pleased to announce that the President-elect for the
Academic Assembly will be George Watson, WC School of Journalism and Telecommunication.
George has a long history of service to the university and I look forward
to working with him and the great things he will accomplish. For Secretary
of the Assembly and Senate, Anne Kopta, School of Music was reelected.
The new members of CAFT (Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure) will
be Kevin Dooley and Greg Moorhead. The new members of Governance Grievance
Committee will be Marian Barchelon, Norbert Samuelson, and John Schlacter.
We also have a new Senate representative to the University Promotion and
Tenure Committee, Maryann Santos de Barona. We have other inviduals that
were elected to the Intellectural Property Committee and they will be notified
through Vice Provost Jon Fink, and the new members of the academic professionals
grievance commitees will be notified by Santos Vega, the Chair of CAPS
(Committee on Academic Professional Status). I want to congratulate all
the winners and to extend my thanks to all candidats that stood for the
election. We really appreciate the strong pool of talent that we have at
the university and in the Senate and the people that are ready to step
up when called.
<p>I have another piece of business: The presidential awards. Provost Glick
had an award all set up until he called me "Bill" but I do want to thank
Milt for his inclusionary approach to management. He has kept the Senate
leadership involved with what is going on and has included us in his meetings.
We really feel like that leads to positive results where we will have win/win
outcomes for faculty. As you look across the country at other universities
and the dissension, tension and dysfunctional behavior that sometimes results,
we have to believe that we are doing some things right, and that this is
a good place to be. We do get an awful lot done even though perhaps we
don?t have as many resources as we would like. Nevertheless we are making
progress and we continue to become a better university.
<p>I do have an award for a committee chairman. We have several hardworking
committees and asking people to take the leadership role, to take the responsibility
for getting things done is a major time commitment. I would like to thank
one individual who stepped up when we had difficulties securing a chair,
took over and did a great job with Student-Faculty Policy Committee, Craig
Allen. The Sparky Award of Valor was presented to Craig. I have two more
awards to announce. One is for someone who goes beyond the normal call
of duty and has really been involved with everything the Senate has been
up to. In the absence of Mort Munk, he stepped up and served as President-elect,
and he has been a workhorse that has accomplished a lot, David Burstein
(much applause here). David gets the second Sparky Award of Valor. The
third award goes to someone who is indispensable to the Senate, Darby Shaw,
the mother of the Senate, the institutional memory, the person that really
gets things done, makes sure that the committees are in lock-step with
the Senate agenda, and keeps the President on target. Darby we really appreciate
you.
<p>A final award goes to Mort Munk, our incoming President who will take
over at the end of the meeting. Mort is a departure from the large in stature
presidents that we have enjoyed over the past few years, Bill Davey is
above average in heighth and weight, Dave Burstein, and I am also. But
I add that my weight is average. Mort is a little guy. He has had a lot
of experience in the university, no doubt he will be able to accomplish
things, but I have a special award for him, following the Theodore Roosevelt
suggestion about carrying a big stick. So, Mort, here is an extra big gavel
to help you get things done. There are many people who work hard and make
contributions to the Academic community.
<p>There are also a variety of people that deserve recognition for their
contribution to that community, and one of them is Duane Roen, Director
of the Center for Learning and Teaching Excellence. Duane and the center
will play an increasing role in the success of the university in the future.&nbsp;
As change seems to be coming&nbsp; faster, we will need to teach faculty
new tricks faster. Particularly, we will need to learn to do outcome measurement.
We will learn to be able to document and demonstrate that we are accomplishing
things. For many of us that will be a challenge and we will need some help.
We see all across the country, the role of faculty changing, coming unbundled
in many respects, development and delivery of courses becoming more distinct.
We find teams of specialists being necessary to do world class quality
work. I encourage each of you to seek out programs in the CLTE in the coming
year. Often we have programs scheduled and everyone sees these opportunities
but somehow fails to RSVP. We have to find a way of helping people get
involved and get the kind of training and exposure that they need in these
situations to be successful. I want to thank Duane and his staff for their
efforts, and I would ask that you look into their summer programs and the
ones planned for fall.
<p><b>3.C Senate President-elect?s Report</b> (Mort Munk).
<p>I did want to remind you that the Master Planning Committee is meeting
on a monthly basis. If any of you have questions or comments or I would
be pleased to address them now or email them to (<a href="mailto:mem@asu.edu)">mem@asu.edu)</a>.
<p><b>3.D ASASU President?s Report </b>(Alex Bainbridge).
<p>Senate President Johnson: I want to add my congratulations to Alex for
doing an excellent job. I continually saw him down at the capital lobbying
and being active in the governmental process. He really took the leadership
role and took the student government way beyond what I have seen done before.
Congratulations on a&nbsp; super job.
<p>Alex: It has been a pleasure working with you all this year. As Dr.
Glick said earlier, we have gone through a very good process this year
on tuition. I want to thank the Senate leadership for their lobbying efforts
at the legislature. I wish we had gotten more than what we did. We will
see what happens in the next couple of weeks. Again, it goes to prove that
a team effort can make things happen. If we all work together we can make
this a better university. I was hoping to have the new officers here to
introduce to you today but they are studying for finals and getting caught
up after the elections. The new president will be Jeremy Helper. Paul Peterson,
Graduate Affairs, Dominic Gomez, Campus Affairs, Sarah St. John, Activities
Vice President and Mark McKenna will be Executive Vice President. And now,
I need to depart and study for my own final exams. Thank you.
<p><b>3.E Past President?s Report</b> (David Burstein).
<p>It has been an interesting three years. I would like to echo comments
that Doug, and Milt and I have made to you before, about how fortunate
we are to have an administration that not only listens to us but also actively
seeks our input. Very few universities can claim such a relationship. The
key to our continuing existence as such a university is to continue the
kind of administration that we have in the future. As long as Lattie and
Milt are in charge, I am sure that will be the case. The challenge for
this university will to replace them should they ever leave. I do think
that Bill Davey once said it best, I now will step back into the faculty
and become unimportant again.
<p>Senate President Johnson: David, it is hard to think of you as ever
being shy and retiring.
<p><b>3.F ASUE Senate Report </b>(Andy Jackson).
<p>Just a quick announcement about the final ASUE Academic Assembly meeting
that is scheduled for this Wednesday, Reading Day, 12:00-1:15 p.m. in TECH
195. Some of the things that we will be addressing at that meeting include
the Arizona Regents University. I have been assigned to be the faculty
coordinator for the faculty needs assessment and to take that discussion
to the next level. Some of the things brought up were course development
and support for ARU type courses. Resources required, for example, software
and hardware, and training and expertise as well as quality of course offerings
and course content. The current thought is that we will focus on course
offerings and not on degree granting programs at this time. That could
change over time.
<p>The second thing we will discuss is the master plan process for East
Campus. There will be an update report on that Wednesday. We are meeting
biweekly with our AME Contractors to help develop and define what our next
phase of masterplanning is for ASUE.
<p>We have a discussion going on about whether we will have offcampus or
oncampus convocation. ASUE will have its convocation off campus this time
because there is not a site on campus big enough to hold it. Our convocation
will be held at the Mesa Centennial Hall.
<p>Finally, I have been elected as your representative for the Arizona
Faculties Council for next year; I will be sitting at the table with the
Board of Regents. I would ask you to work with your senate at the ASU campus
and let me know what you want to have the AFC bring forward to the Regents.
The Arizona Faculties Council represents the three universities? Senate
leadership.
<p><b>3.G Faculty Ombudsperson?s Report</b> (George Watson).
<p>I am hoping that the 6-7 cases that I have dealt with this first year
in my role as faculty ombudsperson are indicative that there are not too
many problems out there that need to be resolved. I certainly hope that
is the case. On the other hand, the few cases that I did have convinced
me that perhaps we need to pay attention in the next year or two, because
the rules that we do have and the efforts to evaluate individuals, such
as promotion and tenure and other criteria, need to be firmed up more precisely
in a sense; they are still slippery in many ways. I actually hope that
in working with Mort next year and you the following year as Senate President,
that we can give very careful attention to the criteria that we have for
evaluating merit, and promotion and tenure.
<p>Senate President Johnson: Thank you George. Ombudspersons are really
unsung heros on campus and they work on solving conflicts before they become
too large. It is that kind of spirit that makes ASU a very good place to
be.
<p><b>4.&nbsp; Open Forum.</b>
<p>Senator Gully: My faculty have two questions. Before Y2K, the question
was raised that at what point the university would initiate a grading system
that would allow faculty to use plus and minus grades. I would like a status
report on that. The other question is that faculty would like to know if
it would be possible to number the parking places in the parking structures,
so they do not get lost. (Much laughter here).
<p>Past President Burstein: On pluses and minuses, what happened is that
my position on the SAP Executive Committee was transformed more into a
position on another committee to make decisions on SIS and other issues,
and I had been pushing to get the pluses and minuses put into the grading
system.&nbsp; That is finally in the hopper and with any luck at all, it
can be implemented in the next year or two but the problem is that with
the current SIS system, any such change is not trivial. You are talking
easily several man months of work.
<p>Senate President Johnson: Everyone knows, in Business especially, that
when there is a mistake, it is a computer problem. That is our story too,
and we are sticking with it. As far as the numbering the parking places,
there has been a task force to study parking and they have counted every
one of them! They assure me that they are all still there. I will convey
your suggestion to Linda Regal.
<p>Senator Okun: There is a resolution before the Senate which in part
states that we urge the Pac-10 presidents to develop mechanisms to assure
that athletics support the larger academic mission of the university, and
there was an article in the <i>State Press</i> that said the university
will spend an astronomical amount to upgrade three buildings; the Memorial
Union, the Baseball Stadium and the Well Fargo Arena, and I am experiencing
some dissonance over these two issues. I would like to ask someone to address
that.
<p>Provost Glick: All three of those buildings are auxilliary functions.
They are required to be self-supporting. Whether they are able to fund
that is a concern I have. I will reassure you however that the money will
not come from the university general fund.
<p><b>5. Unfinished Business.</b>
<p><b>5.A Executive Committee</b> (Doug Johnson).
<p><b>5.A.1 Senate Motions Approved.</b>
<br>We are pleased to note that President Coor has responded and signed
all the Senate motions this year.
<p><b>5.A.2 Annual Reports</b>.
<br>Standing Committee Reports are due in the Senate Office by mid-May.
They should be limited to a one-page summary that we will posted to the
Academic Senate web page.
<p><b>6. New Business.</b>
<p><b>6.A Executive Committee</b> (Doug Johnson).
<p><b>6.A.1 Senate Motion #13 (2000-2001)</b> Request for Senate Representation.
<p>A letter was received from Christina Stage, Director of the Bachelor
of Independent Studies Program, which requested that the BIS program be
represented in the Academic Senate. This letter was distributed with the
agenda via email before the meeting. Their unit is composed entirely of
lecturers and senior lecturers with multiple year contracts, who have been
added as voting members of the Academic Assembly this year. The BIS is
an academic program that grants degrees. There are nine faculty in that
unit are not represented currently by other departments or colleges on
campus. The Executive Committee unanimously voted to bring this matter
before the Senate.
<p>Senator Roosa: Not to cast dispersions on the faculty members who made
this request, I take it that this is sending a message that the Senate
is just admitting another watered down academic program.
<p>Senate President Johnson: The quality of the program is a separate issue
from the recognition of the unit.
<p>Senator Roosa: The more permanent you make a program, they are no longer
separate issues.
<p>Senate President Johnson: The merits of a particular academic program
or any academic program should be discussed and evaluated by the faculty.
Making them a part of this body is a mechanism for improved academic communication.
<p>Senator Karady: Are there any full time faculty members associated with
this program?
<p>Senate President Johnson: This unit is composed of nine lecturers. In
the BIS program they do communicate with many units on campus, but they
are not represented by any of those units. Let me ask your pleasure on
this item. We are at the last meeting of the year. We can wait to vote
on this item until the first meeting of the fall semester, or we can suspend
the rules today. Do I hear a motion to suspend the rules to allow a vote
today? Motion was made and seconded to suspend the rules to allow voting
on the BIS request for Senate membership. A motion to suspend the rules
is not debatable. It does require a two thirds vote to carry the motion.
Following a show hands, the motion to suspend failed for a lack of a two-thirds
majority. This item will appear for a second reading on the agenda for
the first fall meeting.
<p><b>6.A.2 Senate Resolution #2 (200-2001) on Athletics.</b>
<p>Before you there is a copy of Senate Resolution #2 on athletics (distributed
at the meeting). This resolution comes to us from the Senate Presidents
of the Pac-10 universities. This is an initial effort by the Pac-10 Senate
Presidents to act on issues of common interest. Miles Brandt, president
of Indiana University has proposed that university presidents should become
active in insuring that academics are our main focus and that athletics
play a support role. The resolution comes to you from our Executive Committee
as an action item.
<p>Senator Moore: I move that we suspend the rules so we can vote.
<p>Senate President Johnson: The motion has been made and seconded to suspend
the rules. It is not debatable. Following a show of hands, the motion to
suspend passed with a two-thirds majority..
<p>Faculty Athletic Representative Kingston: At President Coor?s request,
I attended a videoconference with him this morning of the CEOs of the Pac-10
Conference. They have already this morning begun a dialogue, and I am here
to report for President Coor that this item has already been placed on
their agenda, and it will be a continuing agenda item until the next Pac-10
presidents meeting in June.
<p>Senate President Johnson: Thank you for that report. I think this is
an important issue to the faculty and we need to have our voice on record
and encourage President Coor to agressively pursue the intent of this motion.
Are there further comments?
<p>Senator Brown: Is the original article available that you received?
(Senate President Johnson will send it to him).
<p>Senate President Johnson: Hearing no objections, we will move to a vote.
The motion carried.
<p>We have a request from Senator Cobas to reorder the agenda.&nbsp; Agreed.
<p><b>6.B Personnel Committee</b> (Jose Cobas).
<p>The Personnel Committee met and heard the report of the Task Force on
Promotion and Tenure. The committee will consider the document prior to
the first fall meeting of the Senate and make its recommendations at that
meeting.
<p><b>6.C Committee on Committee</b> (Brent Brown).
<p>I am happy to report there is no further report beyond the results of
the election, and you should now fill out your ballot for the standing
committees (distributed at the meeting). Thank you for a good year, and
Dr. Betsy Burns will chair the committee in the Fall.
<p><b>6.D Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee</b> (Michael Mayer).
<p><b>6.D.1 Information Items</b> (Senate action not required).
<p>1) A curricular proposal from the College of Education, Division of
Curriculum &amp; Instruction to <u>change the name of a concentration</u>,
MEd in Special Education from Severely/Multiply Handicapped to <u>Severely/Multiply
Disabled.</u>
<p>2) A proposal from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Department
of Mathematics, to <u>establish a concentration in the BS Degree Mathematics:
Statistics.</u>
<p><b>6.D.2 Action Item</b> (First Reading).
<p><b>Senate Motion #12 (2000-2001)</b> was introduced . "The Curriculum
and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of
a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences <u>to
change the name of a degree program</u> from BS in Computer Science to
<u>BS
in Computational Mathematical Sciences</u>."
<p><b>Rationale: </b>The proposed CMS degree is the natural evolution of
Computer Science for students interested in C.S. within the framework of
a rich curriculum provided by a Liberal Arts and Sciences training. Under
the reformulation of the degree, students are able to combine strong quantitative
and computational training with the development of fundamental skills in
one or more areas of the life<font face="Times"> </font>existing facility
resources and expertise in CLAS; specifically in the Department of Mathematics
or physical sciences. In particular, the ability to combine these skills
with the life sciences responds to the national need for scientists qualified
for professions in the new technologies and developments emerging in computational
molecular biology, genetics, protemics and biomaterials. Moreover, this
refocus of the degree to Computational Mathematical Sciences is accomplished
by utilizing.
<p>Senate President Johnson: Is there discussion on this item?&nbsp; Hearing
no motion to suspend the rules, we will automatically place this item on
the agenda of the first fall Senate meeting.
<p><b>6.E&nbsp; Student-Faculty Policy Committee</b> (Craig Allen).
<p>At our last meeting we heard the report of the Task Force on Promotion
and Tenure that the Personnel Committee will now take over from here. One
thing to be thinking about over the summer, is how people who do creative
projects, not traditional research, are going to be peer reviewed. The
area of scholarly research has opened up to include creative projects,
but in turn there needs to be a peer review process on that as rigorous
as the one for research published in academic journals. At that meeting,
we also heard from Alex Bainbridge an update on the course evaluation program.
He did not say this, but I am that it is likely you will never have to
deal with ASASU course evaluation in the class again. They are turning
to an online system to handle all of that.
<p>Senate President Johnson: I think the online evaluation system will
avoid some of the paperwork that we face in the classrooms; we have many
evaluations that need to be completed by students in the classroom. I think
that is a positive change. The Promotion and Tenure issue will be on the
Senate Agenda for the first time in the fall. We decided it was not wise
to rush it through at the end of this semester. We want to allow ample
time for discussion in the fall.
<p><b>6.G University Affairs Committee </b>(Renu Sharma).
<p>Ginny Sylvester from the University Libraries met with the committee
and then with the Senate on the services that the Interlibrary Loan can
provide. We met for the last time today and named Gary Marchant as the
member who will convene the committee in the fall.
<p><b>6.H Governance Grievance Committee</b> (George Karady).
<p>We have no report at this time (applause here). Last year we had two
issues that we discussed. I am serving as chair for a second year, and
I have observed that most of the time the grievance committees do not have
a great deal to do. I think it would be wise to consider whether the three
grievance committees should be combined into one committee (Board on Equal
Opportunity, Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure and Governance Grievance
Commttee). It should probably have a vice chair as well as a chair, to
preside over hearings if there is more work to do. One advantage of this
would be that there would be greater uniformity of the hearing process
and it would serve the grievant better as well.
<p>Senate President Johnson: Thank you for the proposal and we will place
that suggestion on the agenda for the coming year. The committee grievance
process is an important one that insures that the policies of the university
work smoothly. It is difficult to predict in any year how heavy the workload
will be. We have seen major changes in the committee process, particularly
the change in policy that allows attorneys to participate fully in hearings.
The nature of these hearings is evolving very rapidly. At the least, a
review of the procedures for dealing with that is in order.
<p><b>6.I Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure</b> (Joan McGregor for
Brian Gratton).
<p>I am a member and represent Brian Gratton who could not be here today.
There is not a lot to report this time. We met a number of times in the
fall on one grievance. The committee did a thorough reveiew and it ended
in the appropriate way. This semester we handled four grievances.
<p><b>7.&nbsp; Passing of the Gavel.</b>
<p>Senate President Johnson gave Dr. Munk the gavel. Dr. Munk said he will
try to serve the Senate and the university, and do as well as Dr. Johnson
did this year.
<p>Senate President Munk: It is appropriate that we reflect back on Doug?s
term and I know the time is limited. I will not scrutinize his record under
the microscope but rather I speak generally about it. A couple of things
came across my desk recently reminded me of Doug as President-elect of
the Senate. The first is a story told by the violinst Isaac Stern who was
attending a charity reception in New York City. As he was wandering around
in New York he ran into the boxer Muhummad Ali. They struck up a conversation
and it turns out they had never met before but Isaac Stern recognized Muhammad
Ali. Muhammad Ali did not however recognize Isaac Stern. At one point in
the coversation, Isaac Stern said you might say that you and I are in the
same business, we both earn our living with our hands. Muhammad Ali stepped
back, took a look at Isaac Stern, up one side and down the other and said,
"You must be pretty good at what you do because you do not have a mark
on you!" That reminded me of Doug, he is pretty good at what he does and
he does not have a mark on him.
<p>Another thing that reminds me of Doug, is a song I heard once?<i>I?ve
Been Everywhere</i>?I don?t know if you have ever seen his daily calendar,
but it has more appointments and committee meetings on it than Baskin and
Robbins has flavors. I do not know how he does it; perhaps he has violated
the law of Physics about being in two places at the same time. Either that,
or there may have been a virtual Doug Johnson at these meetings.
<p>On a more serious note, we have been fortunate this past year to have
someone as dedicated and effective as Doug Johnson as Senate President.
He has had a long and significant record of contributions to the university.
Doug referred to our health insurance process as heartburn, but I want
to go on record as the third person to commend him, I think we all owe
him a debt of gratitude for the devotion that he gave to this issue, to
craft the very best possible health insurance plan under a system of very
serious constraints that we had to work with. There were many other issues
that he addressed directly: the Whistleblower issue, the Arizona Regents
University, and the Power of Technology Series. Doug had a hand and was
deeply involved in all of these and as a result we all benefitted.
<p>Doug, now that you will be spending a little more time back in your
unit, Accountancy and Information Management, we thought we would try to
do something to help you get up to speed. I talked to my accountant about
picking up some state of the art item to give you. He came up with one
(AN ABACUS), but it does not have directions. I thought to myself, if this
is the state of the art technology for accountants, then people in your
unit really have a lot of work to do (much laughter here). (Dr. Johnson:
This is a dot com phenomenon!)&nbsp; Back to Dr. Munk: I wonder after looking
at what my accountant gave me, maybe that is why I have had so many problems
with the IRS. There is one other item. I thought you were going to talk
to Dr. Glick about establishing your office as Past President in the new
Brickyard Complex in downtown Tempe. (Dr. Johnson: Either there or in the
Social Sciences building.)&nbsp; Back to Dr. Munk: I thought that would
be a good view from there. We did actually get you another gift. You will
be out and about and so you will need this (a leather portfolio).
<p>One other item that we want to share with you is a plaque to recognize
your contributions.
<p>Dr. Munk read the plate inscription: For leadership in the Arizona Faculties
Council, at the state legislature and the Board of Regents meetings; guidance
on the promotion and tenure guidelines; navigating the health insurance
crisis, and bringing us the Power of Technology workshops (teaching techniques
in cyberspace) that was supported by Duane Roen and staff, and taught by
a number of our faculty experts and for many more activities than this
plaque could ever list.
<p>The hour is getting late, and I want to wish you all a pleasant and
productive summer and I look forward to working with all of you next fall,
and with that we stand adjourned.
