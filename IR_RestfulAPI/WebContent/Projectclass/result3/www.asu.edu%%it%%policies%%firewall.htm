			<h2>Firewall Implementation Policy</h2>
			
			<strong>FIREWALL IMPLEMENTATION POLICY   
			(<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>)<acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym></strong> 
				
			<p>Although Datacomm has been working diligently to implement a firewall network architecture 
			at the ASU network border, the implementation of the network devices alone will do little 
			to alleviate the security problems that have beleaguered the ASU network.  As implemented, 
			the firewall will initially be set to allow all traffic to/from the ASU network.  At this 
			time, the intention for blocking traffic via the firewall is to only block when a particular 
			system is actively attacking the ASU network, or when an ASU system is scanning or attacking 
			an outside entity.</p>
		
			
			<p>To work through the issues involved with a general blocking of network traffic at the border, 
			Datacomm brought the issue to the UNCEL committee.  An UNCEL sub-committee reviewed several 
			different methodologies of firewall implementation and presented their findings and 
			recommendations to the UNCEL committee at the October 16, 2002 UNCEL meeting.  
			These methodologies are: </p> 
		
			
			<p>1.	Distributed firewall implementation. Implement a firewall at the network entry point 
			to every building.  The firewall at the ASU network border would remain as the method for 
			blocking active attacks from outside of ASU.</p>
		
			<p>Benefits -</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Distributes the firewall processing 
			throughout the network.</li>
			<li>Protects workstations/servers from 
			internal attacks as well as from off-campus attacks.</li>
			</ul>
		
			
			<p>Concerns -</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Costs (both HW and HR) for implementation</li>
			<li>Implementation policies/methods, given more than one unit 
			may reside in each building.</li>
			</ul>
			
		 
			
			<p>2.	Segment the network into a workstation segment and a server segment.  Use the 
			border firewall to block all traffic to the workstation segment, and all but relational 
			traffic to each server.</p>
		
			
			<p>Benefits -</p> 
			<ul>
			<li>Eases management of firewall once implemented, i.e, 
			only server segment would need ongoing management.</li>
			<li>Highly secure for workstation segment (from Internet attacks)</li>
			</ul>
		
				 
			<p>Concerns - </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Costs (both HW and HR) for implementation.  A complete switched 
			network would be needed for this implementation, VLAN's would need to be set up and 
			managed on all ports.</li>
			<li>Highly restrictive.  No outside 
			source traffic would be allowed to the workstation segment.  A request would need to 
			be made to change a workstation network connection over to the server segment.</FONT></li>
			<li>Does not protect workstations from internal attacks.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<p>3.	General &quot;Service&quot; blocking at the border, i.e., block individual and most 
			problematic services (e.g., FTP, HTTP, NBSessions) at the border firewall, allowing 
			exceptions to individual workstations/servers as requested by units.</p>
		
			
			<p>Benefits -</p> 
			<ul>
			<li>Allows for timely implementation - can be done now!</li>
			<li>Allows for flexibility</li>
			<li>Ability to quickly implement new blocking of port(s) 
			based on new attacks/Trojans</li>
			<li>Can be used as a stop-gap measure to one of the other implementations.</li>
			</ul>
		
				
			<p>Concerns -</p> 
			<ul>
			<li>Does not block all known ports, 
			especially non-standard or dynamic ports which can, and are, also used for legitimate 
			purposes and for some attacks.</li>
			<li>Cost of HR for implementation period (i.e., setting up exceptions)</li>
			<li>Does not protect workstations from internal attacks.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<p>Findings:</p> 
		
			  
			<p>1) It is not feasible at this time to implement firewalls at every building or to implement 
			a fully switched environment that we can use to segment the workstations and servers onto 
			different VLans.  As such, if there is to be any port blocking at the border firewall in 
			the near future, it will have to be one service at a time and may not ever cover dynamic 
			ports (at the border).  We should move forward with what we can - which is to block the 
			ports that cause us the most problems from off-campus attacks.</p>
		
			
			<p>2) A process is necessary for recommending/approving the services that should be blocked 
			at the firewall, prior to implementation.</p>
		
			  
			<p>3) The other methodologies should also be pursued for the university as security priorities, 
			given the proper resources can be allocated for such purposes.</p>
			
			
			<p>As a result of these findings, the UNCEL committee requests the following:</p>
			
			
			<p>1.	Approval for implementation of a program to block individual services at the border 
			firewall.  This implementation will be in addition to the current plan to block systems 
			actively attacking the ASU network, or when an ASU system is scanning or attacking an 
			outside entity.   IT will perform all firewall management, and will include exceptions to 
			each blocked service as requested by units (within the parameters specified below).</p>
			
			
			<p>NOTE: UNCEL would like to be clear that this step towards securing the ASU network border 
			is not considered a final implementation of firewall technologies.  The other two 
			methodologies listed are still security priorities and should also be pursued.  In addition, 
			UNCEL will be pursuing other security options in the future, such as personal workstation 
			firewalls, etc.</p>
		
			
			<p>2.	Approval for the individual service blocking identification and approval process, 
			as outlined below:</p>
		
			
			<p>a.	The UNCEL firewall sub-committee will identify an initial list of services to block, 
			in order of recommended implementation by security impact at the university, and will present 
			to UNCEL Administrative Representatives for approval.</p>
		
			
			<p>b.	UNCEL Administrative Representatives will review and approve/disapprove the list 
			and order of implementation by majority vote, with changes or addendums as necessary.</p>
		
			
			<p>c.	The service blocking list will be forwarded to IT for implementation.  IT will:</p> 
			<ul>
			<li>Implement only one service or 
			service-set at a time, in the order approved by UNCEL.</li>
			<li>Announce upcoming service blocking 
			at least two-weeks prior to implementation, with a full description of impacts, work-arounds, 
			and/or process to obtain exceptions.  The announcement will be made to the Outages list and 
			to the UNCEL distribution list. <strong>UNCEL Representatives will be responsible for acting as a 
			conduit for this information to their units.</strong></li>
			<li>Allow exceptions to every service 
			blocking.  However, exceptions will be granted on an all-or-nothing basis, e.g., if a user 
			wants an exception for the FTP service to their server, all FTP traffic from all sources 
			will be allowed.  No individual sources will be entered in the exception.  Exceptions 
			requests received prior to the service blocking will be implemented at the time of blocking.  
			New requests can be made through the IT Help Desk and will be implemented in accordance with 
			regular processing priorities.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<p>d.	Once the services on the approved list have been blocked, IT or individual 
			units will bring proposals for other service blocking at the border firewall to UNCEL 
			for approval.  Any approved service blocking will be passed to IT for implementation.</p> 
			
			
			
			  
			<p>Responsible Organization:</p>
			
			<p>The Office of the CIO and Vice Provost will be responsible for this policy and for any 
			appeals of UNCEL decisions relating to Firewall Implementation.</p> 
			
			<p>This policy will be reviewed yearly by UNCEL and the Office of the CIO.</p> 
			
			<p>Changes will be authorized by recommendation of the Office of the CIO and approval of the Provost.</p> 
			
		
			
			<p>Policy was last revised May 15, 2003.</p>
			
			<p>Approved<br />
