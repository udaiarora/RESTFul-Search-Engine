      <h2>Plus/minus grading set for implementation in 2004</h2>
      <p>        Following a recommendation by the Academic Senate, and with input from
          the Associated Students of ASU, President Michael Crow has approved
          a plus/minus grading system to take effect with the Fall 2004 semester
        grades. </p>
      <p>The new plus/minus grading, which gives faculty more flexibility
            in assessing student performance, includes a top grade of A+ (4.33),
            in addition to
          A (4.0), A- (3.67), B+ (3.33), B (3.0), B- (2.67), and C+ (2.33), C
        (2.0), D (1.0) and E (0.0). </p>
      <p>"The implementation of this new system provides
          greater flexibility, but it is not mandatory for faculty to use plus/minus
          in their grading,"
          says Crow.</p>
      <p>The Academic Senate, which is advisory to the president, provided
          its recommendations in writing in a memo dated May 31. In the memo,
        then Senate President George Watson, outlined in detail the rationale
        behind
          the Senate recommendation, as well as the exhaustive process, which
        had included, he felt, ample opportunity for student and faculty input.
        The
          Senate recommended a plus/minus grading system with the top grade of
          A and bottom grade of C.</p>
      <p>Students, through their elected student government
          officers, expressed concern that their voice had not been adequately
          heard, prompting a petition
          campaign that resulted in nearly 4,000 student signatures opposing
        the Senate recommendation. With that unprecedented level of response
        from
          students, Crow felt it was only fair to take their concerns into careful
          consideration as he studied the plus/minus issue.</p>
      <p>"The students made a
          very strong argument that they would be disadvantaged, compared to
        students attending other state schools, without the addition
          of the A+ option," says Crow. </p>
      <p>The main concern expressed by students
          was that, without the A+, students would have no way to offset an A-
          grade on their GPA, effectively punishing
          top students and putting some in peril of losing scholarships requiring
          a 3.5 GPA. </p>
      <p>"I'm pleased the president has approved the plus/minus system
          recommended by the Academic Senate," Watson says. "The addition of
        the A+ grade,
          while not approved by the Senate, is a reasonable recognition of the
          counterproposal by the students. I would have done the same thing in
          his shoes." </p>
      <p>The students had also expressed a desire to include the plus/minus
          option in the entire grading system, which would have meant allowing
          C-, D+,
          and D-. Crow, with considerable input from Executive Vice President
        and Provost Milton Glick, said it would not be in the university's best
        interest
          to implement plus/minus options below the C grade level. </p>
      <p>"A 'C' average
          is necessary for graduation and to gain acceptance into certain programs
          and courses, and, in my opinion, it is not acceptable
          for a student with all Cs to lose eligibility due to one grade of C-,"
          says Crow.</p>
      <p>Crow says his final decision takes into account all of the
          major concerns and issues that had been raised.</p>
      <p>"The new grading system addresses the
          desire by faculty to have greater flexibility in evaluating and motivating
          student performance. With the
          addition of the A+ option, it also provides students with additional
          opportunity to excel and gain a reward for their extra effort.</p>
      <p>"I believe
          this is the best decision for all concerned, and I appreciate the input
          from all of the groups engaged in this process," Crow says.</p>
      <p>Watson
          agrees that the end result is a grading system that will improve the
          accuracy of grading and serve as a substantial incentive for students
          to achieve a higher performance level. </p>
      <p>He adds, "At the same time, it
          places ASU more in line with other universities across the nation and
          gives greater credibility to our grading system."</p>
      <p>Antonio
          Garcia, associate professor of bioengineering and incoming president
          for the Academic senate, says he anticipates future discussion over
        the newly implemented grading system.</p>
      <p>"In 2007, a university-wide committee
          that will include the Academic Senate will review the implementation
          of the new grading system," he
        says.</p>
