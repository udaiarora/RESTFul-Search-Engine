      <h2>Goodbye, anonymity. . . hello, togetherness</h2>
      <p>        Many freshmen in ASU's residence halls have a new appreciation for "togetherness"
          this fall. They are not only living together, they take classes together,
          many of them taught right in the halls. Their professors sometimes
      visit, and their advisers are next door.</p>
      <p>Wait a minute . . . where's
            the anonymity they've been hoping for since high school? <br>
        It's been replaced by a community structure that colleges throughout
          the country have found not only helps students make the transition
            to college life better, it helps them learn better.</p>
      <p>Freshmen who chose the
          living-learning concept are grouped in the residence halls with other
          freshmen who have the same major. And because they are
          part of ASU's Freshman Year Experience program, many of their classes
          are taught in the residence hall classrooms, and their advisers keep
        office hours in the halls, too.</p>
      <p>They are encouraged to study together
          and to develop friendships, discussing outside of class what they learn
          in the classroom. Studies have found
          that students do better when they have peer support, and they connect
        their learning to the real world.</p>
      <p>ASU began offering one or two communities
          about 10 years ago. The program has expanded since then, until this
        fall for the first time, every college
          at ASU will offer incoming freshmen a learning community in one of
        the residence halls. </p>
      <p>The College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences (CLAS) is
        plunging dramatically into the living-learning concept in a new way this
        fall by not only grouping
        students on one floor, but also providing them clusters of courses organized
        around a common theme. Freshmen live together in Palo Verde West and
        take courses designed around one of these topics: "War, Culture and Memory,"
        "Multicultural America: History, Gender, Ethnicity" or "Human Disease
      and Society."</p>
      <p>The first is a four-course cluster examining the important
          consequences of World War II (fall semester) and the Vietnam War (spring
          semester)
          on shaping the United States and the world. The courses are taught
        by professors from history, English, religious studies and political
        science.
          The second investigates America's multicultural past, and the third
        looks at the diseases that have ravaged mankind and their implications
        for
        society. </p>
      <p>"We believe this is the best way to pursue in-depth learning
          and allow students to master a coherent body of material," says Dan
        Bivona, CLAS
          associate dean for academic programs who helped design the program.
        "All the writing assignments will be built around topics related to the
        main
          theme. Every cluster offers students multiple opportunities to engage
        in small-group discussions with faculty and to interact with one another."</p>
      <p>Students
          also get together outside the classroom. Faculty from "War, Culture
        and Memory" have lunch with the students in the cluster every
          Monday, for instance. "Human Disease and Society" students may get
        to attend "grand rounds" at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale at least once
        during the semester.</p>
      <p>The College of Nursing has initiated a freshman living-learning
          community this fall to encourage pre-nursing students to help and support
          each
          other, raising the likelihood of success in the rigorous curriculum.
          Getting into the nursing professional program in the junior year is
        very competitive, strong GPAs are a must, and freshmen may not realize
        the
        importance of hitting the books from the start.</p>
      <p>"This will help provide
          students the resources they need to succeed, and will broaden their
        perspective of nursing," says Mary Killeen, associate
          dean of nursing. "Students often come with a very narrow view of the
          profession. We've planned a program of events, including meeting the
          dean, the faculty and nurses in the field who can share their career
          journeys. In addition, we'll link them to tutoring and advising, and
        provide a road map to guide their sophomore year."</p>
      <p>Freshmen from the W.
          P. Carey School of Business take up five floors of Manzanita Hall,
        while engineering freshmen live on four floors. Education
          and nursing majors each occupy one floor. McClintock Hall groups freshmen
          majoring in architecture, public programs and fine arts. The Barrett
        Honors College in Center Complex is a learning community of its own.</p>
