The program is designed to achieve regulatory compliance and provides a means for employees to be better informed about and protected from hazardous chemicals.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Responsibilities of Environmental Health & Safety</b></font><p>Environmental Health & Safety develops, implements, and maintains the university&#146;s hazard communication program, provides employee training, and promotes regulatory compliance and employee health and safety.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Responsibilities of Departments</b></font><p>Departments and units must identify employees who may be exposed to hazardous chemicals, and provide these employees the protections required by the hazard communication program.  Departments and units are also responsible for informing outside contractors of hazardous chemicals their employees may be exposed to within their designated work area at ASU.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Responsibilities of Outside Contractors</b></font><p>Contractors must inform ASU of any hazardous chemicals used in the performance of their work at ASU and have Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) (see <a href="ehsweblinks.html">Related Web Links</a> on the Environmental Health & Safety Web site) available onsite for each chemical used.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Responsibilities of Employees</b></font><p>Employees who use chemicals during the performance of their duties must use safe work practices, use appropriate personal protective equipment, attend hazard communication training, and comply with all provisions of the hazard communication program.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Hazard Communication Plan</b></font><p>The core of the university&#146;s hazard communication program is the Hazard Communication Plan, which contains the following elements:<ol type="1"><li>identifying hazardous chemicals</li><br><li>establishing an employee information and training program on the potential hazards associated with chemicals in the workplace</li><br><li>establishing a chemical inventory</li><br><li>acquiring, distributing, and maintaining an MSDS for each chemical used</li><br><li>maintaining a container labeling system</li><br><li>developing emergency procedures<br><br>and</li><br><li>establishing record keeping and program evaluation procedures.</li></ol><p>This plan must be readily available to employees, employee representatives, and regulatory agencies.<p>The plan and required training provide the foundation for the university&#146;s hazard communication compliance program.  Training schedules and copies of the plan can be obtained from Environmental Health & Safety at 480&#047;965&#150;1823 or e-mail <a href="mailto:ehs@asu.edu">ehs@asu.edu</a>.<p><img src="ehshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule] WIDTH="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="ehshr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule] WIDTH="100%" height="2"><p>For further information, see:<p><ol><li><a href="ehs105.html">EHS 105</a>, &#147;Personal Protective Equipment&#148;</li><p><li><a href="ehs107.html">EHS 107</a>, &#147;Respiratory Protection&#148; <p>and</li><p><li><a href="ehs108-01.html">EHS 108&#150;01</a>, &#147;Health and Safety Training.&#148;</li></ol> <p>&#160;<font color=#FFFFFF>skip navigation bar</font><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">EHS</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | Environmental&#160;Health&#160;&&#160;Safety&#160;Web&#160;<a href="ehs.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
