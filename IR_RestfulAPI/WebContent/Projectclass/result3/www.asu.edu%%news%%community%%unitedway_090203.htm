      <h2>      Big Sister of the Year helps launch ASU United Way drive</h2>
      <p>        Karina Bland joined the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America program seven
          years ago hoping to make a difference in the life of a young girl,
        but had no idea what a monumental change she would see in her own life.</p>
      <p>Bland,
            an ASU alumna, recently shared her experiences as a Big Sister at
        the kick-off breakfast for this year's ASU United Way campaign, which
          runs through Oct. 15. The program is one of hundreds depending on funding
          through the Valley of the Sun United Way.</p>
      <p>"Crystal was just seven when
          I met her but she already knew what it is like to have no place to
        live and not enough to eat, that drugs can turn
          a good father into an absent one, and a woman on her own has to work
          hard to keep four kids," Bland says. </p>
      <p>Bland enjoyed a happy, prosperous
          childhood and knew nothing of those things, but it didn't matter. She
          and Crystal were still a perfect match.
          Crystal is now 14, and the pair is closer than many genetically related
          sisters. Bland was chosen as the 2002 National Big Sister of the Year
          by Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.</p>
      <p>As a reporter for The Arizona
          Republic, Bland covers child welfare issues like child abuse, foster
          care, child poverty and juvenile justice.</p>
      <p>"The
          children I write about are covered with bruises and cigarette burns,
          their bones broken and their innocence stolen, most often by the very
          people who are supposed to love them the most," she says.</p>
      <p>Bland admits
          she needed Crystal in her life as much as Crystal needed her.</p>
      <p>"Sure, she was poor, and her short life had been real tough," Bland
          says. "But she was healthy and happy and whole. And I could do something
          for
          her - I could save her."</p>
      <p>Bland has introduced her little sister to her
          first museum, her first concert and her first plane ride. She has attended
          all of her dance recitals
          and most violin concerts, softball and volleyball games. Bland says
        Crystal has taught her to enjoy the little things.</p>
      <p>"I've slowed down, listened
          to more music, watched more G-rated movies and eaten more ice cream,"
          she says. "I ride more elevators and escalators,
          just for fun. Crystal makes me look in pet store windows and braids
        my hair."</p>
      <p>Bland says her little sister has woven her way into her life as
          firmly as if she had been her natural born sister. </p>
      <p>"Crystal was the first to
          make my son, Sawyer, laugh out loud," she says. "She is his big sister.
          She is in our family portraits." </p>
      <p>Bland says becoming
          a Big Sister is one of the best decisions she has ever made, and encourages
          others to get involved in the Big Brother Big
        Sisters program.</p>
      <p>"Crystal is smart," Bland says. "She's beautiful and
          kind. She makes me laugh. I am her biggest fan. I believe she can do
          anything and because
          I believe it, so does she."<br>
