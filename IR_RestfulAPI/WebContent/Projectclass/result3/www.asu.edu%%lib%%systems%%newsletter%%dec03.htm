            Web Site Survey Welcomes Staff and Patron Input</h3>
          <p align="left">The Libraries Web Development and Management Team has 
            recently developed an online survey to find out what our users think 
            of the libraries&#8217; web site. This is part of a project to redesign 
            the entire site. We encourage staff to fill out the survey too, so 
            please help us in our efforts by taking a few minutes to respond to 
            the survey at <a href="http://webcom.lib.asu.edu/webcom/pages/commentform.php">http://webcom.lib.asu.edu/webcom/pages/commentform.php</a> 
            (or follow the link from the library home page). You can also follow 
            the Web Team&#8217;s progress at our web site, <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/digilib/webgroup/">http://www.asu.edu/lib/digilib/webgroup/</a>.

          <h3 align="left">SOS Reminder</h3>
          <p align="left">When transferring a phone call from a patron with a 
            technical problem to LIST for assistance, please remember to use the 
            SOS line, 5-9093. The SOS desk is staffed many more hours per day 
            than the department reception desk, and SOS personnel will be able 
            to help the caller with their issue. Calling SOS first will also save 
            the caller from being transferred again or getting the department&#8217;s 
            voice mail.<br>
            <br>

          <h3 align="left">New Database Available</h3>
          <p align="left"> A new database has been put online (<a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/top-menus/new.html">http://www.asu.edu/lib/top-menus/new.html</a>):</p>
          <p align="left"><strong><u>Television News Archive (free IP based access)</u></strong><br>
            This collection is the world's most extensive and complete archive 
            of television news. It holds more than 30,000 individual network evening 
            news broadcasts from the major U.S. national broadcast networks: ABC, 
            CBS, NBC, and CNN, and more than 9,000 hours of special news-related 
            programming including ABC's Nightline since 1989. These special reports 
            and periodic news broadcasts cover presidential press conferences 
            and political campaign coverage, and national and international events. 
            Material in the archive can be identified for use through the TV-NewsSearch 
            Database. You can request a loan of broadcast segments compiled on 
            videotape. Fees apply for this service.</p>

            Ask LIST</h3>
          <p align="left"> <em>Please send questions on any library technology 
            topic to Heather Knowles to be answered in future columns.</em></p>
          <p align="left"><strong>Q. <em>&quot;Lately, a lot of the web sites 
            I look at don&#8217;t seem to display correctly. Is there something 
            wrong with my computer?&quot;</em></strong></p>
          <p align="left"><strong>A.</strong> This is probably a problem with 
            your browser, not your computer. If you have seen web sites that appear 
            arbitrarily cut off, that have strange fonts or font sizes, or that 
            fail to display at all, you probably need to upgrade your browser. 
            The current versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator (6.x 
            and 7.x, respectively) support most of the latest features that web 
            sites are being designed with. If you want to experience web sites 
            the way their creators intended, you&#8217;ve got to keep your browser 
            up to date. So please, if you&#8217;re still using Netscape Communicator 
            4.x, do yourself a favor and switch to Internet Explorer or download 
            the latest version of Netscape! As always, Keith Swartz is available 
            to help if you need assistance.<br>
            <br>
          </p><br>
          <h3 align="left">Feedback</h3>

        Your feedback is always appreciated. Please send questions, comments, or suggestions to 
Heather Knowles through Outlook or by calling 5-2421.
