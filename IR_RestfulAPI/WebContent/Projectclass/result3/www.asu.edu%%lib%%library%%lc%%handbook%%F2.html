                  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                  <p></P>
                  <P><br>
                  ASU Libraries emphasize strategic planning and goal setting which are designed to fulfill the mission statement of the system and improve organizational and individual performance. Each department, and ideally each unit within a department, also develops goals and objectives to support and fulfill its portion of the Libraries' mission statement. On the individual level, each academic professional is an integral part of meeting those goals.</P>
                 <br> <P>
                  Therefore, the formulation of individual goals is not only an exercise to facilitate writing the self-review, but is evidence of the individual's contribution to the achievements of the ASU Libraries. Individual goals provide the framework for one's performance; activities in meeting those goals provide the basis for performance evaluation. Because of the fluid nature of position responsibilities it is an organizational necessity that emphasis within a position will fluctuate and goals will change from year to year.</P>
                   <br> <P>
                <h3>
                  FORMULATING GOALS</h3>
                  <p></P>
                  <P><br>
                  Since individual goals are dependent upon organization goals, it is assumed that the academic professional, through the primary evaluator, will be knowledgeable concerning library and department goals. This knowledge will mandate that individual goals will not be created in complete isolation; however, the academic professional is responsible for actually formulating goals. Goals will be written by the academic professional and may reflect advisement by appropriate supplementary evaluators following the procedures in <A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/lib/library/lc/handbook/G1_2.html"> &#32;<I>Librarians' Handbook</I>, G.1.2</A>. The primary evaluator will provide final judgment and guidance on the entire goals document.</P>
                  <OL TYPE=1>
                    <LI>
                      <P>Relation to the Position Description.</P>
                      <P>The initial step in setting goals is to analyze both the academic professional's current position description and past activities to identify basic responsibilities, what is actually done, and what is most important. As the position description changes (&#32;<A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/lib/library/lc/handbook/F1.html"> &#32;<I>Librarians' Handbook</I>, F.1</A> &#32;), goals should also change. Goals should include the specific responsibilities listed in the position description, but will also reflect other innovative and/or creative activity.
                      </P><br>
                    <LI>
                      <P>Relation to Criteria</P>
                      <P>Goals should fall into categories that match the <A HREF="/lib/library/lc/handbook/E2.html">criteria</A> for Retention, Continuing Appointment, and Promotion. The major portion will cover Job Performance and may range from goals dealing with the regular and ordinary tasks which have been done in the past, i.e., maintenance goals, to goals which address problems, are innovative, and create new situations. The statement of basic maintenance goals is critical to insure balance in the overall performance plan for the year. The same spectrum will apply to Professional Activities and to Service goals. A goal may extend beyond one review period as a work-in-progress statement; a goal may include activities which will fall into more than one area of concentration.
                      </P><br>
                    <LI>
                      <P>Priorities</P>
                      <P>The academic professional's goals statement should clearly reflect the priority the academic professional places on each of the goals. During the evaluation, the academic professional and primary evaluator should reach a mutual understanding regarding the relative importance of each goal, the time commitment involved, impact on the departmental goals, and standards for accomplishment.
                      </P><br>
                    <LI>
                      <P>Attainability</P>
                      <P>Goals must be realistic and achievable. If goals have conditions not under the academic professional's control, state those conditions. If obstacles to achievement are anticipated, include those with the goals statement. Barriers to achieving goals include:</P>

                        <LI>
                          <P>individual goals set unrealistically high</P>
                        <LI>
                          <P>lack of balance among maintenance and high-visibility goals</P>
                        <LI>
                          <P>staff member diverted from area of responsibility</P>
                        <LI>
                          <P>changed conditions in work unit</P>
                        <LI>

                          <P>insufficient motivation</P>
                        <LI>
                          <P>failure to follow established procedures</P>

                          <P>lack of cooperation among staff or from other units
                          </P><br>

                    <LI>
                      <P>Measurability</P>
                      <P>Goals should have some measurable or observable outcome which can either be quantified or clearly described in narrative form. Examples of quantitative definition include: quantity (amount), rate (amount per time unit), time spent, or completion date. Some goals cannot be measured in quantifiable terms; a qualitative narrative measuring the outcomes by judgment and observation will record achievement.
                      </P><br>
                    <LI>
                      <P>Changes or Revisions</P>
                      <P>When necessary, the primary evaluator and academic professional are encouraged to meet to review the academic professional's progress toward achieving goals at mid-year. While not mandatory, this schedule allows recognition of unanticipated obstacles such as a change in the position description, changes in priorities, department realignments, etc. Formally negotiated amendments to the academic professional's goals statement should be documented, signed and dated by the academic professional, primary evaluator, and the appropriate Associate Dean. The amended statement will become part of the formal evaluation packet.</P>
