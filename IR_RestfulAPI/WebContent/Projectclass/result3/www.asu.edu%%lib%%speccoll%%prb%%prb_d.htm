<P>--. <I>Recollections of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and His Circle</I> (Cheyne
Walk Life). Gale Pedrick, ed. Prefatory note by William Michael Rossetti.
London: Mathews, 1904; New York: AMS P, 1971. Henry Treffry Dunn abandoned
his position as a bank clerk when he was 24 years old and became a painter.
He then took up residency with Rossetti and was fortunate to have a close
association with both Rossetti and those around him, including participation
in &quot;those frequent and prolonged meetings in the dimly-lit studio
at Cheyne Walk, which were famous for their intellectual charm and brilliancy.&quot;
William Michael Rossetti states in his prefatory note that Dunn's recollections
are &quot;perfectly genuine, and give, from the writer's point of view,
a very fair notion of what Dante Rossetti did in those years, and what
he was like.&quot; PRB-84</P>
