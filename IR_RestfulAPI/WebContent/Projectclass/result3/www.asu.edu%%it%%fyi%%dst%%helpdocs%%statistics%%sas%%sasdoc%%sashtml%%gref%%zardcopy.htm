You can print your SAS/GRAPH output
on hardcopy devices such as laser printers and plotters. In addition, you
can send the output to cameras or film recorders.  Regardless of the destination,
there are several ways to produce hardcopy of your SAS/GRAPH output: </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Print
SAS/GRAPH program
output directly to a hardcopy device.<P>

<LI>Print SAS/GRAPH program
output by creating an external file of graphics commands called a graphics
stream file (GSF), saving it to disk, and printing  the file with host commands.<P>

<LI>Print the displayed graph directly from the GRAPH
window or the Graphics Editor window.<P>
</UL>

<P>The following sections provide a general description
of these methods. 
<P><B>Operating Environment Information:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever way
you choose, the exact steps for printing
graphics depend on the hardcopy device you are using and on the environment
in which you are using it. For complete information on printing graphics output
in your operating environment, see the SAS Help facility for SAS/GRAPH and
the  SAS companion for your operating environment.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<img border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom">

 You can send graphics output directly to a hardcopy device by
sending the graphics commands directly to the device or to a device port.</A>
<P>On most systems you can use any of the following methods
to print directly to a device: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Use a FILENAME statement, a GOPTIONS statement,
and a SAS/GRAPH native device driver.
The FILENAME statement defines a fileref that points to the print commands.
The GOPTIONS statement references the fileref, assigns the device, and specifies
any additional parameters.<P>

<LI>Use the GDEVICE procedure to modify a SAS/GRAPH device
entry to spool output directly to a printer. See <A href="z0727621.htm">The GDEVICE Procedure</A> for information on adding host commands
to a device entry.<P>

<LI>Use the host printing interface. (Not all operating
environments support this method.)<P>
</UL>

<P>For detailed instructions on each of these methods,
refer to the SAS Help facility for SAS/GRAPH.

  There are two steps to printing graphics output from an external
file: </A>
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>Save your SAS/GRAPH output
in an external file.  For information on creating external files, see <A href="zport-ov.htm">About Exporting SAS/GRAPH Output</A> and the
SAS Help facility for SAS/GRAPH.<P>

<LI>Print the file from your host environment.  The
host commands vary across operating environments and spooling utilities. See
the SAS companion for your operating environment for more information on printing.<P>
</OL>

<P>You can perform these two steps separately or combine
them by incorporating the host printing commands into your program or device
driver. In any case, you must choose a graphics file format that is compatible
with your hardcopy device.  For example, if you are using a PostScript printer,
be sure to specify one of the PostScript device drivers supplied in SASHELP.DEVICES.
 This technique is frequently used on multi-user systems in which the output
devices are shared.
<P>You can use any of the following methods to create and
print an external file: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Use the FILENAME and GOPTIONS statements to create
the graphics stream file. To route the output directly to the printer, include
the print commands in the SAS/GRAPH statements.
 Otherwise, save the file to disk and use a host command to spool the file
to a spooler for the device.<P>

<LI>Use the GDEVICE procedure to modify a SAS/GRAPH device
driver to save the output to an external file and spool the output directly
to a printer. See <A href="z0727621.htm">The GDEVICE Procedure</A>
for information on modifying device entries.<P>

<LI>Use the host printing interface.  (Not all operating
environments support this method.)<P>

In
some operating environments you can print directly from the GRAPH window or
the Graphics Editor window by using the PRINT command in conjunction with
the TARGETDEVICE= graphics option. To do this, use TARGETDEVICE= to specify
the printer driver and use DEVICE= to specify the driver for the terminal
or display on which you want to preview the output.</A>
<P>The driver specified by TARGETDEVICE= determines the
characteristics of the printed output and sends the graphics output to either
an output device or a graphics stream file.  The driver specified by DEVICE=
controls some characteristics of the output displayed in the window. In some
cases, you may need to use a FILENAME and GOPTIONS statements to define the
destination of the PRINT command. 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have
not previously specified TARGETDEVICE= when you issue the PRINT command in
the window, SAS/GRAPH prompts you for
a device for the printed output. However, in this situation the output that
is sent to the printer reflects the characteristics of the display device
driver.  To ensure that your printed output matches what you see on your display,
always use TARGETDEVICE= with the PRINT command.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<P>For details on printing directly from the GRAPH or Graphics
Editor window, refer to the SAS Help facility for SAS/GRAPH.
See <A href="ztdevice.htm">TARGETDEVICE</A>
for a complete description of TARGETDEVICE=.

<P><A name="z0748106">&#13; If you want to preview how a graph is going
to appear on another
device before you send it to that device, you can use the TARGETDEVICE= graphics
option.  For example, to preview output on your display as it would appear
on a color PostScript printer, include TARGETDEVICE= in a GOPTIONS statement
and specify the driver for the printer:  


</A>
<PRE>goptions targetdevice=pscolor;</PRE>
<P>The output is displayed on your screen using 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>the orientation of the target device. As a result,
the graph may not cover the entire display area of the preview device.<P>

<LI>the values of either the LCOLS and LROWS pair
or the PROWS and PCOLS pair, depending on the orientation of the target device.<P>

<LI>the default colors list of the target
device.<P>

<LI>the values of the HSIZE and VSIZE device parameters
for the target device.<P>

<LI>the value of the CBACK device parameter for the
target device.<P>
</UL>

<P>All other device parameter values, including the destination
of the output, come from the current device entry.  Therefore, the output
displayed by TARGETDEVICE= may not be an exact replication of the actual output,
but it is as close as possible.
<P>See <A href="ztdevice.htm">TARGETDEVICE</A> for a complete description of
TARGETDEVICE=.
