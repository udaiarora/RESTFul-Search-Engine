<h1 class="storyhead">Rose-Hulman Institute taps Jakubowski as President </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>Gerald Jakubowski, vice president of ASU and provost of the Polytechnic campus, will leave the university July 1 to become the 13th president of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind. </p>
<p>During his tenure as provost of the Polytechnic campus, Jakubowski created an aggressive five-year academic development plan to provide new programs and facilities. He also developed new opportunities for the Mesa community to become involved with the campus and the development of its plans. </p>
<p>"As provost of the Polytechnic campus, Jerry has been responsible for leading the transition of the former ASU East campus in Mesa into a premier polytechnic institution and he has made remarkable progress in a short period of time, laying a foundation upon which his successor will continue to build," says ASU President Michael M. Crow. "Becoming president of an institution such as Rose-Hulman is a wonderful opportunity for Jerry, and I know he will have great success in that endeavor." </p>
<p>Jakubowski was nominated as one of the candidates for the Rose-Hulman president's position and was chosen after a six-month national search. </p>
<p>Jakubowski says Rose-Hulman's national reputation and the commitment of its campus community to the mission of the institute were among the reasons he accepted the position. </p>
<p>"I consider becoming president of Rose-Hulman - an institution of national prominence in undergraduate engineering education - to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," says Jakubowski, a native of Toledo, Ohio. "It also provides an opportunity for me to return to my Midwest roots. Rose-Hulman has much to be proud of, and yet I'm impressed with the desire of everyone associated with the college to strive for even greater success." </p>
<p>His 30 years of experience in private and public higher education - and leadership in national engineering education organizations - makes him keenly aware of the issues and trends that will influence Rose-Hulman's development, says Robert Bright, chairman of Rose-Hulman's board of trustees. </p>
<p>"Gerald Jakubowski was selected to be the next president of Rose-Hulman because of his outstanding academic accomplishments, his effectiveness as a senior administrator, and his commitment to undergraduate education," Bright says. "Those talents have earned him national recognition as a leader in engineering education." </p>
<p>Crow will consult with faculty and staff before naming an interim provost. </p>
<p>Before his appointment at ASU, Jakubowski served 14 years as dean of the College of Science and Engineering and professor of mechanical engineering at Loyola Marymount University, a private institution in Los Angeles. During his tenure there, the academic quality and diversity of incoming freshmen increased. He was involved in major capital campaigns that raised $19 million for a new science and engineering building, created funding for significant renovations to other facilities in the college and increased support to create endowed faculty chairs. </p>
<p>Before becoming dean at Loyola Marymount, Jakubowski was interim dean of engineering, associate dean of engineering and professor of engineering in the Herff College of Engineering at Memphis State University. Before that, he was assistant dean of engineering and associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Toledo. He also served as a faculty member at the University of South Alabama. </p>
<p>Jakubowski earned his doctorate in engineering science, and his master's and bachelor's degrees in mechanical engineering, from the University of Toledo. His areas of engineering expertise include thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer and energy. He is a registered professional engineer. </p>
<p>Jakubowski has been involved in engineering education developments on a national basis. He is chair-elect and vice chair of policy for the engineering accreditation commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). ABET is the recognized accrediting agency for college and university programs in applied science, computing, engineering and technology in the United States. </p>
<p>In 2001, he was national president of the American Society for Engineering Education after serving as vice president and a member of its board of directors. The organization consists of 12,000 members committed to developing policies and programs that enhance opportunities for faculty. It also strives to increase student interest in pursuing a degree in engineering. He has served in many leadership positions in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Society of Automotive Engineers. </p>
<p>Jakubowski has received numerous honors. He was elected as a Fellow in the Institute for the Advancement of Engineering, the American Society for Engineering Education, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1994, 1999 and 2001 respectively. He received the Excellence in Engineering Education Award from the Society of Automotive Engineers in 1998. He has served twice as a NASA Faculty Fellow, and received honors for his teaching from the Society for Automotive Engineers and the University of Toledo. </p>
