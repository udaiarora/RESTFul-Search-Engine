      <h2>Young's expanded role nets added vice president title </h2>
      <p>When it comes to improving the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, David Young means business. Over the past two years, since joining the college as dean, Young has reprioritized, reorganized and realigned existing programs, while developing and implementing brand new programs. </p>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/DavidYoung.jpg" width="180" height="260" align="right">He not only models entrepreneurial behavior, he brings it out in other people and rewards them for it. </p>
      <p>In recognition of Young's impact, expanded responsibilities he is taking on, and the central role the college plays at ASU, Young has been given the additional title of vice president. </p>
      <p>Young's new title of vice president and dean, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS), was approved by the Arizona Board of Regents on March 11, effective April 1. There was no salary adjustment with the title change. </p>
      <p>As head of CLAS, Young has oversight of the overwhelming majority of general education programs at the Main Campus, and more than half of the university's research funding. The college annually produces 280,000 student credit hours, which is comparable to the total of ASU West, ASU East and Northern Arizona University together. Young oversees the CLAS all-funds budget of $180 million. </p>
      <p>"This is well-deserved recognition of Dean Young's vast role and responsibilities, as well as his contribution toward our overarching mission of transforming ASU into a world-class research institution," says ASU President Michael Crow. </p>
      <p>In his revised role, Young will continue to report to Executive Vice President and Provost Milton Glick, and will become a member of the President's Working Group to ensure academic issues are well represented at the senior administration level. </p>
      <p>The expanded role for Young is a key step in Crow's plan to ensure integrated academic planning for the entire university. </p>
      <p>"I'm honored to take on this additional role as we work together to accomplish everything President Crow has set forth in his vision to transform the university," says Young. "I'm grateful for the support from President Crow and Provost Glick, and I'm especially pleased with the demonstrated teamwork not only in CLAS, but across the university." </p>
      <p>Since joining ASU in July of 2001, Young has set forth an ambitious agenda for enhancing the educational and research missions of CLAS. To make the college better prepared to meet new challenges, he has reconfigured its administrative structure, replacing associate deans of academic personnel and research/facilities with divisional deans representing the sciences, the social sciences and the humanities -- CLAS's major academic areas. The new divisional deans will have broad responsibilities within their areas and will be better positioned to meet the needs of those units and to foster rapid advancement under Young's direction. </p>
      <p>Young also has been active in restructuring the college's academic units to make them more entrepreneurial, in keeping with President Crow's model of the New American University. Following a year's planning, Young reorganized three existing college departments - Biology, Plant Biology and Microbiology - into a dynamic new unit, the School of Life Sciences, in the summer of 2003. The new school creates administrative efficiency and is innovatively structured to allow faculty to be flexible and nimble in their research collaborations and program offerings. Young is currently directing the college towards similar restructuring in other areas, including the rapid development of a School of Global Studies, a multi-disciplinary unit aimed at global engagement across liberal arts and sciences disciplines. </p>
      <p>Young has also been active in efforts to enhance the quality of undergraduate education at ASU, notably through his development of the CLAS Learning Communities Program. Started in the fall of 2003, CLAS Learning Communities offers freshmen an alternative to the college's normal general studies courses through courses with integrated curricula spanning a variety of disciplines. Group taught by teams of line faculty, the CLAS Learning Communities create intellectual fusion by linking diverse disciplines around the study of a single topic and help entering students mature intellectually by strengthening their critical thinking and research skills. </p>
      <p>Prior to coming to ASU, Young was dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. His previous administrative positions include provost at Colorado State University, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Oklahoma and director of the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden. </p>
      <p>Young also has been a tenured faculty member in botany at Cornell University, where he directed the L.H. Bailey Hortorium and served as associate dean of the Graduate School. He has held other faculty appointments at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Union College in Schenectady, N.Y. </p>
