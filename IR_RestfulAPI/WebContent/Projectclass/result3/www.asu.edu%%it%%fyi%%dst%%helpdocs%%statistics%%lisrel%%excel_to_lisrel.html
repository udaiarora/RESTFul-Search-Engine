How do I read Excel data into LISREL?
</center></h2>
<p>
Question:<br>
I have entered data into an excel file and wish to bring it into LISREL.
Here are my questions:
<ol>
<li>  I think I have to save the excel file as some sort of a text file.  If
so, what is best?
<li>  Then, I think I need to FTP it from home to my disk space at school.
<li>  Do I use the PICO editor in coordination with LISREL?  If so, I 
think I would simply "read in" the newly created excel text file.  If 
not, how do I begin to run LISREL and specifically transfer the file
from my disk space. Similarly, how do I "begin" or call up LISREL from the 
stats server.
</ol>
<p>
Response:<br>
Yes, save the data to a Text file and then secure FTP it to your AFS space.  Since
the AFS space is available from the stats cluster, you can 
then logon to the cluster and create a seperate LISREL program to read 
and analyze the data which is in the data file.  Information for using 
LISREL on the stats Cluster and for creating LISREL programs can be 
found on the WWW at:
