      <h2>Greater Phoenix resale market continues strong in February</h2>
      <p>The Greater Phoenix resale housing market showed no signs of a slowdown
        in February, with 4,095 homes recorded sold - only slightly below the
        4,220 homes record the previous month, but ahead of last year's 3,970
        sales. This year to date, a total of 8,315 homes have been recorded sold,
        well ahead of the 7,314 homes for slow-starting 2002. The median home
        price fell slightly to $147,500 in February from $147,950 the previous
        month, but remained well ahead of last year's $139,900.</p>
      <p>In Greater Phoenix and throughout the country, the strength of the 2002
        housing market (both in the number of sales and the strong appreciation
        in prices) was one of the few bright points for the economy. "Concerns
        have been raised about the ability of the market to sustain this strength
        through 2003," said Jay Q. Butler, director of the Arizona Real Estate
        Center. "However, even amid a struggling economy and mounting concerns
        about war, people appear to remain confident about the long-term expectations
        for the housing market."</p>
      <p>The current recorded sales activity represents decisions made several
        months ago. "For last several months, the housing market has been reviewed
        positively as to the benefits of the low interest rates, rapid increase
        in prices and the investment opportunities," Butler said. "If the recovery
        continues to be delayed and the war with Iraq become reality, it will
        be interesting to see if the market realizes these expectations." </p>
      <p>While the resale home market improved, the resale townhouse/condominium
        housing sector actually fell from 885 sales in January to 870 sales in
        February, and is well off the 970 sales recorded sold a year ago. The
        median sales price was $100,000, while it was $94,500 a year ago. </p>
      <p>The median square footage for a single-family home recorded sold in
        February was 1,635, larger than the 1,600 square feet reported a year
        ago. In the townhouse/condominium sector the median square footage also
        increased - 1,180 in February compared to 1,160 a year ago. </p>
      <p>&middot; In comparison with February 2002, recorded sales in the city
        of Phoenix slipped slightly from 1,190 to 1,180, while the median sales
        price rose from $115,000 to $122,900. In the townhouse/condominium sector,
        sales activity decreased from 275 to 205, while the median price rose
        from $83,000 to $95,500.</p>
      <p>&middot; The Scottsdale resale home market improved marginally from
        last year's 415 recorded sales to 420. The median sales price continued
        its upward trend, increasing from $265,000 to $300,000. The townhouse/condominium
        sector in Scottsdale was stable at 195 sales, while the median price
        rose from $148,000 to $150,000.</p>
