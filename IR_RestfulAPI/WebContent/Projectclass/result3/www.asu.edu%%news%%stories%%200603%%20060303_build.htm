<h1 class="storyhead">ASU builds the student experience</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>Over the last three years, ASU has set an aggressive agenda to advance both as an academic and research institution. A key part of that agenda has been improving the ASU student experience. From quality to accessibility, the university has achieved significant results &ndash; all to help foster educational advancement &ndash; and the numbers prove it.</p>

        <p>ASU students: We know your investment in education, in time and money, is one of the biggest you&rsquo;ll ever make. ASU wants to make sure your educational investment pays off. Here is a brief look at real examples of the progress the university has made over the past year to improve your educational experience. <a href="20060303_improvingexperience.htm">Read more</a> </p>

<p>The university is attracting more top talent and diversifying the student body. Last year, the university enrolled the largest freshman class in history at 8,467 students, including 155 National Merit Scholars, giving ASU the third most of any public school in the country. Overall, the university has a total of 533 Merit Scholars on campus. ASU further extended its culturally diverse community by enrolling 13,933 graduate and undergraduate minority students in 2005, of whom 1,453 are Native American and 7,325 are Hispanic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The momentum of change is accelerating and all of our achievements thus far &ndash; from the growing number of National Merit Scholars to the addition of several prominent academicians &ndash; have helped ASU secure its place on the world stage,&rdquo; says ASU President Michael Crow.</p>
<p>With the student body growing so rapidly, the university increased its financial support to maintain accessibility to higher education. More than $70 million in university grants and scholarships were awarded in 2004 &ndash; 05. Sixty-six percent of ASU students receive some type of financial aid, including grants, loans and scholarships; Arizona undergraduates received an average award of $7,794. Financial aid can be used to pay for tuition, fees, room, board, books and other educational expenses.</p>
<p> Freshman retention climbed to a record 79 percent last year and much of this success stems from smaller class sizes, better advising and the expansion of key academic support services. The university added 96 lower division English courses and 137 first-year math courses to reduce most class sizes from 24 to 19 and from 60 to 19, respectively. ASU&rsquo;s goal is to have at least 45 percent of all classes enroll fewer than 20 students, says Milton Glick, ASU executive vice president and provost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On average, every time the student-faculty ratio drops by one, there is approximately a four percent increase in graduation rate,&rdquo; says Glick. &ldquo;We must continue increasing the number of instructional faculty to reach our goal of graduating more students.&rdquo; </p>
<p> <img src="images/ClassChangeBlur.jpg" width="200" height="275" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Last year a record 167 new faculty joined the university&rsquo;s existing pool of international scholars to lead academic and research programs. Many of the university&rsquo;s colleges and schools hired new faculty in 2005, increasing the depth and breadth of talent that serve ASU students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The success of our students directly correlates with class size and student-to-faculty ratio,&rdquo; says Crow. &ldquo;We have concentrated on reducing class size and adding more faculty to award more degrees. This trend will continue until we reach a positive student-to-faculty ratio of 18 to 1 to attain a 65 percent graduation rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the 2004-2005 academic year, 12,821 students graduated from ASU, an increase of 300 from the previous year and 1,000 more than two years ago. A recent study titled &ldquo;The Value of Higher Education: Individual and Societal Benefits&rdquo; suggests that a person with a college education will enjoy a significantly higher level of prosperity than if he/she had chosen not to pursue a degree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over a career, an individual with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree earns an average of $1 million more than a counterpart with only a high school diploma,&rdquo; states the economic-competitiveness report developed by the L. William Seidman Research Institute in the W. P. Carey School of Business. &ldquo;If the value of a college degree is expressed on the same basis as the return on a financial investment, the net return is 12 percent a year, over and above inflation. This compares favorably with annual returns on stocks that have averaged 7 percent.&rdquo;</p>
<p> In addition to awarding more degrees, ASU has added new degree programs. In 2005, the university instituted eight new undergraduate degree programs and five graduate programs at the Tempe, Polytechnic and West campuses to accommodate students&rsquo; evolving interests and society&rsquo;s needs. Among these new programs, the College of Nursing added a new Doctor of Nursing Science degree in response to the shortage of doctoral-level nurses and nursing educators in Arizona, and the Herberger College of Fine Arts, in partnership with the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, created a film and media degree program due to high student interest and the need to connect students to the U.S. film industry. </p>
<p> <img src="images/computer_lab.jpg" width="288" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">ASU is blending traditional academic disciplines to discover new approaches for society&rsquo;s pressing problems. The creation of the International Institute for Sustainability, which tackles ecological, economic and societal issues in an effort to ensure humans maintain a sustainable quality of life on Earth, is a good example of this transition. At least nine ASU colleges, schools and institutes, including liberal arts and sciences, engineering, business, law and architecture and environmental design are collaborating to support sustainability studies.</p>
<p>While ASU can take credit for a year of significant achievement, there is still more work to be done. The best way to continue forward in this positive direction is to seek funding from a variety of sources, says Crow. In 2005, 32 percent of the institution&rsquo;s funding came from state appropriations, 29 percent from tuition, 18 percent from federal grants and contracts and five percent from private gifts. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an indelible need to continue pushing the Arizona legislature for government support, increase tuition rates at a steady pace and seek private gifts from our alumni and community supporters in order to advance ASU into the top ranks of American research universities,&rdquo; says Crow.</p>
