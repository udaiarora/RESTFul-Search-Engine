            <p> The Department of Languages and Literatures offers a graduate&nbsp; program in French leading to&nbsp; the degree of Master of Arts in French with concentrations in Literature, Linguistics, or Comparative&nbsp; Literature.&nbsp; There is also an M.A. program in Secondary Education with a major in French.&nbsp; </p>
            <p> This guide is intended to provide new graduate students in the Department of Languages and Literatures with the information necessary for compliance with the degree requirements of the respective programs.&nbsp; It should be used in conjunction with the Graduate College Guide to Graduate College Procedures.&nbsp; In addition, graduate students are expected to consult regularly with the Graduate Director, and programs of study for each semester must be signed by the Graduate Director.&nbsp; Students are urged to discuss their studies with the Director of French Graduate Studies who is available to answer whatever questions or problems may arise during the pursuit of the M.A. degree.&nbsp; </p>
            <p> Since it is the students' responsibility to comply with all requirements and to keep informed of their nature and application, it is in their interest to familiarize themselves with these&nbsp; documents and to consult with the departmental faculty on a regular basis.&nbsp; </p>
            <p> The French section&nbsp;of the Department of&nbsp; Languages and Literatures encourages and appreciates suggestions coming from graduate students which could lead to an improvement of the programs offered.&nbsp; It also welcomes concrete proposals which would improve the usefulness of this guide.&nbsp; </p>

            <p><br>
              <strong>Application for TA-ships and Scholarships:&nbsp; </strong>Completed application forms must be received by January 31.&nbsp; Students must be admitted to the Graduate College and the program to be considered for aid.&nbsp; TA application forms may be obtained from the <a href="mailto:cindy.webster@asu.edu">Graduate Secretary</a>.&nbsp;             
  </span>
  <p> Students seeking admission must first apply to the Graduate College.&nbsp; This is a process totally independent of the application&nbsp; for a teaching assistantship.&nbsp; It is expected that the applicant will have been accepted into the graduate program before s/he&nbsp; may be awarded&nbsp; a Teaching Assistantship.&nbsp; Foreign&nbsp; students&nbsp; should apply as early as possible in the Fall Semester, preferably before the first of October,&nbsp; and must pass the TOEFL before admission.&nbsp; All applications for admission are processed by the departmental&nbsp; Chair, in consultation with the Director of French Graduate Studies and members of the French section.&nbsp; Applicants for the Master's&nbsp; program are&nbsp; evaluated on the basis of&nbsp; their B.A. preparation. In addition, the overall&nbsp; nature of the students' undergraduate preparation is taken into&nbsp; account.&nbsp; The committee is guided by the grade-point average in all undergraduate work, by the junior-senior average,&nbsp; and&nbsp; by the average in the&nbsp; major.&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, students are expected to have&nbsp; at least a 3.25 average in their undergraduate French major in&nbsp; order to&nbsp; be&nbsp; accepted into the Master's program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students denied admission may apply at a later&nbsp; date,&nbsp; after consultation with the Director of French Graduate Studies.&nbsp; Factors which are also taken into consideration include the schools where the students have&nbsp; studied previously, whether or not they have had the opportunity to study abroad, and, where necessary, the nature of any letters of recommendation&nbsp; which they may have submitted in support of an evaluation of their command of French and potential for graduate work.&nbsp; Should the applicants' GPA in previous work not meet the appropriate standard, they may submit graduate record examination scores.&nbsp; The total of the three sections of the <strong> GRE Basic Examination</strong> (verbal, quantitative, and analytical) should be <strong> 1500 or better</strong> in order for the students to be given regular admission.&nbsp; The Graduate College gives priority to on-line applications.&nbsp;</p>

            <a NAME="GENERAL"></a>GENERAL DETAILS&nbsp;
            </span>
  <p> A total of&nbsp; 30 hours of graduate work is required.&nbsp; Graduate&nbsp; students may take only 500-level courses for graduate credit.&nbsp; At least 9 hours must&nbsp; be selected from those courses listed exclusively for graduate students.&nbsp;&nbsp; The program must include a research methods course (FRE 500 or LIN 500).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is recommended that the candidate enroll in this course as early as possible.&nbsp; When approved by the Graduate Committee, up to 6 hours of related course work may be taken outside of French.&nbsp; A student must achieve a grade point&nbsp; average of B (G.P.A. 3.0) or better in all work specifically included in the program of study.&nbsp; Grades below C cannot be used to meet the requirements of a graduate&nbsp; degree.&nbsp; <br>
  No student may accumulate more than one incomplete at any one time.&nbsp; In order to retain a teaching assistantship, a student must complete all incompletes before the new academic year.&nbsp; Incompletes not removed within one year are automatically converted to an I8 by the University.&nbsp; Although such incompletes do not affect a student&rsquo;s G.P.A., they are an indication that the student cannot handle graduate-level work.&nbsp; The department will recommend that a student who has more than two I8 grades be withdrawn from the program.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> Students are encouraged to file an <strong>Official Program of Study</strong> as early as possible and no later than the end of the first year.&nbsp; This form must be completed <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/forms/index.html">on-line</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; On it the students list the courses taken and grades as well as the courses they expect to take, or are in the process of taking.&nbsp; Once the form has been completed, it must be checked and signed by the Director of French Graduate Studies.&nbsp; An examining committee will be designated in consultation with the student, who must obtain the signatures of the three members selected.&nbsp; These members will normally be chosen from&nbsp; among the faculty with whom the student has taken course work.&nbsp; It must then be signed by the Chair of the Department of Languages and Literatures and returned to the Graduate Office, Administration B-Wing, Room 285.&nbsp; Prior to completing the form the student&nbsp; should check with the Director of French Graduate Programs to avoid delays in processing by the Graduation Office.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong> Independent Study courses </strong> will be given only under exceptional circumstances and will not duplicate courses which are&nbsp; available.&nbsp; The French Graduate Committee is responsible for authorizing such work in cooperation with the individual professor.&nbsp; No more than 6 hours of Independent Study will be permitted.&nbsp; </p>

  <p> Financial Aid is available to qualified applicants on a competitive basis in the form of Teaching Assistantships, with stipends.&nbsp; Tuition is automatically&nbsp;waived for teaching assistants.&nbsp; An effort is made to award assistantships for four consecutive semesters, depending on the teaching openings available in the Department.&nbsp; Assistants may teach up to two four-hour courses each semester on the elementary and/or intermediate levels.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
  <p> Deadline for applications is&nbsp;normally January 31; later applications for assistantships will be considered if any positions remain unfilled.&nbsp; Applications&nbsp; for graduate admission&nbsp; may be obtained from Graduate Admissions.&nbsp; <strong>Applications for teaching assistantships and scholarships may be obtained from the <a href="mailto:gruzinska@asu.edu">Director of&nbsp; French Graduate Studies</a>, the <a href="mailto:cindy.webster@asu.edu">Graduate Secretary</a>, or <a href="http://asu.edu/graduate/forms/wordforms/RATAap.doc">online</a>.</strong></p>

  <p class="header3">SELECTION FOR SUMMER SESSION TEACHING&nbsp;            </span>
  <p> Students interested in being considered for summer appointment must submit applications separate from applications for continuation in the next academic year.&nbsp; The French Graduate committee will review applications after the announced deadline for submission, although applications may be received and evaluated until all positions have been filled.&nbsp; The French section coordinator, in consultation with the Graduate Committee and the T.A. supervisor&nbsp; makes recommendations to the departmental chair who, as the executive officer of the department, makes all final decisions.&nbsp; The French section recognizes its obligation to provide continuous appointment for as many graduate students as possible during the summer months.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> Openings for the summer employment of teaching assistants will be determined on the basis of budgetary allowances and the teaching preferences of regular faculty members.&nbsp; Ordinarily, such openings will be on the 100 and 200 levels and qualifications&nbsp; for such openings will be the same as during the regular academic year.&nbsp; Students desiring a summer appointment must be registered for classes in the summer and must not have graduated.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> Applicants for summer positions must have been Teaching or Research Assistant/Associates during at least one semester of the previous academic year and evaluations will be sought by the Committee.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> Applications must be ranked by the graduate committee, taking into account the following priorities and criteria:&nbsp; </p>
  <p> &nbsp;1. Academic and teaching rating on a 10 point&nbsp; scale.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> &nbsp;2. All factors equal, previous summer support will be taken into account.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> &nbsp;3. Every attempt will be made to give Master's students a turn at summer teaching, pending available openings.&nbsp; </p>
  Since the faculty's recommendations are made to the Chair, it is the Chair's&nbsp; responsibility to inform students of the final disposition of their applications.&nbsp; Notification will be made at the earliest time permitted, pending final budget decisions for the summer sessions.&nbsp; <span class="text">

            <p class="header3">EVALUATION OF TEACHING ASSISTANTS/GRADUATE STUDENTS&nbsp;            </span>
  <p> 1. In the spring of each academic year, the French Faculty will evaluate all students&rsquo; academic performance.&nbsp; In addition, the quality of each student&rsquo;s French will be evaluated, and students who need to improve their language skills must do so within the time limit given them by the section.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> 2. Evaluation of teaching assistants is done by the French TA-Supervisor.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> 3. Optionally, each teaching assistant may arrange through her/his supervisor to be evaluated by another faculty member.&nbsp; This evaluation will result in&nbsp; a narrative statement.&nbsp; The evaluation will be arranged in consultation with the supervisor, and the teaching assistant will submit the names of three faculty members s/he feels would be appropriate evaluators.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> 4. All evaluations will go into the teaching&nbsp; assistant's academic file and will be available for examination by the teaching assistant.&nbsp; </p>
  5. All incompletes must be removed by the start of&nbsp; the contract&nbsp;(August or January) or the assistantship will be withdrawn.&nbsp; <span class="text">

            </span>
<p> An introduction to research is an integral part of all M.A. programs at Arizona State University.&nbsp; All students are therefore required to present a thesis.&nbsp; </p>
<p> Once students have declared an area of research interest (e.g., period, figure, or theme), they must decide, in consultation with a faculty member, on a thesis topic and on a committee.&nbsp; The thesis director will be a member of this committee which will consist of three members.&nbsp; This committee will function as an advising body.&nbsp; </p>
<p> Students who plan to write a thesis should submit to their committee a written proposal of about five pages (including bibliography) of their idea.&nbsp; The student should meet with the committee to discuss the project, assign roles to committee members, anticipate problems and solutions, and settle on a tentative defense date.&nbsp; Once that is done, the student must give a copy of the proposal to the Graduate director.&nbsp; </p>
<p> The preparation of theses must conform to Graduate College guidelines (a copy may be obtained from the Graduate College).&nbsp; A thesis in progress will be assigned the grade &quot;Z&quot;.&nbsp; Students will normally receive 6 hours of credit (out of a total of 30) for the thesis.&nbsp; Upon completion of the thesis, the &quot;Z&quot; will be changed to a &quot;Y&quot;.&nbsp; This will be done by the Thesis Director in consultation with the committee.&nbsp; </p>
<p> Prior to the defense of the thesis, the student will be required to write a Master&rsquo;s Examination.&nbsp; </p>
<p> <a name="AppliedProject"></a>APPLIED PROJECT </p>
<p> In lieu of a thesis, students who are planning to teach in the secondary school system may choose to do an applied project. The requirements for the Applied Project are: </p>
<p> Twenty-seven hours of course work in either the Literature or Linguistics tracks of French. </p>
<p> A comprehensive examination </p>
<p> A portfolio comprising: </p>
<ul>
  <li> a) A document of approximately 25 pages describing the project, including a justification firmly grounded in a theoretical framework. </li>
  <li> b) Original pedagogical materials developed by the candidate to support the project. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
The portfolio will be evaluated and approved by the student&rsquo;s supervisory committee and will be presented in a public defense. <span class="text">

<p> The Master's Degree Examination in French is represented by a separate&nbsp;written component administered over a one-day period in January, May, or August.&nbsp; </p>
<p> The examination is based on the student's course work and field of concentration, as defined in the reading list made up by the student.&nbsp; The examination will consist of three parts: a question based on the student&acute;s thesis topic, one general question, and a problem to solve or a text to analyze.&nbsp; A sample of a previous exam is available on request from the Graduate Director.&nbsp; The exam is made up and graded by the student&acute;s thesis committee.&nbsp; </p>
A student desiring to take the examination must file the appropriate application (obtainable from the <a href="http://asu.edu/graduate/forms/pdf/RptFMsEx.pdf">Graduate College)</a> with the Director of French Graduate Studies at least four weeks prior to the examination date.&nbsp; The student must consult at least one semester prior to the exam with his/her committee to establish a reading list and thesis topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Possible grades are Pass, Fail, and exceptionally, Pass with Distinction.&nbsp; <br>

Included in the hours must be ENG 500 Research Methods; ENG 503 Comparative Literature, Theory and Practice; and ENG 599 Thesis. </p>
            <p> The examination for the concentration in Comparative Literature will be administered by the interdepartmental committee&nbsp;for Comparative Literature.&nbsp; </p>
            <p> The examination in Comparative Literature will consist of the following parts:&nbsp; </p>
            <p> 1. General Concepts of Comparative Literature:&nbsp;Essay questions&nbsp;on selected aspects of Comparative Literature, designed to test the student's grasp of the general principles of the disciplines.&nbsp; </p>
            <p> 2. Problems of Comparative Literature: Essay questions based on specific comparative problems.&nbsp; </p>
            <p> The chair of each examining committee will report the results of the examination (determined by polling the members of the committee) to the departmental chair, who will report the results to all students at the same time.&nbsp; In no&nbsp; case&nbsp; is the&nbsp; chair of the examining committee to discuss&nbsp; the&nbsp; results of the&nbsp; exam with the student until the latter has received&nbsp; official notification of the results from the departmental chair.&nbsp; </p>

            <p> In order to continue work on the M.A. degree in French, students must fulfill the following conditions.&nbsp; Failure to fulfill these conditions will result in the student&rsquo;s being excused from further participation in the program.&nbsp; </p>
            <p> 1. A minimum G.P.A. of 3.0 must be maintained.&nbsp; </p>
            <p> 2. Full-time students must complete all course work within two years of&nbsp;the first semester in which the student is enrolled.&nbsp; For example, a student who begins study in the Fall 1998 semester must complete all course work by the end of the Spring 2000 semester.&nbsp; Part-time students may take longer; however, they should keep in mind that the Graduate College has a six-year time limit, and that they may have to petition for an extension.&nbsp; </p>
            <p> 3. All students must take their comprehensive exams at the end of their second year of coursework.&nbsp; Exams are given in May, August, and January.&nbsp; Students must sign up for exams, and must take them at the appointed date.&nbsp; In case of emergency, the student must inform the graduate secretary as soon as possible.&nbsp; Exams may then be rescheduled for as soon as possible, and certainly no later than the next session.&nbsp; Exams may be rescheduled only once.&nbsp; </p>
            <p> 4. The student must have an approved thesis proposal within one year of passing the exams.&nbsp; </p>
