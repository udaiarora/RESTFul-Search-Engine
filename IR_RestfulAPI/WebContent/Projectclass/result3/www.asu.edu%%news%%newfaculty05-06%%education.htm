<p><strong>Daniel Battey</strong><br>
  <em>Assistant Professor, Division of Curriculum and Instruction</em><br>
  Dr. Battey received his doctorate from the University of California, Los Angeles in psychological studies in education, with an emphasis in teacher learning and equity in mathematics education. Prior to coming to ASU, he was a postdoctoral fellow in diversity in mathematics education at UCLA. His work centers on engaging urban elementary school teachers in opportunities to learn within and from their practice in a way that sustains and generates change. Currently, he is working on a project that measures the effect of scaling-up professional development on algebraic thinking. He is collaborating on two chapters for the <em>Handbook of Research on Mathematics Teaching and Learning</em>, one on classroom practices and the other on equity issues in the field. His forthcoming paper, to be published in <em>Teachers College Record</em>, is entitled, &ldquo;Professional Development for Teachers on Gender Equity in the Sciences: Initiating the Conversation.&rdquo; </p>
<p><strong>Julie A. Luft</strong><br>
  <em>Professor, Division of Curriculum and Instruction</em><br>
  Dr. Luft comes to ASU from the University of Texas, Austin, where she served as a faculty member in the Science and Mathematics Education Center in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction. Prior to this appointment she was at the University of Arizona. Dr. Luft&rsquo;s expertise resides in the domain of secondary science teacher education, with specific attention to teacher beliefs, beginning teachers, and the practice of science as inquiry. As an educator and researcher she has received over 2 million dollars in research and professional development grants, published over 60 peer-reviewed articles, and made numerous presentations to educational researchers, school district administrators, and public school teachers. As a faculty member, she has worked to create a bridge between school districts and universities by developing professional development programs for secondary science teachers. She recently completed her term as president of the Association for the Education of Teachers of Science, associate editor for the <em>Journal of Research on Science Teaching</em>, and council member of the National Science Teachers Association. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brian C. Nelson</strong><br>
    <em>Assistant Professor, Division of Psychology in Education</em><br>
    Dr. Nelson recently received his doctorate from Harvard University in learning technologies, with a specialization in learning theory and collaborative learning environments. Prior to pursuing his doctorate, he was an assistant professor of English as a second language at the University of Aizu, Aizu-wakamatsu, Japan, and at Kanazawa Technical College, Kanazawa, Japan. He has also taught English as a second language to recent immigrants at the elementary and middle school levels in Vermont and Washington. His research focuses on the theory, design, and impact of individualized guidance systems in collaborative learning environments. His publications include articles on web-based instruction in English as a second language, factors that influence learning English as a second language, and design-based research strategies for developing scientific inquiry curricula for educational multi-user virtual environments. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finbarr C. Sloane</strong><br>
  <em>Associate Professor, Division of Curriculum &amp; Instruction</em><br>
  Dr. Sloane, a native of Ireland, received his Ph.D. in measurement, evaluation, and statistical analysis from the University of Chicago with specialization in mathematics education and multilevel modeling. Prior to joining the faculty at ASU, he was a program director at the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s Division of Research, Evaluation, and Communication. While there, he oversaw a national effort to conduct research on the scaling of educational interventions in STEM disciplines. He currently serves on the editorial boards of <em>Irish Educational Studies</em>, <em>Mathematical Thinking and Learning</em>, and <em>Reading Research Quarterly</em>. Presently he is secretary and treasurer for the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS). Most recently his research has appeared in <em>Educational Researcher</em> and <em>Reading Research Quarterly</em>. He has provided direction to Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), the Board on International Comparative Studies in Education (BICSE), and has presented to the National Research Council of the National Academies of Science.</p>
