When advertising is required, it must be published in a newspaper of general circulation within Arizona.  This is the responsibility of Purchasing and Business Services.<p>Advertising content should be kept to a minimum in order to conserve funds.  Advertisements should state the description of the procurement; the time, date, and place of bid opening; and the location where plans or <a href="pur004.html#Specifications">specifications</a> can be obtained.  Other pertinent information may be added if necessary for clarification.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Advertising Requirements</b></font><p><b>Design and/or Construction Services</b><p>Advertisement in the <i>Glendale Star,</i> the <i>Arizona Informant,</i> <i>El Sol,</i> or other selected newspaper(s) is required.
