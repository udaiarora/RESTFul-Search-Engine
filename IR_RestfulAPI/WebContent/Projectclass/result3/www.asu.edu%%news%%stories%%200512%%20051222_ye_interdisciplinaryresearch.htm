<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>H.J. Fernando, professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering in the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, and a team of researchers visited Sri Lanka to gain a better understanding of the devastation left by the Dec. 26, 2004, tsunami. </p>
<p>Fernando and the team reported that some areas of Sri Lanka were devastated more than others &ndash; and that the increased destruction follows human development along coastal regions. Further research by the team showed that illegal mining of corals off the southwest coast of Sri Lanka permitted far more onshore destruction from the tsunami than occurred in nearby areas whose coral reefs were intact.</p>
<p>In other ASU research:</p>
<p><img src="images/AMEMediaPerformance.jpg" width="250" height="171" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">&bull; ASU&rsquo;s motione project started a digital revolution &ndash; using motion analysis in dance choreography &ndash; with its first public performance in April. The performance traveled to the Lincoln Center in New York to be part of acclaimed dance choreographer Trisha Brown&rsquo;s 35th anniversary tributes on April 14 and April 16.</p>
<p>By melding dance with imagery and sound and then tying the three together through real-time electronics feedback, motione takes dance to a new level, where the dancer influences the visuals and sound produced, and the sound and visuals in turn influence the performance of the dancer.</p>
<p>&bull; ASU scientists lined up to play key roles in NASA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mars Science Laboratory,&rdquo; scheduled for launch in 2009. </p>
<p>Michelle Minitti, a faculty associate at the Center for Meteorite Studies, is on the science team for the Mars Handlens Imager (MAHLI), a powerful microscopic imager built by Malin Space Science Systems and directed by ASU alumnus Kenneth Edgett.</p>
<p>Jack Farmer, director of ASU&rsquo;s astrobiology program and a professor of geological sciences, is a member of the science team for CheMin, which is described as &ldquo;an X-ray Diffraction/X-ray Fluorescence instrument for definitive mineralogical analysis&rdquo; that is being built by NASA&rsquo;s Ames Research Center. This important instrument &ldquo;will identify and quantify all minerals in complex natural samples such as basalts, evaporites and soils, one of the principle objectives of Mars Science Laboratory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission is seen by the community of scientists involved in the exploration of Mars as the &ldquo;next step,&rdquo; following the stunning successes and dramatic discoveries that already have been made by the still-ongoing Mars Exploration Rover (MER) missions. The instruments in MSL were chosen to help answer even larger questions that follow from MER&rsquo;s discovery of clear evidence for the existence of past liquid water on the surface of the Red Planet.</p>
<p>&bull; According to a study from ASU&rsquo;s Productivity and Prosperity Project (P3), putting money into a four-year college education turns out to be a better financial investment &ndash; to the tune of $1 million more over one&rsquo;s lifetime &ndash; than people who have just a high school education. The study was authored by Dennis Hoffman, professor of economics in the W. P. Carey School of Business&rsquo;s L. William Seidman Research Institute; Kent Hill, research professor in the Department of Economics and Center of Business Research; and Tom Rex, associate director of the Center for Business Research.</p>
<p>The higher education report is part of an effort launched by ASU President Michael Crow and directed by Hoffman to better understand the various factors that help cities grow and regions prosper.</p>
<p>&bull; ASU researcher Roy Curtiss received a $14.8 million grant from the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative to develop a new pneumonia vaccine for newborns, funded primarily by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Curtiss is co-director of the Center for Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology in the Biodesign Institute at ASU and a professor in the School of Life Sciences. The primary aim of his research is to develop a vaccine that can be used in infants and very young children to prevent pneumonia. The vaccine will be effective against all strains of bacteria causing the disease. It also will be able to be given in a single dose and will address the urgent needs within developing nations for a low-cost, needle-free vaccine.</p>
<p>Curtiss&rsquo; proposal was one of 43 projects selected for funding from among an initial 1,500 requests for funding by scientists in 75 countries.</p>
<p><img src="../../features/images/110105schwemberg.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">&bull; The glass plate collection of photographs taken by a Franciscan brother living at St. Michaels Mission on the Navajo reservation close to Window Rock, Ariz., was been deeded to ASU for archiving, scholarly research and digital reproduction. </p>
<p>The collection by Brother Simeon Schwemberger included about 1,750 exquisite images of Native American life and landscapes. Images from the collection went on display at the West campus for the first time Nov. 1.</p>
<p>&bull; A team of researchers, including a photosynthesis expert from ASU, has found evidence of photosynthesis taking place deep within the Pacific Ocean. The team found a bacterium that is the first photosynthetic organism that lives not off sunlight, but from the dim light coming from hydrothermal vents nearly 2,400 meters (7,875 feet) deep in the ocean.</p>
<p>The discovery of the green sulfur bacteria living near hydrothermal vents off the coast of Mexico has significant implications for the resiliency of life on Earth &ndash; and possibly on other planets, says Robert Blankenship, a member of the research team and professor and chair of ASU&rsquo;s chemistry and biochemistry department.</p>
<p>&bull; A new home on the Navajo Nation is offering the latest in energy-saving technologies &ndash; all wrapped in a design that reflects Native American culture and traditions. The new home offers a new model for providing efficient, affordable housing in remote areas like the Navajo Nation. The home was the first full construction project completed by the Stardust Center for Affordable Homes and the Family at ASU. The center, which opened at ASU in January 2005, is dedicated to increasing the quality and quantity of affordable housing through research and innovative design efforts.</p>
<p>&bull; ASU researchers Ranu Jung and James Abbas secured four grants totaling $3.9 million to advance efforts to repair or replace lost function for people with spinal cord injuries or other neurological disorders.</p>
<p>Jung and Abbas co-direct the Center for Rehabilitation Neuroscience and the Rehabilitation Engineering at ASU&rsquo;s Biodesign Institute. The center&rsquo;s focus is on developing and using new scientific knowledge and engineering technology to address the complex physiological, medical and societal problems presented by neurological disability.</p>
