                    <P>Executive Committee - Librarians&rsquo; Council<BR>
  Annual Report 2000-2001<BR>
  Patricia A. Etter, Chair
  
                  <P><B>Elected Members:</B> Patricia Etter (Chair); John Barnard (Chair-elect); Gordon Dutrisac (Secretary); Marilyn Wurzburger (Past Chair); Ken Furuta (Compensation Committee); Helen Seaton (Personnel Committee); Mary Swaty (Review Committee); Tom Grieves (Research and Professional Development Committee); George Bell (Senator at Large); Linda Shackel and Helen Seaton (CAPS). 
                  <P><B>Appointed Positions:</B> JoAnn Mulvihill (Kenneth B. Knepp Parliamentarian); and Annie Platoff (Page Master). An October 18, 2000 revision to the Handbook made these positions non-voting members of the Executive Committee.
  
                  <P>The Executive Committee met on a regular basis between September and June and conducted five Council meetings. Secretary, Gordon Dutrisac resigned his position in February 2001, and Marilyn Wurzburger graciously offered to fill out his term. 
  
                  <P>Both JoAnn Mulvihill and Annie Platoff agreed to serve another term as Kenneth B. Knepp Parliamentarian and Page Master respectively. An amendment to the Bylaws was approved by Council on October 18, 2000, which clarified the duties of the Parliamentarian and created the position of Page Master and defined the duties of that position.
  
                  <P>We can now say that the hard work over the past few years involved with putting the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook on line has paid off. It is well organized and the information is easily accessed by anyone needing information on the Bylaws, Council activities, meeting minutes and schedules, personnel actions, and more. All outstanding revisions to the Librarian&rsquo;s Handbook were approved by Dean Sherrie Schmidt and the Senior Vice President and Provost, Gail Hackett. These are described by the various committees sponsoring the changes in their own annual reports.
  
                  <P>New librarians were welcomed to Council: Deborah Koshinsky, Head of the Architecture and Environmental Design Library, and Dan Stanton to Government Documents.
  
                  <P>The Nominating Committee conducted a very successful election for members to the various committees, noting that all but six of the eligible voters turned in ballots.
  
                  <P>Librarians elected to University Committees were: Annie Platoff to the Committee on Academic Professional Status; and Lydia Lafaro to the Academic Professional Committee; and Philip Konomos was appointed to the University Continuing Appointment and Promotion Review Committee.
  
                  <P>We departed from the usual program for Council meetings twice this year by having invited speakers. Provost Milton Glick gave an animated presentation, &ldquo;ASU and the New Economy,&rdquo; in March. The following month, Dr. Brooke Sheldon, Director of the School of Library and Information Science at the University of Arizona, talked to both Council members and members of ASUs Classified Staff about her plans for the school in the coming years. A number of ASU employees have been accepted for studies in librarianship at our sister institution.
  
                  <P>Thanks to members of the Executive Committee who gave their time and energy in the support of the Librarians&rsquo; Council Agenda. <BR>

                    <H3>Personnel Committee</H3>
                    <P>Members of the Personnel Committee: Pat Etter, Sue Hunter, Orchid Mazurkiewicz, Helen Seaton, Linda Shackle, and Julie Tharp.  
  
                  <P>Helen Seaton, Chair<BR>
  Sue Hunter, Secretary<BR>
  Linda Shackle, Review Committee Liaison
  
                  <P>The major accomplishment of the Personnel Committee was the development of generic personnel action packets for the 2nd and 4th year for an imaginary librarian named Marion. The packet included a two-page letter and a curriculum vita. The packets demonstrate progression in the career of a fictional library and were developed to help new librarians as they progress through the probationary period. An explanatory letter accompanies the packets and states that the packets are illustrations and that there is no one way to design a packet. The packets were submitted to both the Review Committee and the AD for Personnel for comment. The availability of the Marion packets was announced at the March 21 meeting of Librarians&rsquo; Council.
  
                  <P>A copy of the packets will be available in the office of the Assistant Dean for Personnel and a link will be available on the Librarians&rsquo; Council page.
  
                  <P>Throughout the year the committee worked on Handbook revisions. The following Handbook sections were revised and brought to Council and approved.
  
                  <UL>
                      <LI>E.2: Criteria. The changes the Personnel Committee proposed were approved at the March 21 meeting of Librarians&rsquo; Council and have been sent to the Dean for her approval. Also added a sentence including membership in professional organizations under Professional Participation. Under Professional Development and Contribution / Continuing Education, we added &hellip; conference attendance. Under Research and Dissemination / List of Activities, added #9. Substantial instructional material, e.g. subject or assignment guides.
    
                  <LI>G.2.1: Personnel Reviews - Probationary Evaluation. Added a sentence concerning the addition of a current position description to the review packet. Approved by Council at the September 20 meeting.
    
                  <LI>G.2.3: Personnel Reviews - Notification Process for Negative Recommendations. Recommended replacing &ldquo;Associate Dean&rdquo; with &ldquo;Assistant Dean for Personnel.&rdquo; Approved by Council at the September 20 meeting.
                  </UL>
                    <P>The following two sections were revised but it was decided not to bring them forward to Librarians&rsquo; Council as planned, but to postpone for further discussion with the Review Committee and the AD for Personnel. The background on these revisions concerned early promotion. The revisions will be carried over to the new committee.
                    <UL>
                      <LI>E.3: Requirements. The change concerned previous job experience plus an attempt to clarify the amount of time one should expect to spend in the current rank. The sentence that caused the most discussion was: &ldquo;Except in extraordinary circumstances, meeting these requirements is unlikely without more than a year in the current rank.&rdquo; The sentence seemed to be open to many interpretations.
    
                  <LI>G.2.2: Continuing Appointment/Promotion - section under Procedures. Again, the controversial section concerned the attempt to define an acceptable length of time in a rank. The sentence was: &ldquo;Except in extraordinary circumstances, meeting the requirements of continuing appointment and/or promotion is unlikely to occur without more than a year in the current rank at Arizona State University Libraries.&rdquo;
                  </UL>
                    <P>Pending action:  
                    <UL>
                      <LI>In addition to Handbook sections E.3 and G.2.2 listed above, the Personnel Committee also discussed supplementary evaluations but did not come up with a recommendation.
    
                  <LI>Marion 6th year packet.
    
                  <LI>We had also intended to revise Handbook sections J.1: Orientation Program and K.1: Mentoring Program but ran out of time.
                    </UL>

                  <P>Re: Research and Professional Development Committee Annual Report 
  
                  <P>The Research and Professional Development Committee received an allocation of $50,000 in travel funds and $3000 in research funds for the 2000-2001 fiscal year. We received 61 travel requests totaling $67,996.00. We allocated $49,786.00 for the year. No research requests were forthcoming so none of the $3000.00 allocated for research funds were expended.

                    <H3>Review Committee for Personnel Action</H3>
                    <P>Members of the Review Committee for 2000/2001 were Mary Swaty (Chair), Marcia Anderson, Phil Konomos, Kathy Krzys, Annette Voth, Mimmo Bonanni (Probationary member), and Linda Shackle, Personnel Committee Representative.  
  
                  <P>The Committee made recommendations to the Dean on one sabbatical request, four Second Year Probationary Reviews, four Fourth Year Probationary Reviews, two Promotion to Associate with Continuing Appointment requests, and two Promotion to Full requests. Review Committee did not make any recommendations for rank of candidates for Academic Professional positions during the year.  
  
                  <P>The Committee revised Librarians&rsquo; Handbook, section C.2.3, &ldquo;Review Committee for Personnel Action&rdquo; and brought it before Librarians&rsquo; Council. It was returned to the Committee for further revision and will be passed along to the new Committee for their action in fall 2001.

                    <P>Members: Phil Konomos, Steve Hussman, Sandy Bray, Diane Rhodes, and Kenneth Furuta, Chair
  
                  <P>The Committee met in December to discuss the number of merit levels in the Handbook. That stemmed from ideas received the &ldquo;Request for Comments&rdquo; exercise in the spring of 2000. A couple of librarians suggested adding an additional merit level. The Committee realized that we were unsure of the intent of the suggestion and decided to return to Council for further discussion.
  
                  <P>The issue was raised at Executive Committee and slated for an open discussion at a Council meeting. However, the next meetings were cancelled. During that time Executive Committee decided that because the call for change was small and tabled the matter.

                    <H3>Committee on Academic Professional Status</H3>
                    <P>Members: Santos Vega, Chair; Victor Becerra, Maggie Mangini, Stefan Myhajlenko, Helen Seaton, and Linda Shackle. Victor and Stefan were the newly elected members.
  
                  <P>An ongoing issue this year involved the status of Academic Associates (AA). They are Academic Professionals without continuing status. The majority of the Academic Associates are academic advisors. They are all required to have a master&rsquo;s degree and some have a Ph.D. Victor Becerra, an Academic Associate, was elected to membership on CAPS for the next three years. Victor left ASU at the end of the semester. Carol Behl was elected as the new AA representative. Two of their main concerns are voting rights and a grievance procedures. A letter was drafted and sent to Dr. Hackett concerning the voting rights issue.
  
                  <P>Dr. Gail Hackett, the new Vice Provost attended a get acquainted meeting of CAPS on February 7. Dr. Hackett discussed some of the steps she has taken to become better informed about Academic Professionals. The issue of Academic Associates was also discussed.
  
                  <P>Gary Hembree, Chair of the AP Grievance Committee, visited at the February 7 meeting and presented some changes needed in AP bylaws and procedures to conform with the October, 1999 Arizona Supreme Court ruling on the rights of grievants to representation by counsel. The Grievance Committee will draft the changes and bring to CAPS. Then it will be brought to all APs and then to the Personnel Committee of the Academic Senate for comment. Faculty and Classified Staff have already made the necessary changes.
  
                  <P>CAPS sponsored two brown-bag lunch meetings open to all APs to feature the work of Academic Professionals at ASU. Richard (Dick) Filley, head of the Corporate Leaders and Internship Program at the College of Engineering, spoke at the November 1 meeting, and Betty Craft, Director, Distance Learning Technology, was the featured speaker at the May 2 meeting. Betty spoke about the delivery systems, the courses, and the students in the distance learning program at ASU.
  
                  <P>The new CAPS members for the 2001/2002 year are Carol Behl, Annie Platoff, and Patricia Feldman. Usually there are only two new members elected but an additional person was needed to replace Victor Becerra. Patricia was the alternate and will serve for two years rather than the usual three years. Maggie Mangini and Helen Seaton are rotating off the committee this year.
