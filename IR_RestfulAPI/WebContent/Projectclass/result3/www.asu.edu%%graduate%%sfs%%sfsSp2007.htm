    <br>
    Is graduate school right for you? Going to graduate school affects the rest of your life. There are both pros and cons to continuing your education. Students choose graduate school for many reasons, including intellectual curiosity and professional advancement. Some choose grad school because they aren't sure what to do or don't feel ready for a job. 
	<br>
    <br>In this seminar our speakers will help you with answers to some of the following questions: 
	<br><br>
    
    <ul>
      <li> Why do I want to go to graduate school? Is it for the right reasons?</li>
      <li>	What are my career goals?</li>
      <li>	Will graduate school assist me in meeting my career goals?</li>
      <li>	What will I specialize in? What are my interests?</li>
