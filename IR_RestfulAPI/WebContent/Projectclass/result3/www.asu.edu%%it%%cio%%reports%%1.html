<p>This report provides a summary of recommendations of the external 
<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> review team that 
visited <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> on December 1 &mdash; 2, 2003.
The team was charged with assessing the current 
status of information technology planning, resources, programs and services at the 
university and providing external guidance and perspective to 
<acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym>. The specific focus of 
the <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> review is to assess current 
issues and future directions, as guided by a set of 
questions directed to the panel by Provost Glick. Each question is followed by a brief 
summary of the team's comments and recommendations.  It should be remembered that 
these comments are based upon the information gathered during the two day visit and not 
the result of an in-depth study.</p>

<h3>Are the university's <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> resources 
strategically positioned for current and future needs?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There is little historical evidence of comprehensive strategic planning, both at the 
university level and within the Information Technology unit.</li>
  <li>The central <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> budget and 
staffing levels appear low for an institution of <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>'s 
size and aspirations, and it appears that the unit has had difficulty balancing its resources 
with its mission. The organization does not exhibit a "can do" attitude and seems to 
defensively retreat behind a perceived lack of resources.</li>
  <li>Communication between <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> and 
  campus academic and administrative leaders is 
mostly of a tactical nature, rather than strategic. Consequently, 
<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>'s <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> 
vision, directions, and challenges are not widely recognized or understood throughout the 
institution.</li>
  <li>Although <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> East and 
  <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> West have made it a priority to equip classrooms 
with multimedia presentation capabilities and network connections, this appears to have 
been a low priority on the main campus. Faculty interviewed by the visiting team 
lamented the lack of these resources. Faculty also complained about cumbersome 
scheduling procedures for technology equipped classrooms. Another area that was 
identified as needing improvement was the student computer labs, where many 
computers are reportedly as much as 5-6 years old and running old software.</li>
  <li>Faculty also pointed to a lack of high performance computing capacity as a 
shortcoming and a noticeable level of frustration was expressed by faculty who reported 
they do not believe they can obtain access to the recent T-Gen high performance 
computing cluster. The team heard reports of high performance computing clusters being 
developed at the departmental or project level. There appears to be no process of 
information sharing, articulation, or policy setting in this area, leading to suboptimal use 
of resources. There is clearly a need to foster a community of faculty with current or 
emerging needs for high performance computing and networking working in conjunction 
with Information Technology so that existing resources can be coordinated, shared and 
new resources planned in a more holistic fashion.</li>
  <li>Another area where current needs are not being met is in disk space for email, and 
possible other areas such as Blackboard and web hosting.</li>
  <li>The current administrative computing strategy is flawed in two significant ways. 
First, the strategy appears to be based more on the avoidance of making the required 
investment than developing the administrative applications and services required to meet 
the needs of <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>'s constituents now and 
into the future. An effective forward-looking 
<acronym title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</acronym> strategy needs to be defined 
and costs identified so that attention can be drawn to the 
considerable planning, implementation and funding requirements. The second flaw is the 
lack of a "visible" application platform architecture. For 
<acronym title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</acronym> systems, other enterprise-wide 
applications (calendaring, card access, facilities, etc) and departmental systems to 
interact, exchange data and authorizations, and be accountable, the set of shared 
application services (databases, web servers, application servers, directory services, etc.) 
must be identified, developed, and supported.</li>
  <li>Planning and implementing a new <acronym title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</acronym> 
  system typically takes 5 &mdash; 10 years. Given 
the age of <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>'s 
<acronym title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</acronym> systems and their 
reliance on COBOL, planning efforts should start immediately for transition to a 
new <acronym title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</acronym> system.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Are there current/short-term or potential points of failure that need to be addressed to 
insure that sufficient, reliable <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> 
resources are available to meet university needs?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The university data center appears to be orderly and well maintained. The average 
age of the primary servers or clusters is low, and extensive use of identical rack servers 
running Windows or Linux serves to increase reliability and reduce operating costs. 
However, Information Technology has identified several single points of failure that  
need to be addressed immediately for critical systems. The team heard several anecdotal 
reports of reliability issues with regard to Blackboard and electronic mail services. In 
both cases, the causes appear to be a combination of external factors and internal system 
management issues.</li>
  <li>The existing campus network is in serious need of an upgrade to address capacity, 
security and reliability issues, and there is a need for an extensive new infrastructure to 
serve the research and educational facilities planned or under construction.</li>
  <li>In addition to the needed network upgrades, there are significant vulnerabilities 
above the network level that have not been explored, prioritized, or assigned funding. 
<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> 
staff across campus stated that there was a high likelihood of a major privacy spill, where 
sensitive student, financial, or research information could be hacked or exposed to the 
public. <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> lacks a proper response 
unit and strategies to address denial of service 
(DOS) and other network attacks. The central Web authentication service has not kept 
pace with demand and is not equipped for its current load. One of the factors that may 
hide these vulnerabilities is the lack of <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> 
auditors in the campus and system audit 
service. Some assessment function is necessary so that the less visible points of failure 
can be identified and addressed before serious problems occur.</li>
  <li>There is no centralized security point for coordinating and leveraging distributed 
security efforts.</li>
  <li>Funding limitations have led to a lack of capacity planning, and project 
identification and prioritization. The lack of strategic planning and direction allows 
dramatic shifts of priorities when any funding becomes available.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Do existing capacities, technical capabilities and plans adequately address future 
university needs? Are university efforts to explore and evaluate new technologies and 
applications sufficient to guide planning for the future?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Faculty and staff described the process central <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> 
  used to select, test, and deploy a 
university spam filtering solution as "top down and inward looking". The rollout of this 
service caused a significant fraction of the email instabilities during Fall 2003 that the 
team heard about. It was not clear to the team how central 
<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> is evaluating emerging 
technologies, and despite the numerous opportunities that exist 
<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>  does not appear to be 
partnering with research faculty in this area.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are some possible targets for improving the breadth, quality and the efficiency of 
university <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> resources and services?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There are many current and emerging campus <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> 
  needs, as described in this 
document and known to many at <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>. What is 
needed is not so much a list of projects or 
targets of opportunity, which already exist in great number, but rather fundamental 
improvements in campus <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> planning, 
collaboration with other campus units and leaders, 
priority setting, and effective communication. There is a need to move information 
technology from what Bill Graves calls "random acts of progress" to a more strategic 
(<abbr lang="la" title="exempli gratia">e.g.</abbr>, linked to institutional goals and objectives) 
and systemic (<abbr lang="la" title="exempli gratia">e.g.</abbr>, broad, long range 
vision) way of doing business.</li>
  <li>The campus has a fragmented approach to enterprise-wide applications, both 
  <acronym title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</acronym> 
and others, that warrants a solid underpinning to provide the levels of service needed now 
and in the future.</li>
  <li><acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> security lacks effective coordination 
  among distributed departmental and central staff and needs a focus point and additional staffing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How should the university go about addressing the computational needs of its research 
community? What organizational model should be deployed?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>It does not appear that a thorough analysis has been done on the nature of research 
computing needs. Resources need to be leveraged into some form of resource grid.</li>
  <li>Beyond these high-end computing resources, the campus should take steps to 
improve the support of research desktops. Contract workstation support services at many 
campuses provide centralized economies, negotiated local customization, reliable 
backups, and improved overall campus security. <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> 
could provide seed funding for such a useful research computer support service, with 
ongoing support from projects and 
grants.</li>
  <li>Given the diversity of computational needs and interests, the review team 
recommends that <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> establish a faculty 
driven "cyberinfrastructure" task force, to 
include representation from central <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>, 
that will review and document <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>'s existing 
computational resource base and its researchers' current computational, communications, 
data, and visualization needs and obstacles. The task force should then make 
recommendations on how <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> can plug its 
resource holes and tie its existing resources 
together into a "technology grid" that will allow optimum accessibility and use of 
resources for the maximum number of researchers.</li>
  <li>All future centrally-funded distributed computing investments should be guided 
by this planning process. A diversity of computing architectures should be pursued in 
building the grid to match the diversity of application and data needs among faculty. 
Constructing a computing resource grid will also present faculty with research 
opportunities in areas such as peer to peer storage. As it learns to manage this 
infrastructure, central <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> can then 
partner with faculty in a way that it is not doing now, 
and turn the infrastructure into a "living laboratory" for research and education. New 
central investment in both infrastructure and staff to operate the environment is strongly 
encouraged to meet current needs and accommodate the vision for future university 
research growth.</li>
  <li>Central <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> should be the 
  integrator and/or operator of such an environment but 
faculty should steer the choices and selection of architecture and research directions. It is 
likely that <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> will not only have to 
expand staff resources in existing areas to be able to 
meet this challenge, but also add new core competencies by bringing in staff with new 
capabilities to insure success.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Online course delivery is becoming more critical to the mission of the university. We 
would like your input on how we could better serve the university community in this 
area.</h3>

<p>Although the number of online courses is increasing, the university does not have  a clear 
strategy for this activity.  Faculty and course development services for online instruction 
are provided by at least three units: the Center for Learning and Teaching Excellence, 
Distance Learning &amp; Technology in the College of Extended Education, and the 
<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> 
Instruction Support group. These units have recognized the duplication of services, and 
have taken steps to improve inter-unit coordination; however, more needs to be done to 
more cohesively integrate the services and resources of these units. The university should 
take steps to: select and plan a strategy for on-line and technology assisted courses; 
explore new pedagogies and improved instructional models; standardize approaches and 
develop clear and consistent instructional models; develop and implement scalable 
faculty and course development processes to insure quality; and implement systematic 
assessment for all technology assisted courses.</p>

<h3>What "next steps" do you recommend to improve the <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> 
environment at <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>?</h3>

<p>The visiting team provides the following as "next steps" that we believe have potential to 
improve the overall <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> environment 
at <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>.</p>

<ol>
<li>The review team observed a disconnect between academic and administrative 
units and the central <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> group. The 
current state of central <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> organization and operation 
is not sufficiently aligned with the university's directions to become a significant partner. 
It should also develop strategies for partnering with faculty to further the university's 
research and learning missions. We note that this is not an easy or quick process and will 
take a significant effort.</li>
<li>The Provost or President should assign responsibility and authority to empower 
the <acronym title="Chief Information Officer">CIO</acronym> and the Information 
Technology unit to set university-wide standards in areas 
such as: e-mail, calendaring, directory, authentication, networking and online learning. 
Standards should be set in collaboration with the distributed 
<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> community. The 
<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> 
Advisory Council could be an appropriate forum for advice and coordination of 
distributed <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> resources if all 
departments and colleges participate.</li>
<li>The <acronym title="Chief Information Officer">CIO</acronym> should initiate an 
<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> strategic planning process. The review team heard 
that there was no planning because there was no money. Continuing this approach seems 
to assure that there never will be any resources to meet 
<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>'s needs, or a plan worthy of 
financial support. The university administration should clearly articulate planning 
assumptions and expectations related to <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> 
throughout the institution. <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> can then work to 
create an <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> strategic plan aligned with 
these directions and provide a detailed set of 
commonly understood technical roadmaps outlining resource requirements that should 
allow <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> to better allocate resources 
currently in place and also articulate the need for 
additional resources. </li>
<li>The university's administrative computing systems will soon be at the end of their 
life cycle and need to be replaced. In the meantime, the current systems will likely not 
scale to the university's stated enrollment goal of over 90,000 students, and the lack of 
integration between systems will become increasingly limiting and problematic. Planning 
needs to begin immediately to assess the true useful life of current administrative 
applications, and to develop and gain consensus and support of university administration 
for a plan to have replacement systems in place when the legacy systems inevitably reach 
the end of their functional lives.</li>
<li>The review team recommends that the university establish a cross-cutting faculty-led 
task force to include central <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> 
participation under the guidance of the <acronym title="Vice President">VP</acronym> for 
Research to develop a forward looking plan for utilizing and advancing 
<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>'s 
cyberinfrastructure. The task force should be charged  to develop a plan and a business 
model for harnessing the existing computational resources in a manner that insures 
maximum support for, and leverage by the broad research and learning communities. </li>
<li>WEB resources such as the <acronym title="my Arizona State University">MyASU</acronym> 
portal are organized by departments, not services.  Faculty, staff, and students should be 
included in efforts to create a new model that provides access to university services, 
information, business transactions, and communications.</li>
<li>Institutional strategies and models for online learning should be developed, and 
support resources restructured to provide consistent, scalable support for faculty 
development, course development, and online learner support.</li>
