(3 credits).*  This course is appropriate for undergraduates or for graduate students who do not meet the Spanish skills
requirements for "Field Study of Andean/Amazonian Cultures" listed below.  All materials will be translated into English. 
 This course fulfills the ASU General Studies requirements in 1) Humanities and Fine Arts, and 2) Global Awareness.  
 Course requirement: Critical field journal analyzing the learning experiences of each day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/clas/latin/ecuador/Courses/spanish.htm">REL 494/598:
    Amazonian Culture &amp; Sustainable Environment</a> (3 credits).*   Prerequisites:
    basic ability to speak and understand Spanish; graduate student status or
    permission of the instructor. Course requirements: 1) Critical field journal;
    and 2) written research project 10-20 pages.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Grading policy and deadlines for turning in assignments</strong>:
  Because the faculty will not return  from Ecuador until after Winter grades
  are due, all students will receive "Incompletes" which will be converted 
to grades by April 1st, 2007.  Undergraduate courses have two important components:
  1) participation in the  various field learning experiences; and 2) the critical
  field journal. The journal must be typed and turned  in by February 15th, 2007.
  No journals will be accepted after February 15th. Grades in graduate courses
  are  based on three components: 1) participation; 2) the critical field journal;
  and 3) the research project. The  journal must be turned in by February 15th,
  2007. The research project must be turned in by March 15th, 2007.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Course syllabi and grading policies tentative until the first day of class</p>
<hr />

<p><strong>*Further explanation of field coursework</strong>: REL 332 and REL 494/598: Field Study of Amazonian 
Culture provide different rubrics for a field study of the oral history, literature, art, and religious life of 
the Quichua people.  In all of these classes, our time is structured around a particular learning encounter or 
series of encounters with the Quichua world.  For example, the class observes an Amazonian healing ceremony or 
listens to elders recount their memories of the Amazonian rubber boom or learns about the meaning of traditional 
hunting grounds while camped out in the rainforest with a Quichua family.  Following the experience, students 
write about the event in a journal.  After the class has had time to write in their journals, the class meets 
for a discussion of the event.</p>

<p>The key difference is that REL 332 is carried out in English and does not require Spanish.  The entire class 
works together as a group in various field learning experiences. This class is primarily designed for undergraduates 
and can be used to meet ASU General Studies requirements.  Graduate students who do not speak Spanish may also 
enroll in this courses.  REL 494/598: Field Study of Amazonian Culture is primarily designed for graduate students.  
They require the ability to speak and understand Spanish.  Greater flexibility for individual or small group field
 research is built into these courses. </p>
