          <h2>ASU professor keeps tabs on nation&rsquo;s aging aircraft </a></h2>
          <p> Makeshift graveyards and outdoor waiting rooms filled with thousands of aging military and commercial aircraft dot the United States landscape. Many of these planes will never again feel the freedom of the skies, as others patiently wait for their number to be called for maintenance and repairs. </p>
          <p> ASU professor Aditi Chattopadhyay and her research group are developing procedures to detect incipient damage that threatens the health and lifespan of military and civilian aircraft. She specializes in structural health monitoring, smart materials and adaptive systems, mechanics of composites, damage modeling and detection, dynamics and design optimization. </p>
          <p> Her research was featured in the December 2004 year-end highlight and review issue of <em>Aerospace </em><em> America</em><em>.</em> The &ldquo;Structure Highlights Modeling&rdquo; research section was devoted entirely to the research done by Chattopadhyay&rsquo;s ASU group. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that I am very proud of,&rdquo; says Chattopadhyay, a professor in the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering. </p>
          <p> Chattopadhyay&rsquo;s research team is developing a structural health monitoring system for applications to aircraft and other structural components. Her work in this area has been funded in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Army Research Office, NSF and NASA Langley. Chattopadhyay recently became the winner of a Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) award, which will allow her to continue further work in this field using a new technique called pulse-echo thermography. </p>
          <p> Conventionally, researchers study structural defects using expensive nondestructive methods such as ultrasonic techniques, X-rays and thermography &ndash; a method of measuring surface temperature. ASU researchers are developing a more cost-efficient hierarchical structural health system using sensors and sensing architectures. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking at different means of capturing and quantifying damage,&rdquo; Chattopadhyay says. </p>
          <p> ASU researchers first must become experts in diagnostics (how to detect damage) before they address healing. This research is important because of the thousands of aging aircraft in the military and commercial airline industry. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;We have so many airplanes that are sitting there for maintenance, and we cannot really properly estimate the leftover life,&rdquo; Chattopadhyay says. &ldquo;As they sit there waiting to be analyzed or diagnosed, they develop more damage because of corrosion.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Aging airplanes are defined as those that are flying beyond their designed service objectives of about 20 years. For newer models, that figure has extended to 30 years. About 20 percent of all active commercial jet airplanes are considered to be aging. In 2000, the average age of the nation&rsquo;s 150,000 single-engine fleet was more than 30 years old, according to the FAA. By 2020, the average age could approach 50 years. </p>
          <p> Another one of Chattopadhyay&rsquo;s projects featured in the issue focuses on multidisciplinary techniques to study the effects of structural nonlinearities on flutter &ndash; the catastrophic failure phenomenon in an airplane. Nonlinearity issues arise when a specified influence on a material produces a response that is not proportional to that influence, like driving a nail through a piece of lumber with a spoon. </p>
          <p> The developed numerical simulation procedure has increased computational speed by five orders of magnitudes. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;We can generate results and validate them against actual wind tunnel results,&rdquo; Chattopadhyay says. </p>
          <p> With these results, the research group is able to predict flutter dynamic pressure. This research has been funded by a four-year, $300,000 grant from NASA Langley Research Center. </p>
          <p> Another project featured in the magazine focuses on impact mechanics and composites. The three-year grant, funded at $225,000 by NASA Glenn Research Center , is in its last year. The background of this work hinges on engine containment systems, which must be able to contain fragments traveling at ballistic velocities. </p>
          <p> If not contained, a projectile traveling at these speeds can penetrate the composite materials in the body of the aircraft and cause fires, hull damage, occupant injury and component malfunction. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Modeling that high-velocity impact is very critical,&rdquo; Chattopadhyay says. </p>
          <p> The ASU research team has developed an efficient numerical framework to study the high-velocity impact in composite materials. </p>
          <p> Chattopadhyay&rsquo;s research work has been featured in <em>Aerospace America,</em> under &ldquo;Structure Highlights,&rdquo; over the last eight years. </p>
          <p> She believes this is a result of her students&rsquo; hard work. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;They get a special kick out of this, to see their work cited in a magazine that has the highest circulation in the aerospace field,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Being treated as a national highlight is very special.&rdquo; </p>
