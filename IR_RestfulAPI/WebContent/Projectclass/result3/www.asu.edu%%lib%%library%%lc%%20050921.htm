                  <blockquote>
                    <h3> ASU Downtown Campus: </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> Progress is being made on the downtown campus. There was a recent visit with IT to UA&rsquo;s Information Commons and ASU Libraries administration viewed the drawings at Downtown Campus last week. ASU Libraries is ready to start a search for a Library Director for the Downtown Campus, but they&rsquo;re waiting for the Provost to provide the funding for the position. </li>
                    </ul>
                  <br>
                    <h3> Budget: </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> The 21 st day enrollment numbers were what the university expected. ~61,000 students are enrolled this fall across all campuses. Each campus had an increase in enrollment. The Materials Budget increased 5.5%.The Operating Budget increased $79,800 (8%), but this increase also reflected a correction of an error from last year&rsquo;s budget. Jeanne Richardson is currently working on the budget for collections. There will be a 1.46% net increase in the salary allocation based only on filled lines. </li>
                    </ul>
                   <br>
                    <h3> New Centers and Institutes: </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> ABOR must approve all new Centers and Institutes, and they must have more than one faculty member. No salaries are paid specifically by these Centers and Institutes, and they don&rsquo;t offer degrees. They must self-generate money as well. The review process for Centers and Institutes is going through a redesign &ndash; the library has put ideas forward about what it needs to know to help support these units. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3> Salaries: </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> Dean Schmidt has spoken with the Provost about salaries. ASU Libraries aspires to have salaries at the median level of its peer institutions. The Compensation Committee will be addressing this issue this year. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> Shared Governance: </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> All campuses are looking at what is shared and what is individual. Each campus will continue to have its own mechanism for governance (i.e. Tempe Campus will have Academic Senate). </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3> AP Promotion and Continuing Appointment: </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> The ACD 5-07 is in the process of being revised. Librarians&rsquo; in the pipeline need to find time for professional and creative activities. There is a need to bring back the mentoring program to support those in the pipeline. </li>
                      <li> There is work to be done on the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook so that it reflects the changes in the ACD. As of now the &ldquo;old rules&rdquo; are still in effect. </li>
                      <li> Need to look at how travel money is spent &ndash; needs to be invested to serve well. Just attending a conference may not be enough. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3> United Way: </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> Dean Schmidt asked everyone to please consider donating to the United Way. </li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  <br>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Deborah Koshinsky asked what would happen now that Provost Glick had the data about the salaries. Dean Schmidt stated it goes into the mix and was &ldquo;on his radar.&rdquo;</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <br>
                  <blockquote>
                    <h3> Report from Kurt Murphy</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> Last minute revisions were being made to the ACD 507. Many of the library&rsquo;s revision suggestions were made. The document now goes to the Academic Senate Personnel Committee for further editing. Both Kurt and Dean Schmidt stated there were still issues with the ACD 507, especially with the renewal/non-renewal of contracts. They also encouraged everyone to look this as well as the rolling and three-year contracts. </li>
                    </ul>

<h2> IV. Committee Reports </h2>
                  <br>

                  <blockquote>
                    <h3>a. Personnel Committee &ndash; Brian Doherty (for JoAnn Mulvihill)</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> The personnel committee has met once this year. They will be working on two projects this year: 1) Revisions to the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook, and 2) Mentoring documents for the mentoring program. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> b. Research and Professional Development Committee &ndash; Mark Scott </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> RPDC has met twice this year. One proposal for research funds had been received. There is still $2000 remaining for research funding. The forms can be found on the Administration webpage . A total of $60,000 is available for travel funding. This includes an additional $6000 allotted by the Dean to cover the increased cost of air travel. The deadline for travel funding requests in September 28. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> c. Academic Senate &ndash; Deborah Koshinsky </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> The Academic Senate met twice, August 29 and September 12. Lisa Love, Athletic Director, gave a nice talk and outlined her three basic priorities
                          <ul>
                            <li> Work with coaches to make education the top priority </li>
                            <li> No scandals brought to the University by athletics &ndash; &ldquo;Play by the rules&rdquo; </li>
                            <li> Championships in athletics (BCS, Rose Bowl)&ndash; ASU is #11 and must move up. </li>
                          </ul>
                      </li>
                      <br>
<li> Student athletes need to get involved in their classes. </li>
<br>
<li> Provost Glick reported that research expenditures have tripled since 1995 to $80 million, but ASU has not moved up because other institutions have also seen similar increases. Freshman retention is expected to be 79% for 2005. In 1995 it was 68%; 2004 &ndash; 77%. He thanked everyone for their efforts to make this happen. Six faculty and 100 students from Tulane are completing their senior year at the School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture. </li>
                      <br>
<li> Revisions to Promotion and Tenure Implementation Policy for Faculty were discussed. Current guidelines are still not acceptable to faculty or administration. Faculty is concerned that there is no advocate addressing the relevancy of the standing area committees that will review performance and tenure cases. These committees are: Arts &amp; Design, Humanities, Physical &amp; Life Sciences, Social Sciences, Engineering &amp; Technology, Managerial &amp; Legal Studies. There is no committee for Professional Studies and the names of these committees are not those of a New American University. It was also pointed out by someone at the Polytechnic Campus that the President made the final decision, so it really didn&rsquo;t matter. Academic Senate President, Susan Mattson, said there were two areas of consideration for the faculty: promotion and tenure and the curriculum. Every unit needs to have their promotion and tenure bylaws clear and up-to-date. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3> d. Committee on Academic Professional Status &ndash; Lydia LaFaro (for Dan Stanton) </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> CAPS met on September 1. Marjorie Zatz, Vice Provost for Academic Personnel, was at the meeting to discuss academic policies. They reviewed the revisions and new text of ACD 507, which was also distributed to all AP&rsquo;s for review and comment. Committee representation selections were made for the year. The Fall Spotlight Lecture will discuss the policies for post-docs. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> e. Compensation Committee &ndash; Mimmo Bonanni </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> Compensation Committee had not met this year. They will be working with Kurt Murphy this year to look at salaries and make comparisons with peer institutions. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> f. Review Committee &ndash; Ginny Sylvester </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li> The Review Committee is currently working hard and expects to be finished by the end of October. No letters had been written yet. </li>
                    </ul>
