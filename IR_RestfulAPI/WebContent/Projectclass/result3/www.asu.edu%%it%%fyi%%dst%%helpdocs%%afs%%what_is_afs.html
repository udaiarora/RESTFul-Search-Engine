What is AFS and how does it work?
</center></h2>
<p>
AFS, the Andrew File System, is a distributed file system which allows a 
potentially large set of machines across several networks to share access 
to a set of files in a uniform manner.  
<p>
AFS uses the client/server model, where all the data is stored on file 
server machines. Files are transferred to client machines as necessary and 
cached locally. 
<p> 
For example, at ASU, files belonging to individuals are stored on AFS file 
servers which are independent of the other clusters such
as research.asu.edu, stats.asu.edu, general.asu.edu,  
mac-networks and PC-networks.  When a individual accesses a file from one 
of the "other" clusters/client machines such as from general.asu.edu, the 
file is transferred to that client machine as necessary and cached 
locally.  The advantage that users have with this setup is that they can 
logon to any one of the clusters and have access to the same files.  In 
addition, they can share their files with other users across the 
network.  Additional information is available in the manual titled <em>AFS 
User's Guide</em> available from the main (previous) AFS web page.
