<P><A NAME="idxtsd0004">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtsd0003">&#13;</A>To analyze data with the SAS System,
data values must be stored in a SAS data set.
A SAS data set is a matrix or table of data values organized into
variables and observations.
<P>The <I>variables</I> in a SAS data set label the columns of the data matrix
and the observations in a SAS data set are the rows of the data matrix.
You can also think of a SAS data set as a kind of file, with the
observations representing records in the file and the
variables representing fields in the records.
(Refer to <I>SAS Language: Reference, Version 6</I> for more information
about SAS data sets.)
<P>Usually, each observation represents the measurement of one or more variables
for the individual subject or item observed.
Often, the values of some of the variables in the
data set are used to identify
the individual subjects or items that the observations measure.
These identifying variables are referred to as <I>ID variables</I>.
<P>For many kinds of statistical analysis,
only relationships among the variables are of interest,
and the identity of the observations does not matter.
ID variables may not be relevant in such a case.
<P>However, for time series data
the identity and order of the observations are crucial.
A time series is a set of observations made at
a succession of equally spaced points in time.
<P>For example, if the data are monthly sales of a company's product,
the variable measured is sales of the product
and the thing observed is the operation of the company during each month.
These observations can be identified by year and month.
If the data are quarterly gross national product,
the variable measured is final goods production 
and the thing observed is the economy during each quarter.
These observations can be identified by year and quarter.
<P>For time series data, the observations are identified and related
to each other by their position in time.
Since the SAS system does not assume any particular
structure to the observations in a SAS data set,
there are some special considerations needed when storing
time series in a SAS data set.
<P>The main considerations are how to associate dates with the
observations and how to structure the data set
so that SAS/ETS procedures and other SAS procedures will recognize
the observations of the data set as constituting time series.
These issues are discussed in following sections.
