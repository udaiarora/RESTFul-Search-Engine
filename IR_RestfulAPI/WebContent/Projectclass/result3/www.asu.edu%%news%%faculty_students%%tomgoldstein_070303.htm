      <h2>Goldstein to join Cronkite School</h2>
      <p>        <img src="facstudents_images/Tom-Golstein.jpg" width="216" height="203" align="right">Tom Goldstein, one of America's top journalism scholars and writers is
        joining ASU as the first Frank E. Russell Chair in Business and Journalism.</p>
      <p>Goldstein
          was dean of the graduate schools of journalism at both Columbia and
          Berkeley. He is a prominent teacher, administrator and journalist
        who has gained acclaim not only at esteemed educational institutions,
        but also at top newspapers like the Wall Street Journal and the New York
        Times. He will join the faculty of both the Walter Cronkite School of
        Journalism &amp; Mass Communication and the W. P. Carey School of Business
        at ASU in August.</p>
      <p>Anne Schneider, dean of the College of Public Programs
          at ASU, said Goldstein's keen journalistic sense and his business and
          legal acumen make him the
          perfect choice to hold the Russell Chair.</p>
      <p>"The Russell Chair was established
          to foster interdisciplinary work between journalism and other fields,
          especially business and public policy,"
          said Schneider.</p>
      <p>As both a journalist and a lawyer, Goldstein has a unique
          capability to develop new interdisciplinary programs that will challenge
          students
          to broaden their perspective and think critically about various issues,
          such as the completely different approaches that lawyers and journalists
          take in considering evidence and research. </p>
      <p>"I am thrilled to be returning
          to full-time teaching and writing after serving more than 13 years
        as a dean," said Goldstein. "Arizona State
          strikes me as a vibrant and highly innovative university, and this
        is an unparalleled opportunity for me to try things that I have never
        done
          before.</p>
      <p>"I can develop courses across disciplines - particularly business
          and journalism as well as law," he added. "I am also working on a lecture
          course for freshman that would familiarize them with some of the pressing
          issues of the media. These courses fit in neatly with my research interests,
          and I also look forward to having a chance to think systematically
        about the big issues facing the media."</p>
      <p>Schneider said, "There always has been
          a tension within journalism between its role as a pillar of democracy
          and its role as a business that is
          expected to turn a profit. Journalism has a central place in educating
          the public about contemporary social issues and public policy, but
        newspapers, television news and even news on the Internet must pay their
        own way. </p>
      <p>"Students in journalism, business and other fields need to confront
        this issue, as well as other issues about the role of journalism in contemporary
          society," Schneider added. "Professor Goldstein will permit ASU to
        bring
          new vitality to our discussion of journalism, business and public policy." </p>
      <p>The Russell Chair, created during ASU's Campaign for Leadership though
          a gift from the Phoenix Newspapers, takes a cross-disciplinary approach
          to education.</p>
      <p>The holder of the chair is expected to communicate a vision
          of the future role of journalism in society as well as the new economy
          and to translate
          the implications of that vision into the every day management of the
          media as a business. The goal is to prepare students and working journalists
          for success in the increasingly integrated media industry.</p>
      <p>The chair is
          named in honor of Frank Russell, former chairman of the board and publisher
          for Central Newspapers, the owner of the Arizona
          Republic and the former Phoenix Gazette. Goldstein will occupy the
        Russell Chair for a one-year term.<br>
        From 1997 to 2002, Goldstein was dean of the Columbia University Graduate
          School of Journalism. Goldstein served as dean of the University of
          California at Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism from 1988 until
          1996.</p>
      <p>He also
          has taught at Stanford, New York University, the University of Florida
          and the Kennedy School at Harvard.</p>
      <p>Goldstein is a graduate of
          Yale College, Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and
        Columbia Law School. </p>
      <p>He was the founding editor
          of "Juris Doctor," a magazine for young lawyers. <br>
        His professional journalism experience includes working as a reporter
          at the Buffalo Evening News, the Associated Press, the Wall Street
          Journal and Newsday. From 1973 to 1979, he covered legal affairs for
          the metropolitan,
        business and national desk of The New York Times. </p>
      <p>From 1980 to 1982,
          he served as press secretary for New York Mayor Edward Koch. After
        leaving the mayor's staff, he began to freelance, a career
          he still pursues. <br>
        He is the author of "The News at Any Cost," the editor of "Killing
          the Messenger," and co-author of "The Lawyer's Guide to Writing Well." </p>
      <p>Goldstein
        also currently is the West Coast editor of the "Columbia Journalism Review." <br>
