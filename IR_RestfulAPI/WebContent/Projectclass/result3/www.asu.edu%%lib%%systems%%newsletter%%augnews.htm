LIST's Newsletter<br>
August, 2002

</center>
<br>
Major changes are happening in LIST in August! Read on for the good news about WAM and SerialSSolutions, and a farewell to one of our favorite staff members, Jennifer Garcia.


<h3>Two new products to improve access to Electronic Resources</h3>

<b>SerialSSolutions for Electronic Journal Access</b>
<p>
On Monday, August 19, 2002, ASU Library patrons will have a new and improved way to 
access full text electronic journals.  To keep up with the ever-growing selection of 
electronic journals, the ASU Library has contracted with <b>SerialSSolutions</b> to manage 
the holdings for these resources.  <b>SS</b> contacts the vendors, publishers and aggregators 
and produces a list of updated holdings and URLs every other month.  Library staff 
can see the current list, accurate as of July 1, 2002 at: 
<a href=http://www.asu.edu/lib/techserv/ejh/geninfo.html>http://www.asu.edu/lib/techserv/ejh/geninfo.html</a>
<p>
This address is distributed to library staff only for testing and review.  Comments 
on the list can be sent to ejournalcomments@mainex1.asu.edu.  On Monday, August 19, 
2002 the address for this page will be: 
<a href=http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/ejournals.htm>http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/ejournals.htm</a>
<p>
The list will be updated every other month, and the next update will be in early September.
<p>
In addition to the updated Electronic Journals List, <b>SerialSSolutions</b> has been working with 
Innovative Interfaces to provide information that can be directly downloaded into our 
catalog records.  Working through the <b>III Millennium</b> Serials interface, we will be able to 
load the holdings information and current URLs directly into the catalog records for each 
title.  This product is still in development, but look forward to more information in the 
future.

<p>

<b>Web Access Management (WAM) provides access to electronic resources for remote users</b>
<p>
LIST is currently implementing a new product, <b>Web Access Management</b>, which will enable the 
ASU Library to better serve our remote patrons.  We are working to increase the number of 
electronic resources available to remote patrons without an ASU PPP account.  Web Access 
Management will allow off-site users to authenticate via the On-Line Catalog patron 
database, and then will pass them through with an ASU IP address.
<p>
Initially users will need to configure their browsers to use the proxy service, but 
after the simple setup they will be able to use many of the resources available only 
to on-site or ASU PPP users.  Look forward to additional information on this product 
as development continues.       
<p><br>

<h3>Jennifer Garcia Moves Onward and Upward!</h3>

L.I.S.T. is sad to say goodbye this month to Jennifer Garcia, who recently 
completed law school, took (and, we are sure, passed!) the bar exam, and 
accepted a clerkship with a judge in the Arizona Court of Appeals. Jen took 
over so capably when our administrative secretary relocated two and a half 
years ago, and went to such lengths to fit her library job in with her school 
schedule and her law-related job, that it?s hard to believe she was only a 
student worker all that time. We will miss her dedication, cheerfulness, hard 
work, and fashion sense. Congratulations and good luck, Jen!

<h3>Feedback</h3>

Your feedback is always appreciated. Please send questions, comments, or suggestions to
