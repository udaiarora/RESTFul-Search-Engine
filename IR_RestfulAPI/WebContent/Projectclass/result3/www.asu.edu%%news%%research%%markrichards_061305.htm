          <h2> <font color="#000000">Biodesign Researcher serves in Kuwait while advancing science</font> </h2>
          <p>Mark Richards didn&rsquo;t want to choose between serving his country and helping to develop new ways to diagnose disease and monitor health.&nbsp; So, he&rsquo;s doing both.</p>
          <p><img src="research_images/Mark-Richards.jpg" width="288" height="216" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">In October 2004, Richards was called into military service as a member of the Arizona Army National Guard, and was deployed January 10, 2005 for a one year active tour of duty. He is stationed at Camp Doha, Kuwait as a machine gunner and driver in a military police team.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>In between missions, Richards helps advance the work of a research team at the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University in Tempe, Ariz. Before his deployment, Richards worked as an electrical engineer and computer scientist in the institute&rsquo;s Center for Applied NanoBioscience, helping develop devices that diagnose disease and detect biological agents. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;Mark is a talented engineer, and we knew we would miss him for many reasons,&rdquo; said Frederic Zenhausern, who supervised Richards. Zehnhausern is director of the Biodesign Institute&rsquo;s Center for Applied NanoBioscience and a professor at ASU&rsquo;s Fulton School of Engineering. &ldquo;The fact that he continues to help us in these circumstances is just an extension of the dedication he brings to everything he does. I would imagine that he&rsquo;s a great soldier; I know he&rsquo;s a great person,&rdquo; said Zenhausern.</p>
          <p>Richards currently spends about 4-6 hours a week troubleshooting electronic hardware and working on electronic circuits for the ASU projects he was involved in prior to his deployment. For example, he works on a DNA analysis project aimed at combining multiple medical tests into a single process, enabling faster diagnosis of disease.&nbsp; He also designs mechanical fixtures and cartridges used in the devices. Most of the work takes place on his laptop computer using computer-aided engineering and design applications.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>While most of Richards&rsquo; direct project work is on devices for health care use, other Biodesign Institute team members are working on military applications using the technologies he is supporting. These include devices to detect bioterrorism, flexible electronics, and small fuel cells to replace the heavy batteries soldiers must currently carry in the field. The research team is also developing devices to detect pathogens could save thousands of military and civilian lives in the event of a bioterrorist attack.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;My military and civilian jobs reinforce each other,&rdquo; said Richards. &ldquo;As a soldier, I have a vested interest in seeing new technology reach the field. I am gaining valuable insights in to how soldiers work, and what is practical and impractical in a tactical environment. At the same time, I tap my education and professional experience continually to help my unit here in Kuwait,&rdquo; he said.</p>
          <p>In addition to a 15-year electronics career, Richards is married and has a 14-year-old son and 21-year-old daughter. He decided to join the Arizona Army National Guard following the events of September 11, 2001. He said his decision to join the military is fully supported by his family, although they may not fully understand his motivation. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;It is especially difficult to explain why I joined a combat arms unit rather than seeking a non-combat position,&rdquo; Richards said. &ldquo;I feel a profound sense of duty and loyalty to my country. I consider myself to be extremely lucky to have the ability to serve in this capacity.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>The Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University integrates research in diverse disciplines including biology, engineering, medicine, physics, information technology and cognitive science. This approach is designed to accelerate discoveries that can be rapidly adopted by the private sector.&nbsp; For information, visit <a href="http://www.biodesign.asu.edu">www.biodesign.asu.edu</font></a></u> or call (480) 727-8322.</p>
