File Backup Strategies
</center></h2>
<p>
The /Backup directory found in your AFS space is updated each night and 
you can recover any file that was saved the day before /Backup was updated. 
<p> 
If you have any data that is very valuable to you, you should definetely store
it on another media (disk, tape, CD, etc.) that you can keep with you  
and take responsibility of.  More media, and locations you store your
valuable data less the possibility of loosing it.  Even though the data is 
quite safe in AFS space, as with any system there is the possibility of 
problems.
<p> 
Depending on the size of your data (for archiving) you can choose different
media: tape or floppy disk, or the hard disk of your own personal computer 
(UNIX workstation, MAC,or IBM-PC).
<p> 
There are utilities in UNIX that can reduce the size of the needed storage and
package it as a single file.
<dl><dt>
  The utilities are:
<dd>      tar           (for    *.tar     files)
<dd>      gzip          (GNU zip     for very good compression)
<dd>      compress      (standard UNIX for compression)
</dl><p>
To find more about this you can read the man pages by entering the following
at the system prompt:
<p>
 man topic<br>
 man  tar<br>
 man gzip<br>
 man compress
<p> 
Information on using <a href="compress.html">compress</a> and 
<a href="tar.html">tar</a> is also available in this Online Help System.
<p>
There are different kinds of tapes but for UNIX 4 or 8 mm is the norm.
The Visualization Center on the second floor of the Computing Commons
has a few tape drives and (in the near future) a CD recorder.
