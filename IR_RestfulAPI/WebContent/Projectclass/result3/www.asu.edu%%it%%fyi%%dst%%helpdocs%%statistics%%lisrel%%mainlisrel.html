LISREL8, PRELIS2 and MULTILEV5 on the Research Cluster
</center></h2>
<p> 
<h3>
I. General Description
</h3>
These are updated stand-alone programs from Scientific Software 
International. They are fully compatible with LISREL7 and PRELIS. 
<p>
PRELIS2 processes data and produces correlation and covariance 
matrices. LISREL8 uses this type of data to do factor analysis and 
structural equation modeling. Whereas, MULTILEV1 (for Multilevel 
models) deals with the analysis of data where observations are nested 
within groups.  The data may be supplied from other programs or typed in by 
the user. 
<p> 
Examples are located at:

<p>
<h3>
II. Some New Features of LISREL8
</h3><ol>
<li>A second and simpler language has been added to the package. It is 
called SIMPLIS. There is a book available on it from SSI, as well as 
examples in the example directory. Any LISREL model can be specified in 
it. In addition, SIMPLIS returns the model in the form of equations as 
well as matrices.
<p>
<li>The ! or /* symbols indicate that the rest of a line is a comment.
<p>
<li>The first lines are all read as titles until the program encounters 
DA in the first two columns of a line (in upper or lower case).
<p>
<li>The default value of AD is 20.
<p>
<li>The default value of PS = DI.
<p>
<li>In multiple group models (NG > 1) references to elements of column 
vectors should be done with two indices (group number and row number). 
Three indices indicate parameter matrices.
<p>
<li>Output has been reorganized for greater readability.
<p>
<li>Output data default is now two decimal places. (Change with ND=3 on 
the OU line).
<p>
<li>All latent variables will be standardized unless otherwise specified.
<p>
<li>There is a covariance matrix named TH between delta (X) and epsilon 
(Y).
<p>
<li>Unconstrained X. X is assumed to have any/random distribution if NK 
is default or NK=0.
<p>
<li>Goodness-of-Fit Statistics AIC, CAIC, plus all those available in 
EQS have been included. They may be saved in a file by putting
<p>
     GF = filename
<p>
on the OU line.
<p>
<li>Standardized solutions are given for SS and SC.
<p>
<li>General linear and non-linear constraints can be imposed on LISREL 
parameters.

III. LISREL8 SYNTAX
</h3>
<h4>
A. foreground operation
</h4><p>
lisrel [inputfile] [outputfile] [-size=nnnn] [-noquery]
<p>
where:
<p><blockquote></blockquote>
inputfile
<p><blockquote>
filename (with path if necessary) of the LISREL command
file (described in Joreskog, K.G. and Sorbom, D. (1989)
LISREL 7 User's Reference Guide.  Chicago, IL:
Scientific Software).
Filename and path may be up to 127 characters long.
<p>
Default: INPUT
<p>
Note: LISREL will prompt for an alternate filename if
the file cannot be found.  The program will stop if
the file exists, but the user has no read-access
rights.
</blockquote><p>
outputfile
<p><blockquote>
filename (with path if necessary) of the LISREL list
output file.
Filename and path may be up to 64 characters long.
<p>
Default: OUTPUT
<p>
Note: LISREL will terminate if the user does not have
write-access rights for both file and directory.
</blockquote><p>
-size=nnnn
<p><blockquote>
Size of the dynamically allocated workspace memory
region (in Kbytes) for data storage and
transformations.
<p>
Default: 256
<p>
Note: If a region of &lt;nnnn&gt; is not available, the
programs will display the size of the largest
available memory region and request a new size
value.
<p>
Note: In addition to this workspace (size) allocation,
lisrel8 reserves at least another 256K to satisfy
low-level dynamic memory requirements such as file
buffers (cf. AIX-LISREL/PRELIS User instructions).
</blockquote><p>
-noquery
<p><blockquote>
(Logical switch)  Short form: -noq
<p>
When this option is given on the command line, the
program will take default actions if necessary resources
are missing or insufficient.  In particular, it will
<p>
(a) automatically use the largest possible memory region
    for workspace if the '-size' parameter is set too
    large,
<p>
(b) terminate if a specified input file could not be
    found, and
<p>
(c) overwrite existing files with the same name as LISREL
    output files if they are not write-protected.
<p>
Note: When the '-noquery' option is used, both input and
output filenames must appear on the command line,
otherwise the defaults INPUT and OUTPUT are enforced.
</blockquote>
<h4>
B. background operation
</h4>
lisrel [inputfile] [outputfile] [-size=nnnn] &
<blockquote>
When a trailing ampersand (&) is added to the lisrel83
command line, then the program will run in the background.
It is important to remember that no dialog with the user is
possible in background mode, and the program will behave
just as if the '-noquery' switch had been set.  In all other
respects, the lisrel command line arguments have the same
meaning as in the foreground mode.
<p>
If the program encounters start-up difficulties before the
outputfile has been opened, it will leave a diagnostic
message in a file called 'lisrel8.log' and terminate.
lisrel8.log will be located either in the user's home
directory, or in the default working directory from which
the program was started.
</blockquote>
<p><h4>
C. Examples
</h4><ol>
    <li>To run a large model, decribed in the LISREL command
        file 'big.problem.input', with a workspace allocation
        of 4Mbytes and to send the list output to the file
        'big.output', specify:
<p>
            lisrel big.problem.input big.output -size=4096
<p>
    <li>To execute the previous example in the background, simply
        append an ampersand at the end of the command line:
<p>
            lisrel big.problem.input big.output -size=4096 &
</ol><p><b>
Sample Problems (from the User's Guide)
</b><blockquote>
All sample problems presented in the User's Guide were
shipped as ASCII files with the original LISREL distribution
material and may be found under the subdirectory /examples.
</blockquote><p><b>
Related Program(s)
</b><blockquote>
For calculating sample correlation and covariance matrices
from raw data, and for estimating asymptotic covariances,
a companion program,.I prelis2, is also installed on this
system.

<h3>
IV. Some New Features of PRELIS2
</h3><ol>
<li>All variables are assumed to be ordinal instead of continuous by 
default.
<p>
<li>! or /* indicates the rest of the line is a comment.
<p>
<li>Title lines at beginning of problem continue until some form of DA is 
encountered in the first two columns of a line.
<p>
<li>Use REWIND (RE) on the RA line to run stacked jobs on the same data.
<p>
<li>If a variable has more than 15 different values, PRELIS will group 
them in intervals and give the number in each interval.
<p>
<li>The MC keyword is no longer supported.
<p>
<li>Imputation of missing values by finding a case with similar values in 
other variables is the default. If none is found, no imputation is done.
<p>
<li>Raw data may be compressed by first reading it, then saving with 
<p>
     SR = filename
<p>
on the OU line.
<p>
<li>New variables for the same cases in different files may be merged 
using the RA command.
<p>
     RA = fname1, fname2, . . .
<p>
<li>Bootstrap Sampling
<p>
<li>Statistics Computation
<p>
<li>Asymptotic Covariance Matrices--see the Manual.
<p>
<li>In case of singularity or near-singularity, the program will use the 
Generalized Inverse. The command is
<p>
     GINV infile.AC   outfile.WM
<p>
<li>Homogeneity tests for Categorical Variables: Command is HT varlist.
<p>
<li>PRELIS2 will always print threshold estimates whenever they are 
computed.
<p>
<li>X-variables can be fixed or random.
