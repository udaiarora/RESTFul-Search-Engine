<h1 class="storyhead">Top Phoenix journalists join faculty </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>Two leading Phoenix television journalists are joining the ASU faculty to expand the award-winning TV newscast produced by the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, and to create a new program to provide news packages to stations across the state. </p>
<p>Mark J. Lodato, an investigative reporter at KPHO-TV/CBS 5 and former news director at the University of Maryland's journalism school, will become news director for the Cronkite School and its newscast, ?ASU NewsWatch,? in August. </p>
<p>Susan C. Green, managing editor at KNXV-TV/ABC 15 and former executive producer at WABC-TV in New York, will be founding director of the Cronkite News Service in downtown Phoenix and executive producer of ?ASU NewsWatch.? </p>
<p>?The school and our students will benefit enormously from the journalistic and teaching talents of Mark and Sue,? said Christopher Callahan, dean of the Cronkite School. ?These are top-flight journalists and passionate, caring teachers who inspire young journalists. They truly will be a dynamic duo.? </p>
<p>Lodato, a 1989 University of Missouri graduate, started his broadcast journalism career at WINK-TV, the CBS affiliate in Fort Myers, Fla., and then came to the Valley in 1994, where he served three years as a reporter at KNXV-TV. During that period he also taught at the Cronkite School as a member of the adjunct faculty. </p>
<p>He left Phoenix in 1997 to join WUSA-TV, the CBS affiliate in Washington , D.C. , where he served as a reporter and anchor. </p>
<p>Three years later, he joined the faculty of the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism. At Maryland, Lodato designed, implemented and directed a new daily student television news operation, with bureaus in Washington, D.C., and the state capital of Annapolis. </p>
<p>Under Lodato's leadership, that show, which reached 500,000 households in suburban Washington and the city of Baltimore, was named the best college-produced daily newscast in the nation by the Society of Professional Journalists in its first two years. </p>
<p>?What Mark accomplished at Maryland ? taking a weekly newscast and turning it nearly overnight into the best daily college show in the nation ? was nothing short of remarkable,? says Callahan, who as associate dean at Maryland helped recruit Lodato for that position. ?There is simply no one better prepared for taking our award-winning weekly show and making that transition into a premier daily newscast.? </p>
<p>Lodato has been back in Phoenix since 2003 as an investigative reporter at KPHO-TV. </p>
<p>Green, a 1985 graduate of the Cronkite School, started her career at KPNX-TV in Phoenix as a graphic artist, and moved up to associate producer and later producer before being named producer at KTTV-TV in Los Angeles in 1990. </p>
<p>She returned to Phoenix in 1992 as a producer, and later executive producer, at KPNX-TV. In 1996, she was named executive producer at WUSA-TV in Washington, and then returned to Phoenix as KPNX-TV's executive producer. </p>
<p>In 2000, she became executive producer at WABC-TV in New York before returning again to the Valley as managing editor at KNXV-TV. As managing editor, Green is responsible for story planning, assigning crews and managing the news flow throughout the day. She also coordinates the station's internship program. </p>
<p>?Sue has been an important leader in the Valley's broadcast news industry for the better part of two decades,? Callahan says. ?She also has been a regular guest speaker at the Cronkite School, and one of our finest alumni. Sue has the ability to develop young journalism talent with a caring, but firm, hand. She will be a tremendous asset to our school and our students.? </p>
<p>Green will be the first director of the Cronkite News Service, a program that will supply top-quality, student-produced TV news packages to stations across Arizona. She also will serve as executive producer of the ?ASU NewsWatch? newscast. </p>
<p>?I have always been proud of my roots at ASU, and I am now excited to be part of this unique and challenging expansion project,? Green says. ?For the past 20 years, I have had the opportunity to hone my skills in newsrooms across the country, and I am thrilled to now be able to share my knowledge with students every day. I look forward to being part of the Cronkite School's pursuit to become the best journalism school in the country.? </p>
<p>Lodato takes over for Mike Wong, who led ?ASU NewsWatch? to national prominence during his five years as news director. Under Wong's leadership, the show was named best college-produced weekly newscast in the nation this year by the Society of Professional Journalists. </p>
<p>Cronkite students under Wong's tutelage finished regularly in the top five nationally in the Hearst intercollegiate journalism awards program, including last year's first-place finish. </p>
<p>Wong will start July 1 as the Cronkite School's first full-time director of career services. </p>
<p>?Mike will be doing formally what he has done informally for years ? matching the right students with the right professional internships and job experiences,? Callahan says. ?We're indebted to Mike for the extraordinary broadcast news program he helped build.? </p>
