      <p>This new musical is about Leonardo da Vinci . and about his being the

        spans 67 years, from Leonardo's birth in 1452 to his death in 1519. It
        is a story of love and betrayal, determination and <br>
        ambition and, ultimately, of redemption. More than 20 original songs
        grace Leonardo's journey from Tuscany to the court of Milan and, finally,
        to Amboise, France. The Lyric Opera Theatre production marks the world
        premiere of this new musical drama. Directed by noted director J. Robert
        Wills, dean of the Herberger College of Fine Arts. </p>

        Feb. 27 - March 7, 2004<br>
        Evelyn Smith Music Theatre</p>
      <p>Once Upon a Mattress is based on the fairy tale of "The Princess and
        the Pea." Written by Mary Rodgers (daughter of Richard Rodgers) and Marshall
        Barer, the story centers on Prince Dauntless the Drab, who is allowed
        to wed only a true princess of royal blood.</p>

      <p>Also titled Sandrina's Secret, this opera in three acts was written
        by Mozart when he was only 19. Plot complications abound: mistaken identity,
        mad scenes, jealous fits and unrequited love. The Act II finale provides
        26 minutes of continuous music, four minutes more than the Marriage of
        Figaro.</p>
      <p>Theatre</p>
      <p>Alchemy of Desire/<br>

        and compelling play by one of America's new voices, Caridad Svich.</p>

        Lyceum Theatre</p>

        Drama. </p>
      <p>SubUrbia*<br>
        Nov. 8-22, 2003<br>
        Lyceum Theatre</p>
      <p>The New York Times calls SubUrbia, "Chekhov high on speed and Twinkies
        . A scathing study of rootless youth." This is performance artist, actor
        and playwright Eric Bogosian's acclaimed play about a group of 20-year-olds.
        Lance Gharavi directs.</p>
      <p>Please note: </p>
      <p>*SubUrbia will be presented in repertory and on the same set as Our
        Town. Both plays focus on small communities. Written 56 years apart,
        these plays are separated by World War II, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf
        War and momentous social changes. Linking the two provides an interesting
        and challenging theater-going experience. In juxtaposition, the productions
        speak to each other in unexpected, challenging ways. Audiences can see
        both plays for the price of one.</p>
      <p>SubUrbia contains mature themes and language.</p>

      <p>In this fascinating program, Kimberly Marshall, the Patricia and Leonard
        Goldman professor of organ in the Herberger College School of Music,
        shows the ways in which Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque composers incorporated

        one of the most spectacular organ building projects of the last century,
        which was devoted to rendering anew the music of Scheidemann, Praetorius
        and Buxtehude. Davidsson has designed a riveting program to capture the
        distinctive German sounds of the ASU Fritts organ.<br>
