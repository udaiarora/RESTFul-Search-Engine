<span style=text-indent:.5in>The Labriola Center is pleased to announce the first installment of the acquisition of a 5th generation American Indian
clay artist, Rosemary Apple Blossom Lonewolf. She has been a recipient of an ASU Fellowship and is currently a Chandler

great grandmother, Sara Fina Tafoya; grandfather, Camilio Sunflower Tafoya; father, Joseph Lonewolf; and an aunt, Grace
Medicine Flower. <br>
<span style=text-indent:.5in>Ms. Lonewolf, who has exhibited at both the Heard Museum and the Smithsonian Institution, is noted for
her finely incised seed pots, which often combine both modern and ancient themes. 
<br>
<TABLE>
<TD>Recently, she has been creating
mural-sized works of art in clay and her series of tiles depicting American Indians participating in modern day sports are an
integral part of the Chandler YMCA.</TD>
