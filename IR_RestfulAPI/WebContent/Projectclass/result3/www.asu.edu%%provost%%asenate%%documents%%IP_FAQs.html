<hr>
<p><strong>Q: The intellectual property policy provides that ABOR will own intellectual 
  property created with the &#8220;significant use of university resources.&#8221; 
  What does this mean? </strong> </p>
<p>A: Determination of whether significant resources have been used will require 
  a case-by-case analysis, but the ABOR policy provides the following guidance. 
</p>
<p>The following are not considered a significant use of resources: 
<ul> 
<li>Use of assigned office space </li>
<li>Use of library resources Use of personal 
  workstations </li><li>Use of personal computers</li> </ul><p>
  The following are considered 
  a significant use of resources: 
  <ul>
  <li>Research funding </li>
  <li>Funding allocated for asynchronous 
  or distance learning programs </li>

<p> <strong>Q: ASU paid a consultant to contribute content to an electronic publication. 
  Does ASU own any intellectual property rights in the consultant&#8217;s contribution? 
  Can ASU license the entire work without the permission of the consultant?</strong> 
</p>
<p>A: Payment for service is not enough to transfer any intellectual property 
  rights. To transfer rights, the parties need to enter a written assignment agreement. 
  If no assignment agreement has been entered, the consultant retains ownership 
  of intellectual property rights in his or her contribution, so ASU cannot license 
  the entire work without the written permission of the consultant. </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Does transfer of a copyrighted work also transfer IP (17 U.S.C. 
  &sect; 202):</strong>
<p>A: No. Ownership of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a 
  copyright, is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work 
  is embodied. Transfer of ownership of any material object, including the copy 
  or phonorecord in which the work is first fixed, does not of itself convey any 
  rights in the copyrighted work embodied in the object; nor, in the absence of 
  an agreement, does transfer of ownership of a copyright or of any exclusive 
  rights under a copyright convey property rights in any material object.</p>
  <hr>
<p><strong>Q: Must a transfer of copyright must be in writing (17 U.S.C. &sect; 
  204):</strong></p>
<p> A: A transfer of copyright ownership, other than by operation of law, is not 
  valid unless an instrument of conveyance, or a note or memorandum of the transfer, 
  is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such owner's 
  duly authorized agent. </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Q: Why does the ABOR policy say that ABOR &#8220;releases&#8221; IP 
  rights to the employee in the case of employee excluded works? Don&#8217;t the 
  IP rights just belong to the creator of the IP?</strong></p>
<p> A: Federal law provides that the employer owns the IP in a work prepared by 
  an employee in the scope of his or her employment, unless the parties agree 
  otherwise in a written agreement.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Q: What is the definition of &#8220;work made for hire&#8221; (17 U.S.C. 
  &sect; 101):</strong></p>
<p>A: A work made for hire'' is - </p>
<ol>
  <li>a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; 
    or</li>

    collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, 
    as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional 
    text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties 
    expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall 
    be considered a work made for hire. For the purpose of the foregoing sentence, 
    a ''supplementary work'' is a work prepared for publication as a secondary 
    adjunct to a work by another author for the purpose of introducing, concluding, 
    illustrating, explaining, revising, commenting upon, or assisting in the use 
    of the other work, such as forewords, afterwords, pictorial illustrations, 
    maps, charts, tables, editorial notes, musical arrangements, answer material 
    for tests, bibliographies, appendixes, and indexes, and an ''instructional 
    text'' is a literary, pictorial, or graphic work prepared for publication 
    and with the purpose of use in systematic instructional activities.</li></p> 
  </ol>
  <hr>
<p><strong>Q: Who owns works made for hire (17 U.S.C. &sect; 201):</strong>
</p>
<p>A: &#8230;Works Made for Hire. - In the case of a work made for hire, the employer 
  or other person for whom the work was prepared is considered the author for 
  purposes of this title, and, unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise 
  in a written instrument signed by them, owns all of the rights comprised in 
  the copyright.</p>
