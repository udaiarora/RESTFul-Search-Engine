      <h2>ASU findings could dash hopes for past oceans on Mars </h2>
      <p>After a decades-long
        scientific quest, scientists analyzing data from the Thermal Emission
        Spectrometer (TES) on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor
          spacecraft have at last found critical evidence the instrument was
          built to search for - the presence of water-related carbonate minerals
        on the surface of Mars. </p>
      <p>However, the discovery also potentially contradicts
          what scientists had hoped to prove: the past existence of large bodies
          of liquid water
            on
          Mars, such as oceans and seas.</p>
      <p>In a report published in the Aug. 22 issue
          of the journal Science, ASU planetary geologists Joshua Bandfield,
        Timothy Glotch and Philip Christensen
          present an exhaustive analysis of TES observations made at scales as
          small as 3 km (2 miles) of dust-covered areas of Mars. While TES has
          found no detectable carbonate signature in mile-scale surface deposits
          at any point during its six-year Mars mapping mission, the instrument
          has detected the mineral's "ubiquitous" presence in Martian dust in
        quantities between 2 and 5 percent.</p>
      <p><img src="research_images/marsdus_082203.jpg" width="360" height="243" align="right">Carbonate minerals have been an important target
          for Mars investigators because they form when carbon dioxide gas comes
          in contact with minerals
          and liquid water. Since Mars' atmosphere is largely carbon dioxide,
        scientists have theorized that any previous bodies of liquid water on
        the Red Planet
          could have left large carbonate deposits behind, as has been the case
          here on Earth. </p>
      <p>"We have finally found carbonate, but we've only found
          trace amounts of it. This shows that TES can see carbonates - if they
          are there - and
          carbonates can exist on the surface today," said Christensen, Korrick
          Professor of Geological Sciences at ASU and TES Principal Investigator.</p>
      <p>"However,
          we believe that the relatively small amounts that we see probably did
          not come from oceans, but from the atmosphere interacting directly
          with dust," Christensen says. "Tiny amounts of water in Mars' atmosphere
          can interact with the dust to form the small amounts of carbonate that
          we see. This seems to be the result of a thin atmosphere interacting
          with dust, not oceans interacting with the big, thick atmosphere, that
          many people have thought once existed there."</p>
      <p>"What we don't see is massive
          regional concentrations of carbonates, like limestone," says Bandfield,
          who spent a year refining the techniques
          that allowed the group to separate carbonate's distinctive infrared
        signature from TES's extensive spectral database, despite the mineral's
        low concentrations
          and the masking effects of the Martian atmosphere. </p>
      <p>"We're not seeing
          the white cliffs of Dover or anything like that," he says. "We're not
          seeing high concentrations, we're just seeing ubiquitously
          low levels. Wherever we see the dust, we see the signature that is
        due to the carbonate."</p>
      <p>Because there are known to be deposits of frozen water
          on Mars, the findings could have important implications for Mars' past
          climate history.</p>
      <p>"This
          really points to a cold, frozen, icy Mars that has probably always
        been that way, as opposed to a warm, humid, ocean Mars sometime in the
          past," says Christensen. "People have argued that early in Mars' history,
          maybe the climate was warmer and oceans may have formed and produced
          extensive carbonate rock layers. If that were the case, the rocks formed
        in those putative oceans should be somewhere."</p>
      <p>Though ancient carbonate
          rocks might have been subsequently buried by later layers of dust,
        Christensen points out that TES's survey of the
          Martian surface has found no strong carbonate signatures in any location
          on the planet, despite clear evidence of geological processes that
        have exposed ancient rocks.</p>
      <p>"We see so much erosion, places where the surface
          has really been eroded down in canyons and valleys and plains that
        have been stripped bare,"
          Christensen says. "It seems unlikely that the carbonate rocks could
        all be hiding out of view. When you look at the entire planet, you'd
        think
        that somewhere a little piece would be exposed."</p>
