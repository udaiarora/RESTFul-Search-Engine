      <h2>Professors feel pain of lost lives, science in shuttle disaster</h2>
      <p> The disappointment of losing scientific research aboard the Space Shuttle 
        Columbia pales in comparison to the immense grief of losing the seven 
        astronauts. It's impossible, however, for scientists involved in NASA 
        projects, including many at ASU, not to wonder how the tragedy will impact 
        their ongoing research.</p>
      <p>Overall, ASU researchers say the disaster will create a greater resolve 
        to create safer, better ways to explore the unknown.</p>
      <p>"I think there is a great drive to explore space that will not be deterred 
        by this," says Laurie Leshin, an ASU cosmochemist who has a proposal before 
        NASA for an unmanned mission to Mars. "If anything, this causes us to 
        dig in our heels even more and try to get out there more safely and more 
        often."</p>
      <p>University researchers have a long tradition of working with NASA. In 
        fact, the disaster had a direct link to ASU, as the shuttle was carrying 
        the research of a faculty member and an ASU alumnus. </p>
      <p>Professor Petra Fromme, from the chemistry &amp; biochemistry department, 
        lost all of her research data aboard the shuttle when it broke apart on 
        reentry. She was growing a series of protein crystals aboard the shuttle 
        and, upon returning to earth, the crystals would have been exposed to 
        an ultra-high level x-ray. This would have provided a clear, high resolution 
        picture of the protein's structure down to the atomic level. Defining 
        the structure would have given researchers a better understanding of the 
        process of photosynthesis - nature's process for converting light to energy.</p>
      <p>Fromme was in Florida at Kennedy Space Center where the shuttle was scheduled 
        to land. Within four hours of its landing, Fromme would have removed the 
        crystals the shuttle and prepared them for transport. The data from the 
        experiment, including a video of the crystals' growth, was all self-contained 
        with the experiment on the shuttle.</p>
      <p>As the tragedy unfolded throughout the day Feb. 1, Fromme and the other 
        researchers who had projects on the shuttle were sequestered at the space 
        center. She remained in Florida through Feb. 3 to disassemble the control 
        study she was doing with the project. She is scheduled to attend two academic 
        conferences and will not return to Tempe until mid-February.</p>
      <p>Cindy Hutchens, a 1986 graduate from ASU in mechanical engineering, was 
        in charge of the Vapor Compression Distillation Flight Experiment aboard 
        the Columbia. The project was a full-scale demonstration of technology 
        to turn crew members' urine and wastewater aboard the International Space 
        Station into clean water for drinking, cooking and hygiene.</p>
      <p>With the entire shuttle fleet now grounded as NASA investigates the cause 
        of the disaster, other shuttle research projects, as well as several related 
        to ASU, are on hold.</p>
      <p>Three Corner Sat, a fully functional three satellite constellation built 
        by ASU students in collaboration with New Mexico State University and 
        the University of Colorado at Boulder, was planned for launch from the 
        shuttle later this year or early in 2004.</p>
      <p>"Obviously the loss of human life is the most important concern," says 
        Helen Reed, engineering professor and faculty adviser for the ASU student 
        satellite program. "The key issue is to determine the cause and to fix 
        it for future missions. We will face a delay but that is a minor concern. 
        I know the students in our program are still dedicated to launching our 
        satellite, and our program will continue to move forward."<br>
        Reed said she met Feb. 2 with several of her U.S. Air Force contacts, 
        who are major sponsors for the Three Corner Sat, and they assured her 
        the satellite would still be launched.</p>
      <p>Reed said in the last week she has heard from many of her current and 
        former students about the disaster. In the nine years since the student 
        satellite program began, more than 600 undergraduate and graduate students 
        have been involved. Most of the former students are now working in some 
        capacity in the aerospace industry, including former students at both 
        Kennedy Space Center in Florida and Johnson Space Center in Texas.</p>
      <p>The delay in shuttle launches could also have an effect on a major tool 
        used by many ASU researchers - the Hubble Space Telescope. A maintenance 
        mission for the telescope is scheduled for a shuttle mission in 2005. 
      </p>
      <p>Rogier Windhorst, a professor in the physics and astronomy department, 
        said that without the proper maintenance, the telescope could fail by 
        2008. </p>
      <p>A failure of the telescope would have a major impact on space research 
        as a whole and ASU in particular. ASU is considered a major center for 
        the use of Hubble, used by Windhorst, ASU Astronomy Professor Jeff Hester 
        and countless graduate and postdoctoral students.</p>
