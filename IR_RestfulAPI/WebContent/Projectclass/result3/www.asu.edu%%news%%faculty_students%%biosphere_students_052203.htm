      <h2>Biosphere offers Fisher eye-opening experience</h2>
      <p>        Being a college-aged student who volunteers to live in relative isolation
          in Arizona's Sonoran desert flies in the face of conventional wisdom.
          There is hardly the kind of excitement that the typical twenty-something
          craves and "night life" is confined to a few nocturnal birds of prey.        </p>
      <p>But ask ASU senior Amber Fisher about her Fall 2002 semester at the
            Earth Institute and she will tell you that it was the single most
        influential experience of her college career. Fisher, who graduated May
        15 with a
          bachelor degree in political science, says she would not trade her
        experience for anything.</p>
      <p>ASU is one of more than a dozen college and university partners
          in Columbia University's undergraduate program at Biosphere 2 Center
          near Oracle.<br>
        Known as Earth Semester, the program is team-taught by social, biological
          and physical scientists and immerses students in studies that focus
          on the planet as a huge, complex interactive system. The program is
          innovative
          in that it provides experiences that are an important adjunct to other
          programs. </p>
      <p>Fisher says the Earth Semester was an eye-opening experience. </p>
      <p>"It's amazing
          to see a whole other side of school," she said. "Being part of an isolated
          campus taught me so much about myself, allowed me
          to develop close personal friendships and experience how remarkably
        dependent we as humans are on our planet." </p>
      <p>Earth Semester is offered twice a year
          at the Oracle facility and offers students 16 hours of undergraduate
          credit.</p>
      <p>The 250-acre campus is nestled
          in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains, and its centerpiece
          is a 204,000 cubic-meter enclosed glass
          and space frame structure that houses seven of the earth's ecosystems
          in miniature. Within the confines of the manmade dome are a rainforest,
          desert, savanna and a 900,000-gallon ocean - the largest of its kind
        in the world. </p>
      <p>Scientists and students who work inside the Biosphere 2
          facility do numerous research projects that are geared to better understand
          our planet and
        environment.</p>
      <p>Fisher worked with other students to perform ecological
          and hydrological impact studies of the campus landscape and then applied
          that data to
            design a public policy on land use. What impressed her was how the
            classroom experience could directly translate to real world experience.
            Students
            not only performed earth science, but also went through the permitting
          and review processes before writing their public policy. </p>
      <p>"We had the
          opportunity to experience both sides of the procedure - the ecology
        side and the government side, and play the roles of all stakeholders,"
        Fisher said.</p>
      <p>Students live in on-campus housing, and classrooms are equipped
          with the most current technologies. More than 400 students, many from
          ASU,
          have enrolled in the program since it was launched in 1996, soon after
        Columbia took on management of the Biosphere 2 center.</p>
      <p>Fisher said some
          of the closest friends she made during college were made at the Earth
          Institute. The experience also forged meaningful friendships
          with professors due to the close-knit community environment and numerous
          field trips where faculty and students work together to accomplish
        targeted goals.</p>
      <p>"At ASU we've placed a major priority that our undergraduates engage
          in research and other capstone experiences. The relationship with Biosphere
          2 provides them with yet another opportunity to do this," said ASU
        provost Milton Glick.</p>
      <p>After graduating from ASU, Fisher is spending the summer
          in a conservation leadership program with Northwest Youth Corps before
          entering graduate
          school with a focus on environmental public policy. She says in one
        short semester the experience and knowledge gained at Earth Institute
        has inspired
        her for a lifetime and given her direction for the future.</p>
