      <h2>Minority student enrollment continues to climb at ASU</h2>
      <p>Minority students enrolled in record numbers this fall,
            surpassing the overall enrollment increase. Minority enrollment at
            all three campuses
          has hit an all-time high of 22 percent of the total student body, up
          from 10 percent in 1985 and 15.5 percent just 10 years ago.</p>
      <p>Hispanics
          make up the largest group at 6,649, an increase of 10.4 percent over
          last year. The highest growth rate was in the number of African
          Americans, at 2,005, a 13.4 percent jump. A record 1,276 American Indians
          and 2,757 Asian Americans enrolled, both up about 9 percent.</p>
      <p>Several years
          ago ASU stepped up recruitment in target high schools and launched
        intensive early outreach efforts, bringing students to campus
          as early as eighth grade. This year the university offered more financial
          aid, translated additional materials into Spanish and made numerous
        community presentations, trying to increase access for first-generation
        and minority
          students. </p>
      <p>ASU also implemented a system to keep track of these students
          as they progress through high school, maintaining continuous contact
          with them
          and their parents. As a result, a record 30 percent of first-time ASU
          freshmen from Arizona are minority students.</p>
      <p>"We have been working on
          all of these programs for a number of years, and I think the fruits
        of these efforts are starting to pay off," says
          Ken Hollin,<br>
        starting to pay off," says Ken Hollin, assistant admissions director
          for student recruitment.</p>
      <p>"Increases like these are the result of a collaborative
          effort of many departments around campus. Many long hours, hard work
          and solid commitment
          go into making our efforts successful."</p>
      <p>In the midst of a 3.7 percent
          overall increase in ASU enrollment, the College of Nursing registered
          an eye-opening 19 percent upsurge. While
          the college has not yet increased the number of spots in the upper-division
          professional nursing program from 60 per semester at Main campus and
          20 at ASU West, this January they will launch a program at ASU East
        with 20 - 40 additional students. The state universities have a goal
        of doubling
          the number of nursing graduates in five years. </p>
      <p>"The number of pre-nursing
          students admitted was the highest we've ever seen," says Jean Stengel,
          director of student services. "People hear
          about the nursing shortage and they respond, as the economy turns south.
          We also do lots of outreach into the community colleges - we really
        work on that."</p>
      <p>The Colleges of Nursing, Public Programs and Law enrolled the
          highest proportion of minority students of all the schools on campus. </p>
      <p>The Barrett
          Honors College enrolled 2,696 students, including 812 freshmen. Most
          of this year's record class of 173 freshmen National Merit Scholars
          are in the college. High school grade-point average for this year's
        freshmen was 3.36, the same as last year, but slightly more were in the
        top 15
        percent of their class. </p>
      <p>Psychology is the most popular major among all
          students, with biology, political science and English majors also making
          up a large portion of
          the enrollment in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. In the
        College of Engineering, more than one quarter are computer science and
        engineering
          majors, and in the W. P. Carey School of Business, the most popular
        majors are finance and marketing. Journalism is the favorite major in
        the College
        of Public Programs.</p>
