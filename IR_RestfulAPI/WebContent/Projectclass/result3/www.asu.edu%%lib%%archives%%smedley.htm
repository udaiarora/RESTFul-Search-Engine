      <p>Agnes Smedley was born in Missouri in 1892 the second of five children 
        to a poor farming family. Her family moved to a Colorado mining town when 
        she was ten where she worked to support the family while attending school 
        until her late teens. Smedley never finished her formal training yet she 
        excelled in school. She accepted a teaching position in New Mexico that 
        led her to desire further education. From 1911-12 she attended the Tempe 
        Normal School as a special student. As a contributor and editor of the 
        Tempe Normal Student she began her career as a journalist. At Tempe Normal 
        she met and married Ernest Brudin and moved to California where she explored 
        socialist theories which influenced her political direction and her social 
        conscience. Marriage did not suit her so after six years she divorced 
        and moved to New York City.</p>
      <p><br>
        In New York City she worked for Margaret Sanger on the Birth Control Review 
        and became involved with the movement to support India's independence 
        from Britain. Smedley relocated to Germany to live with Viren Chattopadhyaya(Chatto) 
        and worked for Indian independence. These were tumultuous years with serious 
        breakdowns both personally and politically. After psychoanalyses and the 
        completion of her autobiography he broke away from Chatto and the Indian 
        cause. As if this book released her she moved to Shanghai in 1929.<br>
        For years she chronicled the Chinese revolution as a war correspondent 
        for Germany, Britain and later the United States. She told the story of 
        the peasants, the Red army and the oppressed of China to the world. In 
        October of 1937 she joined the Eighth Route Army in the field. As it became 
        increasingly dangerous, she left the field in 1937 to organize medical 
        supplies and continue writing. From November 1938 to April 1941 she visited 
        resistance units under both the Communist and Guomindang leaders in the 
        war zone, the longest tour of the Chinese war by any foreign correspondent, 
        man or woman.</p>
      <p><br>
        Convinced she could support the Far East in Washington D.C. she returned 
        to the United States. Smedley remained an advocate of China, writing several 
        books about China's revolution. She lived at a writer's colony in New 
        York State known as &quot;Yaddo&quot; through the middle forties. She 
        was a regular contributor to The Saratogian and wrote feature articles 
        for The New Masses, The Nation and The New Republic. In 1947 during the 
        McCarthy era she was accused of espionage. Smedley moved to England during 
        the investigation and died in 1950. In 1952 the F.B.I. closed the investigation.</p>
      <p><br>
        Over the years Agnes Smedley had friends and associates who supported 
        a wide range of causes. Margaret Sanger, Emma Goldman, Roger Baldwin, 
        Ladip at Rai, Kathe Kollowitz, Lu Xun, Nehru, Richard Sorge, Soon Qingling, 
        and Chou En-Lai are some of the people who influenced Smedley's life.</p>
      <p><br>
        Influenced by her impoverished childhood Agnes Smedley was an advocate 
        for women, children, peasants and liberation for the oppressed.</p>
