<p><b>Date of Introduction</b>

<br>for First Reading: November 13, 2000

<p><b>Date of Second Reading:</b> November 27, 2000

<p><b>Title of Motion: </b>Request from the College of Liberal Arts and

Sciences for the Implementation of an MA in Asian Languages and Civilizations

<p>1 The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic

Senate approval

<br>2 of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

for the implementation

<br>3 of an MA in Asian Languages and Civilizations

<p><b>Rationale:</b>

<p>The program to be implemented at ASU seeks to prominently prepare students

for immediate entry to the job market or for entrance to professional schools

in such fields as law, business, journalism, even medicine and engineering.&nbsp;

It will aim to attract students who seek a higher level of understanding

of the language and culture of Japan or China as a valuable asset in their

professional careers.&nbsp; At the same time, it will provide a strong

start for those who eventually go on to a doctoral program at another institution.&nbsp;

In keeping with the idea of advanced learning both inside and outside the

classroom, all degree candidates will be required to have spent at least

one academic year residing in the country of their specialization since

their graduation from high school

<p><b>Date of Introduction</b>

<br>for First Reading: November 13, 2000

<p><b>Date of Second Reading: </b>November 27, 2000

<p><b>Title of Motion:</b> Request from the College of Liberal Arts and

Sciences for the Establishment of Undergraduate Certificates in American

Public Policy, Civic Education, and International Studies

<p>1 The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic

Senate approval

<br>2 of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

for the establishment of

<br>3 Undergraduate Certificates in American Public Policy, Civic Education,

International Studies

<br>Rationale:

<p>The Certificate in American Public Policy is designed for undergraduate

students anticipating careers in government, public service, or public

administration and/or who are interested in understanding the dynamics

of policy-making and administration in American government.

<p>The Certificate in Civic Education is designed to contribute to the

preparation of undergraduate students for (a) careers in primary and secondary

education (where the teaching of government and civics may be involved);

(b) careers or voluntary participation in politics, public service, and

civic and social movements; and (c) further education in law, journalism,

business, history, sociology, political science, and other fields where

an understanding of questions of citizenship, leadership, community, democracy,

public responsibility, and ethics is crucial.

<p>The Certificate in International Studies is designed to prepare students

for careers in government agencies, international governmental and non-governmental

organizations, multinational firms and banks, and for graduate studies

in International Relations or Political Science.

<p>These Certificates do not substitute for degree requirements in any

subject, including Political Science.The certificates will add a dimension

and complement the student?s chosen major.

<p><b>Title of Motion: </b>Request from the College of Liberal Arts and

Sciences for the Establishment of Graduate Certificate in Statistics

<p>1 The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic

Senate approval

<br>2 of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

for the establishment of

<br>3 a Graduate Certificate in Statistics.

<p><b>Rationale:</b>

<p>The proposed certificate seeks to provide statistical training for graduate

students at ASU and professionals in the metro-Phoenix area.&nbsp; Statistical

analysis is one of the primary tools of modern scientific reasoning.&nbsp;

Since the need to draw correct and defensible conclusions from data arises

so widely, statistical techniques are useful in almost all disciplines.&nbsp;

There is a consequent demand for professionals who are well educated in

statistics, and the demand is growing.&nbsp; The proposed certificate seeks

to address this need.&nbsp; In particular, the goal is to provide an opportunity

for students to enhance their ability to apply statistics in their chosen

field of expertise.
