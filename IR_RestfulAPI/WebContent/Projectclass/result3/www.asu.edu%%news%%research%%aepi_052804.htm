      <h2>Information to Make Important Education Policy Decisions in Arizona Often Lacking Study Finds </h2>
      <p>Tempe, Ariz.-"The Condition of Education in Arizona: 2004", a collection of 10 policy briefs that examine a broad spectrum of critical challenges facing Pre-K-12 education in Arizona, was released Friday by the Arizona Education Policy Initiative (AEPI). </p>
      <p>"While the topics addressed in the report are varied, a common thread can be observed consistently throughout: Arizona often lacks adequate data to make important education policy decisions," said Alex Molnar, professor of educational leadership and policy studies and director of the Education Policy Studies Lab at Arizona State University.&nbsp; "The authors repeatedly find a lack of data, conflicting data, or data that cannot be cross-referenced," he said. </p>
      <p>"The Condition of Education" report is the first of a planned series of annual reports on Arizona education sponsored by AEPI to provide expert analyses for use by lawmakers, educational leaders, and other stakeholders in making important education policy decisions. </p>
      <p>Launched in 2003, the AEPI is a collaboration of Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University , and the University of Arizon .&nbsp; The initiative was created to focus the expertise of faculty at Arizona 's three public universities on significant education policy issues in the state.&nbsp; "The Condition of Education" report offers a snapshot of public education in Arizona and expert analyses on 10 key topics including: early childhood education and care; English Language Learners; special education; minority access and participation; teacher quality; school administration; school accountability; standards and assessment; school choice; and school funding. </p>
      <p>In their report on early childhood education and care, Michael Kelley of ASU West Campus and Joseph Tobin of ASU Tempe Campus note that there is a large number of children on the state's childcare subsidy waiting list, and that there is a significant disparity in wages paid to early childhood educators and caregivers.&nbsp; Find the brief at: </p>

      <p>Kate Mahoney of ASU East Campus and Marilyn Thompson and Jeff MacSwan, both of ASU Tempe Campus, explore how policies affecting English Language Learners (ELLs) are interpreted and implemented in the classroom, and to what extent ELLs are progressing academically, only to find that the available data are not adequate to answer these questions.&nbsp; Find the brief at: </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/educ/epsl/AEPI/EPSL-0405-106-AEPI.doc">http://www.asu.edu/educ/epsl/AEPI/EPSL-0405-106-AEPI.doc </a></p>
      <p>In their examination of education for children with disabilities, Sarup R. Mathur and Robert B. Rutherford, both of ASU Tempe Campus, found gaps in the data needed to understand the quality of education that children with disabilities receive.&nbsp; "There is, for example, little, if any, data available on the quality of the state's pool of special education teachers or on factors that lead to the retention of high-quality special education teachers in Arizona ," Molnar said.&nbsp; Find the brief at: </p>

      <p>Josu&eacute; M. Gonz&aacute;lez and Elsie M. Szecsy, both of the Southwest Center for Education Equity and Language Diversity at ASU Tempe Campus, found the data collected by the Arizona Department of Education (ADE) on minority student performance to be of limited value because it could not be disaggregated in ways that would make it possible to identify meaningful trends relating to achievement.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>"Gonz&aacute;lez and Szecsy note that by not correcting these data deficiencies, it's difficult, if not impossible, to compare the adequacy of Arizona school programs to those of other states, or to evaluate the quality of the ADE's leadership in helping local schools improve education for all children," Molnar said.&nbsp; Find the brief at: </p>

      <p>In her examination of the twin issues of teacher shortages and teacher quality, Sherry Markel of NAU observes that although the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) equates teacher quality almost exclusively with subject matter knowledge, many experts emphasize pedagogical skills that NCLB ignores.&nbsp; "This is a significant issue in Arizona because, in the face of anticipated teacher shortages in specific subjects and in certain geographic areas, there is increased pressure for "fast track" teacher education programs that greatly reduce training in pedagogical skills," Molnar said.&nbsp; Markel notes that a growing body of research raises important questions about the value of such "fast-track" models.&nbsp; Find the brief at: </p>

      <p>In their report on the supply, demand, and preparation of school administrators, Arnold Danzig of ASU Tempe Campus and Walter Delecki of NAU suggest that schools across the state would benefit from a more rigorous and better-organized system for selecting the best candidates for administrator preparation.&nbsp; Find the brief at: </p>

      <p>Examining attempts to assess public education by measuring student achievement, David R. Garcia of Think AZ and Joseph M. Ryan of ASU West Campus find that recent changes in the state measurement formulas have made it virtually impossible to draw valid conclusions about school improvement and, therefore, impossible to determine the impact of the Arizona LEARNS accountability system.&nbsp; Find the brief at: </p>

      <p>Thomas M. Haladyna of ASU West Campus describes the incompatibility of the data from two leading measures of achievement: the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and the Stanford Achievement Test (Stanford 9).&nbsp; This incompatibility calls into question the validity of conclusions about the performance of Arizona students relative to that of students in the rest of the U.S. &nbsp; Find the brief at: </p>

      <p>Gene V Glass of ASU Tempe Campus considers the two principal policies for expanding parental choice in Arizona : charter schools and private-school-tuition tax credits.&nbsp; He finds that data necessary to determine whether students in charter schools are performing better academically than they would have performed had they remained in traditional public schools do not exist.&nbsp; Further, he notes that data to determine whether Arizona 's private-school-tuition tax credit program has enabled public school students to attend private schools who otherwise could not have done so are not collected.&nbsp; Find the brief at: </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/educ/epsl/AEPI/EPSL-0405-113-AEPI.doc">http://www.asu.edu/educ/epsl/AEPI/EPSL-0405-113-AEPI.doc </a></p>
      <p>Finally, Richard Wiggall of NAU reviews the recent history of school-finance policy in Arizona , and finds that the state legislature's policies have led to comparatively low per-pupil expenditure.&nbsp; Although the state has developed a funding approach that largely achieves equity, Wiggall concludes that it may have done so at the expense of funding adequacy.&nbsp; Find the brief at: </p>
