            <p>A new Arizona State University journalism school research lab has been created to help newspapers and television stations keep up with the myriad ways people now can get news and entertainment. The first client of the New Media Innovation Lab is Gannett Co. Inc., which owns 90 U.S. daily newspapers, including <em>The Arizona Republic</em>, and 22 television stations. The 16 student researchers will study the multimedia behavior of 18- to 25-year-olds, an audience the news industry has struggled for years to attract. &quot;The news industry is at a crossroads,&quot; said Christopher Callahan, dean of ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. &quot;The changes in technology are coming so fast it's almost impossible for newspaper and television people to keep up. <em>The Arizona Republic</em>, Sept. 29. </p>
