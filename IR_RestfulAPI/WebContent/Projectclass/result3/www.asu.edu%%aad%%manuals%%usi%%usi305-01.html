The office follows student compensation policies for the regulation of wage increases, hiring rates, wage changes, and position classifications.<p>Individual hiring units determine pay rates for specific student employee positions within the parameters outlined below in the <a href="#Student Wage Scale">Student Wage Scale</a>.<p>Student Employment assists hiring units with pay-rate questions and job-level determinations.<p>In general, the hourly student wage for individual student employees is determined by the individual hiring unit within the level based on the following:<p><ol><li>the hourly wage paid to other student employees who perform similar tasks for the unit<p>and</li><p><li>the skills that the student employee brings to the position.</li></ol><p>Students may be hired at a rate up to the maximum of each student wage level. Initial pay rates are determined by the hiring unit&#146;s administrative official based on the student&#146;s expertise within the position and the hiring unit&#146;s ability to pay. Additional pay adjustments within each wage level may be given only according to the evaluation guidelines established by each hiring unit.<p>The current student wage  scale reflects four wage levels based on job requirements, type of supervision, and required experience.<p><hr><font size=+1><b><a name="Student Wage Scale">Student Wage Scale</a></b></font><p><b>Student Worker I </b>(&#036;5.15 to &#036;5.90)<p>Duties are of a routine and simple nature.
