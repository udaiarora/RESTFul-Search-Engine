To order goods or <a href="pur004.html#Services">services</a> from off-campus <a href="pur004.html#Vendor">vendors</a>, departments can submit an online <a href="pur004.html#RX">RX</a>. Refer to the <a href="advantageinfo.html">Advantage page</a> located on the Financial Services Web site to get information on how to fill out specific documents.  After appropriate approvals have been applied, the RX will be forwarded to Purchasing and Business Services, which will then issue a <a href="pur004.html#Purchase Order">purchase order </a>for the goods or services.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Vendors</b></font><p>Generally, Purchasing and Business Services will contact the vendor suggested by the requesting department as one source of supply, unless the goods or services are available through a university contract.<p>The requesting department must not make a commitment to procure from a suggested vendor.  Purchasing and Business Services, using approved procurement procedures, will select the vendor.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Processing Time</b></font><p>Purchasing and Business Services will make every effort to expedite orders so that the supplier meets reasonable delivery date requirements. Note that Advantage is a batch processing system. Requisitions accepted in Advantage each day are routed to buyers in an overnight batch process. The buyer will not know the requisition exists until the day after it is accepted in Advantage. Similarly, once a buyer creates a purchase order in Advantage, it is printed in an overnight batch process. The buyer normally does not have the purchase order until the day after it is generated in Advantage. In addition, orders between &#036;15,000 and &#036;35,000 require an informal <a href="pur004.html#Solicitation">solicitation</a>, and orders over &#036;35,000 require a formal solicitation.<p>For orders of &#036;5,000 or less, the fastest method of procurement is one of the small order systems. The Purchasing Card is the preferred method and the Departmental Limited Value Purchase Order may also be used. As these methods are available to all departments, entering a requisition in Advantage for orders under &#036;5,000 indicates to both Purchasing and Business Services and suppliers that the order is not time-sensitive.<p>The<a href="pur004.html#Normal Processing Time"> normal processing time</a> is two to six working days for a requisition that does not require a solicitation and 10 to 28 working days for a requisition that does require a solicitation. For <a href="pur004.html#Emergency">emergency</a> processing, please directly contact the respective buyer.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Price</b></font><p>If vendor <a href="pur004.html#Bid">bids</a> or price negotiations exceed by more than 10 percent the estimated cost or maximum dollar amount specified on the <a href="pur004.html#Purchase Request">purchase request</a>, Purchasing and Business Services will not place the order unless authorized by the requesting department.<p><img src="purhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Exceptions</b></font></center><img src="purhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>Those departments authorized to use the Purchasing Card may use these cards to make small-dollar purchases from off-campus and some on-campus suppliers (see <a href="pur304-04.html">PUR 304&#150;04</a>, &#147;The Purchasing Card&#148;).<p>University departments also may issue Departmental Limited Value Purchase Orders directly to suppliers for the procurement of certain goods and/or services up to a limit of &#036;5,000 (including tax and freight).
