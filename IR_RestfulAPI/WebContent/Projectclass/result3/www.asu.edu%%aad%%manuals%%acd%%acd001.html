The <i>Academic Affairs Policies and Procedures Manual</i>(ACD) provides information for ASU <a href="acd002.html#facultymember" target="New">faculty</a> and <a href="acd002.html#academicprofessional" target="New">academic professionals</a> and their <a href="acd002.html#administrators" target="New">administrators</a> on academic organizations, governance, personnel, and programs.  This information applies directly to faculty, faculty with administrative <a href="acd002.html#Appointment" target="New">appointments</a>, academic professionals, and academic professionals with administrative appointments.

<p>
This manual is intended to be consistent with the Board of Regents&#146; <i>Conditions of Faculty Service</i> and the <i>Conditions of Professional Service,</i> the policies under which faculty and academic professionals at ASU are employed.  

<p>
Whenever revisions in policy are made by federal or state law, the Board of Regents, or the president of ASU, revisions to this manual will be issued by the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University.

<p>
Corrections, changes, or suggestions should be communicated to the <a href="mailto:Mark.Searle@asu.edu">ACD manual coordinator</a>, 480/965&#150;7405.

<p>
In the event of an inconsistency or conflict, applicable law and Board of Regents&#146; policies supersede university policies and university policies supersede college, <a href="acd002.html#department" target="New">department</a> or lower unit bylaws, policies, or guidelines.

<p>
The university reserves the right to add, amend, or revoke any of the contained <a href="acd002.html#rule" target="New">rules</a>, policies, regulations, and instructions or incorporate additional ones, with or without notice, as circumstances or the good of the university community may require.

<p>
The online manual replaces earlier printed versions, which are no longer provided nor distributed.  A printout of this manual and each change to this manual, created from the original text source for the online version, is retained permanently as an official record at University Archives and is available for inspection.  Printouts of all revisions to online manuals will be similarly available.
