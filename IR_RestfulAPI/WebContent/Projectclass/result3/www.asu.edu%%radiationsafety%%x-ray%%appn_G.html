                <LI>The registrant shall ensure that a portable survey 
                instrument is available at all times in a particle accelerator 
                facility.

                  <LI>Perform and document a radiation protection survey when 
                  changes have been made in shielding, operation, equipment, or

                <LI>A registrant or licensee shall provide the means to ensure 
                that personnel entering any area where airborne radioactivity 
                may be produced will not be exposed to airborne radioactive 
                material in excess of those limits specified in Article 4, 
                Appendix B, Table II of this Chapter. 
                <P></P>
                <LI>A registrant or licensee shall not vent, release, or 
                otherwise discharge airborne radioactive material to an

                4, Appendix B, Table II of this Chapter, except as authorized 
                pursuant to R12-1-435. For purposes of this Section, 
                concentrations may be averaged over a period not greater than 1 
                year. Every reasonable effort should be made to maintain 
                releases of radioactive material to uncontrolled areas as far 
                below the limits in Appendix B, Table II of this Chapter, as 
                practicable.
