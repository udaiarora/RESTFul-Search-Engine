Getting Started with the Market Research Application
</H1><P>
This book describes how to get started with the Market Research            Application (MRA), a point-and-click interface to several techniques
used in the analysis of market research data, including conjoint           analysis, discrete choice models, correspondence analysis,
multidimensional scaling, and multidimensional preference analysis. The    application is included with SAS/STAT software. This book illustrates
the use of the MRA with step-by-step discussions of examples for each of   the techniques; it does not describe methodology but does provide
numerous methodological references.
