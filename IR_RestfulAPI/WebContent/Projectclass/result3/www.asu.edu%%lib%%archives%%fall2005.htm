<p>Peterson Zah, considered one of the 100 most important Native Americans of the last century, received an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters from Arizona State University President, Michael Crow, on May 12, 2005. The ceremony was part of ASU&#8217;s spring commencement held in Wells Fargo Arena on the Tempe campus. </p>

The bulk of the material dates from 1982 to 1990 and consists of papers from Zah's campaign for Chairman of the Navajo Tribal Council, and later President of the Navajo Nation. These are arranged in five series: Professional Papers; Scrapbooks and Newspaper Articles; Audio Visual; and Artifacts and Memorabilia.

<h3><a name="LABRIOLA">Labriola Center Hosts Curators&#8217; Meeting October 13, 2005</a></h3>

<br><p>Prior to the conference, on October 13, 9:00 a.m. the Center is hosting an informal get-together for curators of American Indian collections from the Bancroft, Huntington , and Beinecke libraries; Universities of New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, and Cincinnati; Prints and Photographs, Library of Congress; National Archives, Laguna Niguel; the Heard Museum; the Navajo Nation Museum and Archives; St. Louis Mercantile; and Arizona Historical Society, Tucson.</p>

One can perceive the reference to organic fences that Native people have created from adobe and ocotillo and saguaro ribs. At one end the fence features posts that are predominately clay and transitions to posts that are predominately glass. The creators note that this represents continuity of art in the lives of Native people. It is also a symbol of barriers and stereotypes that isolate and divide cultures. </p>
     <br>
 <p>&#8220;Its presence,&#8221; notes Lonewolf, will remind visitors to &#8220;leave preconceptions behind and enter a world where indigenous people blend the past with the present and firmly establish a limitless future.&#8221; </p></td>

<h3><a name="NEWSLETTER">Labriola Newsletter&#8217;s Electronic Version</a></h3><br>
  

<p>The Labriola Center has been publishing Spring, Summer, and Fall newsletters since 1993, and is mailed to some 900 individuals and organizations in both the United States and Canada. The Center also adds an illustrated version of the newsletter to its web site.</p>
<br><p>In response to a reader survey several years ago, we leaned that readers preferred to have the hard copy in hand and rarely, if ever, consulted the web version. </p>
<br><p>Now, it is easier for readers to have both if they choose, and it is easily available any time, especially if one wants to see the photographs and illustrations that Joyce Martin adds to it. Simply connect to the ASU catalog at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/">www.asu.edu/lib</a> and type in Labriola Newsletter, or the call number, E75.N48, connect to the electronic version with a single click. Our catalogers informed us that the University of California, Berkeley, was the first institution to create the online catalog record! </p>
<br><h3><a name="MISS">Miss Indian ASU Charms Miss Arizona Pageant Judges</a></h3>
<br><p>The Labriola Center hosted a &#8220;Sneaker Tour&#8221; on June 29, 2005, for the Miss Arizona Pageant Judges. These tours are a way to introduce community leaders to the university that serves them and offers unique opportunities for the guests to see ASU up close and in action.<br>
  <br>
  The Center invited Hope Seweyestewa, the current Miss Indian ASU, and a freshman in the Nursing program, to meet and talk with the judges. Hope is from Hopi and of the Bear, Badger, and Butterfly clans. The visitors bombarded her with questions about her culture and her studies at ASU, all of which she answered gracefully. The judges invited her to be their guest at the Miss Arizona Pageant that evening. Hope tells us that it was a great experience and she had a wonderful time. </p>

Miss Indian ASU Pageant is held during American Indian Culture week in April, and the winner crowned during the final Pow Wow. Any full time American Indian ASU student is eligible to enter; there is no age limit or restrictions as to marital status.</p>
      <br>
<p> This is not a beauty pageant. There is a performance component, however, which can be traditional (playing a Native instrument), or contemporary (playing a modern instrument). Individuals must have a 2.0 average or better, write an essay, be well informed on current events, and have excellent communication skills. Both Miss Indian ASU and her runner-up are expected to complete at least 20 hours of community service and be available for appearances both on and off campus.

<h3><a name="CENTER">Labriola Center Offers New Research Tools</a></h3>
<br><p> The Center continually tries to keep up with the educational mission of the University and the American Indian Studies Program by having the best and most current tools available. Every day, something new turns up. In addition to online tools, publishers continue offering an enormous number of new titles in the form of books, video recordings, CD-ROM, and <br>
  and microfilm publications. The subject matter covers every topic imaginable.</p>
<br><p> Since students are wanting the &#8220;Native Voice,&#8221; we are always on the lookout for autobiographical material. A recent purchase is the American Indian Oral History [microform] : The Duke Collection, 55 volumes, 310 microfiche, (FICHE 4x6 20490) and Duke Indian Oral History catalog cards, MICRO FILM LAB 10009, 8 reels. The program was sponsored by the American Indian Institute, University of Oklahoma with the assistance of the Western History Association. </p>
<br><p> The collection contains over 600 interviews of Native people living in Oklahoma and represent 30 tribes. Interviews were carried out between 1967 and 1972. Numerous subjects are covered such as traditional storytelling; acculturation and culture change; warfare and warpath stories; death and mourning practices; Indian-White relations; material culture, arts and crafts; foods; and kinship behavior, to name just a few.</p>

<h3> <a name="GENEROUS">Generous Donors Give Research Material</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li> Author, Carolyn Niethammer, has donated her research notes collected for her autobiography of Navajo, Annie Wauneka: I&#8217;ll Go and Do More (University of Nebraska Press, 2001).
