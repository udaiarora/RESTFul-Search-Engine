      <h2>Reports challenge value of education tax credits and wisdom of expanding
        program to include corporations</h2>
      <p>An Arizona program that gives taxpayers a dollar-for-dollar
        income tax credit for donations to finance tuition grants for private
        schools is &quot;fundamentally flawed,&quot; and seems certain to hurt
        the majority of poor children attending public schools, a new analysis
        finds. A companion report concludes that expanding the tax credits to
        corporations would compound the injustice. The reports, &quot;Education
        Tax Credits: No Net Benefit to Arizona's Impoverished Students&quot; and &quot;Peer
        Review of Education Scholarships: Expanding Opportunities for Students,
        Saving Taxpayers Money&quot; prepared for the Education Policy Studies
        Laboratory at Arizona State University were authored by Kevin Welner,
        a lawyer and professor of education policy at the University of Colorado
      - Boulder.</p>
      <p> In &quot; Education Tax Credits: No Net Benefit to Arizona's Impoverished
        Students&quot; Welner concludes, &quot;As a means of providing equity
        and improving achievement for impoverished students currently enrolled
        in the state's public education systems, Arizona's educational tax credit
        laws are fundamentally flawed.&quot;</p>
      <p> Welner examined A.R.S. &sect; 43-1089, which grants a tax credit of
        up to $625 for families who donate funds for private school grants, and
        A.R.S. &sect; 43-1089.01, which provides a similar tax credit of up to
        $250 for families who donate money to cover the costs of certain public
        school extra-curricular activities.</p>
      <p> The 1997 law was enacted with the stated goal of helping poor families
        who wished to transfer their children to private from public schools.
        Welner observes, however, that the Arizona program largely benefits well-off
        families whose children already are enrolled in private schools.</p>
      <p> A provision barring taxpayers from taking credits for donations earmarked
        for their own dependents is undermined by a loophole that allows &quot;quid
        pro quo&quot; donations in which a pair of taxpayers might make donations
        earmarked for each other's dependents, Welner notes.</p>
      <p>Welner also finds:</p>
      <p>- The tax credits, contrary to supporters' claims, provide little incentive
        for families to switch from public to private schools. As such, they
        primarily benefit wealthier rather than poorer families, they don't save
        the state much money on the cost of operating public schools, and they
        deprive the state of revenue.</p>
      <p>- If the credits do prompt construction of private schools in poor communities
        where schools are overcrowded, those schools are likely to shut out the
        poorest and most difficult students. At the same time, those schools
        will lack resources to match the quality of wealthy suburban private
        schools.</p>
      <p>- Tax credits, by promoting the departure of high-scoring students from
        public schools for private ones, will undermine public schools' attempts
        to comply with the federal No Child Left Behind act, which requires schools
        to consistently demonstrate increases in test scores.</p>
      <p>- Tax credits deepen divisions by social class, income, and ethnicity.</p>
      <p> The report offers ways in which the law might be made somewhat more
        fair. It warns, however, that any such changes cannot overcome the law's
        inherent flaws. Welner argues that, &quot;While possible changes in the
        tax credit programs may make them marginally more equitable, reforms
        cannot rescue them from their inherent inability to accomplish the stated
        goal of their architects: improving the quality of education for impoverished
        students.&quot;</p>
      <p> Expanding the program to include corporations would compound the law's
        flaws. In an analysis of the Goldwater Institute proposal to open up
        education tax credits to corporations, Welner found little empirical
        support for the proposition that this is a sensible way to channel the
        financial contributions of the corporate community. Welner concludes, &quot;While
        there is real value to policies that encourage corporate generosity,
        little is gained from a policy that merely gives corporations the power
        to redirect tax money that is otherwise targeted for public purposes.&quot;</p>
