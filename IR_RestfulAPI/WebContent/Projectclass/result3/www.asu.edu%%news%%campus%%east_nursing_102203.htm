      <h2>ASU East hosts Nursing program</h2>
      <p>        Arizona State University is expanding its nursing program to the university's
          east campus in a move that will help tackle the state's critical nursing
        shortage. </p>
      <p>An accelerated, (year-around baccalaureate program will begin
            at ASU East on Jan. 5, 2004, for 40 students. The program will run
            for 16 consecutive
          months, in contrast to the undergraduate nursing programs at ASU Main
          and ASU West, which operate on the normal semester schedule and are
        completed over 24 months. </p>
      <p>"This is an opportunity for ASU to have greater geographic
          distribution of our program and our graduates," says Mary Killeen,
        associate dean
          for undergraduate programs and extended education in the College of
        Nursing. "We expect this program to address the area's nursing shortage
        because
          students are influenced as to where they decide to work by where their
          clinical learning experiences are located.</p>
      <p>"Additionally, we are trying
          to meet student demand with this new program. Our applicant pool is
        showing more interest in ASU East than any of the
          other campuses."<br>
        ASU East Provost Charles Backus says adding nursing to the academic
          program at ASU East is a good fit based on the campus's professional
          and technical
          program focus.</p>
      <p>"Nursing is a high-demand program, and by hosting a nursing
          program, ASU East is doing its part to help address this need in the
          state of
          Arizona," says Backus.</p>
      <p>"Nursing also compliments the existing health-focused
          academic programs that we already have at ASU East. With nursing, exercise
          and wellness, nutrition and human health studies, ASU East will offer
          a spectrum of health-focused degrees aimed at preventing and caring
        for illness and injury in society."</p>
      <p>The new program is projected to grow to
          70 students within five years, and students will be admitted each January.
          By comparison, the Main campus
          program admits 60 students, twice a year, and the ASU West-hosted program
          admits 20 students, twice a year. </p>
      <p>The College of Nursing is based on
          Main campus, but with the addition of the East campus program, the
        college will soon offer nursing at ASU
          campuses across the Valley. The curriculum and courses are the same,
          regardless of where it's delivered. </p>
      <p>The accelerated pace at ASU East
          will allow students to complete program requirements sooner without
        compromising the curriculum. Graduates
            of the new nursing program location will receive a bachelor of science
            in
            nursing, completing essentially their junior and senior years at
        ASU East. </p>
      <p>The health care industry in the fast-growing East Valley will benefit
          from the program being located at ASU East, Killeen says. Particularly,
          students will receive practicum experience in East Valley hospitals
        and community agencies. Between 89 and 95 percent of ASU nursing graduates
          remain in the state to work, according to College of Nursing statistics. </p>
      <p>"This is the latest step ASU is taking to directly improve health care
          services in the state of Arizona," she says.</p>
      <p>For the program expansion
          to be successful, the College of Nursing is actively searching for
        nurses who are interested in teaching and can
          convey their enthusiasm for the profession to the next generation of
          nurses. To learn more about teaching opportunities, contact Stacey
        Buchanan at (480) 965-2668.</p>
      <p>Students for the first class have already submitted
          their applications. Applicants for the next class in January 2005 must
          apply by July 2004.
          Contact the College of Nursing Student Services Office at (480) 965-2987
          for more information.</p>
