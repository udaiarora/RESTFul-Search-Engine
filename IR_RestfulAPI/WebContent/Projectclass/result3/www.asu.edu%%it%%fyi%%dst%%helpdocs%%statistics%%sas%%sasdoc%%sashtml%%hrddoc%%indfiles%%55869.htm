Learn valuable time-saving techniques for data analysis and ensure         reliability and quality of the results!  This book introduces an
innovative and reliable approach for developing object-based               applications for statistical analysis in SAS.  Through detailed
examples, each chapter demonstrated how to develop object-based            applications using this approach. You will learn to structure data,
define statistical classes and their associated actions, define objects,   and perform the statistical analysis by calling actions for the objects.
Statistical analyses illustrated in the examples include regular time      series, calendar time series, and irregular time series. Detailed
instructions for extending this technique to other statistical analyses    are included.  Discover how this object-based approach to statistical
analysis can ensure consistent data analysis across teams comprised of     data analysts, statisticians, and computer programmers!
