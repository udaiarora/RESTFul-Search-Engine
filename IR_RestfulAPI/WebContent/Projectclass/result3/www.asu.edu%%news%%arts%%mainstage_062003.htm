      <h2>ASU Herberger College expands Mainstage Season; Names Marshall W. Mason
        artistic director for theatre</h2>
      <p>In a progressive move that presents exciting opportunities
        for Valley audiences, the Herberger College of Fine Arts at ASU has named
        renowned director Marshall W. Mason the artistic director for its upcoming
        Mainstage Theatre Season.</p>
      <p>In turn, Mason is expanding the 2003-2004 theatre offerings by presenting
        the season in rotating repertory. </p>
      <p>The juxtaposition of alternating shows allows productions to "speak"
        to each other in unexpected and provocative ways, enhancing the theatre-going
        experience.</p>
      <p>"Repertory has been the keystone of great theatre throughout the history
        of theatre," Mason explains. "This is how Shakespeare, Chekhov and Moli&egrave;re
        presented their plays. This is a unique program not only here in the
        Valley, but in universities across the nation."</p>
      <p>Featuring. </p>
      <p>&middot; The season opens with the pairing of Paul Vogel's startling
        Pulitzer Prize-winning play How I Learned to Drive with the powerful
        docudrama, The Laramie Project, by Mois&eacute;s Kaufman. Both plays
        are hard-hitting, emotional journeys through dark and narrow paths of
        dysfunction, sexuality and morality. How I Learned to Drive tells of
        the complex and troubling relationship between a girl and her Uncle Peck,
        who not only teaches her how to drive, but who seduces her. The Laramie
        Project was developed by the Tectonic Theater Company, whose members
        interviewed the community of Laramie, Wyoming, the site of the tragic
        hate crime committed against gay teenager Matthew Shepard.</p>
      <p>&middot; The second repertory set is the classic Our Town by Thornton
        Wilder and the cutting subUrbia by Eric Bogosian. Both are studies of
        what it means to be human in small-town America. Our Town is a tale of
        all ages, for all ages of the goings-on in placid Grover's Corners, New
        Hampshire, at the turn of the century, while subUrbia is a scathing study
        of rootless American youth set in the parking lot of a convenience store.</p>
      <p>&middot; The third repertory set pairs Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard
        with Fifth of July by Lanford Wilson. Both plays are portraits of a family
        and a civilization teetering on the brink of permanent change; both were
        hits in the 2003 Broadway season, as well. Mason himself directs the
        Chekhov masterpiece. The Pulitzer Prize-winning Wilson has been dubbed
        "America's Chekhov" by drama critics, and this will be the first opportunity
        ever to see these rich human comedies in proximity.</p>
      <p>&middot; Finally, the 2003-2004 theatre Mainstage Season wraps up with
        the eighth annual New Plays Festival. This exciting celebration has developed
        from a marathon of staged readings to three full productions in repertory.
        The plays are written by students in the Master of Fine Arts in playwriting
        program and developed in a collaborative process. Audiences will have
        the unique opportunity to participate in the process through post-performance
        discussions with the playwrights and the artistic teams.</p>
      <p>Subscriptions are available now. To receive a brochure or for more information,
        the public should call 480-965-6536. </p>

      <p>The Laramie Project was developed by the Tectonic Theater Company, whose
        members visited and interviewed the community of Laramie, Wyoming, site
        of the tragic hate crime against gay teenager Matthew Shepard. The result
        is a docudrama of breathtaking power. New York director and ASU alum
        Erma Duricko directs. </p>

        Pamela Sterling uses diverse casting to provide new insights into this
        profound examination of life and death in the 20th century. </p>
      <p>subUrbia is a scathing study of rootless American youth, set in the
        parking lot of a convenience store. It was described by The New York
        Times as "Chekhov high on speed and Twinkies." Lance Gharavi directs.</p>
      <p>subUrbia contains mature themes and language. </p>
