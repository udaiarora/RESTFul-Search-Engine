Here <a href="http://www.asu.edu/clas/dopa/Fac_Pages/Spence.html">John Spence</a>, Post Doc Uwe Weierstall and physics graduate student William Lo have chemically  identified silicon atoms at particular atomic sites on an extended crystal suface for the first time. They use a  new scientific instrument they call a Scanning Tunnelling Atom Probe (STAP) built recently at ASU. Figure 1 shows the silicon (111) 7X7 surface imaged using the scanning tunneling microsope portion of the STAP. Each blob is one atom on the surface of the silicon crystal. Figure 2 shows higher magnification. In the right-hand figure the dark space in the middle shows where a few atoms have been  picked up for identification by the time-of-flight spectrometer portion of the STAP. Figure 3 shows the characteristic  spectrum signature for  silicon atoms.<br><img src="images/spence1.jpg" width=400 alt="[Figure 1]"><br>Figure 1.

Identical Si 7X7 regions before (left) and after (right) applying a 10 msec positive 5 volt pulse to the tip near the center of the image, showing modification to the surface. Atoms have been transfered from the sample onto the tip from the dark space in the middle.<br><img src="images/spence3.jpg" width=250 alt="[Figure 3]"><br>Figure 3. Time-of-flight spectrum from the STM tip used in figure 2, showing the Si<sup>+</sup> peak. Large oscillations near the time origin are due to radio-frequency  pulses, which arrive before the ions. Since this spectrum was taken the RF has been reduced by about 100 times, allowing hydrogen to be seen.</body></html>
