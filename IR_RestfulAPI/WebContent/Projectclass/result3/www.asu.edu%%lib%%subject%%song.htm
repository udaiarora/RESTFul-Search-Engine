               <br>

            
               <P>The ASU Music Library has a substantial collection of both art and popular song literature. Many of the popular songs are found in the Sheet Music Collection. Each song is separately cataloged and may be found by its title, composer or lyricist in the ASU Libraries online catalog. There is also a separate database which indexes popular songs in collections. Individual art songs are seldom listed separately in the online catalog. It is therefore often necessary to find a particular song in a collection, either of a single composer's work, or a representative collection from the period or style.</P>

    SONG INDEXES (ART AND POPULAR)
  </CENTER>
</H3>
<P>To locate individual songs published in collections it is often necessary to use indexes to those collections. Listed below are the major indexes in the Music Library Reference Collection. All these indexes are used in much the same way. The individual songs are listed by composer and/or title, with a reference to the collection in which they are to be found. There is always a list of the collections indexed, with some kind of symbol (letter or number) used to identify the collection for each entry in the index. Once a song is located in a collection, it is then necessary to determine if ASU has that collection. Use the ASU online catalog to find the call number, but be aware that we do not own all the collections indexed.</P>
