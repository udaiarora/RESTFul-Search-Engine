science-based program for students in kindergarten through fourth grade that is conducted in conjunction with the STARLAB portable planetarium. The program&rsquo;s curriculum establishes connections between astronomy and a variety of subject areas including mathematics, language arts, and social studies.

                    for 7th and 8th grade students and their parents. This workshop 
                    provides participants with information regarding high school 
                    courses needed for higher education, strategies to explore

                    of Law and the Office of Youth Preparation at Arizona State 
                    University. The program is designed to introduce middle-school students to logical problem solving, the benefits 
                    of academic achievement, and the requirements for becoming 
                    an attorney. During in-class, fifty-minute presentations, 
                    students from the College of Law at Arizona State University 
                    guide middle school students through the facts, the arguments, 
                    and the decisions of cases which were brought before the United 
                    States Supreme Court.</P>

                    experience cultural events such as Broadway productions at 
                    ASU&#8217;s Gammage Auditorium. Kaleidoscope is a collaborative

                    Leaps &amp; Bounds: A Kindergarten Readiness Program </STRONG></P>
                  <P> Children who enter kindergarten without readiness skills 
                    tend to lag behind other students throughout the foundational 
                    years of school. Approximately one hundred elementary-grade 
                    teachers were asked the question, &#8220;What are the minimum 
                    skills that a child should know or be able to perform upon 
                    entering kindergarten?&#8221; This presentation provides the 
                    top ten responses to this question along with a variety of 
                    activities that parents can do at home to prepare their child 
                    for kindergarten. Parents learn ways to help the child build 
                    skills that will prepare him or her for a successful kindergarten 
                    experience.</P>

                  <P>Potentially outstanding high school students are given special classes that require them to do college level work while still in high school. Advanced placement exams are offered by the College Board at the completion of the course work. Students who demonstrate by examination that they are qualified will receive college credit for the work they are accomplishing in high school.</P>

                  <P> Programs for Talented Youth is a program at Arizona State 
                    University&#8217;s Main Campus that offers talented fourth 
                    through seventh grade students an opportunity to experience 
                    challenging courses from a variety of academic disciplines. 
                    Utilizing the University&#8217;s resources, the program is 
                    designed to provide students with courses that are interdisciplinary, 
                    enriching, and stimulating. These educational opportunities 
                    are provided on a year round basis: a three-week program in 
                    the summer, and a six-week Saturday program in the fall and 
                    spring. <BR>

                    to build student confidence through creative writing. The 
                    goals of the program are to increase the number of students 
                    who have access to a meaningful experience in creative writing, 
                    to promote creative writing as an important means of motivating 
                    student writing, and to create a system for the long-term 
                    support of creative writing in a given setting.</P>
