      <h2>Tuition increase improves access, ASU student experience</h2>
      <p>        Students are the major beneficiaries of this year's tuition increase,
          though the increased revenues will lift the entire university. The
          largest portion provides increased financial assistance for students.      </p>
      <p>Other improvements being funded with tuition revenues include expanded
          library hours, improved classroom facilities, better access to advising
          and increased availability of classes, as well as improved compensation
        for teaching assistants.</p>
      <p>A more accurate estimate of tuition revenues
          will not be available until the 21st day of the semester, when enrollment
          numbers are official. Based
          on current information, however, total revenues from the tuition increase
          are estimated to be between $34 million and $39 million for Main Campus,
        and between $44 million and $50 million for the entire university. </p>
      <p>Last
          spring ASU President Michael Crow met with students to learn what their
          academic priorities were for the use of the funds. The Associated
          Students of Arizona also surveyed students electronically, and identified
        a list of their requests.</p>
      <p>"We indeed kept the students' priorities at
          top of mind and attempted to address each of them to an appropriate
        extent within the resource
            availability," says Milton Glick, executive vice president and provost
            of the university. "I believe our budget allocation keeps full faith
          with the students."</p>
      <p>Funds already have been set aside for the highest
          priority, increasing student financial aid by about 140 percent. Main
          Campus is expected to
          receive between $11 million and $11.7 million, and the entire university
          between $13 million and $14 million. ASU has made a systematic effort
          to reach out and tell families how to apply for financial aid, communicating
        in both English and Spanish.</p>
      <p>Hours at Hayden Library have been expanded
          to 114 hours a week, another high priority expressed by students, who
          were surveyed on what hours
          they are most likely to use the library. This places ASU third among
          peer institutions for library access and fifth among the 27 largest
        academic libraries. Cost is expected to be $170,000.</p>
      <p>Students also asked for new
        desks in the Language &amp; Literature Building,
        to replace the existing small, 40-year-old desks. New seating will be
        in place throughout the building this fall - 961 new seats at a cost
      of $500,000.</p>
      <p>Students requested improved technology in classrooms and
          more computer sites and computing stations. Thirty-three new mediated
          classrooms with
          seats for 2,058 students will come on line by the end of the fall semester,
          as well as a new student computing facility with 150 stations. Tuition
          revenues of $8 million have been earmarked for their operation and
        maintenance as well as a share of debt service.</p>
      <p>Technology also will be upgraded in
          30 additional Main Campus classrooms during the academic year, at a
        cost of $350,000. ASU West will receive
          $500,000 in state-of-the-art equipment for a new classroom building,
        and ASU East will receive $173,000 to improve instructional facilities.</p>
      <p>Students
          showed great concern about the compensation for teaching assistants
        (TA), and ASU faculty and staff were not opposed to directing tuition
          dollars toward solving the problem. A partial waiver of in-state tuition
          was increased from .25 to .55 for a half-time TA and from .125 to .275
        for a quarter-time TA, at a cost of $2 million.</p>
      <p>To ensure that enough
          classes are available to serve students, dollars were distributed to
          units with the greatest enrollment growth and those
          having difficulty meeting the demand. Though it is a temporary measure
          that cannot completely address the problem, Main Campus received $2.7
        million, ASU West $320,000 and ASU East $550,000. </p>
      <p>To improve the student-faculty
          ratio, ASU West will initiate searches for 40 new faculty, at a cost
          of $680,000. ASU East will invest $325,000
          in tenured/tenure track faculty. Officials say, however, it is a temporary
        solution to a university-wide problem.</p>
      <p>Improved student services and advising
          were a high priority for students, so enhanced Web access to advising
          is now available and a task force
          is looking at other improvements. Other services will be enhanced at
          ASU West at a cost of $400,000, and at ASU East for $250,000. A feasibility
          study also is underway on moving forward with plans to create a wireless
        campus.</p>
      <p>"Our tuition, even with the increase, is still among the 10 lowest
          states in the nation," says Glick. "An ASU education is a very good
        value, indeed
        a bargain."</p>
      <p>ASU also will cover unfunded staff health insurance costs
          and increases in contributions to the State Retirement System, at a
        cost of $8 million.
          Further efforts are under way to identify funds for performance-based
        salary increases and strategic investments.</p>
