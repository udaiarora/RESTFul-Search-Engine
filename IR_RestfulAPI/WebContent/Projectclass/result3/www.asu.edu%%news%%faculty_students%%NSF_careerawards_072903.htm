      <h2>National Science Foundation recognizes six rising stars with CAREER
        Awards</h2>
      <p>        ASU researchers have once again received strong recognition from the
          National Science Foundation (NSF) in the form of six 2003 Faculty Early
      Career Development Program (CAREER) Awards.</p>
      <p>Receiving the recognition
            are assistant professors Alyssa Panitch in bioengineering, John Shumway
            in physics and astronomy, Teresa Wu in industrial
          engineering and Dong-Kyun Seo in chemistry and biochemistry. Rob Gray,
          in applied psychology at ASU East and Junshan Zhang in electrical engineering
          have also received official notice of the awards but are awaiting funding
        approval.</p>
      <p>The awards are given annually by the NSF to young faculty members,
          within the first five years of taking a tenure-track position, considered
          most
          likely to become the academic leaders of the 21st century. With this
        year's six awards, ASU researchers have received 24 since 1999.</p>
      <p>"CAREER
        Awards are extremely important to a growing institution like ASU - they
        show the recognition of the National Science Foundation that
        our young faculty members have the potential of becoming the future leaders
        of the chosen fields," says Jonathan Fink, ASU vice president for Research &amp; Economic
        Affairs. "ASU in recent years has done very well in CAREER competitions,
      a great credit to our rising faculty."</p>
      <p>From 1999 to 2002, ASU ranked 19th
          in the nation, tied with Harvard University, University of California
          - Berkeley, Ohio State University and Rensselaer
          Polytechnic Institute for the number of CAREER Awards over a four-year
        period. National statistics for the 2003 awards have not yet been released.</p>
      <p>All
          of the grants include a basic research program for four or five years
          as well as an educational component designed to apply the knowledge
        to a classroom or educational setting.</p>
      <p>Panitch, with ASU since 1999, sets
          forth a five-year plan of biomaterials research and community college
          educational outreach in her CAREER proposal,
          "Biomimetic Self-Assembling Hydrogels for Delivery of Bioactive Molecules."
          Panitch is developing soft, pliable materials, known as hydrogels,
        which can be injected as a liquid into the body, where they will solidify,
          or spread over a wound like ointment. The material shows promise as
        a
          delivery method for medication to aid in treating disease or improving
        organ transplants.</p>
      <p>Shumway, a second-year ASU assistant professor of physics,
          is applying a novel computer modeling technique to quantum dots in
        "Path Integral
          Simulations of the Electronic, Optical, and Magnetic." The simulations
          could create a better understanding on the nature of atomic-scale quantum
        dots and lead to new materials and electronic devices.</p>
      <p>Wu, who came to
          ASU in 2001, will pursue collaborative product development research
        in "Design and Implementation of a Virtual Product Development
          Environment." Wu's research will focus on creating tools to aid the
        product development process for collaborators, particularly at multiple
        companies.
          A major part of the project is to create a Web-based shared information
          space that allows all parties involved in a product's development to
          communicate with one another. <br>
        Seo, in his second year at ASU, will focus on developing new ferromagnetic
          materials using intermetallics, or metallic compounds using two or
          more types of metals, in his research "New Ferromagnetic Metals." The
          process
        has strong potential for new media storage devices.</p>
      <p>Gray, associate professor
          in applied psychology at ASU East, is focusing his research on the
        concept of collisions - both in initiating and avoiding
          them - in "An Integrated Approach to Research on Collision Control."
          Gray, with ASU since 2001, will study visual cues and try to better
        understand human adaptation to changing circumstances in relation to
        avoiding automobile
          collisions. He will also study the actions used in creating collisions
        in activities such as hitting a baseball with a bat. </p>
      <p>Zhang, in his CAREER
          proposal, "Efficient Resource Management and Multi-Access Protocols
        for Bursty Traffic Over Wireless Networks: A Cross-Layer Design
          Approach," plans to improve wireless networking, particularly for multimedia
          transmission. Zhang, who joined the ASU faculty in 2000, will create
          theory and design algorithms for cross layer design, which takes advantage
          of the interplay between protocol layers in a network. This work could
        lead to better streaming audio and video on wireless networks.</p>
