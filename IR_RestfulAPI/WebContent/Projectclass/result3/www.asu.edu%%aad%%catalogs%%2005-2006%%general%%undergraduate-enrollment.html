<p>
Arizona State University shares with other colleges and universities a tradition of service and academic excellence that is hundreds of years old. Its purpose is the exchange of knowledge and the pursuit of wisdom. ASU is committed to providing a setting where faculty and students are challenged to exchange ideas and information within an atmosphere of intellectual honesty.</p>
<p>
The university offers its students unique opportunities to enjoy both a rich cultural heritage and a diverse student population. Anyone giving evidence of suitable preparation, by way of acceptable academic credentials, is welcome to the university without regard to race, religious creed, or national origin.</p>
<p>
Under the constitution and the laws of the State of Arizona, jurisdiction over ASU has been vested in the Arizona Board of Regents. The regents, in turn, grant broad legal authority to the president, the administration, and the faculty to regulate student life within reasonable limits.</p>
<p>
By enrolling, a student voluntarily assumes certain obligations of conduct and performance. These obligations include acting with honesty, integrity, and fairness in all campus and community activities. They also include avoiding certain behaviors, such as: the irresponsible use of alcohol; the use, possession, or distribution of illegal drugs; and verbal or physical assaults. Should a student intentionally or inadvertently become involved in questionable campus-related actions or activities, the university will investigate the circumstances and will enforce its standards of conduct through prescribed procedures contained in the <i>
Student Code of Conduct.</i>
</p>
<p>
The primary purpose for the <i>
Student Code of Conduct</i>
 is to set forth the standards of conduct expected of students who choose to join the university community. Students and student organizations are expected to become familiar with and adhere to this code. Violations of the <i>
Student Code of Conduct</i>
 will result in university disciplinary action being taken and appropriate sanctions being imposed for the misconduct. Copies of the <i>
Student Code of Conduct</i>
 are available in the Office of Student Life, SSV 263, or on the Web at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/studentlife/judicial">www.asu.edu/studentlife/judicial</a>.</p>
<p>
The university further reserves the right to take necessary and appropriate action to protect the safety and welfare of the campus community and will cooperate with appropriate law enforcement agencies in their efforts to ensure a safe and secure environment.</p></div>

Enrollment Services at ASU</b>
<a id="a17014"></a></h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Arizona State University is a richly diverse academic setting with more than 55,000 students. The ASU student may be a traditional 18- to 24-year-old, a recent high school graduate, a community college transfer, someone returning to college to pursue a degree, or a professional studying for an advanced degree or career change. The ASU student may live in residence halls, in on-campus housing for sororities or fraternities, or in one of the many communities in the metropolitan Phoenix area. Each of the 50 states and more than 100 countries have students enrolled at ASU.</p>
<p>
The university is organized into several distinct administrative areas. University Undergraduate Initiatives, one of these areas, is responsible for the delivery of a variety of services in support of students&#8217; educational experiences.</p>
<p>
Special attention is given not only to the recruitment of a high-achieving, culturally diverse student body, but also to the creation of an energetic campus environment that both catalyzes the mature development and advances the academic endeavors of students.</p>
<p>
Enrollment services to students begin with recruitment, admissions, student financial assistance, on-campus housing, and registration programs. ASU encourages students to explore the facilities, services, and human resources available.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Office of Undergraduate Admissions</b>
<a id="a97787"></a></h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
A primary goal of Undergraduate Admissions is to identify, inform, recruit, admit, and enroll high quality, diverse undergraduate students through admission programs and services, including early outreach, high school and community college contacts, on- and off-campus programs, applicant services, orientation, and parent programs. Students are highly encouraged to apply online. For admission requirements and application procedures, access the Web site at 
<a href="http://www.vpsa.asu.edu/uga/requirements">www.vpsa.asu.edu/uga/requirements</a>, 
or call the East campus at
 
480/727-3278, the Tempe campus at 480/965-7788, or the West campus at 602/543-8203. </p></div>

<b>
Student Financial Assistance</b>
<a id="a21668"></a></h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Pursuing a college education is an important life decision as well as a major financial investment. The cost of a college education can be a major concern for many students and their families. The ASU Student Financial Assistance Office is committed to helping students, within the limits of available funds, meet college costs. Options range from scholarships to financial aid awards&#8212;grants, loans, and employment.</p>
<p>
Approximately two-thirds of ASU students rely on some form of financial assistance to meet their educational expenses. For more information, call 480/965-3355, or access the Web site at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/fa">www.asu.edu/fa</a>.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
University Registrar&#8217;s Office</b>
<a id="a64048"></a></h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Management of the registration system and maintenance of academic records are the primary responsibilities of the University Registrar&#8217;s Office. Registration is available through the SunDial telephone registration system at 480/350-1500; the ASU Interactive Web site at
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/interactive"> www.asu.edu/interactive</a>; or in person at the Records Information counter at the Tempe campus, Registration Services at West campus, or Registration Services at East campus. The Student Information System stores academic records and improves the quality of data used in academic advising. The University Registrar&#8217;s Office coordinates applications for graduation and undergraduate readmission, course changes and scheduling, transcript services, applications for residency, verification of enrollment, and veteran&#8217;s educational benefits. For more information, call 480/965-4747, or access the Web site at

<h3>
<b>
Veterans Services</b>
<a id="a26973"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
This office offers complete educational services for U.S. veterans and their eligible dependents. Counseling about admissions, registration, and veterans benefits is available. Veterans programs provide service by advising all interested veterans and dependents about educational benefits and their optimum use. Students must apply each semester to receive veterans benefits. The program also assists students in obtaining suitable paid tutors, when needed, using their federal benefits. Students receiving veterans&#8217; educational benefits are not eligible to receive pay for audited courses. Veterans must achieve satisfactory GPAs and semester hours progress toward their academic programs for continued educational benefits, as stated under 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a52895">Satisfactory Academic Progress</a>. The university must report this progress to the Department of Veterans Affairs each term. Failure to maintain the minimum GPA established by the university and/or the veteran&#8217;s college may result in academic probation or disqualification. Although veterans may be eligible for educational benefits while on academic probation, benefits could be affected by a continuing probation status. The Veterans Services section is located in SSV 148. For more information, call 480/965-7723.</p></div>

Undergraduate Admission</b>
<a id="a23665"></a></h1>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
ASU welcomes an application for admission from any individual seeking to benefit from the university&#8217;s broad spectrum of educational programs and services.</p>
<p>
Prospective students may access information about admission requirements and procedures via the Web at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/admissions">www.asu.edu/admissions</a>. Prospective students may call any campus about visits and tours or to request materials at the following numbers:</p>
<p>
East campus:	480/727-3278</p>
<p>
Tempe campus:	480/965-7788</p>

<h2>
<b>
Admission Procedures for Applicants</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Individuals interested in admission to an undergraduate program at ASU must submit the following materials to Undergraduate Admissions: the required application, fee, official transcripts, and test scores. Non-U.S. citizens should see 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a42008">International Student Admissions</a>, for additional requirements.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Application for Admission.</b> 
Prospective students must complete the Application for Undergraduate Admission. As with other state-supported colleges and universities, ASU distinguishes between resident and nonresident students with regard to tuition. Residents of Arizona are required to provide residency information, which is part of the admission application. Any student who does not provide residency information is classified as a nonresident for tuition purposes. For more information about residency, call Residency Classification at 480/965-7712.</p>
<p>
Students who do not enroll for the semester in which they are admitted must submit a new application and application fee if they wish to apply for a subsequent semester. All documents are destroyed one year after the semester for which the student has applied if the student is not enrolled in a degree program.</p>
<p>
Any misrepresentation or falsification on the admission application, including failure to report any college or university attendance, is cause for cancellation of admission and enrollment and/or any credits earned.</p>
<p>
Application for admission may be made via the Web at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/admissions">www.asu.edu/admissions</a>,
 or by paper.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Application Deadlines and Fees.</b> 
The nonrefundable application fee is $25 for Arizona residents and $50 for nonresidents. Applications for admission and application fees should arrive according to the appropriate priority date. Applications for admission (other than for international admission) are accepted after the date, but ASU cannot guarantee that these applications will be processed.</p>

 Before Receipt of Final Transcript. 
Admission may be granted to high school seniors who submit a six-semester or seven-semester transcript that shows academic quality or rank in class in keeping with admission standards and who complete the steps in the undergraduate admission procedures. Admission is official when verification of high school graduation showing the final GPA and the date of graduation has been received in the mail by Undergraduate Admissions directly from the high school. Final transcripts must be received a minimum of 45 days in advance of the start of the semester. An admission may be canceled if the final verification shows that the applicant has not met the university requirements for admission.</p>
<p>
Applicants enrolled in other colleges and universities may be considered for admission on the basis of meeting all admission requirements, except for a final transcript of work in progress. This final transcript must be sent to Undergraduate Admissions directly from the issuing institution immediately after the work in progress has been completed. Transcripts carried by hand are not accepted. <i>
Admission is official only after the final transcript has been received showing that the applicant has met the university admission requirements.</i>
 In the event the applicant does not qualify or has falsified application documents, admission and registration are canceled, and any registration fees paid are returned according to university refund policies.</p></div>

Competency Requirements</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Competencies may be met with high school courses <i>
or</i>
 acceptable test scores <i>
or</i>
 transferable college courses. See the 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#aCompetency Requirements">Competency Requirements</a> table. Applicants with a maximum of one deficiency in no more than two competency areas, provided the areas are not both mathematics and laboratory science, may be admitted subject to removing the deficiencies within two calendar years of university enrollment. Applicants who are 22 years of age or older or who have completed an Arizona General Education Curriculum (AGEC) or an associate&#8217;s or higher degree at the time of initial enrollment are not required to meet competency requirements.</p></div>
<h3>
Admission Appeal Procedure</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
An applicant who does not meet the specific admission requirements may file a letter of appeal and three letters of recommendation with the Undergraduate Admissions Board:</p></div>
<div class="address">

UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS BOARD</p>
<p>
ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY</p>
<p>
PO BOX 870112</p>
<p>

<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The decision of the board is final, and any conditions set by the board for future admission supersede all other admission criteria or exceptions. The applicant must be able to meet at least one of the following criteria to be considered for appeal:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
an upward grade trend during the high school career or an upward grade trend during the senior year;</li>
<li>
positive recommendations from secondary school administrators, faculty, or counselors based on considerations such as academic potential, work experience, and leadership ability;</li>
<li>
an average score of 500 (50 if taken before 2002) or greater on the General Education Development (GED) examination; or</li>
<li>
completion of at least 12 semester hours of college-level academic studies with a minimum 2.00 GPA.</li>

<h3>
<b>
Transfer Credit</b>
<a id="a11716"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Credit is awarded for traditional course work successfully completed at institutions of higher learning as indicated by ASU and the Arizona Board of Regents. <i>
Whether the specific credits can be applied toward a degree depends on the requirements of the department, division, school, or college in which the student is enrolled.</i>
 There are several qualifications:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
Transfer credit is not given for courses in which the student has earned a grade below &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00).</li>
<li>
While some courses successfully completed but evaluated on nontraditional grading systems (e.g., pass/fail) may be acceptable for transfer, colleges in the university may not accept such credits to fulfill graduation requirements.</li>
<li>
Grades and honor points earned at other colleges and universities are considered for admission but are not included in computing the student&#8217;s cumulative GPA at ASU.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The following types of credits cannot be transferred to ASU:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
credits awarded by postsecondary institutions in the United States that lack candidate status or accreditation by a regional accrediting association;</li>
<li>
credits awarded by postsecondary institutions for life experience;</li>
<li>
credits awarded by postsecondary institutions for courses taken at noncollegiate institutions (e.g., governmental agencies, corporations, industrial firms); and</li>
<li>
credits awarded by postsecondary institutions for noncredit courses, workshops, and seminars offered by other postsecondary institutions as part of continuing education programs.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Acceptable academic credits earned at other institutions that are based on a different unit of credit than the one prescribed by the Arizona Board of Regents are subject to conversion before being transferred to ASU. Once a transfer course equivalency is determined, it stands unless the student changes majors and the course is required by the new major.</p>
<p>
Students who feel they have been unjustly denied credit for transfer courses they have taken may appeal to the standards committee of the college in which they have enrolled. This procedure does not apply to community college transfer of credit greater than the 64-semester-hour maximum. The decision of the committee is final.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Veterans Exception.</b> 
By Arizona statute, no failing grades received by a veteran at an Arizona university or community college before military service may be considered when determining admissibility. This exception applies only to veterans who</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
are honorably discharged;</li>
<li>
have served in the armed forces of the United States for a minimum of two years; and</li>
<li>
have previously enrolled at a university or community college in Arizona.</li>
</ol>

<b>
Community Colleges.</b>
<a id="a22093"></a> 
A maximum of 64 semester hours are accepted as lower-division credit when transferred from community, junior, or two-year colleges.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Students Attending Arizona Community Colleges.</b> 
To determine the equivalency of courses offered by Arizona public community colleges and courses offered at ASU, a student should refer to the <i>
Course Applicability System </i>
in consultation with an academic advisor. For more information, access the Web site at 
<a href="http://az.transfer.org/cas/students">az.transfer.org/cas/students</a>.</p>
<p>
The <i>
Course Applicability System </i>
addresses the acceptability of a course, not its applicability to any specific major. 
Community college students who plan to transfer to ASU at the end of their first or second years are strongly advised to follow the ASU transfer guides when taking courses to meet the requirements of the curriculum they select. ASU transfer guides are available at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/provost/articulation">www.asu.edu/provost/articulation</a>. Provided college attendance has been continuous, students are permitted to follow the degree requirements specified in the ASU catalog in effect at the time they began Arizona community college work. See 
<a href="university-graduation-requirements.html#a42063">Guidelines for Determination of Catalog Year</a>.</p></div>
<h3>
<a id="a99428"></a><b>
Arizona General Education Curriculum (AGEC)</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The Arizona public community colleges and universities have agreed upon a common structure for a general education core. This curriculum provides students attending any Arizona public community college with the opportunity to build a general education program that is transferable to any other state institution without loss of credit. This common agreement is called the Arizona General Education Curriculum (AGEC).</p>
<p>
The AGEC is composed of 35 semester hours of lower-division general education course work in which a student may prepare for transfer.</p>
<p>
The AGEC has three forms: AGEC-A, AGEC-B, and AGEC-S. Refer to 
<a href="http://www.az.transfer.org/cas/atass/student/agec.html">www.az.transfer.org/cas/atass/student/agec.html</a>
 for a detailed description of each AGEC.</p>
<p>
Community colleges are responsible for certifying the date of completion of the AGEC on the official institutional transcripts.</p>
<p>
Completion of the appropriate AGEC will fulfill university lower-division general education requirements of the baccalaureate degree with which the AGEC articulates but may not apply to degrees articulated with the Transfer Guide Pathway TG-XR. Students completing the AGEC will still be required to fulfill lower-division program requirements and prerequisites within their college and major/minor area of study. To complete a degree program most efficiently, students should select courses that concurrently satisfy AGEC and major requirements.</p>
<p>
Completion of any AGEC guarantees admission to the university provided that a GPA of 2.00 (for Arizona residents) or 2.50 (for nonresidents) has been achieved. AGEC completion, however, does not guarantee admission to any specific university program. Many majors (e.g., architecture, engineering, business, fine/creative arts, or health professions) have significant prerequisites and/or program requirements that must be completed before a student may be admitted to upper-division course work. Community college students who are undecided about which of the universities they plan to attend or what program of study they intend to pursue are advised to explore educational options while they complete the AGEC. In all cases, students have the responsibility for selecting general education course work that is relevant to the requirements of their intended major and degree.</p>
<p>
Students who complete both the AGEC and an approved associate&#8217;s degree will be assigned junior-class standing by the state universities. Junior-class standing is based on the number of semester credits a student has earned and does not necessarily indicate the remaining number of semester credits needed to complete degree requirements. Course prerequisites, major requirements, and upper-division requirements continue to be specified by each university. Appropriate sequencing of courses and timely completion of course prerequisites are essential to ensure efficient progress toward a baccalaureate degree. Students who have identified the university they plan to attend and/or a major area of study are advised to fulfill requirements and prerequisites identified by these programs through transfer guides and/or curriculum check sheets provided by the state universities. The AGEC does not replace articulation agreements developed to enhance the transfer process between specific institutions, e.g., Associate Transfer Partnership Degrees (ATP). Nor does the AGEC eliminate the possibility that students who have identified the university they plan to attend and/or a major area of study will follow transfer guides provided by the state universities.</p></div>

<a id="a30894"></a>Admission of Undergraduate Nondegree Applicants</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Any high school graduate is invited to enroll for eight or fewer semester hours per semester of undergraduate course work as a nondegree student. Students currently enrolled in high school and persons under the age of 18 may be admitted as nondegree students by submitting official ACT or SAT scores that meet the high school aptitude requirements of the university. Persons admitted as nondegree students for a specific year and term must remain nondegree until the next semester.</p>
<p>
Nondegree applicants must complete an Undergraduate Admissions Application at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/apply">www.asu.edu/apply</a>. Arizona residents must submit a nonrefundable $25 application fee, and nonresidents must submit a nonrefundable $50 application fee. Applicants who are not high school graduates or who are younger than 18 years of age must also submit ACT or SAT scores.</p>
<p>
No more than 15 hours of completed nondegree work may be applied to a degree program. A nondegree student who decides to work toward a bachelor&#8217;s degree must <i>
apply for admission to a degree program</i>
 with Undergraduate Admissions and meet normal admission requirements.</p>
<p>
Once registered in a regular degree program, a student is not permitted to register again in a nondegree status. Nondegree students are not eligible to receive most types of financial aid, nor are they eligible to receive certain benefits, such as veteran benefits.</p></div>
<h3>
Steps from Admission to Registration</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Certificate of Admission.</b> 
After being admitted, students receive a Certificate of Admission, an Immunization Verification form, and information about orientation. International students additionally receive a Certificate of Eligibility (Form I-20 or DS-2019), which enables them to apply for the appropriate visa.</p>
<p>
Upon receipt, students should check their admission information for accuracy and report any errors or changes. For East and Tempe campuses, call 480/965-7788. For West campus, call 602/543-8203.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
<a id="a96627"></a>Freshman Orientation.</b> 
University orientation programs for new students and their parents are provided at numerous times during the year, including the beginning of each semester. Most orientation programs include academic advising, campus tours, special events, and an introduction to university resources and procedures. Some programs offer sessions for parents. Newly admitted students are sent information preceding each orientation program. Students are expected to attend orientation activities.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Transfer Orientation.</b> 
Transfer students receive information about orientation via mail.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
<a id="a22356"></a>Immunization Requirements.</b> 
Every newly admitted student born after December 31, 1956, must provide proof of measles/rubella immunity to the Student Health and Wellness Center. <i>
Students are not permitted to register until proof of immunity to measles/rubella is on file with the Student Health and Wellness Center.</i>
</p>
<p>
The following proof of measles/rubella immunity is considered adequate: (1) two vaccinations of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), at least one of which must have been given after December 31, 1979; or (2) a copy of laboratory test results that show immunity to both measles and rubella.</p>
<p>
Measles/rubella immunity proof can be faxed to the Student Health and Wellness Center at 480/965-8914. Verification that the Student Health and Wellness Center received a student&#8217;s proof of measles/rubella immunity can be confirmed by going to 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/interactive">www.asu.edu/interactive</a>
 on the Web two working days after the information has been faxed to the Student Health and Wellness Center.</p>
<p>
In addition, it is recommended that students also be immunized against mumps, tetanus, hepatitis-B, diphtheria, and meningitis. Special populations may need other vaccines. For more information on measles requirements, visit the Student Health and Wellness Center&#8217;s Web site at

<i>
Student Health Insurance..</i> 
All F-1 or J-1 visa students must have health and accident insurance through ASU. The cost for insurance is automatically added to their registration bill. <i>
No privately acquired insurance is accepted in place of the ASU insurance.</i>
 However, students who have health insurance through their government or sponsoring agency may qualify for an insurance waiver if that coverage has been preapproved by the university. No waivers may be granted after the first two weeks of classes. To find out if their sponsor is on the preapproved list, sponsored students and others who fall into this category are encouraged to contact the Student Health and Wellness Center at 480/965-2411 or visit the Student Health and Wellness Center Web site at

<b>
Credit by Examination</b>
<a id="a15422"></a></h1>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
No more than 60 hours of 
credit are awarded for any or all programs, including ASU comprehensive and proficiency examinations. Credit will not be awarded for any course in which the student has been given credit from any educational institution. Credit will not be granted for a course taken at an educational institution after credit by examination has been awarded. Credit may not be received for a lower-level or prerequisite course when credit has already been received in a higher-level course within the same field. In these categories, only credit earned by comprehensive examination counts toward the resident credit requirement for graduation.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">

<b>
Advanced Placement.</b>
<a id="a26360"></a> 
Students who have taken an advanced placement (AP) course of the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) in their secondary school <i>
and</i>
 who have taken an AP Examination of the CEEB may receive university credit. No credit is given for any examination with a score of 2 or 1. There is no limit to the number of AP credits that can be used to meet the General Studies requirement, including the requirements in natural sciences (SQ and SG), and literacy and critical inquiry (L). </p>
<p>
When the scores are received by the university directly from the CEEB, credit is awarded as shown in the

<b>
College-Level Examination Program (CLEP).</b>
<a id="a34816"></a> 
Students who have taken a College-Level Examination of the College Entrance Examination Board may receive university credit. The table of CLEP credit applies to all students enrolled in the university for the first time in August 1975 and any student enrolling thereafter; see the 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a57902">CLEP Credit</a> table. CLEP examination credit is <i>
not</i>
 given where it duplicates credit previously earned by the student at the university or accepted by the university for work done elsewhere. All examinations are given monthly by University Testing Services.</p>
<p>
The General Studies requirement in natural science (SQ and SG) and literacy and critical inquiry (L) are not satisfied by CLEP. There is no limit to the number of CLEP credits that can be used to fulfill the other parts of the General Studies requirement. (See the 
<a href="UG.18.html#a94203">General Studies</a> table.) A student who has received ASU credit for a course due to Special Programs credit may not duplicate the credit by enrolling in the same class for credit at ASU or transferring it to another institution.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<i>
Subject Examinations.</i> 
To obtain credit or placement for all subject exams except English, French, German, and Spanish, a student must receive a score of 50 (Computer Based Training [CBT] scale) or higher. To obtain credit for English Composition with Essay, a student must receive a standard score of 610 (1978 scale), 500 (1986 scale), or 50 (CBT scale). For test scores for French, German, and Spanish, see the

International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma/Certificate.</b>
<a id="a33428"></a> 
Students who present an International Baccalaureate Diploma/Certificate may qualify for university credit, depending on the level of the examination and the grade received. Arizona State University grants credit for higher-level courses only. A grade of 5 qualifies the student to receive credit for up to two introductory courses while a grade of 4 qualifies a student to receive credit for one introductory course. No credit is awarded for English as a Second Language (English B). Credit is awarded according to the 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a11732">International Baccalaureate Diploma/Certificate Credit</a> table.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Comprehensive Examinations.</b>
<a id="a19103"></a> 
A comprehensive examination is intended to permit a student to establish academic credit in a field in which the student has gained experience </p>
<p>
or competence equivalent to an established university course. Applications are given only for courses listed in the current catalog and only for courses in which a comprehensive examination can serve as a satisfactory measure of accomplishment.</p>
<p>
A number of restrictions apply. The student must be enrolled at ASU with <i>
no more than 100 semester hours of credit earned (includes credits earned at ASU, credits transferred to ASU from another institution, and all credits earned by examination).</i> The examinations must be taken during the first two semesters in residence in a degree program at the university.</p>
<p>
The decision on the suitability of course material for a comprehensive examination, the development of a comprehensive examination, and the administration of an examination are strictly departmental functions. An application is for one course only. The student should complete an application form with the number, title, and number of semester hours for the course. When completed, the application must be approved by the student&#8217;s advisor and the chair of the department responsible for offering the course.</p>
<p>
The student must then pay the stated fee for such examinations at Cashiering Services. The receipt must be taken to the departmental office.</p>
<p>
The examination is prepared by the instructor who normally conducts the course, and it is comprehensive in nature and scope. The instructor and other experts designated by the chair grade the examination, using letter grades &#8220;A+,&#8221; &#8220;A,&#8221; &#8220;A-,&#8221; &#8220;B+,&#8221; &#8220;B,&#8221; &#8220;B-,&#8221; &#8220;C+,&#8221; &#8220;C,&#8221; &#8220;D,&#8221; or &#8220;E.&#8221; If the grade is &#8220;C&#8221; or higher, a mark of &#8220;Y&#8221; is entered on the student&#8217;s permanent record; otherwise, no entry is made. Credit by examination is indicated as such on the record. The student is notified by mail of the result of the examination. In cases of failure (&#8220;D&#8221; or &#8220;E&#8221;), the student is not given an opportunity to repeat the examination.</p>
<p>
A student pursuing a second baccalaureate degree may not receive credit by comprehensive examination, but with prior approval of the college, the student may use the examination to waive a course requirement if a grade of &#8220;C&#8221; or higher is earned. </p></div>

University Testing Requirements</b>
<a id="a43151"></a></h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
All new, transfer, or readmitted undergraduate students who plan to enroll for seven or more semester hours must meet one of the following testing requirements. <i>
Students who fail to meet at least one of these requirements will not be allowed to register for any course the following semester:</i>
</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
Take the ACT English or SAT verbal examination and have scores submitted to ASU.</li>
<li>
Receive a score of 4 or 5 for the advanced placement examination in English offered by the College Entrance Examination Board and have scores submitted to ASU.</li>
<li>
Take the CLEP general examination in English Composition with Essay, earning a score that qualifies for placement in ENG 105, and have scores submitted to ASU.</li>
<li>
Have previously taken ENG 101, 102, 105, 107, or 108 at ASU; or have previously earned a grade of &#8220;Y&#8221;; or be currently enrolled in WAC 101 or 107 at ASU. If the course was taken before 1980, contact the Recording Section, in SSV 142, before registering for classes.</li>
<li>
Transfer a course equivalent to ENG 101, 102, 105, 107, or 108 with a grade of &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00) or higher. An official transcript showing the grade must be received at ASU. If a student transfers an equivalent composition course from a public community college or university in Arizona, the equivalency is automatically posted, and the student need not take further action. A student transferring a composition course from any other college or university must have the course evaluated for equivalency. The student must take a copy of both the transfer transcript and the catalog description of the course to the Writing Programs Office, in LL 314 (480/965-3853). See 
<a href="university-graduation-requirements.html#a39476">First-Year Composition Requirement</a>, for more information.</li>
<li>
International students from non-English-speaking countries must take ENG 107 (or WAC 107 followed by ENG 107 the second semester) in the first semester at ASU, unless they have taken and transferred an equivalent composition course from a college or university in the U.S. Such a course must be evaluated for equivalency by the Composition Office.</li>
</ol>
<h1>
<b>
Placement Examinations</b>
<a id="a11149"></a></h1>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
English.</b> 
Students who have not taken any composition courses are placed in First-Year Composition courses according to their scores on the ACT English or SAT verbal tests. </p>
<p>
<i>
Note: </i>The ACT and SAT scoring systems have been modified. Shown in parentheses are equivalent ACT scores for tests taken before October 1989 and equivalent SAT scores for tests taken before April 1995.</p>
<p>
Students who score 18 (16) or below on the ACT English test or 460 (380) or below on the SAT verbal test must enroll in WAC 101, a basic writing course (see&#8220;Writing Across the Curriculum,&#8221; page <a href="college-liberal-arts-sciences.html#aCourse Header">374</a>). Students who score between 19 (17) and 28 (24) on the ACT English test or between 470 (390) and 650 (580) on the SAT verbal test are eligible to enroll in ENG 101. Students who score 29 (25) or higher on the ACT English test or 660 (590) or higher on the SAT verbal test may take ENG 105 in place of ENG 101 and 102. Students may qualify for ENG 105 by achieving appropriate scores on the CLEP General Examination in English Composition with Essay.

<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Each college has advisors to assist students in developing programs of study, assessing educational goals, and understanding rules, procedures, and curriculum requirements. In some colleges, these advisors are faculty members. In others, they are full-time, professional advisors. Students often may seek academic and career advice from both faculty members and full-time advisors. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the skill and knowledge of the advising professionals available to them. Most new students and many continuing students must meet with an advisor as a condition of registration.</p>
<p>
An additional unit, University College Academic Advising Services, is a central advising, referral, and information facility whose staff is available to assist students in their academic careers at ASU. Emphasis is placed on advising services to first-time, prospective, transfer, and visiting students and students in transition, such as those changing majors and those without majors. Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies students (BIS or pre-BIS) also receive academic advising in Academic Advising Services. In addition to guidance in the exploration or selection of a major, Academic Advising Services provides general academic information and referrals to all areas of student academic support. For more information, visit Academic Advising Services in UASB 129, or call 480/965-4464.</p>
<p>
Students are strongly encouraged to seek academic advising at the earliest possible time and to do so regularly throughout their academic careers, whether or not advising is mandatory in their particular programs. Advisors may be contacted at the locations and times shown in the 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a44956">Academic Advising at Tempe Campus</a> table, on this page. For academic advising at the East campus, see the 
<a href="east-campus.html#a42225">Academic Advising at East Campus</a> table. (See 
<a href="building-abbreviations.html#a86091">Building Abbreviations</a>, for a list of building abbreviations and names.)</p></div>

<b>
Readmission to the University</b>
<a id="a19788"></a></h1>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Undergraduate students who have previously attended ASU but have not been enrolled at ASU for one semester or more are required to apply for readmission through the University Registrar&#8217;s Office for the semester in which reenrollment is intended. For information and application materials, students requesting readmission may access the Web site at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/registrar/readmissions">www.asu.edu/registrar/readmissions</a>, call 480/965-7550, or write</p></div>

<p>
PO BOX 870312</p>
<p>
TEMPE AZ 85287-0312</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Students must submit an application for readmission and appropriate fee by the priority date for the semester of application. See the 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a14525">Priority Dates for Submitting Applications and Application Fees</a> table. Applicants classified as residents must submit a $25 nonrefundable application fee, and applicants classified as nonresidents must submit a $50 nonrefundable fee. If, meanwhile, the student has attended another accredited college or university, it is necessary for the student to have on file an official transcript of all academic work taken. Failure to report such attendance is considered misrepresentation and falsification of university records. In addition, it is considered cause for Records Hold action and withholding of further registration privileges. An applicant for readmission must have an ASU GPA of 2.00 or higher, depending on the college of the major. An applicant who does not meet this GPA requirement and is below good standing may need to undergo an appeal process. In these cases, the completed application for readmission may be subject to a deadline that is earlier than the readmissions priority deadline. Students whose GPA is below a 2.00 and who are applying to a college other than the one they had previously attended and students who were disqualified must submit an application for reinstatement in addition to the application for readmission. Nondegree applicants for readmission must have a minimum GPA of 2.00. If not, the applicant may apply for readmission to summer or winter only to raise the ASU GPA, or the applicant may apply for admission to a degree program for fall or spring through Undergraduate Admissions.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Conditional Readmission.</b> 
A student completing academic work in progress at another institution may be granted conditional readmission. This conditional status remains effective until a final official transcript is received. Additional registration privileges are withheld if this condition for readmission is not cleared.</p></div>
<h1>
<b>
Academic Renewal</b>
<a id="a74404"></a></h1>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Academic renewal is a university policy administered for the purpose of recalculating the ASU cumulative GPA of undergraduate students who have been readmitted to a degree program after an absence of at least five continuous calendar years, including summer sessions, and who have completed in good standing a minimum of 12 college-approved additional hours in residence within three semesters after reentry. Students may have the former academic record before the five-year absence (including transfer credits) accepted in the same manner as if the credits were transfer credits. That is, earned hours are carried forward for up to 60 hours of credit in which a grade of &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00) or higher was earned. The cumulative GPA is based only on credits earned subsequent to the student&#8217;s reentry. All graduation residency, academic recognition residency, and GPA requirements must be fulfilled after academic renewal. A request for academic renewal follows this procedure:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
Students interested in academic renewal must request the Application for Academic Renewal from the Readmission Section of the University Registrar&#8217;s Office or the dean of the college offering the major.</li>
<li>
The Application for Academic Renewal may be submitted immediately upon readmission but not later than the start of the third semester after readmission.</li>
<li>
The Application for Academic Renewal is submitted by the student to the dean of the college offering the major.</li>
<li>
The dean specifies in advance a minimum of 12 semester hours.</li>
<li>
When the approved credits are completed with a cumulative GPA of 2.50 or higher, and no grade lower than &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00) in each course, the dean forwards the Application for Academic Renewal to the University Registrar&#8217;s Office for processing.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Only students working toward their first undergraduate degree are eligible to apply for academic renewal, which may be effected only once during a student&#8217;s academic career. Academic renewal is transferable among colleges. All students with ASU GPAs below 2.00 are eligible to petition for academic renewal. Individual colleges may elect to entertain petitions for academic renewal from students with ASU GPAs above 2.00. College standards committees have final authorization on academic renewal petitions. Eligibility for graduation is based on the ASU cumulative GPA after academic renewal. However, a student&#8217;s complete record&#8212;before and after academic renewal&#8212;remains on the transcript and may be taken into consideration when a student applies for undergraduate professional or graduate programs.</p></div>
<h1>
<b>
Registration</b>
<a id="a72876"></a></h1>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
All persons attending a class at ASU must be registered for that class. A student is considered to be registered when all registration fees have been paid in full.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Eligibility.</b> 
Only eligible students may register for courses at ASU. An eligible student is either continuing from the previous semester or has been admitted or readmitted to the university. See 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a23665">Undergraduate Admission</a>, and 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a19788">Readmission to the University</a>. </p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Proof of Identification.</b>
<a id="a17696"></a> 
To receive university services, photo identification must be presented. Each admitted or readmitted student who completes the registration process for a regular semester needs to obtain a student identification card. This photo identification card is valid for the duration of the student&#8217;s enrollment at ASU.</p>
<p>
Photo IDs are issued throughout the semester at the Sun Card office located in the Memorial Union on Tempe campus; Student Services (QUAD 2) on East campus; and through the bookstore, UCB 140, at West campus. See the <i>
Schedule of Classes</i>

Reserving of Course Credit by Undergraduates.</b>
<a id="a15999"></a> 
Seniors at ASU within 12 semester hours of graduation may enroll in a 400-level or graduate course and reserve the credit for possible use in a future graduate program. The course cannot be used to meet a baccalaureate graduation requirement. Before registration in the course, the student must submit a Division of Graduate Studies Petition form requesting credit reservation. The form must be signed by the student&#8217;s advisor, the head of the academic unit offering the class, and the dean of graduate studies.</p>
<p>
Permission to reserve a course does not guarantee admission to a graduate degree program or that the course may be used toward graduate degree requirements. A maximum of nine semester hours may be reserved, and only courses in which the student earned an &#8220;A&#8221; (4.00) or &#8220;B&#8221; (3.00)    grade are applicable. Reserved credit earned before admission to a graduate degree program is classified as nondegree credit. The maximum course load for a student enrolled in a reserved course is 15 semester hours during a regular semester and six hours during a summer session.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Summer Session Semester Hour Load.</b>
<a id="a13194"></a> 
The summer session semester hour load limit is seven semester hours for each five-week session and nine semester hours for the eight-week session. The student may not exceed a total of 14 semester hours for any combination of sessions.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Concurrent Enrollment.</b> 
Provided that the other institution&#8217;s regulations concerning enrollment, graduation requirements, and transfer of credits are not violated, a student may enroll in classes at other institutions or in independent learning courses while enrolled at ASU. However, the student is urged to seek advising before concurrent enrollment to assure orderly progress toward a degree. If total credits exceed the maximum course load, prior permission must be granted by the college standards committee. See 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a21640">Course Loads</a>, on this page.</p></div>

<h3>
<b>
Unit of Credit</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The Arizona Board of Regents has defined (May 26, 1979) a unit of credit for the institutions under its jurisdiction. A minimum of 45 hours of work by each student is required for each unit of credit. An hour of work represents a minimum of 50 minutes of class time&#8212;often called a &#8220;contact hour&#8221;&#8212;or 60 minutes of independent study work. For lecture-discussion courses, this requirement equates to at least 15 contact hours and a minimum of 30 hours of work outside the classroom for each unit of credit. Even though the values of 15 and 30 may vary for different modes of instruction, the minimum total of 45 hours of work for each unit of credit is a constant. Since the unit of credit as defined by the Arizona Board of Regents is the cornerstone of academic degree programs at ASU, degrees granted by other institutions that are recognized by ASU should be based on a similar unit of credit.</p></div>

Incomplete</b>
<a id="a30673"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
<b>
 </b>
A mark of &#8220;I&#8221; (incomplete) is given by the instructor only when a student who is otherwise doing acceptable work is unable to complete a course because of illness or other conditions beyond the student&#8217;s control. The mark of &#8220;I&#8221; should be granted only when the student can complete the unfinished work with the same instructor. However, an incomplete (&#8220;I&#8221;) may be completed with an instructor designated by the department chair if the original instructor later becomes incapacitated or is otherwise not on campus. The student is required to arrange with the instructor for the completion of the course requirements. The arrangement is recorded on the Incomplete Grade Request form. The student has one calendar year from the date the mark of &#8220;I&#8221; is recorded to complete the course. If the student completes the course within the calendar year, the instructor must submit an Authorization for Change of Grade form to the University Registrar&#8217;s Office, whether the student passed or failed the course. Marks of &#8220;I&#8221; are changed to a grade of &#8220;E&#8221; (0.00) for purposes of evaluating graduation requirements for undergraduate students. Marks of &#8220;I&#8221; received in the fall 1983 semester or thereafter for undergraduate courses that have been on a student&#8217;s record for more than one calendar year are automatically changed to a grade of &#8220;E&#8221; (0.00). An undergraduate student does not reregister or pay fees for a course for which an incomplete &#8220;I&#8221; has been received in order to complete the course.</p>
<p>
Students who receive a mark of &#8220;I&#8221; in courses at the 500 level or above have one calendar year to complete the course for a grade. After one calendar year, the mark of &#8220;I&#8221; becomes a permanent part of the transcript. To repeat the course for credit, a student must reregister and pay fees. The grade for the repeated course appears on the transcript but does not replace the permanent &#8220;I.&#8221;</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Satisfactory</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
A mark of &#8220;Y&#8221; (satisfactory) may be used at the option of individual colleges and schools within the university and is appropriate for internships, projects, readings and conferences, research, seminars, theses, and workshops. The &#8220;Y&#8221; is included in earned hours but is not computed in the GPA.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Credit Enrollment</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The semester hour is the unit on which credit is computed. It represents one 50-minute class exercise per week per semester. To obtain credit, a student must be properly registered and must pay fees for the course.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Audit Enrollment</b>
<a id="a33725"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
A student may choose to audit a course, in which case the student attends regularly scheduled class sessions, but no credit is earned. The student should obtain the instructor&#8217;s approval before registering and paying the fees for the course. Selected courses may not be audited. Veteran students using education benefits should see 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a26973">Veterans Services</a>.</p>
<p>
The mark of &#8220;X&#8221; is recorded for completion of an audited course, unless the instructor determines that the student&#8217;s participation or attendance has been inadequate, in which case the mark of &#8220;W&#8221; (withdrawal) may be recorded. This grading option may not be changed after the close of drop/add. The &#8220;X&#8221; is not included in earned hours and is not computed in the GPA.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Pass/Fail Enrollment</b>
<a id="a21946"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
A mark of &#8220;P&#8221; (pass) or &#8220;E&#8221; (0.00 [fail]) may be assigned for this grading option. This grading method may be used at the option of individual colleges and schools within the university. Consult the academic advisor for detailed information and restrictions. Approval of both the class instructor and the college of the major are required before registration. &#8220;P&#8221; is included in earned hours but is not computed in the GPA.</p></div>

Remedial Enrollment</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
A mark of &#8220;RC&#8221; (remedial credit) or &#8220;RN&#8221; (remedial no credit) may be assigned for this grading option.

Withdrawals</b>
<a id="a49444"></a></h2>
<h3>
<b>
Instructor-Initiated Drop</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
An instructor may drop a student for nonattendance during the second week of classes in fall or spring semesters or the first four days of each summer session. Instructor-initiated drops for nonattendance are signed by the dean or dean&#8217;s designee. The college notifies students by mail. The student must contact the instructor before the end of the first week of classes if absences during that period cannot be avoided.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Drop/Add</b>
<a id="a26077"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Students registering for courses for a semester or summer session may drop or add courses through the first week of classes in a semester or the first two days of a summer session. See the <i>
Schedule of Classes</i>
 or the <i>
Summer Sessions Bulletin</i>
 for dates of drop/add periods. During this period, a student may drop one or more but not all scheduled courses without penalty. Courses that are dropped do not appear on the student&#8217;s transcript and fees paid are refunded according to the refund schedule printed in the <i>
Schedule of Classes,</i> depending on the student&#8217;s remaining hours. A student who wishes to withdraw from all courses during the drop/add period must process complete withdrawal from the university.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Course Withdrawal</b>
<a id="a14845"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
During the second week through the 10th week of a semester or the third day through the third week of a summer session or at the midpoint of the term for winter and flexibly scheduled sessions, a student may withdraw from any course with a mark of &#8220;W.&#8221; See the Schedule of Classes or the Summer Sessions Bulletin for dates of the withdrawal period.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Instructor-Initiated Withdrawal</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
An instructor may withdraw a student from a course with a mark of &#8220;W&#8221; or a grade of &#8220;E&#8221; (0.00) only if the student&#8217;s continued presence in the course is disruptive to the instructor&#8217;s ability to conduct the course. A student may appeal an instructor-initiated withdrawal within 10 days of being withdrawn to the standards committee of the college in which the course is offered. The decision of the committee is final.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Withdrawal from the University</b>
<a id="a39579"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
To withdraw from <i>
all</i>
 classes after having paid registration fees, a student must submit a request to withdraw using ASU Interactive, SunDial, or submit a signed request to any registrar location. The ASU Interactive and SunDial complete withdrawal option is available through the semester transaction deadline. A student may withdraw from all courses with marks of &#8220;W&#8221; through the semester transaction deadline. See the <i>
Schedule of Classes</i>
 or the <i>
Summer Sessions Bulletin</i>
 for dates of the complete withdrawal periods. </p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Medical/Compassionate Withdrawal</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
A medical/compassionate withdrawal request may be made in extraordinary cases where serious illness or injury (medical) or another significant personal situation (compassionate) prevents a student from continuing in his or her classes, and where incompletes or other arrangements with the instructor are not possible. Usually, consideration is for complete withdrawal. All applications for withdrawal require thorough and credible documentation. Application for less than a complete withdrawal must be especially well documented to justify the selective nature of the medical/compassionate withdrawal request. </p>
<p>
A student may request and be considered for a <i>
medical</i>
 withdrawal when extraordinary circumstances, such as a serious illness or injury, prevent the student from continuing in classes. This policy covers both physical-health and mental-health difficulties.</p>
<p>
A student may request and be considered for a <i>
compassionate</i>
 withdrawal when extraordinary personal reasons, not related to the student&#8217;s physical or mental health (for example, care of a seriously ill child or spouse, or a death in the student&#8217;s immediate family), prevent the student from continuing in classes.</p>
<p>
Each college has a dean&#8217;s representative (medical/compassionate withdrawal designee) to review medical/compassionate withdrawal requests, according to that college&#8217;s procedures. A student requesting a medical/compassionate withdrawal is referred to the dean&#8217;s designee of the college of the major. A nondegree student is referred to the dean&#8217;s designee of the college with which he or she is primarily affiliated. The dean&#8217;s designee determines the appropriateness of the medical/compassionate withdrawal request and whether an administrative hold is indicated. Removal of the hold must be authorized by the designee before the student can register for a future semester or be readmitted to the university. </p>
<p>
The medical/compassionate withdrawal procedure results in a special note line on the unofficial transcript.														 Refunds are not given beyond six months past the close of the semester. Only one Request for Documented Medical/Compassionate Withdrawal form needs to be filed with the college of the major, even if classes in more than one college are involved. Medical/compassionate withdrawal applications and supporting documents are retained and filed separately from the student&#8217;s other records.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Grade Points</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
For the purpose of calculating the grade point average (GPA), grade points are assigned to each of the grades for each semester hour as follows: &#8220;A+,&#8221; 4.333 points; &#8220;A,&#8221; 4.000 points; &#8220;A-,&#8221; 3.667 points; &#8220;B+,&#8221; 3.333 points; &#8220;B,&#8221; 3.000 points; &#8220;B-,&#8221; 2.667 points; &#8220;C+,&#8221; 2.333 points; &#8220;C,&#8221; 2.000 points; &#8220;D,&#8221; 1.000 point; and &#8220;E,&#8221; 0.000 points. GPAs are rounded to the nearest 100th of a grade point.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Grade Point Average</b>
<a id="a27394"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Grade points earned for a course are multiplied by the number of semester hours to produce honor points. For example, receiving an &#8220;A,&#8221; which is assigned four grade points, in a three-semester-hour course would produce 12 honor points. The grade point average (GPA) is obtained by dividing the total number of honor points earned by the total number of semester hours graded &#8220;A+,&#8221; &#8220;A,&#8221; &#8220;A-,&#8221; &#8220;B+,&#8221; &#8220;B,&#8221; &#8220;B-,&#8221; &#8220;C+,&#8221; &#8220;C,&#8221; &#8220;D,&#8221; or &#8220;E.&#8221; Other grades do not carry grade points. </p>
<p>
<i>
Semester</i>
 GPA is based on <i>
semester</i>
 net hours. <i>
Cumulative</i>
 GPA is based on <i>

<h3>
<b>
Change of Grade</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Ordinarily the instructor of a course has the sole and final responsibility for any grade reported. Once the grade has been reported to the registrar, it may be changed upon the signed authorization of the faculty member who issued the original grade. Approval for the change is also required by the department chair and the dean of the college concerned. This policy also applies to the grade of &#8220;I&#8221; (incomplete).</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
University Policy for Student Appeal Procedures on Grades</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Informal.</b> 
The steps outlined on this page, beginning with step A, must be followed by any student seeking to appeal a grade. Student grade appeals must be processed in the regular semester immediately following the issuance of the grade in dispute (by commencement for fall or spring), regardless of whether the student is enrolled at the university. It is university policy that students filing grievances and those who are witnesses are protected from retaliation. Students who believe they are victims of retaliation should immediately contact the dean of the college in which the course is offered.</p></div>
<ol class="alpha">
<li>. 	The aggrieved student must first undergo the informal procedure of conferring with the instructor, stating the evidence, if any, and reasons for questioning that the grade received was not given in good faith. The instructor is obliged to review the matter, explain the grading procedure used, and show how the grade in question was determined. If the instructor is a graduate assistant and this interview does not resolve the difficulty, the student may then go to the faculty member in charge of the course (regular faculty member or director of the course sequence) with the problem.</li>
<li>
If the grading dispute is not resolved in step A, the student may appeal to the department chair or other appropriate chair of the area within the department (if any). The department chair may confer with the instructor to handle the problem. Step B applies only in departmentalized colleges.</li>
<li>
If these discussions are not adequate to settle the matter to the complainant&#8217;s satisfaction, the student may then confer with the dean of the college concerned (or the dean-designate), who will review the case. If unresolved, the dean or designate may refer the case to the college academic grievance hearing committee to review the case formally. In most instances, however, the grievance procedure does not go beyond this level.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Formal.</b> 
The following procedure takes place after steps A, B, and C (or A and C) have been completed.</p></div>
<ol class="alpha">
<li>
Each college has on file in the office of the dean (and in each department of the college) the procedures and composition of the undergraduate or graduate academic grievance hearing committee for student grievances. Each college committee shall operate under grievance procedures as stated which satisfy due process requirements. The committee shall always meet with the student and the instructor in an attempt to resolve the differences. At the conclusion of the hearing, the committee shall send its recommendations to the dean.</li>
<li>
Final action in each case will be taken by the dean after full consideration of the committee&#8217;s recommendation. Grade changes, if any are recommended, may be made by the dean. The dean shall inform the student, instructor, department chair (if any), the registrar, and the grievance committee of any action taken.</li>
</ol>
<h3>
<b>
Repeating Courses</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
An undergraduate course taken at ASU may be repeated for credit if the grade of &#8220;D&#8221; (1.00), &#8220;E&#8221; (0.00), or &#8220;W&#8221; or a mark of &#8220;X&#8221; is received. An undergraduate student may not repeat for credit an undergraduate course in which a grade of &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00) or higher is earned. Undergraduate courses in which grades of &#8220;D&#8221; (1.00) or &#8220;E&#8221; (0.00) are received may be repeated only once. After an undergraduate student repeats 100- and 200-level courses, the student&#8217;s transcript shows both grades, but the student&#8217;s cumulative GPA reflects only the higher grade. After an undergraduate student repeats 300- or 400-level courses, the student&#8217;s cumulative GPA and the transcript reflect both grades.</p>
<p>
To be eligible for the deletion of &#8220;D&#8221; (1.00) or &#8220;E&#8221; (0.00) grades received at ASU, the course must be repeated at ASU. Independent Learning courses may not be used to repeat &#8220;D&#8221; (1.00) or &#8220;E&#8221; (0.00) grades. Students who have graduated are not eligible to delete the grade for a course taken before the award of the ASU bachelor&#8217;s degree.</p>
<p>
Students wishing to repeat a class for the third time with grades of &#8220;D&#8221; (1.00) or &#8220;E&#8221; (0.00) must petition the standards committee of the college in which they are enrolled. This policy does not apply to seminar and independent study courses with different content each semester. This policy affects only undergraduate students and undergraduate courses.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Demonstration of Mastery</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
An undergraduate student who receives a &#8220;D&#8221; (1.00) in a course in which a &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00) or higher is required may use the grade from an equivalent course taken elsewhere to demonstrate mastery at the &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00) or higher level. However, the course may neither be transferred to ASU (since credit has already been given for the course) nor computed in the student&#8217;s GPA.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Midterm Report</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Instructors are strongly encouraged to evaluate students at midterm for academic progress. A student who has been evaluated for a &#8220;D&#8221; (1.00) or &#8220;E&#8221; (0.00) at midterm receives a midterm report. The midterm &#8220;D&#8221; (1.00) and &#8220;E&#8221; (0.00) grades are not recorded on the student&#8217;s permanent record. Midterm reports are mailed to the student&#8217;s local address of record.</p></div>

<h3>
<b>
Records Hold</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The University Registrar&#8217;s Office enforces a financial records hold or administrative hold on the records of a student when an outstanding financial obligation or disciplinary action has been reported.</p>
<p>
When a financial hold is placed on the record, the following results may occur:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
No official transcript is issued.</li>
<li>
Registration privileges are suspended.</li>
<li>
Other student services may be revoked.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The second and third results may also occur when an <i>
administrative</i>
 hold is placed on the record. The hold remains effective until removed by the initiating office. It is the student&#8217;s responsibility to clear the conditions causing the hold.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Transcripts</b>
<a id="a25444"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Students may request official transcripts via ASU Interactive, in person, or by written letter. The request must include the following information about the student:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
name; </li>
<li>
former name(s);</li>
<li>
ASU ID number (or Social Security Number [SSN]);</li>
<li>
date of birth;</li>
<li>
first and last dates of attendance;</li>
<li>
current return address;</li>
<li>
daytime phone number; and</li>
<li>
specific mailing address for each transcript ordered;</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Students (except those who attended ASU before 1980) must also select one of the following options to be displayed on the transcript:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
ASU ID only;</li>
<li>
SSN only;</li>
<li>
both ASU ID and SSN displayed; or</li>
<li>
neither ASU ID or SSN displayed.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The University Registrar&#8217;s Office does not issue a transcript if the student has a financial records hold. Official transcripts can be requested in person, by mail or via ASU Interactive. The fee for official transcripts is $10.00 per copy. &#8220;Rush&#8221; transcripts (requested to be printed and picked up the same day) cost $10.00 in addition to the total cost of the transcripts ordered. Special delivery processing, instead of regular mail, is available via FedEx or U.S. Express Mail at $19.50 per U.S. delivery address (with some exceptions). Express deliveries to addresses outside the U.S., is available via International FedEx Express or International Express Mail at $38.00. The express costs are in addition to the cost of the transcript(s). (Please note that FedEx Express will not deliver to a PO Box; an actual FedEx deliverable street address is required.) Fees are subject to change without notice. Unofficial transcripts may be requested in person at the University Registrar&#8217;s Office, or by mail or fax (480/965-2295) if a signed release is enclosed. There is no charge for an unofficial transcript. Also, students may view and print their own unofficial transcripts via the Web using ASU Interactive at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/registrar">www.asu.edu/registrar</a>.</p>
<p>
<i>
Note:</i> Pre-1980 records are not available via the Web option.</p>
<p>
All in-person transcript requests require presentation of photo identification. Requests are not accepted from third parties without a written release from the student. For information on parental access to records, see

A student who does not maintain the minimum GPA standard is placed on academic probation or is disqualified. A student on academic probation is in conditional good standing and is permitted to enroll. A student who has been disqualified is not in academic good standing and is not permitted to enroll for fall or spring semesters.</p>
<p>
To transfer from one college to another within the university or to be eligible for readmission, a student must have an ASU GPA of 2.00 or higher. The GPA determining good standing is computed on courses taken only at ASU.</p>
<p>
For purposes of retention or transfer, an individual college may set higher GPA standards; otherwise, the university standards prevail. See the college sections of this catalog or contact the college deans&#8217; offices for statements regarding college retention standards.</p></div>

<b>
Meeting Basic Competencies.</b>
<a id="a39446"></a> 
New students are required to have completed a specific number of courses in the areas of American history, English, laboratory science, mathematics, social science, fine arts and foreign language. Students who are exempt from these requirements include students who have completed an Arizona General Education Curriculum (AGEC) or an associate degree, students admitted by GED, and students who are 22 years of age or older by the first day of the semester of admission. An admitted student who needs to meet competencies in one or more of these areas must satisfy the requirement within two years of the beginning of the student&#8217;s first semester at ASU. Subject competencies in each area may be met by earning a grade of &#8220;D&#8221; (1.00) or higher at ASU in an appropriate course(s) as listed in the 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#aBasic Competencies">Basic Competencies</a> table. </p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Appealing Basic Competencies.</b>
<a id="a31179"></a> 
A student who has not met all basic competencies at the end of two calendar years after the student&#8217;s initial date of enrollment is not permitted to continue at ASU. Each student is notified that he or she may not register or, if already registered, that their registration has been canceled.</p>
<p>
A student wishing to appeal the dismissal should submit a petition through his or her college. The colleges have three options in reviewing these appeals:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
extending the student&#8217;s end semester to allow one additional semester to complete the required course work;</li>
<li>
allowing the student to substitute a course not currently approved to fulfill a competency area when an error has been made or for other just causes; or</li>
<li>
denying the petition.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">

College actions are forwarded to the University Registrar&#8217;s Office for processing.</p></div>

<b>
Satisfactory Academic Progress.</b>
<a id="a52895"></a> 
The university is required to publish and enforce standards of satisfactory academic progress for certain students (e.g., student athletes, students receiving financial aid, and students receiving veterans benefits). </p>
<p>
Certification of satisfactory progress for student athletes is verified by the academic advisor and the dean&#8217;s designee for certifying satisfactory progress. Certification of satisfactory progress for students receiving financial aid or veterans benefits is verified by Student Financial Assistance or the Veterans Services section, respectively. Students should contact their advisors or the appropriate office for additional information on satisfactory progress requirements.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Probation.</b>
<a id="a10575"></a> 
A student&#8217;s college assumes responsibility for enforcing academic standards and may place on probation any student who has failed to maintain good standing as previously defined. For purposes of probation and retention, an individual college may set higher GPA standards. A student on academic probation is required to observe any rules or limitations the college may impose as a condition for retention.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Disqualification.</b> 
A student who is placed on probation at the end of a semester is subject to disqualification by the college at the end of the following semester if the conditions imposed for retention are not met.</p>
<p>
Disqualification is exercised at the discretion of the college. <i>
A disqualified student is notified by the dean of the college and is not allowed to register in a fall or spring semester at the university. </i>
If the student has already registered for a future fall or spring semester, then the registration is cancelled. A student who has been disqualified may apply for reinstatement to the college standards committee. A student who is disqualified may not attend as a nondegree student.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Reinstatement.</b> 
A student who has been disqualified and has skipped a fall or spring semester must follow the procedures for readmission. See 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a19788">Readmission to the University</a>.
</p>
<p>
A disqualified student who has not skipped a semester may submit an Application for Reinstatement to the college of his or her major. If the student wishes to transfer to a different college and has a GPA of 2.00 or greater, he or she may submit an Application for Reinstatement to the college into which he or she wishes to transfer. If the student wishes to transfer to a different college and has a GPA below 2.00, he or she must submit the Application for Reinstatement to the Registrar&#8217;s Recording/Readmission Section (SSV 142). The University Admissions Board then reviews the application. </p></div>

Academic Integrity.</b> 
The highest standards of academic integrity are expected of all students. The failure of any student to meet these standards may result in suspension or expulsion from the university or other sanctions as specified in the University Student Academic Integrity Policy. Violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to, cheating, fabrication, tampering, plagiarism, or facilitating such activities. The University Student Academic Integrity Policy is available from the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University and from the deans of the individual colleges.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Suspension or Expulsion for Academic Dishonesty.</b> 
All decisions relating to expulsion or suspension that are concerned with academic dishonesty are the sole prerogative of the dean of the school or college in which the student has been admitted. These decisions of suspension or expulsion can be appealed in accordance with established university procedures. Application for reinstatement may be made to any of the academic units within the university after the specified period of suspension. Merely having remained in a suspended status for a period of time does not, in itself, constitute a basis for reinstatement.</p></div>

<b>
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, also known as the Buckley Amendment or FERPA, sets forth the requirements governing the protection of the privacy of education records of students who are or have been in attendance at ASU.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Definitions</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Eligible Student.</b> 
For the purpose of this act, an <i>
eligible student</i>
 is defined as any individual formally admitted to and enrolled at ASU.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Record.</b> 
The term <i>
record</i>
 includes any information or data recorded in any medium, including, but not limited to, handwriting, print, tapes, film, microfilm, microfiche, and electronic means.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Types of Information</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Education Record.</b> 
The term <i>
education record</i>
 refers to those records directly related to a student and maintained by an educational institution. Two types of education records are subject to the provisions of this act: (1) directory information and (2) personally identifiable information. The term does not include those records specifically excluded by Section 99.3 of the privacy act.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Directory Information.</b> 
The term <i>
directory information</i>
 includes the following student information: name, local, permanent and ASU e-mail addresses (including directory number), local telephone number, date of birth, academic level, major field of study, college of enrollment, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Personally Identifiable Information.</b> 
The term<i>
 personally identifiable information</i>
 includes all information not defined as directory information. This includes, but is not limited to, the name of a student&#8217;s parent or other family member(s), a personal identifier such as the student&#8217;s ASU ID number or Social Security number, a list of personal characteristics, or other information that would make the student&#8217;s identity easily traceable and any information, including directory information, that the student has indicated should not be released.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Access to Records</b>
<a id="a33262"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
An eligible student may inspect and review his or her own education records. Some form of photo identification must be displayed before access to education records is allowed.</p>
<p>
Directory information may be released to anyone without consent of the student unless the student has indicated otherwise. Students may request that this information not be released by completing a form in the University Registrar&#8217;s Office. A request to withhold this information excludes the student from being listed in the annual directory only if the request is submitted to the University Registrar&#8217;s Office before the end of the third week of the fall semester.</p>
<p>
All other education records that contain personally identifiable information may not be released without the written consent of the student. A parent of a dependent student may challenge denial of such access by producing the most current copy of Internal Revenue Form 1040. If that form lists the student in question as a dependent, the parent is required to sign an affidavit that affirms that the student is his or her dependent. The affidavit is retained by the University Registrar&#8217;s Office. Upon receipt of the affidavit, the university may make student records available to the parent for the rest of that calendar year as specified under the Buckley Amendment.</p>
<p>
Students may grant access to individuals or agencies by completing a form in the University Registrar&#8217;s Office.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Location of Policy and Records</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The custodian of education records at ASU is the University Registrar&#8217;s Office. Copies of this policy are available in the following offices: Reserve sections of Hayden Library and the Noble Science and Engineering Library, the University Registrar&#8217;s Office, Undergraduate and Graduate Admissions, and Student Life. The University Registrar&#8217;s Office also maintains a directory that lists all education records maintained on students by ASU.</p></div>
