      The following bibliography lists reference material dealing with the Native Voice. These resources include material found in the Labriola Center in the University Libraries at Arizona State University, websites, and other research facilities.

          <strong>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE NATIVE VOICE</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>Significant facets to the study of Native America are the histories, cultural research, and literature written by Native Americans. This subject guide attempts to provide an overview of research pertaining to the Native American authors, researchers, and historians who have contributed to the growing fund of modern Native American scholarship.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Native voice is derived from a variety of sources. The autobiography provides direct access to the authors&#8217; connection to their tribe, gender, and role in Native American life. Other primary source materials include photographs, manuscripts, ephemera, theses &amp; dissertations, and oral histories. Non-fiction research in the fields of history, ethnography, linguistics, anthropology, and literature comprise a large portion of the Native Voice. Native American academics and authors continually add to the overall scope of their fields of study furthering the development of Native American scholarship.</p>

    <br>
    <p> <em>Natives and Academics: Researching and Writing about Native Americans</em>, Devon A. Mihesuah, ed. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1998. The relationship between Native peoples and the academic community has become especially rocky in recent years. Both groups are grappling with troubling questions about research ethics, methodology, and theory in the field and in the classroom. In this timely and illuminating anthology, ten leading Native scholars examine the state of scholarly research and writing on Native Americans. They offer distinctive, frequently self-critical perspectives on several important issues: the representativeness of Native informants, the merits of various methods of data collection, the veracity and role of oral histories, the suitability of certain genres of scholarly writing for the study of Native Americans, the marketing of Native culture and history, and debates about cultural essentialism.</p>

Her book can be read most profitably by those thoroughly familiar with Vizenor's work and knowledgeable about literary theory and recent Native American writing.</p>
    <br>
    <p> <em>Conversations with Leslie Marmon Silko</em>, Ellen L. Arnold, ed. Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi, 2000. Compilation of interviews with Native American author Leslie Marmon Silko. Silko grants interviews rarely, but the sixteen included here are generously wide-ranging and deeply honest. They reflect her heritage of storytelling and give vivid accounts of her life experiences, her creative processes, and her forthright political views. As she speaks, she spins out descriptions of the living oral traditions, the communal relationships, and the desert landscape that are the sources of her inspiration.</p>
    <br>

    <p> <strong>&#8220; Hidden Nation: Nez Perce Identity and American Indian Sovereignty,&#8221;</strong> Janice Ann Johnson. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Tulane, 1999. American Indians express national identity and sovereignty often in a context of misrecognition and domination. The dominant culture frequently mythologizes, or depoliticizes, Native Americans to maintain its hegemony. The mythologization of the Nez Perce Indians has been overwhelmingly laudatory from Lewis and Clark onward, yet it frequently distorts Nez Perce/white history, denies the Nez Perces coevalness, and effaces dual U.S./Nez Perce identity and sovereignty. </p>

            <p> <strong>The American Indian Oral History Collection</strong> contains microfilm transcripts of some 700 interviews with members of the Navajo Nation, and from members of the Pueblo Tribes, all of which are representations of the Native Voice. Ask for the subject guide for these in the Labriola Center.</p>
            <br>
            <p> <strong>The University of South Dakota Oral History Collection</strong> contains a taped series of interviews conducted in the late 1960s and early 1970s with Plains Indians and those non-Indians working actively with them. Participants include members of religious, cultural, linguistic, and political aspects of Native tribal organizations.</p>
