The DRC will make every effort to provide reasonable accommodations for qualified students with disabilities.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>General Eligibility Requirements</b></font><p>DRC applicants must be admitted or enrolled ASU students, and they must provide the DRC with qualifying disability documentation verifying the nature and extent of the disability prior to receiving any accommodations. DRC disability access consultants and disability specialists are responsible for evaluating disability documentation and determining accommodation eligibility.<p>All documentation must be provided to the DRC on professional letterhead and contain the dates of assessment, signatures, titles, and license/certification numbers of the diagnosing professionals. Diagnoses of disabilities that do not contain the required information may not be used for determining eligibility for academic accommodations.

The assessment must be administered by a trained and qualified (i.e., certified and/or licensed) professional (e.g., psychologist, school psychologist, neuropsychologist, educational diagnostician) who has had direct experience with adolescents and adults with learning disabilities.<p>An appropriate psychoeducational evaluation must include comprehensive measures in each of the following areas:<p><ol><li>aptitude (the evaluation must contain a complete intellectual assessment, with all subtests and standard scores reported)</li><p><li>academic achievement (the evaluation must contain a comprehensive achievement battery with all subtests and standard scores reported). The test battery should include current levels of functioning in the relevant areas, such as reading (decoding and comprehension), mathematics, and oral and written expression<p>and</li><p><li>information processing (the evaluation should assess specific information processing areas such as short- and long-term memory, sequential memory, auditory and visual perception/processing, processing speed, executive function, and motor ability).</li></ol><p><dl><dd><b>Examples of Measures</b></dd><p><dd><u>Aptitude</u></dd><p><dd><ol><li>Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale&#150;III</li><p><li>Stanford-Binet, Fourth Edition</li><p><li>Woodcock-Johnson&#150;III&#151;Tests of Cognitive Abilities</li><p><li>Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test.</li></ol></dd><p><dd><u>Achievement</u></dd><p><dd><ol><li>Wechsler Individual Achievement Test&#150;II (WIAT&#150;II) </li><p><li>Woodcock-Johnson&#150;III&#151;Tests of Achievement</li><p><li>Stanford Test of Academic Skills (TASK)</li><p><li>Scholastic Abilities Test for Adults (SATA).</li></ol><p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>Screening tools such as the Wide Range Achievement Test&#150;III (WRAT&#150;III) are not considered comprehensive measures of achievement and must be accompanied by a comprehensive measure such as one of those listed above.
