      <h2>August resale market slows; year-to-date numbers remain high</h2>
      <p>The Greater Phoenix resale housing market slackened in August, affected
        by the same wartime anxieties and economic concerns that plagued the
        rest of the nation since early 2003. Recorded sales peaked at 7,890 homes
        in June, slowed in July and again in August, posting 6,055 sales for
        the month. Despite the slowdown, this activity was ahead of last August's
        4,940 recorded sales, so the year-to-date total of 47,255 homes is well
        ahead of last year's 41,130 homes</p>
      <p>Jay Q. Butler, director of the Arizona Real Estate Center, said analysts
        will be closely watching the housing market's performance through the
        end of the year. "The strength of 2002 record year was due to the last
        four months recording activity well above the typical pattern for the
        latter months of the year," Butler noted. "The question now is whether
        the current housing market will rebound from its current slowing trend." </p>
      <p>The median home price was a record $160,560, in comparison with $160,000
        for the previous month and $145,900 a year ago. The Greater Phoenix area
        is so large, the median price can range significantly from $90,000 in
        the central western areas of the city of Phoenix to $378,750 in North
        Scottsdale. In August, 50 percent of all recorded sales were for homes
        priced from $100,000 to $175,000, and 15 percent for homes priced over
        $300,000. </p>
      <p>"In addition to concerns about the continuing weak economy and events
        in the Middle East, mortgage interest rates have jumped from 5.0 percent
        in June to 6.0 percent," Butler said. "But people continue to have a
        strong confidence in their live-in investment. Now that we are seeing
        the glimmer of a recovery, high mortgage rates combined with higher home
        prices could begin to erode the affordability of peoples' housing dreams."</p>
      <p>The 1,105 resale townhouse/condominium housing transactions also represent
        a slowing of market activity, but were better than last year's 965 recorded
        transactions. The year-to-date activity stands at 9,610 units, up from
        8,850 homes for YTD 2002. The median price was down slightly from $105,000
        in July to $103,500, but was well above last year's $95,000. Since this
        sector is a good source of affordable housing, the strong increase in
        median price could adversely impact the market activity. </p>
      <p>The median square footage for a single-family home recorded sold in
        August was 1,715, which is larger than the 1,655 square feet reported
        a year ago. In the townhouse/condominium sector, the median square footage
        was 1,140, which is smaller than the 1,150 square feet reported a year
        ago. </p>
      <p>&middot; In comparison with August 2002, recorded sales in the city
        of Phoenix rose from 1,435 to 1,600 sales, while the median sales price
        increased to $132,000 from $119,900. Since Phoenix is a geographically
        large city, the median prices can range significantly ($75,000 in the
        Sky Harbor area to $195,000 in the Union Hills area). The townhouse/condominium
        sector increased slightly from 265 to 270 sales, while the median price
        rose from $85,000 to $87,000.</p>
      <p>&middot; The Scottsdale resale home market grew from 505 to 650 recorded sales.
        The median sales price rose from $290,000 to $334,000. The median resale
        home price is $378,750 in North Scottsdale and $172,000 in South Scottsdale.
        The townhouse/condominium sector in Scottsdale also improved from 210
        to 230 sales, while the median sales price increased from $140,000 to

        from 95 to 110 sales, with the median sales price jumping from $95,500
        to $117. Resale activity in Sun City West declined from 75 to 70 recorded
        sales and the median sales price decreased from $144,000 to $137,500.
        The townhouse/condominium market in Sun City stayed at 70 sales, but
        the median sales price increased from $72,900 to $77,000. In Sun City
        West, sales remained at 20 sales, but the median sales price decreased
        from $96,000 to $92,500.</p>

        the median sales price rose from $165,000 to $180,000. The townhouse/condominium
