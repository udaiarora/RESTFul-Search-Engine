      <h2>Reading, math program pairs ASU West students, Valley children</h2>
      <p>        ASU West students are teaching Valley children to read, improve their
          reading skills, and learn valuable math skills through America Reads-America
          Counts, a federally funded program coordinated through the ASU West
        College of Arts &amp; Sciences.</p>
      <p>Children ages preschool to eighth grade
            are involved in America Reads-America Counts. The program reaches
        children at an early age to help them develop
          the valuable skills of reading and arithmetic. It also targets children
          who are struggling to catch up to their current grade level. ASU West
          students work closely with children, tutoring those who need the extra
          one-on-one assistance.</p>
      <p>"America Reads-America Counts teaches children
          two of the most important skills that they will learn in their lifetime,"
          says Linda Persau, coordinator
          of internships and fieldwork in the integrative studies department
        at ASU West. "It is a rewarding experience that students enjoy. Some
        ASU
          West students have been involved with America Reads for as long as
        two years." </p>
      <p>ASU West students can be paid to participate if they qualify
          for work-study assistance. Other students volunteer and fulfill internship
          credit hours.</p>
      <p>"I
          have been a tutor for two semesters. I love volunteering, and I like
          working with the kids and seeing their progress," says Jane Bringgold
          Hassan, a graduate student at ASU West who is working on her master's
          degree in interdisciplinary studies. "The kids are happy to see me
        each week, and the volunteer program takes some of the burden off of
        the classroom
        teacher, so she is happy to see me too." </p>
      <p>Bonnie Dash, an experienced
          classroom teacher at Granada Elementary School in the Alhambra School
          District, trains ASU West students who participate
        in the program. </p>
      <p>"After the training session with Bonnie Dash, everything
          was put into a new perspective," says Sara Kirby, a freshman at ASU
        West. "I learned
          many new strategies for reading, and I learned that figuring out a
        word is more than just 'sounding out.'" </p>
      <p>Time management is a vital skill for
          all college students, but those who work and participate in internship
          programs learn quickly and usually
        acquire added skills. </p>
      <p>"I am a single mother of four, and I work and go
          to school," Hassan says. "I just manage. If I thought about it I might
          freeze in my tracks, like
          a deer in the headlights. But the kids that I help make it worthwhile,
        and I volunteer at a particularly needy school, so I find the time."</p>
      <p>ASU
          West students participate in the America Reads program at 15 elementary
          and K-8 schools around the Valley, enabling students to choose a school
        close to their home or close to the campus.</p>
      <p>"The America Reads program
          has been a valuable resource and an integral part in our effort to
        help all children achieve grade level in reading,"
          says Nancy Hamlet, reading coordinator at Carol G. Peck Elementary
        in the Alhambra School District. "One-to-one tutoring is a powerful and
        effective intervention that builds reading skills and self-esteem."</p>
