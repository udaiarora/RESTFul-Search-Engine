<DL>
<DT><TT>Project Name</TT>
<DD>
is the name of the SAS catalog entry in which forecasting models
and other results will be stored and from which
previously stored results are loaded into the forecasting system.
You can specify the project by typing a SAS catalog entry name
in this field or by selecting the Browse button to the right of this field.
If you specify the name of an existing catalog entry,
the information in the project file is loaded.  If you specify a one
level name, it is assumed to be the name of a project in the <I>fmsproj</I>
catalog in the <I>sasuser</I> library.  For example, typing <I>samproj</I>
is equivalent to typing <I>sasuser.fmsproj.samproj</I>.

controls whether intervention effects defined for the current series
are automatically added as predictors to the models considered by
the automatic selection process and
displayed by the Model Selection List window.
When the Include Interventions option is selected,
the series interventions are also automatically added to the predictors list
when you specify a model in the ARIMA and Custom Models Specification windows.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Print Audit Trail</TT>

prints to the SAS log information about the models fit by the system.
A check mark or filled check box next to this item indicates that the
audit option is turned on.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Show Source Statements</TT>
<DD>
controls whether SAS statements submitted by the forecasting system are
printed in the SAS log.
When the Show Source Statements option is selected, the system sets the
SAS system option SOURCE before submitting SAS statements; otherwise, the
system uses the NOSOURCE option.
Note that only some of the functions performed by the forecasting system
are accomplished by submitting SAS statements.  A check mark or filled check
box next to this item indicates that the option is turned on.
</DL></DL><BR><H3><I>Left Mouse Button Actions</I></H3>
If you select a series in the table by positioning the cursor over
the table row and clicking with the left mouse button once,
that row of the table is highlighted.
Menu bar actions such as Delete Series will apply to the
highlighted row of the table.
<BR><BR>If you select a series in the table by positioning the cursor over
the table row and double-clicking with the left mouse button,
the system brings up the Model List window for that series,
which displays a list of all the models that you fit for the series.
This is the same as the List Models action under
Tools in the menu bar.
<BR><BR><H3><I>Right Mouse Button Actions</I></H3>

This is the same as Delete Series in the Edit pull-down menu.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Refit All Models</TT>
<DD>

current fit range.
This is the same as the Selected Series item under Refit Models 
in the Tools pull-down menu.
<BR><BR><DT><TT>Reevaluate All Models</TT>
<DD>
reevaluates all models attached to the highlighted series using data within the
current evaluation range.
This is the same as the Selected Series item under Reevaluate Models 
in the Tools pull-down menu.
