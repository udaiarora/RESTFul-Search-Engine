      <h2>New York City real estate investment banker Willliam Polk Carey donates 
        $50 million to Arizona State University College of Business</h2>
      <p><strong>Second Largest Gift in History of U.S. Business Education Endows 
        W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University</strong></p>
      <p>TEMPE, AZ, January 24, 2003 -- Wm. Polk Carey, chairman of W. P. Carey 
        &amp; Co. LLC (NYSE: WPC), a New York City-based investment firm, and 
        grandson of John Samuel Armstrong, the legislative founder of Arizona 
        State University, today announced a $50 million gift on behalf of the 
        W. P. Carey Foundation to the Arizona State University College of Business.</p>
      <p>The gift, which will endow the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona 
        State University, is the second largest single donation to any U.S. business 
        school according to the AACSB International - the Association to Advance 
        Collegiate Schools of Business, and is the largest gift in the history 
        of Arizona State University. According to U.S. News &amp; World Report 
        the W. P. Carey School of Business begins its history ranked 12th in the 
        United States among public programs for its master of business administration 
        (M.B.A.), 31st among all M.B.A. programs, and 25th among all undergraduate 
        programs. </p>
      <p>In addition, it ranks among the top business programs in the world for 
        its research, global outreach, technology and ethics curricula. The gift 
        will enable the school to leverage its internationally recognized strengths 
        in management education and thought leadership by supporting faculty, 
        students and special initiatives. </p>
      <p>"It is with great pleasure that I present this gift of $50 million to 
        Arizona State University creating the W. P. Carey School of Business," 
        said Wm. Polk Carey, chairman of the W. P. Carey Foundation. "The key 
        to future economic growth is quality education, and this school will be 
        dedicated to producing our country's next generation of business leaders. 
      </p>
      <p>"Arizona State University, one of the leading public universities in 
        the country today, has played an important role in the history of my family 
        and I am pleased that 118 years after its founding I am able to contribute 
        to the advancement of the university my grandfather helped create in 1886, 
        " Mr. Carey concluded. </p>
      <p>"This is a gift of inestimable importance," said ASU President Michael 
        Crow. "By making possible a world-class business school in metropolitan 
        Phoenix, the W. P. Carey gift increases ASU's capacity to develop new 
        strategic partnerships with business, industry and government. In turn, 
        these partnerships will enable ASU to further develop its entrepreneurial 
        potential and take on major responsibility for the economic, social and 
        cultural health of our region."</p>
      <p>&quot;Mr. Carey has already honored the memory of his grandfather through 
        his generous support of the ASU College of Law, funding the Armstrong 
        Law Prize and the W. P. Carey Director of Career Services,&quot; Dr. Crow 
        continued. &quot;We are grateful to Mr. Carey for his commitment, and 
        inspired by the possibilities that will emerge from this friendship." 
      </p>
      <p>W. P. Carey School of Business Dean Larry E. Penley said, "This gift 
        will be used to attract the leading scholars in the business disciplines, 
        and to recruit and prepare the brightest students. With this support, 
        the W. P. Carey School of Business is poised to expand its global orientation, 
        its technology-rich learning community and its ties to business and industry. 
        "</p>
      <p>Mr. Carey's family includes visionaries who helped found two of America's 
        great universities. In 1885 his grandfather, John S. Armstrong, introduced 
        legislation which created the Arizona Territorial Normal School, which 
        later evolved into today's Arizona State University. His great-grandfather, 
        James Carey, was on the first board of trustees of Johns Hopkins Hospital 
        while other relatives served as the first chairmen of the boards for Johns 
        Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Hospital. Mr. Carey's philanthropic 
        endeavors in support of higher education span the United States from coast 
        to coast. Through the W. P. Carey Foundation he has made previous gifts 
        to: Johns Hopkins University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton 
        University, California Institute of Technology, Colorado College and Arizona 
        State University's Colleges of Law and Business. Among gifts bestowed 
        to U. S. business schools, the $62 million received by the Darden Graduate 
        School of Business Administration at the University of Virginia is the 
        only donation larger than the W. P. Carey endowment.</p>
      <p>Mr. Carey is a graduate of the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce 
        at the University of Pennsylvania (1953). His firm is one of the largest 
        holding companies of commercial and corporate real estate in the world. 
        Along with its affiliated publicly held non-traded real estate investment 
        trust (REITs), the company owns and/or manages more than 500 properties 
        throughout the United States and Europe comprised of more than 60 million 
        square feet of space valued at approximately $5 billion. </p>
      <p>The W. P. Carey School of Business provides quality undergraduate, masters 
        and doctoral programs that draw upon a dynamic learning environment. Its 
        internationally award-winning faculty enriches the curriculum with their 
        latest research reports, and delivers this knowledge in a technology-rich 
        environment. Its undergraduate program offers the Business Honors program 
        to elite students at the university, while its M.B.A. program combines 
        business fundamentals with marketplace issues and trends, giving graduates 
        the knowledge and experience to excel in a global economy. </p>
