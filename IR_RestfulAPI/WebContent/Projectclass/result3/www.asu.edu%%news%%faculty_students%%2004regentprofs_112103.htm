      <h2>Arizona Board of Regents Designates 8 New Regents Professors</h2>
      <p>The Arizona Board of Regents has approved the appointment
        of Charles Arntzen, Ronald Carlson, Philip Christensen, Gene Glass, Luis
        Gomez-Mejia, Stephen Pyne, Irwin Sandler and Mary Lee Smith as Regents
        Professors, to take effect on Aug. 15, 2004. The action took place Nov.
        21 at the board meeting at the University of Arizona.</p>
      <p>This is the highest number of Regents Professors to be approved at one
        time since the selection process was converted to a two-year cycle in
        1993 - 94, bringing to 46 the number of ASU faculty accorded the honor
        since 1988. Jeffrey Coles, chairman of the nominating committee, says
        this is one of the highest honors the university can bestow on faculty
        members.</p>
      <p>"This prestigious honor includes an increase of $5,000 to the faculty
        member's base salary as well as an annual grant of $5,000 to support
        their scholarly endeavors," says Coles, finance professor and the Francis
        J. and Mary B. Labriola Endowed Chair in Competitive Business in the
        W. P. Carey School of Business. "In addition to their regular teaching
        and research activities, Regents Professors may be called on to serve
        the state's universities by lecturing, consulting on curriculum and research,
        advising administrative officers and performing other similar activities."</p>
      <p>Nominations for Regents Professorships are made by faculty members and
        are submitted to a nominating committee by Oct. 1 of the academic year
        preceding appointment. The nominating committee consists of nine to 12
        tenured faculty members, appointed by the university president, who are
        noted for their scholarly achievements and represent a variety of academic
        disciplines. The nominating committee makes its recommendations to the
        president, who approves the final selections.</p>
      <p>"The committee was impressed with the accomplishments and qualities
        of the entire set of nominees," Coles says. "While this made the committee's
        deliberations more difficult and lengthy, it is evidence of the outstanding
        quality of faculty across the campuses of this university."</p>
      <p>This year's newly appointed Regents Professors are: </p>
