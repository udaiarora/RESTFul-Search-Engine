SAS/OR User's Guide: Mathematical Programming, Version 8
</H1><P>
Discover how you can optimize operations such as production, inventory,    distribution, sales, logistics, facility location, and many more
operations of your business using mathematical programming and SAS/OR      software. Using the techniques demonstrated by the sample applications,
learn how you can build your own models describing your operations and     then employ sophisticated but easy-to-use optimization procedures that
determine the optimal solution. This title serves as the primary           documentation for all the mathematical programming (Optimization)
procedures in SAS/OR software, such as the LP, NETFLOW, NLP, TRANS, and    ASSIGN procedures.
