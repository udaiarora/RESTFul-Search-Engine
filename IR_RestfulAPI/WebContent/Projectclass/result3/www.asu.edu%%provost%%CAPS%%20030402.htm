<h2><b>Minutes of Meeting</b></h2>

      </font></font> 
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">April 2, 2003, 10:00?11:30 a.m., Ross-Blakley Law Library Classroom</font></b> 
      </p>
<p><font face="Arial">Members Present: Carol Behl, Sue Hunter, Acting Chair; Stefan Myhajlenko, Barbara Trapido-Lurie, Victoria Trotta. Also present Dr Gail Hackett, Vice Provost for Academic Personnel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Excused Absent: Patricia Feldman</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In the absence of the Chair, Sue Hunter served as convener of this meeting and Acting Chair. The Acting Chair welcomed Dr Hackett and expressed appreciation on behalf of the Committee for her  availability and willingness to attend the CAPS
meeting.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font face="Arial"><b>NEW BUSINESS</b></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">The sole agenda item before the Committee was   a discussion about President Michael Crow?s decision to decline the  award of continuing status to all those  academic professionals who had applied this year. Those affected academic professionals did receive promotion. Dr Hackett reported that this development does not affect the status of any academic professional who currently holds continuing appointment.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">Dr Hackett provided additional information about this situation.  As a general statement, Dr. Hackett reported that Dr. Crow believes that any academic professional  who is promoted is a valuable employee who he wishes to retain in the University.  He further believes that the salary adjustments that attend promotion will be increased.  But, Dr Crow took this action because he ?had too many questions? about some of the AP files, and about the procedures for promotion and continuing appointment that are currently in place. Therefore he has exercised his prerogative to extend the probationary periods set out in University policy in order to do a thorough review of existing academic promotion and retention procedures.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">Dr. Hackett  communicated that  Dr Crow  believes that the award of  continuing status , as the award of tenure for faculty,  must be done with the utmost care, and that he is immediately assuming the responsibility for bestowing that award. [Past Presidents delegated this authority to the Provost ].   Dr. Hackett then described the process that Dr. Crow has used when reviewing faculty tenure applications.  When reviewing these applications, Dr. Crow considers the departmental criteria, the candidate?s C.V, and external letters of review as a whole.  If questions arise, sometimes he can call someone and get an answer, sometimes not.   If in reviewing the file, his conclusion is that   the   documented record does not support the recommendation, particularly as regards the outside evaluations, he will not award  tenure. Moreover, as a general standard, Dr. Crow believes that the weight of the evidence provided in the candidate?s application needs to be more persuasive than merely positive or supportive of the  recommendation . Dr. Hackett described it as the difference  between preponderance of the evidence resulting in a positive decision versus  proof  that addresses all questions about the case.  President Crow is immediately applying that same standard to the academic professional applications.  The indication was that at the very least, the documentation for making the case for continuing status must be significantly strengthened.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">Dr.Crow has delegated to Dr. Hackett the immediate responsibility to review the entire area of Academic Professional status.  This review will include exploring the possibility of adding new employment options, such as multi-year contracts, to the existing year-to-year contracts and probationary/continuing appointments.  The review will also examine salary structure, and documentation required for continuing appointment.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">The Committee then discussed with Dr. Hackett how   academic professionals will contribute to this review and how CAPS might provide leadership for this process.    The dormant Provost's Advisory Committee on Academic Professionals (PACAP) might be a good partner in this process since we believe that every College has a representative to that advisory board. CAPS  members .  Dr. Hackett asked for CAPS assistance in drafting an appropriate statement to issue to the academic professional community on the larger issue of academic professional status review.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">Carol Behl asked Dr. Hackett how this development affects academic associates. It was determined that Carol would contact the Chair of the Counsel of Academic Advisors to draw up a list of  issues and transmit those to Dr. Hackett so that a review can be undertaken.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">After Dr. Hackett left the meeting, CAPS began to develop an action plan to address this development. In general, the committee agrees that it must develop a plan to notify AP?s about the review, facilitate discussion, and develop recommendations.  CAPS recommends that:</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">1. Minutes of this meeting  be distributed to all academic professionals through the AP e-mail distribution list, instead of merely posting them on the CAPS website.  Another notice of Dr. Hackett?s appearance at the AP Spring Spotlight Series will be sent out to encourage AP attendance.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">2. An appropriate statement on the current situation come from the President and Dr. Hackett. Sue Hunter will draft a statement that   might serve as the basis of  such  a statement.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">3. PACAPS be notified of the situation and convened for purposes of partnering with CAPS in any investigation and action plan that is developed.  Stefan  Myhajlenko  will investigate whether PACAPS does indeed include an AP representative from each College, and if not, Barbara Trapido-Lurie will develop a list of  Academic Professionals  from each College if PACAPS for what ever reason can not partner with CAPS in this matter.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">4. CAPS Chair Patty Feldman  coordinate CAPS activities with Dr. Hackett.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">5. A subgroup of CAPS be immediately formed to study [and then communicate] what sort of documentation for continuing status files is necessary to be meaningful to Dr Crow.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">6. A meeting for all academic professionals planning to present their cases for continuing appointment next year be planned and held as soon as possible.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">The meeting was adjourned at 11:30 a.m.</font><font face="Arial">
