<p>
<a href="acd002.html#student" target="New">Students</a> with <a href="acd002.html#disabled" target="New">disabilities</a> must contact faculty when the semester begins regarding particular classroom and laboratory accommodations.  Examples of accommodating students with disabilities include, but are not limited to, providing readers, scribes, notetakers, interpreters, and special testing arrangements; allowing the use of tape recorders in the classroom; and providing adapted course materials and course requirements.

<p>
During the academic year, the Disability Resource Center (DRC) staff will hold workshops for faculty and staff addressing accommodation issues.  All faculty are strongly encouraged to attend.

<p>
The DRC also suggests that faculty announce, on the first day of class each semester, that they are willing to make any necessary accommodations due to a temporary or permanent disability, and that students may discuss any special needs during posted office hours.

<p>
For examinations, it is helpful if the <a href="acd002.html#facultymember" target="New">faculty member</a> or designee administers tests, quizzes, and exams for which students with disabilities need only extended time or proctoring.

<p>
If more accommodation is needed, the instructor should contact the Testing Office at the DRC a minimum of three working days in advance of the test and ask for assistance.  The DRC will administer academic examinations requiring private rooms, readers, interpreters, scribes, or adapted equipment (e.g., CCTV enlarger, Braillewriter).  However, the DRC may not be able to provide scribes or readers in some technical fields (e.g., some foreign language, math, science, and computer courses).  Consequently, faculty may need to provide personnel to administer these examinations.  If a test needs to be restructured for a student with a disability, the faculty member may consult the DRC regarding test restructuring, but any changes in content are the sole responsibility of the faculty member.
