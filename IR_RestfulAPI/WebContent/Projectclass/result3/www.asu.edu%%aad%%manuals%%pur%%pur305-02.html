Per ABOR 3-801.D.1, all procurement under $50,000 and under must be awarded to small businesses unless it is impracticable.

Informal bids need not be opened publicly.  Price information received from any quotation will not be disclosed to the public until after award of the order.<p><b>Phone/Oral Quotations</b><p>When a department needs a quick turnaround, one or two specific items with an aggregate dollar value of less than $50,000 can be quoted verbally.  The buyer must summarize each quotation on a telephone quotation sheet and attach it to the requisition.<p><b>Fax Quotations</b><p>Any order with an aggregate dollar value of less than $50,000 can be quoted informally by fax.  The buyer processes an informal fax sheet from the Purchasing LAN shared directory.  The fax sheet includes complete <a href="pur004.html#Specifications">specifications</a> of all items to be quoted.  Bids are solicited from at least three suppliers and will be from all a <a href="pur004.html#Small Business">small business</a> and includes a <a href="pur004.html#Small, Disadvantaged Business">minority</a> business.
