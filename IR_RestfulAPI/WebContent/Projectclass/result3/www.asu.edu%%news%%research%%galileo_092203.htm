      <h2>ASU space scientist recounts life with Galileo </h2>
      <p>This Sunday, planetary
          scientists the world over mourn the necessary loss of an old, dear
        friend - NASA's Galileo spacecraft. After a long
            life of planetary exploration, the spacecraft will, by the command
            of those who love it most, be plunged into the crushing atmosphere
            of Jupiter at more than 100,000 miles per hour, disintegrating it
        to the point that future visitors to the planet - be they robotic or
        human
        - will hardly know it was ever there.</p>
      <p>The highly publicized funeral begins at 12:52 a.m. PDT as Galileo's
        instruments will be reconfigured for the descent and the spacecraft begins
        its eight hour journey toward its determined spot of atmospheric entry.
        Here, the NASA press kit reads a little like techno-poetry: "By 9:42
        a.m., the intensity of radiation interference will reach a point where
        even a bright star like Vega can no longer reliably be seen by the attitude
        control star scanner. The software will now be told to expect to see
        no more stars." By approximately 12:49 p.m., all poetry aside, the spacecraft
        will be smithereens.</p>
      <p>Ronald Greeley, Arizona State University Regents' Professor of Planetary
        Geology and Director of NASA's Regional Planetary Image Facility, will
        be one of the mourners. Greeley has been working with Galileo since the
        beginning of NASA's Galileo program. According to Greeley, Galileo and
        the scientists who worked on the mission made great contributions to
        the developing field of planetary geology.</p>
      <p>"When planning for the Galileo mission started in 1977," says Greeley,
        "the discipline of planetary geology had only been around for about a
        decade. Planetary geology was still in its infancy. What we've seen since
        that time is the maturing of a scientific discipline."</p>
      <p>If anyone knows the trajectory of planetary geology, Greeley should
        know. The space science veteran began working in planetary geology in
        1967 and has been involved in a fair number of the missions that have
        flown in solar system exploration. He analyzed data from the Mariner
        missions to Mars in the 60s and early seventies, was part of the successful
        Viking orbiter and lander missions to Mars in 1976, and participated
        in the Magellan project that put an orbiter around Venus and gave us
        our first geological view of the planet. That's just the beginning. All
        told, Greeley has been chair or member of more than 30 NASA committees,
        Principal Investigator of 17 projects and a Co-investigator or Team Member
        of 9 more. </p>
      <p>According to Greeley, Galileo stands out as a significant spacecraft,
        for science and for his own life in science. Its loss will be different.
        "The loss of Galileo will be sort of like the loss of an old friend who
        has lived out their lifetime and now has moved on. In this case moving
        downward and deeper into Jupiter," said Greeley. "It's a bitter-sweet
        sort of thing; you're sorry to see the friend go, but at the same time
        it's been a great friend who has done great things for us scientifically
        and served us beyond the call of duty. We're very proud of the spacecraft."</p>
      <p>Galileo has made some incredible discoveries during its 14 year mission.
        Though its destination was Jupiter, Galileo didn't have the energy to
        go directly from the Shuttle to the giant planet. To make it, the spacecraft
        had to first wind its way a couple times through the inner solar system.
        According to Greeley, several of the highlights of the mission came from
        this delay and only served to make the mission sweeter for geologists.</p>
      <p>"We had to loop around the sun a couple times, but at the same time
        we were able to do science. When we made the passes back across Earth,
        we obtained the first modern data that had been collected of the moon
        in 20 years; we passed by the far-side of the moon and the polar regions
        and took the first multi-spectral images. None of this was anticipated."</p>
      <p>Another stop during Galileo's delay was Venus, where the spacecraft
        was able to collect data from deeper in the planet's atmosphere than
        earlier missions. The spacecraft also flew twice through the asteroid
        belt. On the first time through, Galileo took the first ever spacecraft
        images of an asteroid. The second time around, Galileo discovered an
        asteroid with a small moon of its own. "This was pretty exciting," said
        Greeley. "It had been predicted for a long time that asteroids might
        have moons. We were able to test that hypothesis and prove it." </p>
      <p>According to Greeley, this discovery illustrates the importance of simply
        being in the right place at the right time. "It was purely serendipity,"
        said Greeley, "which is often the case in science, and in planetary exploration
        in particular. We didn't go looking for an asteroid with a moon, we just
        were lucky enough to find one."</p>
      <p>Galileo reached Jupiter in 1995 and was placed in orbit. This is where,
        according to Greeley, Galileo made its key contribution to planetary
        geology. Using Galileo to study Jupiter's ice-rich moon Europa, scientists
        discovered that the moon may in fact have a liquid H2O ocean. "The model
        suggests that there is liquid water at depth. So it would be an icy surface,
        a liquid ocean and then a rocky interior." The implications are great.
        "If that is the case, then that raises the potential of favorable habitats
        for life. Europa is now a very high-priority target in the search for
        life or for habitable zones. One of three targets - Mars and Saturn's
        moon Titan are the other two."</p>
      <p>Galileo has built the foundation for future exploration, pointing the
        way toward the next step in exploring the Jupiter system in particular.
        The National Academy of Sciences, in its list of priorities for NASA
        in the coming decade, has put special emphasis on a mission to Jupiter's
        icy moons. With this success, however, Galileo also predicted its own
        demise. It is because of the importance of maintaining the integrity
        of Europa for future study that Galileo must go down in a controlled
        manner, before it ceases operation on its own.</p>
      <p>According to Greeley, the loss of Galileo is lessened because the spacecraft
        more than lived up to expectations. "I would have to say it accomplished
        more than what we had anticipated, primarily because it was such a robust
        spacecraft. The flexibility that was engineered into it allowed us to
        deal with problems that popped up."</p>
      <p>The loss of Galileo will not leave Greeley's plate empty. The planetary
        geology veteran is involved in NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers, set to
        touch down on Mars in January, 2004 and the European Space Agency's Mars
        Express Orbiter, set to reach the red planet in December of this year.
        Greeley is also co-chair of NASA's Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) science
        definition team, and is helping to establish and prioritize the scientific
        objectives for that mission. JIMO is currently slated to launch in 2013,
        reaching Jupiter 5 years later in 2018. Building on Galileo's work, JIMO
        will continue the search for life and habitability in the outer solar
        system.</p>
