<B><P>1.   &#9;Call to Order.</P>
</B><P>The meeting was called to order by Senate President William Davey at 3:07 p.m.</P>
<B>
<P>2.      Approval of Previous Minutes (November 23, 1998).</P>
</B><P>The <I>Minutes </I>of the November 23, 1998 Senate meeting were approved by voice vote as corrected by Senator Mayer (Page 4, under <U>Graduation Rates</U>: line two: 1998 should be 1988.). </P>

<B><P>3. &#9;Announcements and Communications.</P>
<P>3.A  &#9;Senate President's Report</B> (William Davey).</P>
<P>President Coor and Provost Glick are meeting with foundation executives right now, and when they arrive, I will ask them to give their announcements.  </P>
<P>As you are probably aware, the Governor's Office and the Joint Legislative Budget Committee have made their budget recommendations for the university.  We are working to put those budget summaries up on the Web so that you can access them.  The budgets are less than adequate for the support of the universities, and we are asking all senators to take leadership in trying to mobilize the members of their colleagues to exercise their right as citizens, to talk to their legislators and tell them how you feel about the budgets.  As your faculty president, I will not share my opinion with you, but I will urge you to read the budget summaries on the Web.  Statements of concern have been made in <I>Insight </I>and in the <I>State</I> <I>Press</I> because there are no decision packages in the proposals.  One of the budgets includes a 1/3 reduction in the Law School appropriation.  I will be sending an email to each of you soon that will include critical information on the budget requests.  When you receive my email, if you do not know what legislative district you live in, or who your legislators are, email me and I will get you that information.  It is critical that we act soon in expressing our viewpoints as individuals about the way we feel about the budgets being proposed.  </P>
<B><P>3.B  ASASU President's Report </B>(Paul Frost).</P>
<P>In early January, a document containing many jokes that were highly offensive to different ethnicities, genders, and national origins was found on one of the computers in the working area of ASASU.  Then that document was turned over to the Office of Student Life.  That document did not in any way reflect the opinions of the executive officers of ASASU.  We made some resolutions that will we hope will prevent this type of thing from ever happening again.  We do not know who did this. Tomorrow we celebrate Martin Luther King's dream of equality and respect for all races.  At this time, it is important for the leadership of the university, and more particularly for the student government, to speak out against bigotry and prejudice, as was expressed in this document.  </P>
<P>On Wednesday, in conjunction with the Martin Luther King Celebration, there is a student-organized rally.  Jennifer Gillom of the Phoenix Mercury will be coming to speak to the students.  All faculty are invited to attend between the hours of 11 and 1:00p.m on Hayden Lawn.</P>
<P>As an update of the Course Instructor Evaluation Program, we piloted the current evaluation form in approximately 100 more classes in the fall.  Those forms are now being scanned.  The process is widening in scope and going well.  We are not sure if there will be further changes to the project itself.  We have received feedback from students that they liked the evaluation and the things that were asked.  They felt it would be helpful to them in the future.  We plan to go forward with that.  </P>
<P>The students are also concerned about the budget proposals.  There will be a Day of Action held on campus soon.  We will have a rally and then go down to the capitol, along with students from NAU and UofA to lobby on behalf of the universities.  We encourage your support of those initiatives.  </P>
<B><P>3.C  Senate President-Elect's Report </B>(David Burstein).</P>
<P>The continuing saga--asking the simple question of when can we get plus and minus grades posted--has led us to scanning the university in terms of Student Information System usage.  That process is still going on.  Some of you may know that we are doing a set of interviews, on this campus, at East Campus and at West Campus, trying to canvas everybody in the university as to how they currently use the Student Information System, and getting an idea of what they might want a new student information system to do.  We are in the process as a university of negotiating with the software company SAP, to work with them to development of a campus student information system they call IQCAMPUS.  That negotiation process is ongoing.  I believe that if we can get that system working on the campus we will all be very pleased.</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: We should all appreciate the efforts that Dr. Burstein is putting in on this project.  I think that because of the impetus and the cooperation of Bill Lewis and IT, I think we will come to a good solution to our student information system situation on campus.</P>
<B><P>3.D  ASU West Senate President's Report</B> (In<FONT FACE="WP MultinationalA Roman">&#74;</FONT>
s Chisholm).<B> </P>
</B><P>One of the things we were able to accomplish at our previous meeting of the Senate in December was to look at the Whistleblower policy that you are examining today.  We looked at the previous third draft.  With some amendments to the wording, the Senate voted to approve the document.  It is my understanding that the wording that ASU West implemented has also been incorporated into the version you are looking at today.  </P>
<P>We are also very concerned about the budget proposals and will be working very closely with Dr. Davey and with East Campus as well as NAU and UofA, to speak with one voice on our concerns about the budget.  </P>
<P>We held our Academic Assembly meeting last Wednesday; President Coor urged the faculty to look carefully at that budget proposal and let their voices be heard.  We hope that faculty, staff and students will get the message across.</P>
<B><P>3.E  ASU East Senate President's Report</B> (Don Kelley).</P>
<P>My report will be brief.  </P>
<P>We have received planning approval for three new programs: General Business, Applied Psychology, and Human Health.  </P>
<P>In addition to that, I would like to say that the faculty are East are very concerned about the budget proposals.</P>

<B><P>4.  Open Forum</B>.   </P>
<P>Senator Moore: For many years I have wanted to say in the open forum how much sometimes our health insurance depends upon the activities of individuals, rather than the unit.  For many years, Harvey Smith was a leader in this cause.  I understand now that Jonathan Rose is pushing ahead with this issue.  I would like to thank him beforehand and after the fact for his effort.  I hope he communicates with us what we all too frequently read about in the papers, about the unraveling of our benefits from the Department of Administration.</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: The Senate has been looking at and has been very concerned about the health issues in light of what seems to be the erosion of indemnity programs, the closing of the Thomas Davis Medical Centers that affected the Intergroup HMO, and the numbers of physicians that are leaving the preferred care plans.  At the beginning of the year, the University Services and Facilities Committee began to look at this and it became clear that the committee and the Senate leadership did not have the technical expertise to treat this issue in the way it needed to be treated.  I spoke to Associate VP Mernoy Harrison and we have put together a faculty, staff and administrative committee to look into the health insurance issues in a comprehensive way.  Jon Rose has agreed to chair that committee.  Everyone on that committee is very knowledgeable about the technical things that exist in this problem.  They will do a fine job and will then advocate for us on health insurance issues.  Thank you, Senator Moore, for raising that issue.  I will ask Senator Rose to continue to update us on the committee's progress.  </P>
<P> There were no further issues to discuss.</P>

<B><P>5.  Unfinished Business (Motions from Committees).</P>
<P>5.A  Personnel Committee </B>(Ron Hoffmeister).</P>
<B><P>5.A.1  </B>Senate Resolution #13: The Personnel Committee recommends Academic Senate approval for the ASU Whistleblower Policy.</P>
<P>Dr. Davey: We experienced a change in committee chairs during the approval process for this document.  Since I was continually involved these discussions, I will speak to the resolution today.  Each Senate member was given a draft copy of the whistleblower policy at the November 23 meeting of the Senate.  It was titled version number 3.  This has literally been a work in progress between the three institutions, between three sets of university counsels, and a variety of other people who have given input on a continuing basis.  We need to get a policy in place as soon as possible, because if you recall initially the three university presidents sought to avert legislative action which would put any of our personnel whistleblower decisions into the State Department of Administration to adjudicate.  The presidents wrote a joint statement and the legislature accepted that, suggesting that each of the university campuses put together a specific whistleblower policy, therefore keeping whistleblower issues in terms of personnel policies, within the university, but would indeed send it out for binding arbitration, or arbitration service if the person did not like the decision of the university governance structure.  What we have distributed to you for the agenda today is called version 5, which is actually version 3, plus the amendments that came from ASU's University General Counsel in terms of improving the wording concerning the role of the arbitration service.  In the version 5, there are a series of amendments, which I have highlighted for you.  The Senate can handle this in one of two ways: we can go through and as a whole make a decision to accept the amendments all together, and accept the amendments as coming from the Executive Committee.  Then we will go back and look at the document as a whole.  The other choice is to go ad seriatim, handling each amendment separately.  If there are concerns about the amendments that we have outlined, I suggest that the Senate handle them item by item.  Is there a sense of the house on how you would like to proceed?  What is your pleasure?  The response of the house indicates that we will take the amendments separately.  </P>
<P>I have transparencies to share with you that have highlighted all the changes in red, to help you signpost on your documents where all the changes are located.  </P>
<P>The first change recommended is <B>in the item entitled "Purpose</B>."  <B>The first paragraph would be deleted, substituting the second paragraph, so that the new reading would be "This policy is intended to protect any employee who engages in good faith disclosure of alleged wrongful conduct to a public body, or to a designated university official.  The employee who discloses and subsequently suffers an adverse action because of that disclosure is then a whistleblower. "  </B>It is basically the definition of a whistleblower.  It deletes the first three lines and replaces them with lines 4,5,6, &amp; 7.  The chair will entertain a motion to accept amendment #1.  So moved and seconded.  We are ready for discussion.</P>
<P>Senator Jacob: The original version of the language is better because the amended language is too narrow of a definition for "adverse action."  [The remainder of his comments were inaudible.]  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: I have invited Associate General Counsel Mary Stevens to attend today.   Mary, can you address this question?</P>
<P>Mary Stevens: My impression in talking with all the parties is that they want to have this document revised so that the universities would have similar policies.  UofA and NAU have already adopted the revision that we are talking about today.   In consultation, we felt they were very similar.  The second amendment does talk about the protection from "adverse action."  There is a definition of adverse action later in the policy.  From our perspective, we do not feel there is a lot of distinction between these two wordings, and the amendment addresses the thing we spoke about having similar policy.</P>
<P>Senator Jacob: What does this protect you from?  What specific types of "adverse action?"</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: It is in the next sentence.</P>
<P>Mary Stevens: I think the purpose defines this later in Section A of the policy.</P>
<P>Senator Jacob: Is it then considered O.K. to have a general introductory statement, which is later delineated in the policy statement?</P>
<P>Senator Bernstein: I would like to <B>propose the insertion of the word "personnel" on page 1, line 6, between the words adverse and action (adverse PERSONNEL action).</B> </P>
<P>[Discussion inaudible.]</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Would you then please make that amendment?  Yes.  Is there a second to the amendment?  Yes.  This amendment will clarify the wording, and make it in line with the issues on the next pages.  </P>
<P>[Much back and forth here, again, inaudible.]</P>
<P>Senator Jacob: I still believe there should be more definition.</P>
<P>Mary Stevens: The difficulty here is that our policy is based upon statute, the whistleblower law passed in 1989.  The statute implies personnel actions are handled by the State Personnel Board.  We have an exemption for this as university employees, providing that the Regents, not the Personnel Board, will protect whistleblowers from such actions.  The statute implies, again, personnel actions.  Most of those actions are the same in both systems.  We have a few personnel actions that the state does not have, but what we have tried to do is model our document after the law, and the law is geared to defined personnel actions.  It would be quite difficult to extend this beyond the law. </P>
<P>Senator Grossman: In the policy, there is the term "good faith."  I was interested in why that was, given the way the policy unfolds.  There seems to be a disposition that the whistleblower is assumed to be acting in good faith, yet there is no language that threatens that notion.  Why is that paragraph included?</P>
<P>Mary Stevens: There is a section in that policy that also comes from the law.  It is called false allegations of misconduct.  It does provide for action against an employee who falsely alleges whistleblower violations.  The good news is that did not come from General Counsel, it came from revisions from the campuses.  Revisions have been coming in continually since October.  I do not recall which individual or campus proposed this.  </P>
<P>Senator Grossman: I was more interested in the rationale that they give, in the fact that if a whistleblower alleges an offense, if that was not in good faith, it would certainly fall into section D.  However, it would be hard to prove, because the assumption seems to be that if they bring a complaint, then that it done by definition in good faith.  </P>
<P>Mary Stevens: I cannot provide the rationale here, because I do not recall who made that suggestion.  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Specifically, I need to take comments from Dean Bernstein's amendment, adding "personnel" to "adverse actions" right now.  Is there any further discussion?</P>
<P>Senator Mignolet: Is the original text that we are working with right now in the <I>ACD Manual?</P>
</I><P>Senate President Davey: It does not appear in the <I>ACD Manual</I> currently.  When President Coor accepts this document with its changes, it will then go into the <I>ACD Manual</I>.  </P>
<P>Senator Mignolet: The Personnel Committee made amendments too and we voted.</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: That is what we are doing today, voting on this document and the proposed changes to it.  Right now, there is no university whistleblower policy, although since January 1, we have been operating under this draft policy on a case-by-case basis.  Fortunately at ASU, we have had no cases that required the use of  this policy.   </P>
<P>Hearing no further discussion, all those in favor of the amendment, which inserts the word "personnel" between "adverse" and "action," please say aye.  Following a voice vote, the Chair rules that the amendment passed.  We are considering the amendment as a whole at this point.</P>
<P>Senator Rose: I would point out two things, 1) the purpose does not protect for disclosures in newspapers, or similar things 2) the purpose is not consistent with the policy in that the purpose protects against disclosures to a public body or the designated university official, the policy only protects disclosure to a public body.  It includes only very high-ranking titles: the president, the provost, the vice-provost, etc.  I do not know if you (Mary Stevens) would want to comment on the exclusion of newspapers, and the inconsistency between the policy purpose statement and the policy section A.</P>
<P>Mary Stevens: First, the statute itself is a part of the personnel policy for the State.  It addresses disclosure to public bodies, not directly to the media.  The law itself defines this in its definition of a public body.  What we have done at ASU--the administration is hoping that if an employee here believed that violations of the whistleblowing law were occurring that this would put the university on notice and a high level administrator could take action and look into it.  Obviously an employee can go to a public body outside the university as defined by the law, or they can go within, or both.  We want to have a policy in place and then notify employees that there is an avenue to have their complaints of whistleblowing dealt with.  In the first sentence of the policy, we talked about a public body, as defined in this policy.  Then, if you go to public body, on page 13, it defines public body.  </P>
<P>Senator Rose: If someone discloses something to a newspaper, may I assume they will have no protection under this policy?</P>
<P>Mary Stevens: This policy does not go into that.  Of course, they have protection under the first amendment.</P>
<P>Senator Rose: They have no protection under this policy.  The second point is a bigger problem.  I think it is not realistic to expect certain types of university employees, i.e. the electrical shop, or a library staff member, or a certain faculty member, to take their complaint to the provost or president.  This requires them to do that.  It is quite odd to define individuals as a public body.  It would be better if we have a definition of a university, because it is certainly plausible that the university can designate lower ranking people for someone that people can take a complaint to, other than a designated high level administrator.  It also reads in A that, this wholly protects them against disclosure to the Board of Regents, the president, the provost, vice provost, or chair, or other people.  This frankly does not have much impact on how the policy operates.  The policy frame is much bigger.  It think that we have to deal with the inconsistency, the problem of whether we want to make available people below these four high ranking people.  </P>
<P>Mary Stevens: Again, our model is based on the law and the law does define public body to include individuals such as the governor, the attorney general, the county attorney, and members of the legislature.  It does not talk about supervisors, or directors of agencies, although people might know of others.  The law defines public bodies and public officials that presumably have the authority and interest in taking some action about it.  The whistleblower cases that we have seen to date are generally against a supervisor or against someone in the supervisory chain at the department or college level.  The idea is to set it up for employees to go to a much higher level, possibly because they might not get a fair or thorough investigation if they reported to an immediate supervisor, or someone in that immediate chain of command.  This is an issue that the president, the legislature, and as Madeline Jarrit discussed, and the decision was, that reporting would be done to a public body, or a high level official at the university.  I don't believe a revision to amend it to take it down to a chair, or a certain other person will be approved, because that is not the understanding when they negotiated it in the legislature.  Internally, we want to be sure that for this policy to have impact, whistleblower allegations are taken to the appropriate office for resolution and investigation.  Our concern is that if we are going to the immediate supervisor, will all the supervisors at this university know what to do and where to go with that?  If they do not act appropriately and immediately, it puts the university at risk.  That is our rationale for wanting to go to a higher level and notifying employees by policy that there are higher level officials that investigate their complaint.  </P>
<P>Senator Killeen: The purpose of a purpose statement is to make a clear and concise statement of what the item is about.  It is not the purpose of the purpose to have all the battles and codicils attached to it.  The original statement of purpose is clear and relatively easy to read.  It avoids gratuitous implication of good faith, which may be discussed in detail later in the policy.  It avoids some of the inconsistencies that Senator Rose pointed out.  It is consistent with Counsel's intent.  I see no advantage to attempt to say too much. <B>I make a motion that we decide not to accept the amendment</B>.</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: That in effect is a <B>Call for the Question</B>, shutting off debate upon the motion.  The uestion has been called.  Therefore, we are ready for a vote to accept this amendment to the first section.  <B>Accepting the amendment provides substitute wording that includes the amendment to add the word "personnel" between "adverse" and "action</B>."  <B>Rejecting this amendment reverts to the original wording.   A yes vote accepts the new wording; a no vote retains the old wording</B>.  Following a voice vote, the Chair rules that the <B>original wording is retained.  </P>
</B><P>Senator Rose: Point of clarification: Is the discussion today limited only to the amendment?</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: I think so because right now we need to adjudicate the document we were given, which was the document on the table with the amendments that have been proposed by a variety of sources.  What we have tried to do is coalesce all those amendments into one document that will facilitate us going through these changes.  Right now, what we are doing is going through all the amendments and then we will look at the document as a whole.  </P>
<P>Senator: Will we be able to offer amendments to the document as a whole?</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Yes, to the document as a whole.  The second amendment occurs on page 2: it suggests <B>deleting "having control over personnel actions" and replacing that with the words "with authority to make or materially influence significant personnel decisions."</B>  Is there any discussion of this proposed amendment?</P>
<P>Senator Mayer: Would that make personnel committees under the purview of the policy?</P>
<P>Mary Stevens: This is the concern of the Academic Senate at West, when they approved it. </P>
<P>West Senate President Chisholm: Essentially, the discussion centered on the word "control."  Our senators felt that it was more to do with the authority to influence personnel actions. </P>
<P>Senator Karady: I think the original language is best.</P>
<P>Senator Linder: I will speak in favor of the amendment.  As most faculty know, control over personnel actions is something that rarely exists; however, many people have material influence over personnel decisions.  Influence is the better language.</P>
<P>Senator Rose: I would agree.  I support the amended language.  However, the question from the gentleman about committees has not been answered.  As I read the language, I do not think that it does say that Personnel Committee would be under this policy.  It talks about individuals, not committees.  </P>
<P>Senator Bivona: As I read it is seems like a member of a personnel committee would materially influence the decision of the personnel committee.  </P>
<P>Senator Mayer: Actually an individual or a committee could influence a decision.</P>
<P>Senator Blumenfeld-Jones: While a person could bring complaints about action taken by a committee, they could also identify certain individuals that were members of the committee.  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Legal counsel has agreed with that assessment.</P>
<P>Senator Mayer: I would agree if that were the interpretation.  <B>I move to amend the amendment by deleting "or materially influence."</B>  Seconded.  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: We are discussing the amendment.  Is there any further discussion?</P>
<P>Senator Blumenfeld-Jones: [Inaudible here.]</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Hearing no further discussion, we will move to a vote<B>.  A yes vote means that we will delete "or materially influence", a no vote retains that language</B>.  Following a voice vote, the Chair rules that the <B>wording of the amendment remains the same</B>.  </P>
<P>We are <B>now considering the amendment as a whole</B>.  Hearing no further discussion, we will move to a vote.  <B>A yes vote effectively confirms the deletion of the words "having control over personnel actions" and substitutes the wording "with authority to make or materially influence significant personnel decisions."  A yes vote puts that wording into place; a no vote retains the original wording.</B>  Following a voice vote, the Chair rules that <B>the amendment passes</B>.  </P>
<P>Moving on: Going down to the next <B>section, number 2, insertion of the words "denial of continuing status</B>" brings this policy in line with the wording that is associated with Academic Professionals.  <B>A vote of yes inserts the words "denial of continuing status."  A vote of no leaves the wording as it was before the suggested insertion.  </B>Following a voice vote, the Chair rules that <B>the amendment passes.</P>
</B><P>The next amendment deals with <B>the insertion of the word "written" on page </B>3 (written as opposed to oral or any other means).  Is there any discussion of this amendment?  </P>
<P>Senator Winkelman: Oral disclosure is not technically in the policy.  </P>
<P>Mary Stevens: I don't think it was intended that oral disclosure would not be protected, but in the chain of events that has to occur in making a complaint; there is burden of proof to establish that following disclosure that retaliation did in fact occur.  The consensus was that we will need written documentation in the whistleblower area, or eventually you are going to get to a hearing stage.  In addition, when we look at other investigations of whistleblowing complaints, various offices on campus were charged to do the investigation, and in one case we asked for an outside law firm.  It depended on the nature of the allegation.  You have to refer that complaint to the appropriate office to investigate it.</P>
<P>[Some discussion inaudible here.]</P>
<P>Senator Killeen: With my first reading of this policy, availability of documentation might dissuade a disclosure.  The written report is required before it is considered a disclosure.  Later we will talk about filing a written submission.  Unless it would undermine the purpose of the legislation, <B>I would recommend that we close the question (debate) and not include "written" because it may have negative effects on people who don't understand that it does not have to be written.</B>  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: <B>The question has been called</B>.  That requires us immediately to move to a vote<B>.  The vote of yes serves to insert the word "written" into the document and the vote of no leaves the document the way it is.</B>  Following a voice vote, the Chair rules that <B>the original wording "a report by an employee to a public body" stands.  </P>
</B><P>The next proposed amendment is <B>the insertion of item #8, which is a filing statement, submission of a written disclosure to a public body by the employee.</B>  Is there any discussion of the amendment?  </P>
<P>[Extensive, wide-ranging discussion, mostly inaudible.]  </P>
<B><P>Senator Mayer: I move to strike from recommendation #8, "disclosure to a public body by the employee" and insert  "written whistleblowing complaint".  </B>(seconded by Senator Killeen)</P>
<P>[Discussion.]  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: What is your pleasure on the proposed amendment?  Following a voice vote, the Chair rules that <B>the amendment passes</B>.</P>
<P>Senator Linder: I <B>call for a division of the house</B>.</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: A<B> division of the house has been called.</B>  <B>The count was taken: 29 yes.  24 no.</B>  The Chair rules that <B>the amendment passes</B>.  <B>    </P>
</B><P>Senate President Davey: Now we are ready for a vote on the amended statement.</P>
<P>Senator Moore: I have a question.  We have here a definition of a public body.  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: We need to restrict our comments to this amendment.  Is it relevant to this amendment?  </P>
<P>Senator Moore: I can understand how you can communicate to a governor, but when it gets down to a member of the Board of Regents and the Arizona Legislature--does that mean you can communicate with one member?  Is this a filing, or does it require acceptance by the legislature?</P>
<P>Mary Stevens: Public body has been deleted from that filing statement.  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: That is a question that could come up under another section.  That is a good point.  We are ready for a vote on the amended statement on filing.  We are saying <B>a "submission of a written whistleblower complaint.</B>"  Following a voice vote, the Chair rules <B>the amendment passes</B>.  </P>
<P>The next set of amendments is an <B>adjudication of the numbering</B>.  Can we just stipulate that if we add a section we just change the numbers to conform?  So stipulated.  Moving right along.</P>
<P>Item number 16 is the next change, insertion of a component that defines what a supervisory employee is.  "<B>Any ASU supervisor, director, chair or dean, department head or other employee who has authority to make or materially influence significant personnel decisions</B>."  Hearing no further discussion, we will move to a vote.  Following a voice vote, <B>the amendment passed</B>.  </P>
<P>The next three are numbering alterations, and we will assume that we all agree on that.</P>
<P>The substantive amendment is under item #C and it is the insertion of the sentence "A employee may make a disclosure to any public body as defined herein."  It just says that anyone can make a whistleblower complaint.  Is there any further discussion of this amendment?</P>
<P>Senator Moore: Is the proper place to discuss the term "public body?"</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Actually no, but when we come back and we will vote on the whole document, I will allow an amendment to say "a member of the legislature" if you wish to make that amendment.</P>
<P>Senator Moore: If that is your intent.</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: That is my intent.  Any further discussion of the amendment to insert the words "<B>any employee may make a disclosure to any public body defined herein</B>"?  Following a voice vote, the Chair rules that <B>the amendment passes</B>.  </P>
<P>The next amendment is the <B>deletion of the word "shall" and the insertion of  the words "are encouraged to."</B>  Is there any discussion of this amendment?</P>
<P>Senator Mignolet: Are we going to try to finish this document today?</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: There was a plan to do that, but we may not get through it.  May I suggest that we get through the proposed amendments that have come from a variety of sources and then we will deal with the document as a whole at our next meeting?  Is that fair enough?  Following a voice vote, the Chair rules that <B>the amendment passes</B>.  </P>
<P>The next amendment says <B>"a university investigation</B>" striking "an" and making it "a" to specify the locus of control of the investigation.  Following a voice vote, the Chair rules that <B>the amendment passes.</B>  </P>
<P>The next amendment is the <B>deletion of the sentence in the middle of page 5 that says "No suit, claim, or judicial review may be brought alleging violation of the whistleblower policy until this step has been completed."   </P>
</B><P>Senator Mignolet: Does it mean that a lawsuit cannot happen at the same time?</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: It basically says that you have to go through this process and then if you get an action that you do not like, then you are free to file the suit at that time.  The deletion implies that you can do it simultaneously.  </P>
<P>Mary Stevens: Deletion just leaves it more ambiguous.  That was done originally in an effort to have people go through this process before they file a lawsuit.  It was at the request of some faculty leaders; in fact, if there is an internal process going on, generally, the courts require that process be completed.  There is always some argument on this and by removing this sentence, it opens that possibility.</P>
<P>Senator Killeen: It is not clear that the university is telling people they cannot sue through outside channels.  </P>
<P>Mary Stevens: The law says that you can appeal a final decision of administration.  The university represents the final agency decision in this case.  The courts here have determined that if you have policies in place they become part of the contractual conditions of employment.  The judge may request that you go back and exhaust your university procedure first.  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Any other discussion of that deletion?  Hearing no further discussion, we will move to a vote.  Following a voice vote, the Chair rules that <B>the amendment passes</B>.</P>
<P>The next substantive amendment inserts an item #2 under 2.F which suggests adding "results of a disclosure investigation" and changes number 2 to number 3.</P>
<P>Senator Jacob: Point of order.  I respectfully request a quorum call.  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: A quorum has been called.  I am without a parliamentarian today, but I will rule after we count.  The call requires 78 be present.  After counting there was a count of 50.  That is not sufficient to conduct further business.</P>
<P>Some catalog copy needs to go forward and this call creates some problems on those items.  The rule says we cannot do more business.</P>
<P>Senator Linder: The Chair may call a special meeting.</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: The Chair will now entertain a motion to call a special meeting to continue our business, and a separate special meeting to discuss the whistleblower policy amendments.  Following a voice vote, the Chair rules that we will call a special meeting now and inform the members when the other special meeting is scheduled.  We can now move down the agenda.  </P>
<P>Senator Winkelman: Point of order, if we do not have a quorum, how can we go on to other agenda items?</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: As long as we have called a special meeting, and no one calls the quorum again, we do not have to deal with that issue.  </P>

<B><P>6.  New Business (Motions and Reports from Senate Committees).</P>
<P>6.A  Executive Committee</B> (William Davey).  </P>
<B><P>6.A.1  Senate Resolution #16 was introduced: "Be it Resolved: The ASU Academic Senate endorses the 1998 revision of the ASU Philosophy of Intercollegiate Athletics, and Be it Further Resolved: The Academic Senate urges swift and effective implementation of this philosophy to achieve the goals therein stated."</B>  The document was distributed with the agenda. What the University President would like us to do, at our next regular meeting of the Senate, is to endorse a document that the ICA and many others have already approved.  If there are further issues from the floor of the Senate, I will  pass those items along with the resolution on to President Coor.        </P>
<B><P>6.B   Committee on Committees </B>(Tim Karcher).  No report.</P>
<B><P>6.C   Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee </B>(Linda Johnson).</P>
<B><P>6.C.1  Senate Motion #14 was introduced: "The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee requests Academic Senate approval of a request from the College of Public Programs to establish an undergraduate certificate in Asian Pacific American Studies."  </P>
</B><P>[Discussion of the proposal with Dr. Tom Nakayama, Director, Asian Pacific American Studies Program.  At the request of the Dean of the Graduate College, the Senate asked that the sentence "such a certificate might be of interest to those already holding undergraduate degrees who seek to augment their educational backgrounds" found on pages 3 and 4 and the sentence "It is also available to non-degree studetns" on page 4 be removed.]  </P>
<B><P>6.C.2  Senate Motion #15 was introduced: "The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Business to disestablish a Certificate in Small Business for non-majors." </P>
</B><P>The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee now requests the suspension of the rules to vote upon these motions in order to make sure they meet publication deadline in the new biennial catalog.  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee essentially asks that we move on to their second readings today.  That requires a 2/3 vote of those present to suspend the rules.  This motion is non-debatable, so, we move to a vote to suspend the rules.  Following a voice vote (one nay duly recorded), the motion to suspend the rules passed.</P>
<P>Senator Johnson: We are now considering Senate Motion #14 (read again).</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Is there further discussion on this motion?  </P>
<P>Senator Mignolet?: Can you clarify what is Asian Pacific American?</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Can you clarify (to Professor Nakayama) for him?</P>
<P>Professor Nakayma: Any individual who claims their ancestry to Asia, or the Pacific Island region.</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Hearing no further discussion, we will move to a vote.  The vote in essence then will approve this certificate program and a no vote will no approve it.  Following a voice vote, the motion passes.</P>
<P>Senator Johnson: We are now considering Senate Motion #15 (read again).  </P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Is there further discussion on that motion?  Hearing no further discussion, we will move to a vote.  Following a voice vote, the motion was approved.</P>
<P>[Copies of Senate Motions #14 and #15 w/rationale and documentation are available upon request from the Academic Senate Office, 965-9245vm.]</P>
<B><P>6.C.2  Information Item (does not require a second reading or a vote):  </P>
</B><P>Senator Johnson: On December 2, 1998, the Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommended approval of the following item: A request from the College of Engineering to disestablish a concentration under the B.S.E., Engineering Special Studies Manufacturing Engineering.</P>
<B><P>6.D  Student-Faculty Policy Committee </B>(John Crawford).  No report.</P>
<B><P>6.E  University Services and Facilities Committee </B>(Rodney Rogers).  No report.</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: Would the Provost like to address any issues at this time?</P>
<P>Provost Glick: The Governor's proposal--the Legislative proposal (JLBC).  The governor's proposal takes into account the fact that with the tax reductions of the past few years, and the fact that Students First was funded on carry-forward for this year, the Governor and legislature project a major deficit for next year.   Therefore, the governor proposes that part of Students First, which is the school construction program, be funded by bonding, to ease the shortfall.  She recommends flat budgets for the universities except for two decision packages: the first is funding for a teacher inservice preparation center at NAU, which the Board has proposed as a tri-university center and the second a decision package for the UofA to grow tomatoes in water, which the UofA had not requested.  In addition, the governor proposes a 2.5% pay package.  </P>
<P>The JLBC proposal has major reductions and no bonding.  There are three major reductions: 1) a major reduction based on faculty payroll (5%) that is argued that the universities can solve this by everyone teaching 18 minutes more a week; 2) a reduction corresponding to one-half the budgeted amount to fund out-of-state travel; 3) initial reduction in state funding of the law school, which would be followed by eliminating state funding for the law school.  Eventually they would eliminate all subsidies for graduate programs.  </P>
<P>The positive part of the legislative proposal is they recognize for ASU the major loss of tuition suffered this year and backfill part of this shortfall.  The gravest concern is that in the middle of the greatest economic boom in U.S. history, we are having visited upon us major reductions; when the economy does decline, there will be even greater problems facing us.  We can each make our own decisions on the wisdom of these recommendations--then we can communicate our support or lack of support to our elected representatives.  That is kind of a birdseye view of the budget proposals.  We think that both proposals are serious for the universities.  While recognizing the governor's proposal includes bonding, it does not recognize new needs for the universities.  </P>
<P>Our budget hearings are February 16 and 17.  The State has taken as one of its credos to do the budget in 60 days, which means in early March they should be done with the budget.  Then they will try to end the legislative session in 100 days.  If you want to be heard, then this is the time frame.</P>
<P>Senate President Davey: On Wednesday, January 27, from 6-7 p.m., Senators Freestone and Huppenthal are having an open meeting at Alma Elementary School, 1313 West Medina in Mesa, on the K-12 funding issues.  It would be best if they approved bonded funding for those kinds of programs and so, if you live in District 30, please try to attend.  If any of want to exercise your right as citizens and need specific information as to who your legislators are, the Academic Senate will be happy to provide that information to you in the form of their telephone numbers and email addresses.  My email is william.davey@asu.edu, and I will be happy to help you with any questions you may have.  Again, I would like to thank the Senate for the clarity with what you are going through with the whistleblower policy.  This has been a difficult task.  We are instructed to have similar policies at all three universities, yet the three universities are going off on their own.  I appreciate those of you who have attempted to make sure that there is internal consistency within the document, and for the seriousness with which you have taken these proposed amendments.    </P>

<B><P>7.  Adjournment</B>.  There being no further business to discuss, the meeting adjourned at 4:58 p.m.</P>
