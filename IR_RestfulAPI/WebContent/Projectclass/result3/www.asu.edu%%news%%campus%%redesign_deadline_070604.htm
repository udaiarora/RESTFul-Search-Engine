      <h2>Regents extend deadline for redesign input </h2>
      <p>The deadline to submit proposals for a feasibility study to redesign Arizona's university system has been extended to Aug. 1, 2004. This was a decision much appreciated by more than 20 members of the public who voiced their concerns during the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) meeting held June 24-25 at Northern Arizona University. </p>
      <p>During the call to the public, community members requested that the ABOR slow down the process, rethink the proposed plan and consider how the proposed redesign would impact the surrounding communities. </p>
      <p>ABOR President-elect Gary Stuart addressed the audience and said their concerns mirror those of the board. </p>
      <p>"Those concepts that you have talked about are vital to us," Stuart said. "It is perceived that we made up our minds. This is about true innovation," he added. "We are going to work with lots of people and get a lot of ideas and work together. It's an open collaborative process. If we don't have that, then it will be a failure." </p>
      <p>The proposed operating model, which was made public May 23, would involve the creation of two new freestanding "regional universities" that would help Northern Arizona University, Arizona State University and the University of Arizona better serve Arizona. As their core mission, the regional universities would consist of Northern Arizona University, Central Arizona University (currently ASU West Campus) and Southern Arizona University (currently University of Arizona South and Northern Arizona University-Yuma). These universities would center their attention on specific areas of the state and concentrate on undergraduate and masters-level education. </p>
      <p>In addition, the board gave ASU approval to begin implementation of the Design Team recommendations and the "One University in Many Places" plan, which includes the reorganization and name changes of academic units at ASU. For information about the plan and the University Design Team, visit the Web at (http://www.asu.edu/president/udt/). </p>
      <p>The Arizona Board of Regents also approved the following items: </p>
      <p>. Support for the renaming of Arizona State University East Campus as Arizona State University Polytechnic and approval to approach the Arizona Legislature and the Governor to seek an amendment of A.R.S. &sect;15-1601.A to allow the renaming; </p>
      <p>. Approval of ASU's FY 2005 Capital Development Plan, which proposes five new projects, the Academic Renovations &amp; Deferred Maintenance Phase II at an estimated cost of $20 million, the Instructional/Research Laboratory Renovations Phase II at an estimated $20 million, Arizona Futures Decision Theater at an estimated $6.5 million; The Capital Center Complex Phase I funded by a third-party developer; and the Wrestling Training Facility funded through a public/private agreement; </p>
      <p>. Approval to enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the City of Tempe for an exchange of real property to enable construction of the Central Phoenix/East Valley Light Rail Transit Project and construction of a Light Rail Station on the ASU main campus; and, </p>
      <p>. The appointment of Gerald S. Jakubowski as the new vice president and provost for the Arizona State University East campus; and the appointment of Mark Searle as the new vice president and provost for the Arizona State University West campus. </p>
      <p>The next Arizona Board of Regents meeting is scheduled August 19 and 20 at Northern Arizona University. For more information on the Arizona Board of Regents, visit the Web at (<a href="http://www.abor.asu.edu">http://www.abor.asu.edu</a>). </p>
