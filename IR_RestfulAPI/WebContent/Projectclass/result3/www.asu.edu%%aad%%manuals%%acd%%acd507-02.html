This description is dependent upon the unit&#146;s mission and goals.  Excellence is achieved in the context of the unit in which the academic professional works.  Standards for performance include:<p><ol><li>effective and continuous accomplishments that relate to the missions of the unit and university</li><p><li>effective accommodation of change in the position or environment in which the individual has worked during the time period under review</li><p><li>contributions to organizational goals and objectives</li><p><li>innovation and creativity in professional practices</li><p><li>professional development, that is, continuing growth in one&#146;s position and professional expertise<p>and</li><p><li>knowledge and application of professional standards and practices, guidelines and protocols. </li></ol><p><b>Professional Contributions</b><p>Professional contributions comprise a wide range of endeavors that draw upon the academic professional&#146;s expertise, talents, and interests and represent a commitment to the profession or to the discipline that extends beyond the scope of assigned responsibilities.  <p>Each position affords different opportunities, and each academic professional has different talents and means of contributing to his or her profession and enhancing effectiveness in supporting the needs of the unit and the mission of the university.  <p>Examples of professional contributions include, but are not limited to:<p><ol><li> active participation in appropriate professional or scholarly organizations</li><p><li> publication and dissemination</li><p><li>efforts to transfer techniques and practices resulting from creative activity at the university to other institutions</li><p><li> consultations and evaluations drawing on the academic professional&#146;s expertise</li><p><li>fellowships or scholarly awards</li><p><li>grant proposals written or grants received<p>and</li><p><li>research, teaching, leadership, management, or administrative roles within the academic professional&#146;s specialization beyond those stated in the position description for the individual.</li></ol><p>The academic professional&#146;s role in these activities is important in evaluating these contributions. The contributions should reflect an active, directed pursuit of goals that impact and advance the practice and/or scholarship within the academic professional&#146;s field. Because many kinds of participation and contribution are possible, the academic professional should describe the nature and extent of the activities so that the level of significance is clear to reviewers. <p><b>Institutional, Professional, and Community Service </b><p>Academic professionals with continuing or probationary appointments are to actively serve the institution, the profession, and the community.  Service of academic professionals is characterized by the application of subject knowledge and professional expertise beyond the scope of assigned responsibilities. <p>Service may include such activities as membership on unit search committees, roles in shared governance, contributions to campus committees, and/or similar activities within professional organizations. Service may also include community activities that draw upon professional expertise or subject knowledge and/or advance the university by meeting the needs of the greater public.   <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Definitions of Performance Reviews and Evaluations</b></font><p><dt>Performance Review</dt><dd>An assessment of an academic professional&#146;s overall contributions that determines whether the academic professional is retained at ASU.  A review of an academic professional on a multiple-year appointment determines renewal of that appointment, either as a fixed-term or a rolling appointment.  A probationary review is conducted approximately at the midpoint of the probationary period; a review for continuing status is conducted in the last year of the probationary period as is designated in the offer letter; a promotion review can occur at any time, in accordance with the personnel action schedules set by the university provost&#146;s office. </dd><p><dt>Annual Performance Evaluation</dt><dd>The appraisal of the academic professional&#146;s performance, prepared on a yearly basis by the unit head. </dd><p><dt>Post-Continuing Appointment Review</dt><dd>A review triggered by the annual performance evaluation of an academic professional who holds a continuing appointment. If an academic professional is found to be &#147;unsatisfactory&#148; in one or more areas of evaluation or on the overall evaluation, the relevant post-continuing appointment review procedures must be followed.
