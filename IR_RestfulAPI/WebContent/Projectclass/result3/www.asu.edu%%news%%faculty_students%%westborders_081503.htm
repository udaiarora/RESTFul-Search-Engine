      <h2>ASU West students experience global realities first-hand</h2>
      <p>        It's one thing to engage in classroom study about NAFTA's effects on
        trade; it's another to visit a Mexican border city, visit maquiladora
        factories and meet factory workers and management. An award-winning program
        in the ASU West School of Management that brings students face-to-face
        with living and working conditions in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico is one
        example of the opportunities the campus offers students to experience
      Latin American cultures and economies first-hand.</p>
      <p>Students in ASU West's
          "Business in the Global Environment" course spend a day in Nogales,
        touring maquiladoras (multinational factories), conducting
          market-basket surveys at grocery stores to compare food prices with
        typical local incomes, and learning about the economic, political and
        historical
        issues that characterize the Nogales border area.</p>
      <p>The Nogales border immersion
          tours earned the School of Management the 2002 Program Excellence Award
          from the North American Small Business
        International Trade Educators organization.</p>
      <p>"Most U.S. university business
          students have not had significant exposure to international business
          realities," says Gary Anders, professor of
          economics and director of the School of Management's Institute for
        International Management. "The response of our students has been overwhelmingly
        positive
          to this opportunity for real-world exposure to topics such as NAFTA,
          globalization, foreign direct investment, inter-firm trade, outsourcing
        and competitive advantages."</p>
      <p>"It's vital for our undergraduate global
          business students to understand the growing ties between Arizona and
          Mexico, which is now the second-largest
          trading partner of the United States," says Bruce Forster, dean of
        the ASU West School of Management.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the School of Management
        has established a relationship with the Hermosillo Campus of the Instituto
        Tecnologico y Estudios Superiores
        de Monterrey (ITESM). ITESM faculty member Ignacio Vazquez spent a year
        at ASU West as a visiting professor. ASU West students participated in
        an immersion trip to Hermosillo, and Vazquez brings a group of ITESM
        students to ASU West each semester.<br>
        ASU students also have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the culture
        of Central America and the Spanish language through a summer study abroad
      program to Costa Rica, offered by ASU West's College of Arts &amp; Sciences.</p>
      <p>The
          two-week program combines intensive Spanish language study with instruction
          related to Central American culture, including field trips to cultural
          locations. Students are housed with a Costa Rican host family. Sara
        Gutierres, associate professor of social psychology in the ASU West social
        and behavioral
        sciences department, coordinates the educational experience.</p>
      <p>Students
          interested in participating in the Costa Rica trip may apply for scholarship
          assistance made possible through the support of the Mitsui
        Foundation. </p>
      <p>"It is gratifying to receive financial support from a private
        foundation that recognizes the tremendous benefits that come from giving
        U.S. university
        students the opportunity to become familiar with other cultures in the
      Americas," says Emily Cutrer, dean of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.</p>
      <p>"The
          trip was a great educational and growth experience for me," says student
          Carole Horn, who received a Mitsui scholarship to participate
          in the 2003 tour. "It was good to see how another culture lives. I
        think that as Americans, we truly believe that ours is the only way."</p>
      <p>Information
          about the study abroad program is available through the ASU West social
          and behavioral sciences department at (602) 543-6061. For
          details about School of Management international study opportunities,
