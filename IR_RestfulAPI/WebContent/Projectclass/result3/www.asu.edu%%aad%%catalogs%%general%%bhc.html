This interdisciplinary program affords an opportunity to engage in a focused program of study that brings analytical rigor to bear on the philosophical issues involved in law and politics. The concentration comprises six courses (18 semester hours), two of which are offered through Barrett Honors College. One of these courses, normally taken in the student&#8217;s second year at ASU, is a seminar on law, justice, and morality (HON 310); the second is a junior-senior seminar on theories of justice, or a related topic in philosophy, politics, and law, that entails an extended paper (HON 410). The remaining four courses must be approved by the PPL Council and selected from courses regularly offered in philosophy, political science, and other areas.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1256312"></a>The PPL Council consists of the PPL director and several members of the ASU faculty whose research and teaching focus on political, legal, and moral philosophy. ASU has exceptional resources in this area, with more than a dozen faculty members &#8212; in the Department of Philosophy, the Department of Political Science, Barrett Honors College, the College of Law, and other departments &#8212; working in this field. Among them are several professors who have won teaching awards and national or international honors for their scholarship. </p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1256320"></a>The PPL Program aims to sharpen the critical, conceptual, and analytical skills that law schools and graduate programs in philosophy, political science, and other fields require. By engaging students in the analysis of classical and contemporary political, legal, and moral concerns, moreover, PPL hopes to prepare them for public service, whether it be as lawyers or scholars, in government or in watchdog groups, or simply as active and responsible <br>citizens. </p><p class="CL-01-title-6-above"><a name="pgfId-1256321"></a>Certificate Requirements</p><h6 class="CL-03-semester"><a name="pgfId-1256322"></a>Required courses</h6><p class="CL-04-pfx-title-hr"><a name="pgfId-1256323"></a>HON	310	Justice and Law	3</p><p class="CL-04-pfx-title-hr"><a name="pgfId-1256324"></a>HON	410	Philosophy, Politics, and Law	3</p><p class="CL-05-elective-group-hr"><a name="pgfId-1256325"></a>Choose four of the following elective courses for 	12 hours</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256326"></a>HON	376	Law, Literature, and Life L/HU (3)</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256327"></a>JUS	303	Justice Theory (3)</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256328"></a>PHI	305	Ethical Theory HU (3)</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256331"></a>PHI	307	Philosophy of Law HU (3)</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256336"></a>PHI	309	Social and Political Philosophy HU (3)</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256340"></a>PHI	310	Environmental Ethics HU (3)</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256344"></a>PHI	335	History of Ethics HU (3)</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256348"></a>POS	340	History of Political Philosophy I HU/H (3)</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256352"></a>POS	341	History of Political Philosophy II HU/H (3)</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256356"></a>POS	346	Problems of Democracy HU (3)</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256360"></a>POS	442	American Political Thought HU (3)</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256364"></a>POS	445	Asian Political Thought SB, G (3)</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256368"></a>POS	471	Constitutional Law I SB (3)</p><p class="CL-06-choices"><a name="pgfId-1256372"></a>POS	472	Constitutional Law II SB (3)</p></div><div><h6 class="CL-09-totalhours"><a name="pgfId-1256405"></a>Total	18</h6><p class="Body-6-above"><a name="pgfId-1275211"></a>In keeping with the interdisciplinary nature of the program, students may count no more than three courses from any one department toward the PPL certificate.
