      <h2 align="left">ASU mourns fallen soldier, top student, Sun Devil star </h2>
      <p align="left">It was a week ago today we learned of the news of the loss of one of ASU's own, graduate Pat Tillman, who was killed April 22 in Afghanistan while serving his country with the Army Rangers. Plans have been made to celebrate him and his life by establishing a scholarship fund and retiring his football jersey, No. 42. </p>
      <p align="left">Tillman was a consummate student-athlete, graduating summa cum laude in 1997 with a degree in marketing and a 3.84 grade point average. He was a linebacker with the Sun Devil football team 1994 - 97 and was the Pac-10 defensive player of the year in 1997. </p>
      <p align="left">He was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in 1998, and turned down a lucrative new contract with the Cardinals in 2001 to serve his country in the U.S. Army. </p>
      <p align="left">Tillman never liked being in the spotlight, even after he gained national attention by leaving the NFL to fight overseas with his brother Kevin. But on April 23, word of his tragic death took center stage. </p>
      <p align="left">Fans set up makeshift memorials at the Victory Bell outside Sun Devil Stadium and left flowers around Tillman's picture inside the Intercollegiate Athletics Building. And flags at ASU were flown at half-mast. </p>
      <p align="left">ASU and the Arizona Cardinals organization also came together to create the Pat Tillman Memorial Scholarship Award. </p>
      <p align="left">"Pat not only exemplified what it meant to be a scholar-athlete as a member of the Sun Devil family, but also what it meant to be an American," said Gene Smith, ASU director of athletics. "Although we lost an outstanding individual in Pat Tillman, we know that this scholarship will assist future Sun Devils that strive for success and build upon the excellence he set forth." </p>
      <p align="left">The recipient of the scholarship will be a marketing student in the W. P. Carey School of Business. If the scholarship fund grows, then more scholarships will be awarded within the Marketing Department. </p>
      <p align="left">In addition to the scholarship, at the conclusion of the upcoming 2004 Arizona State football season, the No. 42 will no longer appear on the Sun Devil roster, as the jersey worn by Tillman will be retired in a ceremony at the Nov. 13 Washington State game. </p>
      <p>"The most difficult thing was to try and strike a balance by being sensitive to what the family is going through," Smith said. "The list of ideas that we have is unbelievable and a lot of them are very good, but knowing Pat, what we know and listening to those who knew him well, we have to walk a fine line and say, 'These things are appropriate, they're traditional.' Retiring the jersey and the creation of a scholarship are great ways to honor his memory, but other things might bring more attention to this than Pat would want and what his family would want." </p>
      <p>Connor Banks, a senior defensive end from Richmond, Calif., currently wears No. 42 for the Sun Devils and will continue to do so this season as a tribute to Tillman. Prior to each game, Banks will also carry the American flag out of the team tunnel and onto Frank Kush Field. </p>
      <p>"It's a great honor to be able to wear No. 42 for the last time," Banks said. "I feel so much pride for what he has done for the community and this nation. For him to give up his football career and go overseas to fight for his country and fight for what he feels is right is a great thing for the nation." </p>
      <p>Tillman's No. 42 is the fifth number retired in Sun Devil history, joining No. 11 Danny White (1971 - 73), No. 27 Bobby Mulgado (1954 - 57), No. 33 Wilford White (1947 - 50) and No. 40 Mike Haynes (1974 - 75). </p>
      <p>Memorial service plans were still pending as of April 28. Visit (www.asu.edu) for service information. </p>
