<h2><b>Minutes of Meeting (Spring Forum)</b></h2>

      </font></font> 
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">April 28, 2003, MU Alumni Lounge</font></b> 
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Dr Gail Hackett, Vice Provost
for Academic Personnel, addressed a gathering of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>80<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>academic professionals
and then took questions from the floor. CAPS received a large number of
questions from AP members prior to the meeting. The answers to some were
incorporated into her remarks and covered during the subsequent question and
answer period. Dr. Hackett agreed to prepare answers to the remaining questions
and make them available to all AP?s. These questions and answers will appear
on the CAPS website.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>
</o:p>
Dr Hackett<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>addressed two issues
initially: the status of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>imminent
revision of ACD 506 and 507 (now before the Academic Senate) and the events of
past year<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>pertaining to the
disruption of the faculty awards of tenure and academic professional awards of
continuing status. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">ACD 506/507 Revisions</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"> ?
Various faculty task forces and Academic Senate subcommittees have been working
on this for three years. Now the proposed revisions are before the Academic
Senate for their endorsement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
essence, all references that link faculty and academic professionals in these
two sections have been ?uncoupled?. The sections pertaining to academic
professionals have been extracted. They have supposedly been moved to a
different part of ACD and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>renumbered
but as of the date of this meeting, this is not the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The academic professionals either as a body,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>or through CAPS , have not been informed of where exactly these sections
have been placed, or why the complete revision of ACD 506/507 does not include
the new location/numbering of the academic professional provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to Dr. Hackett, the plan has always been to complete the review
of faculty promotion and tenure policies and procedures and then move to a
similar review of academic professional continuing status policies and
procedures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The abrupt decision by
Dr Crow to decline the award of continuing status to those candidates who
applied during the last cycle has accelerated the process that it took the
faculty three years to complete.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Recent Events</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial">
-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Crow is now personally making<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>the ultimate<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>tenure/continuing
status decision. In the process of reviewing the files<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>presented for a continuing status decision, Dr. Crow found<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>that he<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>had many<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>questions concerning<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
process and documentation of those files<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>that
could not be resolved given the existing timetable for this type of review and
decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Departmental appointment
letters, criteria and review procedures varied from college to college. He has
stated that the documentation in support of the particular candidates was in
some cases not as fully developed as he expected and in many cases did not serve
the candidate?s record. He believes the evidence that candidates present<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>in support of the award of continuing appointment must be overwhelming
before he will grant continuing status. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Therefore, he
?decoupled? the decisions for promotion and continuing status for this group
of candidates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Hackett
emphasized that no continuing status candidates received terminal notifications.
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">On a more fundamental
level, Dr Crow asserts that a close reading of the ABOR policies and ACD
policies demonstrates that the University policies ?go much further? than
the ABOR policies possibly intended to go. His view is that the standard of
excellence stated in the ABOR policies is simply not reflected in the current
University policies and procedures memorialized in the ACD manual. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Dr. Crow has charged Dr.
Hackett with the responsibility of conducting a thorough review of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>academic professional status and the policies and procedures that govern
their classification, appointment, evaluation and promotion. Furthermore, he has
asked Dr. Hackett to investigate alternative employment options other than
continuing status track. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The ramifications of both
these issues are to be addressed by a Task Force that Dr Hackett will<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>select and convene in short order. Members of the Committee on Academic
Professional Status have been asked to transmit nominations for this Task Force
to Dr. Hackett<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>and this has been done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Track and non-track academic professionals representing a cross section
of the academic professional ranks are to be selected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Some of the issues<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Task Force
will address include: clarification of the AP category (why is continuing status
needed? When and for whom is it needed?); investigation of multiple options for
employment other than continuing status; whether incumbent A Ps are properly
categorized; revision of the continuing status ?clock?, documentation and
evaluation criteria; revision of the evaluation solicitation letter; revision of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>employment offer letters; whether continuing status is depressing
salaries. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Question Period</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial">:
Time did not permit the full discussion of all questions posed by AP?s in
advance of the Spring Forum [see CAPS website for complete list]. Issues
concerning year to year AP employees such as Academic Associates for example
were not fully addressed. Affected AP employees expecting to either reapply for
continuing status during the next year may have the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>benefit of consulting with their Deans<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>who received some feedback from Dr Crow during the course of the reviews
this past year. Those AP employees who expect to present their applications
during the next cycle may possibly have the benefit of the result of the Task
Force work product. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Questions were also raised
about whether the President's office had worked with ASU Legal Counsel in
determining the outcome of this year's continuing appointment reviews.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One participant commented that the Board of Regent's Policy Manual
(6-301, part D) states that the President may not extend an Academic
Professional's probationary appointment beyond 7 years; and Dr. Hackett stated
that she would look into this.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">There was some discussion
about the process by which revised ACD policies affecting academic professionals
would be promulgated and adopted.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>How would AP?s be involved ? Would AP employees vote on
proposed revisions? Would the Academic Senate review and approve the proposed
revisions as they are doing for the faculty tenure and promotion revisions?
Specific answers to these questions are somewhat unclear. <o:p>
