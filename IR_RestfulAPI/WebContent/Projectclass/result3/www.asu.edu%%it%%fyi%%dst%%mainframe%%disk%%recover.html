    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You are responsible for backing
      up your files. Backups performed by the computing center should
      be considered your &quot;secondary&quot;, not &quot;primary&quot;,
      source of backup.</FONT></P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you wish to restore a lost
    or damaged disk data set and are unable to restore the data set
    from your own backup facilities, it may be possible to restore
    the data set from backup facilities maintained by the computing
    center.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Once a day, the computing center
    makes tape backups of disk data sets which have been modified
    since the last backup. Also, once a month, all disk data sets,
    whether modified or not, are copied to backup tapes. The daily
    backup tapes (incremental backups) are kept for 42 days; the
    monthly backup tapes are maintained for 13 months. (Files opened
    for output or update at the time backup occurs are bypassed for
    that day's backups.)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The backup facilities maintained
    by the computing center are intended for use by the computing
    center for disaster recovery purposes. As a public service, these
    facilities are available to supplement your own backup facilities.
    You should manage your own set of backups to ensure that you
    will always have a permanent &quot;good&quot; copy of important
    and non-reproducible disk data sets. In particular, if you have
    a newly created or modified data set which is inadventently deleted
    or modified before the daily backups are done, recovery of the
    data will depend primarily on your own backup facilities.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You need to complete the &quot;Request
    for Data Set Services&quot; form to have a data set restored.
    This form and instructions for filling it out are available at
    the computing sites. After you have submitted a properly completed
    form to the site operator, an operator will attempt to restore
    your data set from system backup tapes to temporary disk (with
    volume serial number <B>ASU234</B>) within 24 hours, but special
    cases may take more time.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After submitting the form, you'll
    need to follow two steps to recover your data set:</FONT></P>

    <OL>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Periodically, use <B>ISPF 3.4</B>
      to check on whether the file has been restored. On menu 3.4,
      fill in the name of the data set AND put <B>ASU234</B> in the
      volume serial number field before pressing Enter. If the data
      set cannot be found, it means the restore has not completed yet.</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Once the data set has been restored,
      use <B>ISPF 3.3</B> to move or copy the data set (or members
      thereof) to another data set. Be sure to include the volume serial
      number <B>ASU234</B> on the &quot;From&quot; menu. (If the &quot;To&quot;
      data set does not yet exist, use <B>ISPF 3.2</B> to create the
      &quot;To&quot; data set before using ISPF 3.3.)</FONT>
    </OL>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You must perform both these tasks
    to recover a permanent copy of your data set. Restored data sets
    are placed on a temporary disk volume for at least two days and
    are subsequently deleted. You need to copy the data set to a
    permanent disk volume during this period.</FONT>&nbsp;</TD>
