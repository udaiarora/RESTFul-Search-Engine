      <h2>ASU rides the wireless wave</h2>
      <p>Wireless is the wave of the future and ASU
        is on the edge of it. </p>
      <p>Last July, Virtual Private Network (VPN)/SecureRemote
          became available for wireless users on ASU Main and East campuses. </p>
      <p>"On an average day,
        it's estimated that 500 to 700 connections are made to the wireless network
        at ASU," says John Babb, assistant vice provost
        for Information Technology Instruction, Research &amp; Infrastructure
        Support.</p>
      <p>Wireless at ASU is an extension of the wired network that provides
          convenience and mobility and is a new technology that's still developing,
          according
          to Babb.<br>
        What does wireless mean to the average user? </p>
      <p>It allows access to ASU
          servers without being hardwired, meaning a user can check e-mail from
          a laptop computer or a personal data assistant
          (PDA) while visiting an outdoor coffee shop on the campus. </p>
      <p>"Students
          in the Residence Halls have access to wireless in some of the day rooms,
          where they can work collaboratively using their own computers,
          and staff will bring their laptops or PDAs to meetings to take notes
          or access information during the meeting," says Babb. "Even professors
          are using the technology when teaching classes outdoors."</p>
      <p>Stumbling blocks
          for the development of all wireless networks include security, registration
          and authentication, according to Babb.</p>
      <p>"Having
          the VPN/SecureRemote is a huge step forward, because providing security
          and privacy on wireless systems has always been difficult, and
          the VPN technology allows ASU to provide both," says Babb. </p>
      <p>While the
          wireless network is expected to grow, it will be some time before campuswide
          wireless coverage is possible at Main and East. </p>
      <p>At
          present, ASU has islands of connectivity at both campuses. As the network
          develops, the number of islands will grow and eventually merge.
          Currently, the wireless network on the Tempe campus is divided into
        five zones. The connection zone, sometimes called a hot spot, is a limited
          area of coverage.</p>
      <p>"It may be necessary to 'release and renew' when moving
          from one zone to another or you may have to reboot the computer," says
          Babb.</p>
      <p>It's expected
          that in the near future the release/renew process will be automatic,
          thus providing seamless roaming between zones. </p>
      <p>For computers
          and PDAs to work in a zone, they need to be able to support the technology
          used by the local area network to connect. Wireless cards
          are included in new laptops and PDAs, and adapter cards can be purchased
          for older devices. Computers also have to be registered and configured
          for the ASU network before having wireless access.</p>
      <p>Babb recommends that
          those interested in installing a wireless system consult IT's Datacomm
          group. Using their assistance will help departments
          avoid creating security and interference problems on the university's
          network. </p>
      <p>The wireless world, at least on the Main Campus, has the potential
          to go beyond geographic boundaries.</p>
      <p>Last week, representatives from ASU and
          the City of Tempe met to discuss expanding wireless service to include
          Mill Avenue. </p>
      <p>"We also are looking
          at including the community around us, at least in Tempe, in ASU's wireless
          world," says Babb. </p>
      <p>For more information about
          connecting to ASU's network, visit the ASU Wireless Web page at (www.asu.edu/wireless)
          or contact (comm-q@asu.edu)
          with questions.</p>
