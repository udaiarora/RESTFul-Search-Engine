<H2><A NAME="sect1">What Information Does SAS OnlineDoc Include?</A></H2>

<P>SAS OnlineDoc contains the reference information that
you absolutely must have in order to use the SAS System. For example, it
includes descriptions of functions, statements, and procedures; documentation for particular
operating environments; and (where applicable) information about basic
SAS tasks and concepts.  In other words, SAS OnlineDoc
contains the type of "dictionary style" information that has proved most
useful and easiest to use in an online format. 

This edition of SAS OnlineDoc also includes User's Guides and Administrator's Guides 
for some products. See the Table of Contents for a complete list of products and host
materials that are included.

<P>Reference information for SAS software products is also
located in the SAS System Help. To access the SAS System Help, select <B>Help </B> <IMG border="0"
src="images/arrow.gif"> <B>SAS System Help </B>
from any SAS window that has a menu bar, or issue the
<B>Help</B> command from the command area of the SAS ToolBox.  <P> <HR>

<H2><A NAME="sect2">Advantages of Using SAS OnlineDoc</A></H2>

<UL>

<LI>SAS OnlineDoc increases the efficiency of your entire organization
by giving every user at your site access to the most current edition of
SAS System reference documentation at no additional cost to your
organization. It is designed for use on your internal web, or you can
access it directly from a local CD-ROM drive on a PC.

<P>Once your SAS OnlineDoc CD-ROM has been installed, you can access it
from the SAS System by selecting <B>Help </B><IMG border="0"
src="images/arrow.gif"> <B>Books and Training
</B><IMG border="0" src="images/arrow.gif">
<B>SAS OnlineDoc</B> from any SAS window that has a menu bar.<P>

<LI>With thousands of pages of reference material at your fingertips,
you can locate information quickly and easily.<P>

<LI>In a Java-enabled browser environment, SAS OnlineDoc provides a
search engine with full-text search capabilities, as well as a detailed
table of contents and index. A plain HTML interface is also available
for use in browsers that are not Java-enabled.<P>
</UL>

<P>For information about how to use the Java-enabled version of SAS
OnlineDoc effectively, see the <a href='JavaScript:openWindow("../odquick/splash.htm")'> Quick

<H3><A NAME="sect4">Tutorials</A></H3>

<P>If you are using the SAS System for the first time, we recommend that
you begin with the tutorial "Getting Started with SAS Software," which
is integrated within the SAS System.  You can access the tutorial 
by selecting
<B>Help </B> <IMG border="0" src="images/arrow.gif"> 
<B>Getting Started with SAS Software</B> from the menu
bar of the SAS Explorer or the SAS programming windows.  

<p>This tutorial steps you through the
process of accessing data, managing files, analyzing data, and creating
graphs and basic reports, using sample data and a point-and-click
interface. New users quickly learn how to maneuver through the SAS
System. Experienced users learn the new interface and are exposed to new
products.


<P>
You can also 
access tutorials for SAS/ASSIST, SAS/EIS, SAS/GIS, and SAS/Warehouse Administrator
 software by 
accessing the product and then selecting <B>Help </B> <IMG border="0"
src="images/arrow.gif"> <B>Getting Started ... </B> from 
the menu bar.

SAS OnlineTutor is SAS Institute's next generation of online training.  
Taking advantage of HTML and Java capabilities, SAS OnlineTutor offers 
you an easy-to-use method of learning about the SAS windowing 
environment and SAS programming skills.
<P>
Topics in SAS OnlineTutor range from learning basic concepts to

small fee for the web-based training gives you 30 calendar days of unlimited
access to the entire library.


<P>
SAS OnlineTutor is also available as a licensed product within the SAS
System.  If your site has licensed and
installed SAS OnlineTutor, you can start the training by selecting
<B>Help </B> <IMG border="0" src="images/arrow.gif">

src="images/arrow.gif"> <B>SAS OnlineTutor </B> from any
SAS window that has a menu bar.  Contact the Training Representative at your 
local SAS office for more information about the annual license for

<P>
To view SAS OnlineTutor, we strongly recommend that you use 
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 or

JavaScript enabled. If you run SAS software on a mainframe computer, you
can view SAS OnlineTutor on your PC or UNIX workstation and use terminal
emulation software to practice in the mainframe SAS environment.

<H2><A NAME="sect7">SAS OnlineDoc Examples and the Year 2000</A></H2>

<P>As the 21st century approaches, you may notice that some of the
values in the sample programs in SAS OnlineDoc specify the year 2000 and
beyond. Unless otherwise noted, all of the output for example programs
in SAS OnlineDoc was generated using the new default value of the SAS
system option YEARCUTOFF=. In Versions 7 and 8, the default value of this
system option is 1920.

<P>YEARCUTOFF= specifies the first year of a 100-year span and is used
by various DATE and DATETIME informats and SAS functions. A default
value of 1920 means that SAS interprets any two-digit year value between
20 and 99 inclusive as referring to the 1900s. Any two-digit year value
between 00 and 19 inclusive is interpreted as referring to the 2000s.

<P>For more information about the YEARCUTOFF= system option, see <em>SAS
Language Reference: Dictionary</em>.  For more information about general
year 2000 issues and SAS software, visit the
<A name="z0663344"> <a href="http://www.sas.com/y2k"> Year 2000 Compliance</A>
link at our web site.

<P>In addition, the <a href="http://www.sas.com/training"> SAS Professional Services Division</a>
offers a course entitled <em>The Year 2000: Achieving Date Compliance in SAS
Applications</em>. You can attend a public course at an Institute
training center or bring the course to your site.
Contact your local SAS office for more information about <em>The Year 2000</em> 
and other training courses.
