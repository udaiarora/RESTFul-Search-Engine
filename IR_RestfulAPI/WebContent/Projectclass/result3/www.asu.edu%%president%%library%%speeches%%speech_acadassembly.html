It&#8217;s great to be here to welcome all                           of you to the beginning of the Fall semester. The main                           thing I want to do in the time that I have is share                           with you the set of Guiding Principles driving me, so                           that no matter what else I do, you&#8217;ll know that                           I&#8217;m trying to go back to these principles. Constantly,                           in judgments I make, decisions I make, assessments I                           make, or ideas I might generate and throw out for people                           to think about &#8211; there is a set of guiding principles                           driving me and I want you to know what those are. In                           addition, I will share my thoughts for the future in                           terms of where we might head collectively. </font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First,                           I&#8217;d like to share my impressions of ASU that are                           the result of meeting with hundreds of people since                           last April. I have spent a great deal of time meeting                           with people, including the leadership of the other Arizona                           universities, leaders of universities outside Arizona,                           community leaders, political leaders, alumni spread                           out across country and world. In talking with all of                           these folks and getting a sense of the community here,                           it&#8217;s fair to say this university is a beloved                           institution. There are large numbers of people who hold                           this institution close to their heart, that care about                           the institution and are willing to do things for this                           institution. There is a high level of social status                           in the community broadly. This is something that takes                           decades to achieve and it has already been achieved                           here. </font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This                           is a powerful foundation on which we&#8217;re sitting                           &#8211; a powerful foundation on which to build from.                           It&#8217;s something all of you should be proud of for                           the contributions you have made through interactions                           with students, and for the way the institution projects                           itself. I can say I&#8217;m not surprised by that, but                           I am surprised by the intensity of that positive feeling.                           I find the morale at this university to be among the                           highest of any institution I&#8217;ve either been at                           or visited or talked with others about. The general                           sense within the institution is positive and constructive,                           with a strong willingness to work together. This remains                           a university interested in being a community, a university                           interested in being connected to each other within the                           intellectual community. I consider that to be very,                           very positive.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We                           have an outstanding group of senior faculty. There are                           a number of faculty at the senior level who are truly                           remarkable. Not only do they carry the weight of driving                           their own disciplines forward and working to build their                           own department, they also are heavily engaged in building                           the university&#8217;s intellectual capacity across                           and between disciplines. These are truly remarkable                           individuals and they are a very rare, uncommon thing.                           It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity to be at an institution                           that has so many individuals of such high academic standards,                           yet with such intellectual agility that allows them                           to move between disciplines and take on and conceptualize                           problems and ideas that are really and truly meaningful                           &#8211; the kinds of things that are big and complicated.                           This institution is blessed with these individuals.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We                           are blessed with outstanding faculty on the junior level                           as well. I&#8217;ve been through hundreds if resumes                           of all new appointments, tenures, regents professors,                           and top faculty in every school, just to get a sense                           of who we have here. We have a great new faculty. I                           hope you saw the announcement that ASU is ranked 19th                           among 265 American universities in the winning of NSF                           CAREER awards. That achievement is significant. Now,                           it&#8217;s in a certain band of discipline, but it portrays                           the kind of people that we have the ability to attract                           here. We have to be sure to retain, nurture, develop,                           and grow them. It&#8217;s a tremendous indicator of                           the capacity of this university to really act, behave                           and perform and create at the highest levels.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Given                           all of that extremely positive feeling, which is what                           I have, you can&#8217;t imagine how excited I am to                           be here. To be at an institution that has these kinds                           of features. We can think about taking forward steps.                           That doesn&#8217;t mean there isn&#8217;t the need for                           some repair here or patchwork there or some additional                           resources here or there, but we can seriously think                           about where we want to go, what do we want to be, because                           we&#8217;re not mired or pinned down in some sort of                           internal struggle. This is a good place.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having                           said that, there are some things I&#8217;m concerned                           about. One is the ability to act, behave, and respond                           rapidly. We&#8217;re not quite able to do that yet at                           the speed I&#8217;d like to see us be able to engage.                           In another few months, the NIH will have doubled their                           budget in Washington to roughly $30 billion a year of                           new funding for social, physical, life, and behavior                           sciences. These are things a lot of folks here are interested                           in. There is a tremendous amount of new opportunity.                           Universities have to be able to respond to those kinds                           of things in time frames of two, three or four years.                           We&#8217;re running a little behind in terms of our                           ability to respond to those kinds of opportunities,                           so that&#8217;s one concern.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another                           concern as we move forward is the scale of the enterprise.                           We have a very large student body, one that&#8217;s                           likely to get much larger. We have a very hardworking                           faculty. I&#8217;ve looked at what people do, at their                           workloads. I&#8217;ve looked at the kind of weight people                           are carrying here. You can&#8217;t take a hard working                           faculty and say here are 30,000 more students, good                           luck. That doesn&#8217;t work very well. How do we scale                           the enterprise to be both focused on the individualized                           education and at the same time deal with large numbers                           of students?</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We                           also have some cultural unevenness. We can have all                           the differences that we want in the university in terms                           of what we think is or isn&#8217;t scholarship, but                           we can&#8217;t have unevenness about whether or not                           we are teachers first and scholars second. We have to                           agree that we&#8217;re all scholars and all teachers.                           There&#8217;s a little unevenness out there about that.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I                           think the empowerment of the academic leadership and                           the empowerment of the faculty remains low. We need                           to find ways to empower the chairs, to empower the faculty,                           to provide resources for creativity. You&#8217;re going                           to see those of us in the central administration work                           to try to find the means to do that. My most significant                           concern right now is that we still act, think, and behave                           too much like an agency. As if someone else, some other                           force &#8211; the state legislature, the Governor, someone                           else &#8211; is responsible for our fate. We behave                           as if we are an agency, as opposed to an enterprise                           where we are responsible for our fate. We are responsible                           for our fate. The people of Arizona will help us, but                           they won&#8217;t save us. The people of Arizona will                           give us a lot of resources, but they won&#8217;t ever                           give us enough resources. That&#8217;s not possible.                           There&#8217;s no institution in the country that has                           that from a single source that&#8217;s any good. </font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now                           I&#8217;d like to share with you the principles that                           guide me. There are four basic things I believe about                           this institution and about myself that are important                           to where we&#8217;re going. </font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1.	                          Teaching is our prime directive. We are teachers. I                           am a teacher, you are teachers, the institution is a                           teacher. The schools and departments are teachers. We                           all are teachers &#8211; that is what we are. When someone                           meets me on an airplane and they ask me what I do, I                           say I&#8217;m a teacher. I talk about what I do, why                           I got into the business of being a faculty member, ideas                           that I like to teach about and the things I like to                           focus my thinking on. That&#8217;s why I assume we are                           all here, because we are all teachers. I can&#8217;t                           think of anything more important that that. That is                           the prime directive.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.	                          Scholarship is our pathway to better teaching. I believe                           that scholarship, in whatever form each of us takes                           it, is essential to the quality of our teaching. That                           scholarship can be in form of teaching others how to                           teach complicated subjects, it can be advancing the                           knowledge of the interworkings of how to connect a wire                           to a molecule, or some form of creative expression in                           music or art, or theater. There&#8217;s a whole range                           of things that scholarship means, but all of us must                           be creatively engaged in pushing back the edges of whatever                           it is we do if we hope to be great teachers.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.	                          If teaching is our prime directive, creative expression                           in all forms is our highest goal. We live in a privileged                           setting. We live in a privileged class. We are people                           separated, to some extent, from the day-to-day workings                           of our broader and, in many ways, more complicated and                           more painful rest of society. We are separated, protected                           from that. In that protected realm, we have a responsibility                           to be creative. Whether we are artists, scientists,                           athletes, or whatever, our job is to be creative and                           you&#8217;ll find that I find all forms of creativity                           equal. I don&#8217;t hold any one form higher than another.                           I can&#8217;t judge whether an internet delivered animated                           opera is comparatively better than a person who is looking                           at the vortex dynamics of the atmosphere of a distant                           star. I can&#8217;t judge that. They&#8217;re both tremendous                           forms of creative expression and that&#8217;s our job.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4.	                          We must be an institution built around openness and                           access to our learning environment for all. Whatever                           we&#8217;re doing, the energy we create, the creativity                           that we stimulate, the teaching we do, if we sequester                           it, hold it inside, protect it, if we wall it off, it&#8217;s                           greatly diminished. We have to find ways to be as open                           and as accessible as we can and, at the same time, not                           be overwhelmed or moved to the arena of ineffectiveness.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So,                           no matter what you hear me say or do, these are the                           things that drive me.

That is that we somehow                           think that we&#8217;re existing in an institution that                           is evolutionarily dead. That the highest form of entity                           already exists and it&#8217;s somewhere else and that                           only if we had worked a little harder we could be on                           the faculty at Berkeley. Because, in our minds, something                           happens to us in the academy. We somehow think there                           are these institutions out there that we have to strive                           to be. I&#8217;m going to suggest that ASU has the potential                           to be a new kind of organization, that the evolutionary                           development of what we call a university is far from                           over that no institution has achieved what&#8217;s needed.                           No one has gotten to where we need to get. ASU, because                           of its history, because of its place, because of its                           orientation, has the opportunity to be different for                           the sake of having a higher impact, for the sake of                           being better teachers, for the sake of teaching what&#8217;s                           needed. I don&#8217;t mean be different for the sake                           of being different.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&#8217;ll                           use chemistry as an example. Do we really want to be                           in the business of building just another chemistry department                           so we can compare ourselves to these so called ideal                           chemistry departments that we somehow wish we were in?                           Or, do we want to build a chemistry department that                           is reflective of what we think chemistry ought to be,                           what we think this university ought to be doing in chemical                           sciences relative to where we are? That is to say, does                           place make a difference? I would suggest that place                           does make a difference. I&#8217;m not suggesting that                           the other 200 chemistry departments are meaningless.                           I am suggesting it&#8217;s time to begin thinking about                           what it is we need in our disciplines to be the kind                           of university we want to be. I would argue that we have                           a unique opportunity to transform this university into                           a learning organization, an adaptive organization, as                           opposed to a simple clone.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most                           university presidents are cloning agents who spend time                           studying what other people do, bring in people from                           other places to determine what&#8217;s excellent, weeding                           out what they think isn&#8217;t excellent, replacing                           it with what they think is excellent and creating in                           all that a free agency market for faculty, which basically                           move around the country from place to place and arbitrarily                           just fill in roles. I think there&#8217;s an opportunity                           to do something different to help this university move                           in the direction of being a learning organization. What                           is it that this community needs? What is it that this                           region needs? What kind of university will be a sustainable                           city/state here in this region? What kind of university                           will be able to meet the demands for mass education?                           It&#8217;s certainly not the model at Berkeley. It&#8217;s                           certainly not the model at Columbia. It&#8217;s got                           to be some other model, some different approach.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What                           allows us to be in an opportunity to be able to suggest                           that we can be a new kind of university? We&#8217;re                           in a place with an undone social and economic setting.                           We live on an island in some ways. We&#8217;re in an                           isolated metroplex. The social complexity of the region                           is about to increase dramatically so we have the opportunity                           to capture the transformation of America as a mechanism                           for helping to transform this university or vice versa.                           This university is young and agile. It&#8217;s not set                           in concrete. I worked for seven years to do two things                           at Columbia, just to put things in perspective. I was                           the first administrator that could actually be the driving                           force to create a new department in the arts and sciences.                           The first department since 1946 and it only took me                           seven years to do that. This was the Department of Ecology,                           Evolution and Environmental Biology. My e-mail, even                           as late as last night, was suggesting to me that I&#8217;d                           left too early to ensure the success of that new department.                           Now that&#8217;s a rigid, structured institution. The                           youth of ASU is a feature that works to our tremendous                           benefit.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The                           idea I&#8217;m working on is that ASU has the opportunity                           to be in a class of one. We have all of the features                           to be in class of one. To be a new American university.                           In the beginning of last century, 15 universities rose                           up to become the new American research universities.                           Places like Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Stanford,                           Columbia, Harvard, Chicago, MIT and Berkeley. Most of                           us still hold those universities to be the model, the                           thing we should strive for. Well, they&#8217;ve done                           a good job educating really smart people. I don&#8217;t                           know whether or not they&#8217;ve helped them, but they&#8217;ve                           done a really good job attracting and educating really                           smart people. The new American university will be one                           that embraces the educational needs of an entire population,                           not a selected piece of a population, not just the verbally                           or mathematically gifted. That new American university                           would develop an outstanding faculty and an institution                           around that entire population. The university in this                           particular model becomes more than a place or places,                           it becomes a force in the community at all levels, in                           all ways, in all places. The design elements of the                           new American university would be the following</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First,                           leverage place. Leverage where we are and whom we are                           with and the community in which we are embedded. I call                           that local engagement with global impact. Maybe ASU,                           by focusing on leveraging place, could become the driving                           force for the transformation of Phoenix to be a different                           kind of place itself. A second design element is the                           integration of knowledge in ways where whatever we&#8217;re                           doing to advance knowledge is somehow linked to societal                           transformation. Third is to focus on use inspired scholarship                           &#8211; doing something for a reason. Fourth, use of                           the university as a social incubator. We have to the                           reflect society we think we want, because we&#8217;re                           running slightly ahead of it &#8211; culturally, intellectually,                           in every possible way. angle. Another design element                           is the university working as a catalyst for addressing                           and coping with complexity. At what point will the university                           raise its hand and say it should have done something                           &#8211; we&#8217;re really quite sad that the graduation                           rate in Arizona public high schools is now under 10                           percent. The trend is losing about a point and a half                           per year at the moment. At what point do we stand up                           and say something? At what point do we become concerned                           as a group, engaged as a group? Obviously, a design                           element will be that we need to become learner focused,                           discovery oriented, creatively intensive. How we do                           that with thousands of students we have to work on.                           Think of the university as a force, not a place. Is                           university a place you go and hang out with faculty                           and then leave because you&#8217;re done? Or, is the                           university a place you go to learn how to learn and                           stay connected to your whole life? It becomes a force                           for you for your entire life. One of our design elements                           would need to be the university as an intellectual,                           and cultural wellspring. Where will the ideas come from                           in the social transformations that lie ahead? How will                           we manage the complexity that lies ahead? Lastly, a                           design element will be the concept of intellectual convergence,                           the multiplier of knowledge through inter- and trans-disciplinary                           connections. We basically need to get over the fact                           that hard, rigid structured disciplines are but one                           element of our intellectual identity. Can&#8217;t we                           have hard, rigid, structured successful disciplines                           and inter- and trans-disciplinary capacities that go                           beyond that? And can&#8217;t we be a driving force to                           help facilitate that convergence?</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This                           idea of the new American university is one that I&#8217;m                           working on. One that I need your input on. I need ideas                           from you. These are the basic design elements that I&#8217;m                           thinking about at the moment. I view this as a process,                           an interactive process. I view it as taking some time                           to think through, to proceed carefully. I&#8217;m also                           a realist. I know we have the day-to-day university                           that we have right now to run, problems to solve, money                           to raise, legislators to convince. This idea about the                           new American university is not meant to be disruptive.                           It&#8217;s meant to be directional, on the base of what                           I think is a sound, solid, capable university. These                           are the kinds of directions my thinking is going and                           where I&#8217;m going to be headed between now and November                           8, when I will be talking about this in greater detail                           in my inaugural address. </font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now                           let&#8217;s talk about the upcoming year and the fact                           that we&#8217;re reading in the newspaper that state                           has entered into a period having some difficulty predicting                           its income. There are 42 states suffering budget shortfalls                           right now and Arizona&#8217;s is far from the worst                           &#8211; It&#8217;s not even near the top. One need only                           look at California, with its $20 billion-plus shortfall.                           While that&#8217;s true, we are looking at the possibility                           that the amount of resources we were expecting from                           the state will be less than what we had budgeted for.                           We&#8217;re going to do everything we can do to try                           and mitigate this temporary state of affairs. We&#8217;ll                           our best to strategically manage this potential shortfall                           centrally as best we can with resources or cash flows                           that we have here and there to help mitigate the impact.                           We&#8217;re doing everything we can to make investments                           in faculty that have the capacity to generate new revenues                           from beyond the state. Now, that might sound unusual                           &#8211; how do you make investments at a time when you&#8217;re                           suffering shortfalls &#8211; well if you don&#8217;t                           you&#8217;re in the worst possible of all positions,                           so we&#8217;re going to continue to make investments.                           And, once we figure out the political landscape after                           the primary election and general election, we&#8217;re                           going to develop a new strategy for ASU to advance our                           agenda in the legislature, seeking investment, using                           a new kind of financial model.</font></p>                        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again,                           let me say welcome.
