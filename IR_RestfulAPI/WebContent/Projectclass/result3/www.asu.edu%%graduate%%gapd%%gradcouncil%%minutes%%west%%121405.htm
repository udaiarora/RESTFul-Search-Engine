        <br>

The council met in FAB N303C at 10:00 a.m.  In attendance were:  Joan F. Brett, Candice Bredbenner, Maria Cardelle-Elawar, 
John Greenhut, Carol Langer, Stephen Lawton, Sarah Lindquist, Julie Ramsden, Jennifer Shaffer, Marge Williams, and Suzanne Vaughan.    
Excused:  Dennis Isbell. 
<br>
<br>
The minutes from November 9, 2005 were approved.
<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       
DECISION ITEMS
<br>
       <br>
Dr. Candice Bredbenner discussed the Proposal for Course Action for the new course MAS 529 Latina/os, Schooling, and Social Inequality.  
Previously, this course has been offered as a 598 special topics course.  The MAS 529 course has been reviewed by the faculty of the 
College of Teacher Education and Leadership and they have determined that it would be an appropriate elective course for their Ed.D. 
Leadership and Innovation program.
<br>
<br>
Some of the council members questioned the grading system outlined in the proposed syllabus.   It was stated by Dr. Brett that the 
grading system used in a course, whether it is the +, - system or the straight A, B, C, etc. system is the discretion of the faculty 
member teaching the course.  The only stipulation is that the grading system used may not change during the semester. Also, there was 
some concern about the long list of required readings and the cost for the students purchasing the books.  Since the course is an 
interdisciplinary course, no one book will fulfill the course requirements.  The course is designed to show many perspectives.  
Some books will be placed on reserve in the library for students who are registered in the course.  The Proposal for Course Action 
MAS 529 was unanimously approved.
<br>
<br>
Dr. Stephen Lawton presented the Proposal for Course Action EDA 505 American Educational Systems to the members of the council.  Dr. 
Lawton stated that this course will be cross listed with the core course COE 505.  This will fulfill the state of Arizona?s requirement 
of 30 credit hours for certification in the content area of administration and supervision without increasing the credit hours for the 
M.Ed. Administration and Supervision.  Clarification regarding the semesters this course will be taught was requested.  The proposed 
EDA 505 will be taught every fall, spring, and at least one of the summer sessions.  Julie Ramsden stated that since this course is 
to be cross listed with COE 505 the title should be the same as COE 505 American Education System.  Dr. Lawton stated that they will 
make the correction in the title.  Also, since the teaching method of the proposed course is a lecture/discussion, the word ?discussion? 
should be added to the definition of teaching method.  With these minor changes, the EDA 505 course was unanimously approved by the 
council.
<br>
<br>
<br>
DISCUSSION ITEMS
<br>
<br>
The scholarships allocated to the graduate programs at the west campus for the approaching academic year (2006/2007) are to be used for 
recruiting graduate students.  The scholarships are to help attract students our graduate programs.  All graduate programs should have 
a scholarship application form on their web site for their graduate students.  The graduate academic units should have an internal 
selection process in place by the time degree applications for the fall 2006 semester begin to arrive.  The graduate academic units 
may begin submitting the names of the students they wish to award scholarships to the office of Graduate Studies as soon as they 
have made their decision.  
<br>
<br>
The office of Graduate Studies will process the awards and keep track of the number of awards remaining for each graduate program.  
On April 15 the scholarships that have not been awarded will be reclaimed by the office of Graduate Studies; and, then reallocated 
to the academic programs.  The goal this year is to award the scholarships as early as possible to attract and matriculate quality 
graduate students.  
<br>
<br>
It was stated that the scholarships (tuition waivers) are not as attractive as a Research or Teaching Assistantship.  Since a 
RA/TA offers carries with it a stipend and health insurance benefits, graduate students will usually select the program, college, or 
university that will offer them an assistantship.  The office of Graduate Studies understands the need for graduate research/teaching 
assistantships; however, funds to support an RA/TA must come from the units? budget.  Therefore, it is the decision of the Dean of 
each college to determine how their college?s budget is allocated.  
<br>
<br>
We are currently processing our graduate applications through the G-portal computer program system.  Some graduate directors stated 
that the system has the added benefit of their staff being able to see when a document arrives and what items are missing.  Therefore, 
they are able to contact prospective students in a timely manner when a credential is missing.  
<br>
<br>
There are several interdisciplinary groups on campus with the charge of defining the needs 
of future students and developing unique programs that will meet their needs.  Several new masters programs are in various stages of 
discussion and development. 
<br>
<br>
The directors of graduate programs are scheduled to meet with Karin Harbin to discuss marketing and recruiting ideas and processes.  
A communication flow will also be discussed at this meeting.  The directors of graduate programs were encouraged to bring with them 
their planned recruiting activities and sample letters to share with their colleagues.  The office of Graduate Studies will work with 
the office of Public Affairs to plan the Masters Open House on Wednesday, February 1 from 4:00 p.m. ? 7:00 p.m.   
<br>
<br>
Implementation of the new Ed.D. degree program in the College of Teacher Education and Leadership is underway.  The faculty committee 
is busy developing courses and moving them along the approval process.  The College of Teacher Education and Leadership have received 
at least 100 inquiries regarding the new doctoral program.  The director of CTEL?s graduate program is planning an information session 
for prospective students which will be held in February. 
<br>
<br>
The meeting adjourned at 11:30 a.m.
