                        <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="000000">Born 
                          with a severe form of lazy eye in both eyes, Michele 
                          Pfund had eye surgery when she was only a few months 
                          old. She underwent several more surgeries and worked 
                          through intensive therapy through her second-grade year. 
                          At an early age, Pfund learned a strong work ethic from 
                          her parents and doctors as they encouraged her through 
                          each stage of therapy. By the age of four, Pfund was 
                          reading the newspaper.<br>
                          <br>
                          Today, Pfund is doing much more than reading newspapers. 
                          This summer, she will complete work on a Ph.D. in industrial 
                          engineering. Pfund is one of the many impressive Preparing 
                          Future Faculty (PFF) fellows who will display information 
                          about their teaching projects at the annual PFF Capstone 
                          Fair on Thursday, April 25, from 2&#150;4 p.m. at the 
                          Memorial Union, Arizona Room.<br>

                          Preparing Future Faculty provides innovative training 
                          and mentoring for doctoral students preparing for faculty 
                          careers in higher education. ASU is nationally recognized 
                          as a pioneer and leader in this program. PFF requires 
                          at minimum a one-year commitment from participating 
                          doctoral students. After the first-year exploratory 
                          phase, students successfully completing the first year 
                          apply for the second-year participatory phase. Students 
                          learn about faculty roles, inclusive teaching strategies, 
                          job search techniques and engage in teaching, research 
                          and service projects with faculty mentors and students 
                          at different types of institutions.<br>
                          <br>
                          Pfund kept raising the bar of achievement in her life. 
                          She earned a B.S. in chemical engineering at Case Western 
                          Reserve University and a master's degree in industrial 
                          engineering at Purdue University. She worked for more 
                          than six years as a manufacturing and development engineer 
                          in medical device manufacturing and disease detection. 
                          Well published, she serves as editor of <i>ORMS Tomorrow,</i> 
                          the operations research professional society student 
                          journal. Pfund's research has been funded by the National 
                          Science Foundation and the U.S. Air Force. A super achiever, 
                          Pfund is convinced that her early-life trials made her 
                          stronger.<br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;My father thinks that by teaching me to work so 
                          hard to overcome my eye problems, it influenced me at 
                          an early age and affected how I approached my school 
                          work, sports practices, music lessons and the like,&quot; 
                          said Pfund, who has also competed in international piano 
                          competitions. &quot;So, while I am a straight A student 
                          and the work comes naturally to me, I do know that part 
                          of it is due to my strong work ethic. I will admit that 
                          I do have to work really hard to succeed in classes 
                          I don't particularly enjoy. That's my biggest advice 
                          to students: choose a field that you love and you will 
                          no longer have to worry about grades.&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          In her second year of PFF, Pfund worked with the Southwest 
                          Center for Education and the Natural Environment (SCENE), 
                          an organization that promotes learning about the environment 
                          through scientific discovery. Through SCENE, she worked 
                          with three Phoenix-area high school students to develop 
                          a project for the Central Arizona Regional Science and 
                          Engineering Fair, held annually in Tempe. The students&nbsp;&#151; 
                          Hong Han, Yen Yeh and Anson Wong&nbsp;&#151; placed 
                          first in the computer science competition. Yeh and Wong 
                          attend Westview High School in Avondale, and Han attends 
                          Dobson High School in Mesa.<br>
                          <br>
                          Pfund's Capstone Fair exhibit will focus on her research, 
                          teaching of the supply chain management class, coursework 
                          she developed for the Maricopa Advanced Technology Education 
                          Center and the Intel Institute and service activities 
                          with SCENE. She won the John W. Teets Outstanding Teaching 
                          Award for her work with the supply chain management 
                          course&nbsp;&#151; a course outside her own academic 
                          area. <br>
                          <br>
                          Like others involved in PFF, Pfund sees great potential 
                          for a trickle down theory in which PFF affects positive 
                          change among doctoral students, who eventually become 
                          faculty members passing what they've learned on to their 
                          own students.<br>
                          &quot;What is really important for the student is to 
                          learn the scientific method of problem solving and critical 
                          thinking,&quot; Pfund said. &quot;This is my guiding 
                          principle. I strive now to provide learning opportunities 
                          through discovery. So instead of giving a student an 
                          answer directly, I now try to ask the right questions 
                          or create the right scenarios to let the students discover 
                          the answers themselves. The benefits are much greater 
                          for both myself and the students.&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          Pfund is also mentoring undergraduate and graduate college 
                          students. &quot;Through PFF, I have learned so many 
                          skills,&quot; she said. &quot;We had a seminar on cooperative 
                          and multimedia learning in the first year that I quickly 
                          integrated into my supply chain management course. This 
                          seminar greatly improved my teaching skills and helped 
                          me reach my students more effectively. In addition, 
                          we had sessions on how to integrate research with teaching. 
                          These again trickled down into our research lab as I 
                          began mentoring both master's and undergraduate students 
                          within the Modeling and Analysis of Semiconductor Manufacturing 
                          lab. I learned how to ask effective questions so that 
                          students found the answers rather than being told the 
                          answers. PFF helped me to make this transition. My doctoral 
                          education has been greatly enriched, and through PFF 
                          I have enriched my interactions with high school students, 
                          undergraduate students and master's students.&quot; 
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          John Fowler and Matt Carlyle serve as faculty mentors 
                          for Pfund. &quot;They are incredible and have ensured 
                          that I am more of an apprentice than a doctoral student,&quot; 
                          Pfund said. &quot;They have had me teach in their classes, 
                          mentor their master's students and aid them in the management 
                          of their research projects. This combination has ensured 
                          that I am prepared for the academic job.&quot;<br>
