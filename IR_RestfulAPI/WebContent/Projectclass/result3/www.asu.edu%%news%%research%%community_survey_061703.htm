      <h2>Social survey reveals rapidly developing sense of community in fast-growing
        Phoenix </h2>
      <p>How neighborly is Phoenix? Living in a metropolis famous for its rapid
        growth and for a dynamic, transient population, how do Phoenicians feel
        about their neighbors, the neighborhood and the general metropolitan
        environment? </p>
      <p>A pilot scientific survey aimed at examining how people in Phoenix view
        their community and their environment has yielded some surprising - and
        tantalizing - results about the societal attitudes of the residents of
        America's fastest growing city.</p>
      <p>The Phoenix Area Social Survey, an interdisciplinary research project
        developed by a team of Arizona State University sociology, environmental
        science and business researchers, examines issues of community and environment
        in specific neighborhoods in Phoenix, Arizona. The study is based on
        a survey conducted in 2002 by the ASU Department of Sociology's Survey
        Research Laboratory in conjunction with the ASU Center for Environmental
        Studies.</p>
      <p>The survey examined six Phoenix neighborhoods, chosen to represent a
        range of geographic locations and socioeconomic backgrounds, and measured
        attitudes on a variety of issues, ranging from feelings about the local
        and regional community, to perspectives on the environment and the urban
        landscape.</p>
      <p>Among the intriguing results was that Phoenix's newness has not prevented
        a strong sense of community among its residents. Though nearly one-quarter
        of city residents have lived in the Valley less than five years (and
        a much larger percentage have recently moved within the Valley), residents
        rapidly develop a sense of "belonging." </p>
      <p>"High percentages of people report a sense of belonging at multiple
        geographic scales - everything from the neighborhood, to the city, to
        the Valley, to Arizona," said ASU Associate Professor of Sociology Sharon
        Harlan, the project's director. "Even though many are short-term residents
        who tend to move around a lot within the Phoenix area, they have built
        connections."</p>
      <p>The survey found overall that Phoenix residents arrive at a full sense
        of "social cohesion" - identifying with and trusting neighbors - within
        two years of moving into a neighborhood. The development of "social ties"
        - relationships and networks with neighbors - peaks at four years.</p>
      <p>"We think about strong communities growing organically - where people
        live in a neighborhood a long time, they connect with each other, and
        they build relationships, social ties, and common values," said Harlan.
        "That is what makes a healthy community over time. We are finding, at
        least in Phoenix, that it happens much faster than most of us would have
        expected."</p>
      <p>The survey found some interesting differences between neighborhoods.
        While residents of virtually all neighborhoods rated the Valley, the
        City of Phoenix and their neighborhoods as good places to live, "upper-income
        people tend to be more loyal to their neighborhoods than to their city,"
        noted Harlan. "That could be a location effect, since upper-income people
        tend to live out on the fringe. They are farther away from the city center
        and they may have a different view of the city than the middle- and lower-income
        people who live near the core." </p>
      <p>Differing worries and complaints about the environment also were expressed
        by people in the surveyed neighborhoods. </p>
      <p> People living in the higher-income neighborhoods were the most concerned
        about overcrowding, small lot sizes and land preservation, though these
        neighborhoods were located at the urban fringe where the lot sizes are
        large. Close to 35 percent of the higher-income neighborhood respondents
        thought that lot sizes in their neighborhoods were too small, as opposed
        to about five percent in the lower-income neighborhoods. </p>
      <p>Upon further investigation, the researchers discovered that homes in
        the wealthiest neighborhoods are three times larger, on average, than
        homes in the poorest neighborhoods, and they take up a much larger proportion
        of the lots. Fifty percent of higher-income respondents say that housing
        density is too high and too little land is being preserved in the Valley,
        as opposed to less than 20 percent of lower-income respondents who hold
        these contradictory views.</p>
      <p>And while all neighborhoods showed significant levels of concern about
        environmental problems such as air pollution, groundwater contamination
        and water supply, higher-income areas perceive these issues to be more
        "Valley problems," than issues that affect their own neighborhoods. Two
        to three times more lower- income respondents than higher-income respondents
        are "very concerned" with accidental industrial releases, soil contamination,
        amount of water used, and odors in their own neighborhoods. </p>
      <p>. <br>
        Some significant environmental differences between homes in lower-income
          and upper-income neighborhoods were also measured by the survey, particularly
          in landscaping trends. While 70 percent of all respondents indicated
          a preference for greenery such as "well-watered grass and trees," a
          clear difference exists between neighborhoods in where the greenery
          is put.</p>
      <p>Nearly 70 percent of higher-income respondents have desert front yards,
        as opposed to about 15 percent of lower-income respondents, who prefer
        lawns. Back yards, however, reverse the situation - only 20 percent of
        upper- and middle-income respondents have desert back yards (green "oasis"
        landscaping is the preferred option), while lower-income homes tend to
        have more desert landscaping in their back yard than front.</p>
      <p>"Part of the difference may reflect a change in fashion between newer
        and older homes, or the landscaping rules of homeowners' associations
        in the wealthier neighborhoods." said Harlan. However, this does not
        mean that upper-income residents are having an unpopular landscape style
        forced upon them. The difference between the landscape people want and
        what they have, the survey found to be affected by income level, with
        higher-income residents reportedly happier with both their front and
        back yards. </p>
      <p>The project is affiliated with the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term
        Ecological Research project, a National Science Foundation funded study.
        The multi-disciplinary research team for the Phoenix Area Social Survey
        includes Tom Rex from ASU's Center for Business Research; Diane Hope
        and Amy Nelson from ASU's Center for Environmental Studies; Andrew Kirby
        from the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at ASU West; Robert
        Bolin, Edward Hackett, Sharon Harlan and Shapard Wolf from ASU's Department
        of Sociology, and Larissa Larsen, formerly from ASU's School of Planning
        and Landscape Architecture. The project was funded by ASU's Office of
        the Vice Provost for Research, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences,
        the Center for Environmental Studies and the Department of Sociology.</p>
      <p>While a scientific survey on environmental concerns that is both neighborhood-specific
        and also citywide has never been done in the Phoenix area, Survey Research
        Laboratory Director Shapard Wolf points out that the findings are preliminary,
        due to the small number of neighborhoods surveyed. "Issues need to be
        followed further, and other questions need to be asked," he said. "Follow-up
        studies also need to be done to see if the attitudes measured change
        over time."</p>
      <p>"One use of this data would be to measure the effect of public education
        campaigns-for instance, on conserving water and energy. We need to survey
        more of the Valley to establish baseline measures of current usage, so
        that we can measure change over time. We need to find some additional
        funding to expand this project to the rest of the Valley and repeat it
        periodically," he said.</p>
