            <h1>  Gramm Leach Bliley (GLB) ACT Information Security Plan</h1>
            <p>This Information Security Plan (&ldquo;Plan&rdquo;) describes
              Arizona State University&rsquo;s safeguards to protect information
              and data in compliance (&ldquo;Protected Information&rdquo;) with
              the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, also known as
              the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 6801. These safeguards
              are provided to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Protect the security and confidentiality of Protected Information; </li>
              <li> Protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security
                or integrity of such information; and </li>
              <li> Protect against unauthorized access to or use of Protected
                Information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience
                to any customer. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This Information Security Plan also provides for mechanisms to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Identify and assess the risks that may threaten Protected
                Information maintained by Arizona State University; </li>
              <li> Designate employees responsible for coordinating the program; </li>
              <li> Design and implement a safeguards program; </li>
              <li> Manage the selection of appropriate service providers; </li>
              <li> Adjust the plan to reflect changes in technology, the sensitivity
                of Protected Information, and internal or external threats to
                information security; and </li>
              <li> Reference related policies, standards, and guidelines. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Identification and Assessment of Risks to Customer Information</h2>
            <p> Arizona State University recognizes that it has both internal
              and external risks. These risks include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Unauthorized access of Protected Information by someone other
                than the owner of the covered data and information </li>
              <li> Compromised system security as a result of system access by
                an unauthorized person </li>
              <li> Interception of data during transmission </li>
              <li> Loss of data integrity </li>
              <li> Physical loss of data in a disaster </li>
              <li> Errors introduced into the system </li>
              <li> Corruption of data or systems </li>
              <li> Unauthorized access of covered data and information by employees </li>
              <li> Unauthorized requests for covered data and information </li>
              <li> Unauthorized access through hardcopy files or reports </li>
              <li> Unauthorized transfer of covered data and information through
                third parties </li>
            </ul>
            <p> Arizona State University recognizes that this may not be a complete
              list of the risks associated with the protection of Protected Information.
              Since technology growth is not static, new risks are created regularly.
              Accordingly, the University Technology Office and the Office
              of Student Affairs will actively participate with and seek advice
              from an advisory committee made up of university representatives
              for identification of new risks. Arizona State University believes
              current safeguards used by the University Technology Office
              are reasonable and, in light of current risk assessments are sufficient
              to provide security and confidentiality to Protected Information
              maintained by the University. </p>
            <h2>Information Security Plan Coordinators</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://uto.asu.edu/mediawiki/index.php/University_Technology_Officer">University Technology Officer</a>, 
			  in consultation with an advisory committee, is responsible for the 
			  maintenance of information security and privacy. The advisory committee
              will include representatives from the departments primarily responsible
              for safeguarding Protected Information. Each department responsible
              for safeguarding Protected Information will provide an annual update
              report indicating the status of its safeguarding procedures. The
              Coordinators, in conjunction with the advisory committee, are responsible
              for assessing the risks associated with unauthorized transfers
              of Protected Information and implementing procedures to minimize
              those risks that are appropriate based upon the University&rsquo;s
              size, complexity and the nature and scope of its activities.</p>
            <h2>Design and Implementation of Safeguards Program</h2>
            <h3>Employee Management and Training</h3>
            <p>In accordance with University policies, standards, and guidelines,
              reference checking and background reviews will be conducted when
              deemed appropriate. During employee orientation, each new employee
              in departments that handle Protected Information will receive proper
              training on the importance of confidentiality of Protected Information.
              Each new employee will also be trained in the proper use of computer
              information and passwords. Further, each department responsible
              for maintaining Protected Information will provide ongoing updates
              to its staff. These training efforts should help minimize risk
              and safeguard covered data and information security.</p>
            <h3>Physical Security</h3>
            <p> Arizona State University has addressed the physical security
              of Protected Information by limiting access to only those employees
              who have a business reason to know such information and requiring
              signed acknowledgement of the requirement to keep Protected Information
              private. Existing policies establish a procedure for the prompt
              reporting of the loss or theft of Protected Information. Offices
              and storage facilities that maintain Protected Information limit
              customer access and are appropriately secured. Paper documents
              that contain Protected Information are shredded at time of disposal. </p>
            <h3>Information Systems</h3>
            <p>Information systems include network and software design, as well
              as information processing, storage, transmission, retrieval, and
              disposal. Arizona State University has policies, standards, and
              guidelines governing the use of electronic resources and firewall
              and wireless policies. Arizona State University will take reasonable
              and appropriate steps consistent with current technological developments
              to make sure that all Protected Information is secure and to safeguard
              the integrity of records in storage and transmission. Arizona State
              University will develop a plan to protect all electronic Protected
              Information by encrypting it for transit.<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong> Management of System Failures </strong></p>
            <p><strong>              </strong>The University will maintain effective systems to prevent,
              detect, and respond to attacks, intrusions and other system failures.
              Such systems may include maintaining and implementing current anti-virus
              software; checking with software vendors and others to regularly
              obtain and install patches to correct software vulnerabilities;
              maintaining appropriate filtering or firewall technologies; alerting
              those with access to covered data of threats to security; imaging
              documents and shredding paper copies; backing up data regularly
              and storing back-up information off site, as well as other reasonable
              measures to protect the integrity and safety of information systems.</p>
            <h2>Selection of Appropriate Service Providers</h2>
            <p>Due to the specialized expertise needed to design, implement,
              and service new technologies, vendors may be needed to provide
              resources that Arizona State University determines not to provide
              on its own. In the process of choosing a service provider that
              will maintain or regularly access Protected Information, the evaluation
              process shall include the ability of the service provider to safeguard
              Protected Information. Contracts with service providers may include
              the following provisions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> A stipulation that the Protected Information will be held
                in strict confidence and accessed only for the explicit business
                purpose of the contract; </li>
              <li> An assurance from the contract partner that the partner will
                protect the Protected Information it receives. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Continuing Evaluation and Adjustment</h2>
            <p>This Information Security Plan will be subject to periodic review
              and adjustment, especially when due to the constantly changing
              technology and evolving risks. The Coordinators, in consultation
              with the Office of General Counsel, will review the standards set
              forth in this policy and recommend updates and revisions as necessary.
              It may be necessary to adjust the plan to reflect changes in technology,
              the sensitivity of student/customer data and internal or external
              threats to information security.</p>
