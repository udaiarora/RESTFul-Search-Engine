To be included on a bidders list, vendors must complete a vendor registration form that describes the company and its products.<p>Buyers send solicitations to firms that have expressed an interest in supplying the university and that are likely to be competitive in the bid process.  Buyers do not send solicitations to every vendor with a registration form on file for the goods or services in the solicitation.  On the contrary, prospective suppliers who do not respond to solicitations, who are consistently the highest priced or otherwise not competitive, who have failed to perform satisfactorily in the past, who have wasted time with frivolous protests, or who have lost the confidence of user departments, are not sent solicitations.  Such prospective suppliers are eligible to submit a bid or <a href="pur004.html#Proposal">proposal</a>, but they will have to take action in order to obtain a solicitation:  by checking the public posting, by monitoring the <i>Glendale Star,</i> by subscribing to one of the electronic bid networks, or by calling the ASU Bid Line at 480/965&#150;BIDS (480/965&#150;2437).<p>To continue to receive <a href="pur004.html#Invitation to Bid (ITB)">invitations to bid</a> (ITBs), vendors must:<p><ol><li>respond consistently to quotation requests or have sales personnel regularly call on the buyer<p>and</li><p><li>perform satisfactorily on orders received as to quality, delivery, service, etc.</li></ol><p>Buyers will solicit bids from vendors registered with Purchasing and Business Services and from other sources.  No guarantee is made that every vendor will receive an ITB on every procurement.  The number of vendors solicited depends on the type and dollar amount of the procurement.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Newspaper Advertising</b></font><p>ITBs usually appear in the legal advertising section of the <i>Glendale Star</i> and may appear in the <i>Small Business Exchange,</i> <i>Arizona Informant Newspaper,</i> and <i>El Sol De Arizona.</i><p><b>Bids on Construction Projects</b><p>ITBs on construction projects are advertised at least once not less than two weeks before bid opening. In unusual circumstances, the director of Purchasing and Business Services may waive this requirement.<p><b>Bids on Services Costing $50,000 or More</b><p>ITBs on services costing $50,000 or more are advertised at least once not less than two weeks before bid opening. This requirement may be waived only through the Sole Source or the Bid Waiver process.<p><b>Bids on Capital Equipment</b><p>On occasion, ASU will advertise for bids on capital equipment.<p><b>Bids on Supplies</b><p>ASU does not advertise solicitations for supplies in print media.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Public Posting</b></font><p>A copy of each written ITB or <a href="pur004.html#Request for Proposal (RFP)">Request for Proposal</a> (RFP) is publicly posted on the bulletin board in Purchasing and Business Services.  By periodic inspection of the board, vendors may be informed of upcoming office procurements.  Vendors may request and shall receive an opportunity to bid on any ITB or RFP so posted. Solicitations are also posted on an <a href="bidboard.html">electronic bid board</a>; interested potential suppliers may download solicitations from this site.<p><img src="purhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="purhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>For information on bidding, see:<p><ol><li><a href="pur303-03.html">PUR 303&#150;03</a>, &#147;Preparation of Specifications and Response Evaluation Criteria&#148;</li><p><li><a href="pur305-01.html">PUR 305&#150;01</a>, &#147;Bidding Requirements for Procurements Costing Less than $25,000&#148;</li><p><li><a href="pur305-02.html">PUR 305&#150;02</a>, &#147;Bidding Requirements for Procurements Costing at Least $25,000 but Less than $50,000&#148;</li><p><li><a href="pur306-01.html">PUR 306&#150;01</a>, &#147;Bidding Requirements for Procurements Costing $50,000 or More&#148;</li><p><li><a href="pur306-02.html">PUR 306&#150;02</a>, &#147;Waiver of Bidding Requirements for Procurements Costing $50,000 or More&#148;</li><p><li><a href="pur501-02.html">PUR 501&#150;02</a>, &#147;Advertising for Bids&#148;<p>and</li><p><li><a href="pur501-03.html">PUR 501&#150;03</a>, &#147;Bid Security and Performance and Payment Bonds.&#148;</li></ol><p>&#160;<font color="FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">PUR</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | PUR&#160;manual&#160;<a href="pur001.html">contact</a> | Purchasing&#160;and&#160;Business&#160;Services&#160;Web&#160;<a href="purchasing.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
