      <h2>ASU West graduates give new meaning to family togetherness</h2>
      <p>        It took Ethel Short approximately a half-century longer than Leslie Short
          to earn a bachelor's degree - Ethel is 75; Leslie is 26. Considering
          that Ethel raised 10 children, worked evenings while her husband ran
          a business during the day, entered the real estate field, and successfully
          battled lymphoma a few years ago, one would be hard-pressed to criticize
        her for reaching this milestone on the same day as her granddaughter.</p>
      <p>Though
            they did not take classes together at ASU West, the grandmother/granddaughter
          team will celebrate together as fall 2003 graduates. Ethel's bachelor's
          degree is in communication studies, while Leslie is completing her
        B.A. in sociology. Approximately 50 members of the family will gather
        to celebrate
          Ethel's and Leslie's accomplishments.</p>
      <p>"My grandmother is amazing, and
          I'm proud of her," Leslie says. "She has been taking classes for as
        long as I can remember. It's wonderful
          that education is so important to her and she wants to keep learning."</p>
      <p>"If
          you want to accomplish something, you can do it if you put your mind
          to it," Ethel says of her achievement.</p>
      <p>Ethel spent many years taking community
          college courses. She earned an associate's degree from Phoenix College
          in 1975. Ethel continued to take
          what she describes as "fun" classes through the Maricopa Community
        Colleges until 2001, when she decided to pursue a bachelor's degree at
        ASU West.</p>
      <p>"I
          felt accepted by the younger students in my classes, and there were
        times when I had the opportunity to talk to my classmates about what
          it was like living here when Phoenix was a much smaller town," Ethel
          says. She speaks with pride about having recently been installed as
        one of the founding members of ASU West's newly formed chapter of Lambda
        Pi Eta, the honor society of the National Communication Association.</p>
      <p>Ethel
          and Leslie both plan to continue their education. Ethel has signed
        up for gerontology classes at ASU West. "Going to school keeps me young.
          But I'm not completely sure I want to study gerontology, since I'm
        not
          so old," she says.<br>
        Leslie, who lives in Peoria and graduated from Centennial High School,
          wants to help others and plans to attend graduate school in social
          work or public health. </p>
      <p>The Short family has additional ties to ASU. Of Ethel's
          10 children, 24 grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren (number 17
          is on the way),
        two have received degrees from ASU. </p>
      <p>The next ASU-related celebration
          will come in the spring, when Leslie's cousin, Christopher Short, graduates
          from ASU West. Christopher's sister,
          Ashley, is an ASU Main student. It's a safe bet the Short family's
        Sun Devil connections will only grow stronger in the years to come.</p>
      <p>Crum,
          with ASU West, can be reached at (602) 543-5209 or (matthew.crum@asu.edu).<br>
