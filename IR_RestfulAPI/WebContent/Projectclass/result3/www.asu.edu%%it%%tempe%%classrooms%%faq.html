<p><strong>Q: How do I contact classroom support outside of class time?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> General classroom questions can be directed to <a href="mailto:classroom.support@asu.edu">classroom.support @asu.edu</a> or by calling (480) 965-3342.</p>

<a name="anchor-ga3" id="anchor-ga3"></a> 
<p><strong>Q: What time can I get into a classroom?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Any open access classrooms is open during normal building hours. The student mediation classrooms are open one-half hour prior to a scheduled class or event and should be scheduled through <a href="scheduling/index.html">Classroom Scheduling</a>. Depending on preceding classes, we can make arrangements for you to have access to your classroom even earlier. Please <a href="about/contact/cs.html">contact us</a> ahead of time to make these arrangements.</p>

<a name="anchor-ga4" id="anchor-ga4"></a> 
<p><strong>Q: How do I learn to use the multimedia equipment available in the classroom?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>You can schedule training with a staff member anytime.

<p><strong>Q: I'm an instructor for a special event. Where can I find out more specifics about campus and the building that the class is in?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Classroom Support would be happy to answer as many questions about campus as we can. If we don't know the answers we can probably direct you to a better source of information.

<h3 class="more">Printing Questions<br /><a name="anchor-pr1" id="anchor-pr1"></a></h3>

<p><strong>Q: What do I do if I don't have any money on my Sun Card?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A Value Transfer Station (VTS) is available in the Computing Commons Atrium next to the ASU Computer Store. You can increase the balance of Sun Dollars on your Sun Card by inserting your card and $1, $5, and $10 bills into the VTS. You may also add funds to your Sun Dollars account at the Sun Card office in the Memorial Union or online at the <a href="http://www.suncard1.com" target="_blank">Sun Card Web page</a>.</p>

<a name="anchor-pr2" id="anchor-pr2"></a>
<p><strong>Q: Since I'm paying for my printing, what level of quality should I expect?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We will offer print quality sufficient to submit work to a professor at ASU free of streaks, wrinkles and other blemishes. If the print quality is below this standard, we will reprint your job free of additional charges.</p>

<a name="anchor-pr5" id="anchor-pr5"></a>
<p><strong>Q: I want to print on paper other than that provided in the classrooms. Can I do this? What will I be charged?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We provide 20lb. stock 8.5" x 11" white paper. If you would like to print to a different size paper, transparency film or other media, please ask for assistance from a classroom support staff person. User supplied media must be verified against the specifications of our printers to avoid damage. You will be charged the same per sheet fee as if you were using the supplied paper.</p>

<p><strong>Q: When do the student mediation classrooms close?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Typically, these rooms close 15 minutes after the class is over. If an instructor would like to stay later in the room, they may feel free to do so, assuming there isn't another class. Students are not allowed to remain in the room without an instructor present.</p>

<a name="anchor-ai2" id="anchor-ai2"></a> 
<p><strong>Q: Do all of the classrooms have the same schedule during finals week?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The classrooms on campus do not have the same schedule during finals week. Your classroom may be in use during your normal instructional period by another class. Your room designee can provide you with the location of your final exam.</p>

<a name="anchor-ai3" id="anchor-ai3"></a> 
<p><strong>Q: What if someone tries to use a computer in the room while I'm teaching a class?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q: Why can't my students and I have food or drink in the classroom?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We ask that you cooperate with us and not allow food or drink in the classroom in order to keep the room presentable and equipment functioning for all users.</p>
