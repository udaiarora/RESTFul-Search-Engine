        <p>Quotes re: Appraisal</p>
        <p>As you can see by these selected quotations from the interviews (and again, these are faculty engaged in research), people admit to being packrats, say that they keep everything because others lose things and need to have them re-sent, are aware that they need to keep their lab data, and correspondence regarding grants and funding. I particularly like this last one Â? "Sometimes I have a bad habit of skimming the top part and not reading the rest and just deleting it." These are busy, busy people who don't have a lot of time to spend on managing email! </p>
