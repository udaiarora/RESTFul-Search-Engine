      <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I have a dream 
        that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and 
        the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the 
        table of brotherhood.&quot; As Martin Luther King, Jr. declared these 
        prophetic words on August 28th, 1963 on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, 
        sweat trickled down his face from the sweltering heat of the summer's 
        sun, as millions of African Americans listened in silence, wondering if 
        maybe these words would one day become a reality. What they did not know 
        is that one day, they, along with their brothers, children, and parents, 
        would actually be treated as an equal, because one courageous man decided 
        to take action and speak out against something that was wrong.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My grandfather, a 
        survivor of the Holocaust, volunteers his time to speak to highschool 
        students of all ages, races, and religions. His teenage years were spent 
        in many different concentration camps, Auschwitz being one of them, where 
        hundreds of thousands of Jewish people were killed and tortured for only 
        one reason; they were Jewish. He watched as his father torturously died, 
        and then his brothers, and finally to learn that his mother was killed 
        as well. Left with only one brother, he knows it is his responsibility 
        to warn others, especially young ones of the perils that come along with 
        prejudice and hate. Although he cannot reach out to everyone in the world, 
        he knows that he has made a difference in educating Arizona's youth and 
        possibly preventing others from engaging in cruel and hateful behaviors. 
        Maybe if only someone would have stopped the Nazis and spoken out against 
        what was wrong, millions upon millions of people would not have been lost. 
        Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke out to his fellow men and soon, his dream 
        was fulfilled. If Martin Luther King had decided to go along with the 
        crowd, Negroes would still be imprisoned in the world of hatred.</font></p>
