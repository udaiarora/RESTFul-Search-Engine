               <p>     Health physics emergencies in laboratories utilizing radioactive material will usually be limited to minor spills. The potential does exist, however for emergencies involving the creation of significant radiation hazards. These incidents may be complicated by injuries to personnel.</p>

               <p> In all emergency situations the primary concern must always be the protection of personnel from radiation and non-radiation hazards. The secondary concern is to confine contamination. Medical assistance should not be withheld or delayed because of contamination of personnel by radioactive material.</p>

               <p><strong> SPILLS </strong></p>

               <ul>

                 <li> Notify all other persons in the room at once. </li>

                 <li> For liquid spills, don protective gloves and place absorbent paper on the spill. </li>

                 <li> For dry spills, don protective gloves and place lightly moistened absorbent paper on the spill, taking care not to spread contamination. </li>

                 <li> If the spill is on the skin, flush thoroughly with water. If the spill is on the clothing, discard outer clothing at once. </li>

                 <li> Notify the <strong>Office of Radiation Safety</strong> (ORS) immediately. </li>
