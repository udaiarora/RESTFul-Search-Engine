Features and capabilities of the REG, ANOVA, and GLM procedures are        included in this introduction to analyzing linear models with the SAS
System. This clearly written guide will show you how to apply the          appropriate procedure to your data analysis problems and understand PROC
GLM output. Other helpful guidelines and discussions cover the following   significant areas: multivariate linear models, lack-of-fit analysis,
covariance and heterogeneity of slopes, a classification with both crossed and nested effects, and analysis of variance for balanced data.
