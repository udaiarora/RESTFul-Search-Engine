<p><strong>NOTES ON DENNIS ERICKSON</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> Won his first 32 home games at Miami from Sept. 3, 1989 until falling to Washington on Sept. 24, 1994. Those 32 wins remain part of the longest home winning streak in college football history, as Miami won 58 straight from 1985 to 1994. Coach Erickson and his staff defeated seven ranked teams during the streak, including victories over No. 1 Notre Dame (Nov. 25, 1989), No. 2 Florida State (Oct. 6, 1990) and No. 3 Florida State (Oct. 3, 1992).</li>
  <li><img src="images/20061211_Erickson1.jpg" width="300" height="205" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Coach Erickson&rsquo;s team have finished in the Associated Press Top 25 at the end of the year six times, with Miami earning the No. 1 ranking in 1989 and 1991 and also finishing third in 1990 and 1992. The Hurricanes were No. 15 in 1993 while Oregon State climbed all the way to fourth in 2001.</li>
  <li>Has been the head coach twice in a No. 1 vs. No. 2 match up. His second ranked Hurricane squad won at top ranked Florida State, 17-16, on Nov. 16, 1991, while second-ranked Alabama topped his top-ranked Hurricanes on Jan. 1, 1993, in the Sugar Bowl.</li>
  <li>He is one of just two coaches to win Pac-10 Coach of the Year at two schools, as he shared the honor at Washington State with Larry Smith of USC in 1988 and then won it outright in 2000 while at Oregon State. ASU&rsquo;s Bruce Snyder, the 1996 winner, also won the honor in 1990 while he was at California. Coach Erickson also has been named Coach of the Year in the Big Sky and the Big East.</li>
  <li>He has posted more victories over the No. 1 ranked team (three) than eight Pac-10 schools. Arizona has done it twice, while ASU, Oregon State, Stanford, Washington and Washington State all have done it once. Cal and Oregon have never done it, while USC has done it seven times and UCLA three.</li>
  <li>Of his 18 teams, 14 have competed in postseason play and he has five bowl victories.</li>

<p><strong>WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ABOUT DENNIS ERICKSON</strong><br>
  &ldquo;Coach Erickson is a true players&rsquo; coach. You love playing for him because he relates to his players well. He is an energetic and fun guy to be around. As a player, you appreciate him as a coach.&rdquo;<br>
  ~ Ray Lewis, Baltimore Ravens<br>
  <em>Three-time All-American at the University of Miami and two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t just like Coach Erickson; I love him. The most important step in me getting to where I am now was probably him taking a chance on me at Oregon State. Most coaches won&rsquo;t take that kind of chance on a guy with just one year of eligibility. He had faith in me, and I&rsquo;ll always be grateful for that.&rdquo;<br>
    ~ Chad Johnson, Cincinnati Bengals<br>
    <em>Former Oregon State player, selected to First Team AP All-Pro and three Pro Bowl teams</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dennis Erickson is a great coach and he also has a great deal of experience. He is a good person. What I saw from him is he is a players&rsquo; coach with a personality and attitude that meshed well with his players. He is able to get the most out of his team.&rdquo;<br>
    ~ Jeff Garcia, Philadelphia Eagles<br>
    <em>Played under Erickson with the San Francisco 49ers and is a three-time Pro Bowl player</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Coach Erickson is the type of guy who strives for excellence. He expects a lot out of his players, but at the same time, he treats them like student-athletes and understands they&rsquo;re going to make mistakes. He&rsquo;s a guy who&rsquo;s big on second chances.&rdquo;<br>
    ~ Steven Jackson, St. Louis Rams<br>
    <em>Two-time All-Pac-10 Conference player at Oregon State and two-time Pac-10 rushing leader</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of all the coaches I have had, he is the only one that knows how to really relate to his players. He knows how to let players have fun, but yet have discipline. If you ever have any problems with school, football, family or whatever your problem is, you can go to Coach Erickson for help. When you go to his office, it is comfortable; you don&rsquo;t feel like an outsider. You feel like one of the family.&rdquo;<br>
    ~ Nick Barnett, Green Bay Packers<br>
    <em>Former Oregon State player, All-Pac-10 Conference selection and NFL Draft first round selection</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Coach Erickson is smart. He&rsquo;s an innovator. Offensively, he&rsquo;ll just cut you up.&rdquo;<br>
      ~ T.J. Houshmandzadeh, Cincinnati Bengals<br>
      <em>Former Oregon State player</em></p>
