Develop and fine-tune your programming skills the easy way--by example!    For beginning and intermediate users, SAS Programming by Example guides
you, with a series of annotated examples, through basic tasks to more      complex ones. Problems and solutions are provided to make the most of
the programming tools available in base SAS software. Conversational in    tone, this book is useful both as a tutorial for learning programming
and as a convenient quick-reference filled with tips and strategies for    solving your programming problems. Among the clearly explained examples
are models that show you how to build SAS data sets, use SAS functions     for data translation, program more efficiently, relate information from
multiple sources, and chart and plot data. You will also learn to work     with SAS date values, produce descriptive and summary statistics, and
write reports.
