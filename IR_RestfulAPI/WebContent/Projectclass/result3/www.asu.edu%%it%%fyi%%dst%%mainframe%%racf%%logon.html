    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The logon password, which is
    also known as the TSO password or the system access password,
    is used when you logon to TSO or submit a batch job.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Logon passwords will need to
    be changed at least every 90 days. Any new logon passwords must
    be at least 6 characters in length; the maxiumum length is 8
    characters. Passwords may contain only uppercase letters, digits,
    and national characters. (National characters are the dollar
    sign $, the at sign @, and the pound sign #.) When you change
    your logon password, you cannot change it to the current password
    or to the previous password.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Whenever you logon to TSO, the
    system will automatically prompt you to change your password
    if your password has expired, i.e., if one of the following conditions
    is true:</FONT></P>

    <UL>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">the first time you logon to
      your account</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">your password is more the 90
      days old</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">the first time you logon after
      the Computer Accounts Office resets your password (this would
      occur if you had forgotten the password and requested the Computer
      Accounts Office to reset it)</FONT>
    </UL>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is not necessary to wait for
    one of the preceding events to occur before changing your password.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Once a logon password has expired,
    you cannot successfully logon to TSO or submit a batch job until
    the password is changed. If you logon to TSO, the system will
    automatically inform you when the password has expired and will
    prompt you for a new password. If you often submit batch jobs
    to the academic MVS system from another system and do not regularly
    logon to TSO, you should be aware that batch jobs will fail if
    the password is expired at the time the batch jobs are submitted.
    (There is a way to change the logon password from a batch job
    even if the current logon password has expired. Refer to the
    RACF BATCH topic in this help facility for information on changing
    your password with a batch job.) </FONT>&nbsp;</TD>
