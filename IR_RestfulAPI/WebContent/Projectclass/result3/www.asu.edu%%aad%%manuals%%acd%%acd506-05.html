Promotion is awarded on the basis of proven excellence rather than on a lack of deficiencies.  Promotions of nontenured probationary (tenure-eligible) faculty to the ranks of associate professor or professor will be accompanied with <a href="acd002.html#tenure" target="New">tenure</a>.  Demotion does not occur.<p>The collection of supportive materials pertinent to all such decisions is the responsibility of the <a href="acd002.html#facultymember" target="New">faculty member</a>, except that the department personnel committees and the chairs collect supplementary confidential evaluation letters where required.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Instructor (ABD) to Assistant Professor</b></font><p>Change in title from &#147;instructor (ABD)&#148; (all-but-dissertation) to &#147;assistant professor&#148; is made for a person hired as an assistant professor in a tenure-eligible position but who has not finished the doctoral degree at the time of appointment, as described in <a href="acd506-02.html">ACD 506&#150;02</a>, &#147;Key Terms.&#148; Once the degree is conferred and official notification has been received by the executive vice president and provost of the university, the &#147;instructor (ABD)&#148; title is changed to &#147;assistant professor.&#148; <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Assistant Professor to Associate Professor</b></font><p>Promotion from assistant professor to associate professor will be granted if the faculty member has achieved excellence in scholarship and/or creative activity, instructional contributions, and service consistent with departmental criteria. An assistant professor whose intent is to remain at the university must apply for promotion no later than the sixth year of service as an assistant professor at ASU.  An early application is also possible.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Associate Professor to Professor</b></font><p>Promotion from associate professor to professor must be based on established departmental and college criteria. These criteria reflect a commitment to excellence whereby the faculty member&#146;s contributions to his or her discipline have generated new discoveries or models that advance the discipline and serve society.   Although there is no set time for promotion from associate professor to full professor, it would be unusual for an individual to accumulate the expected record of accomplishment recognized at the national level without working for several years at the associate level.<p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>See also:<p><ol><li><a href="acd505-02.html">ACD 505&#150;02</a>, &#147;Faculty Membership, Ranks, Titles, Appointment Categories, and Honored Positions&#148;<p>and</li><p><li><a href="acd506-03.html">ACD 506&#150;03</a>, &#147;Probationary Appointments.&#148;</li></ol><p>&#160;<p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
