Reduced in-state tuition does not apply to noncredit or correspondence courses.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Fees</b></font><p>The amount of the fee to be paid, the limit on the number of credit hours (if any), and any courses that are excluded from the reduced in-state tuition are determined by the University Registrar&#146;s Student Fee Payment Schedule for courses taken at the university. The waiving of fees under this policy does not include expenses such as library and laboratory fees, books, supplies, and other special course fees.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Taxes</b></font><p>Under current Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations, the amount of tuition reduction provided to an eligible employee or family member for education below the graduate level is not taxable. &#147;Below graduate level&#148; means enrollment in a bachelor&#146;s-level program. Eligible employees who are in a graduate-level program are exempt from tax on tuition-reduction benefits up to $5,250 per calendar year.<p>If a family member (spouse or dependent) of an eligible employee enrolls as a graduate student, the amount of the tuition discount continues to be taxable to the ASU eligible employee. If the eligible employee or family member drops a class within prescribed time limits, the taxable amount may be reduced based on the university registrar&#146;s schedule of refunds. Human Resources will notify the employee of the taxable income and appropriate federal, state, and FICA/Medicare taxes that will be withheld. If the employee remains on the university&#146;s payroll, the appropriate taxes will be withheld from future earnings. If the employee terminates from the university, the employee will receive a 1099 tax statement for the amount of the tuition discount at the end of the tax year.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Persons Eligible for Reduced Tuition</b></font><p><b>Employees, Spouses, and Dependent Children</b><p><dl><dd><b>Eligibility Dates</b></dd><p><dd>Employees are eligible for reduced in-state tuition on the first day of employment and must be in a benefits-eligible status on the first day of classes.
