<i>Abstract:</i>  New instrumental developments are described, based on STEM optics and through-the-lens electron detection, which allow scanning Auger electron microscopy (SAM) to be performed at the nanometer level. Example Auger images with 3 nm resolution are shown of silver islands deposited on Si(100). A consistent definition of SAM edge resolution is given with emphasis placed on the distinction between image and analytical resolution. The structure of ideal samples for testing resolution, at the level where localization effects may become important, is discussed.<p>
