<p>This was the first major contribution to the knowledge of plant anatomy.
Grew was able to use Robert Hook's newly invented compound microscope for
his studies. He notes in his preface that he begins his work, after an
essay on the philosophical history of plants, with observations made using
the naked eye.&nbsp; "Having thus begun with the bare eye; I next proceeded
to the use of the Microscope."&nbsp; Grew discusses the anatomy of plants,
followed by the anatomy of roots, then trunks, flowers, fruits, and seeds.&nbsp;
Then there are a series of seven lectures discussing such topics as the
nature, causes, and power of mixture; essential and marine salts of plants;
colours of plants; diversitites and causes of tasts, chiefly in plants;
and the solution of salts in water.&nbsp; There is an index of the main
subjects, followed by 82 plates of illustrations.&nbsp; Printed margin
notes within the text give the plate references.
