<P><A name="z0599118">&#13; SAS uses two interactive windowing text (nongraphics) device
drivers: a non-Extended-Data-Stream (non-EDS) driver and an Extended-Data-Stream
(EDS) driver.  An EDS device supports IBM 3270 extended attributes such as
colors and highlighting, whereas a non-EDS device does not.  Note that EDS
devices also support the non-EDS data stream. The ability to display graphics
on a 3270 terminal implies that it is an EDS device.  Examples of EDS and
non-EDS IBM terminals are </A>

<P>On non-EDS
terminals, vertical window borders occupy
three display positions on the screen: the first position for the field attribute
byte, the next position for the border character itself, and the third position
for the attribute byte for the following field.  Because a window has both
left and right vertical borders, six display positions are used by the vertical
borders. Therefore, on an 80-column non-EDS device, the maximum display/editing
area in a window is 74 columns.
<P>Vertical window borders on EDS devices occupy two display
positions: the border character and the attribute for the next field (left
vertical border), or the attribute and the border character (right vertical
border).  Therefore, on an 80-column EDS device, the maximum display/editing
area in a window is 76 columns.

<P><A name="z0599129">&#13; There are two 3270 graphics device drivers in the SAS windowing
environment: the Programmed Symbol driver and the Vector-to-Raster driver.
On terminals that support graphics, these two drivers are used to produce
graphics as well as mixed text and graphics.  Both graphics drivers communicate
with the text driver, which controls the terminal display. </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>The Programmed Symbol graphics driver uses user-definable
characters to display graphics.  A programmed symbol is a character on the
device in which certain pixels are illuminated to produce a desired shape
in a position (cell) on the display.  A loadable programmed symbol set is
a terminal character set that contains these application-defined programmed
symbols.  (The default symbol set on a device is the standard character set--that
is, those symbols that are normally displayed and that can be entered from
the keyboard.) Examples of terminals that use programmed symbols to display
graphics are the 3279G, 3290, and 3270-PC.<P>

<LI>The Vector-to-Raster graphics driver is used to
produce graphics on terminals that support graphics drawing instructions such
as MOVE and DRAW.  Examples of these devices are the 3179G/3192G and the IBM5550.
The 3179G/3192G terminals also have limited support for programmed symbol
graphics.<P>

When used with Emulus 3270 terminal emulation software, the SAS3270 device
drivers provide workstation-like capabilities that can greatly enhance SAS/GRAPH software,
as well as applications that are developed using SAS/AF software.
 These capabilities include the following: </A>
<DL>
<DT>use of local workstation memory for graphics</DT>
<DD>offers significant performance improvements
for SAS/AF applications because a local
copy of graphics is stored in the workstation memory rather than being continually
retransmitted from the mainframe.<P></DD>

<DT>color loading by RGB value</DT>
<DD>enables applications to use more colors
than just the standard 8 or 16 graphics colors that are used on a typical
3270 terminal or terminal emulator.<P></DD>

<DT>rubber-banding</DT>
<DD>enables you to create, resize, and move
objects.  For example, you can
<P>
<UL>

<LI>create or size graphics objects by dragging the
workstation mouse in the SAS/GRAPH Graphics Editor<P>

<LI>easily drag and position objects in the SAS/AF
Frame Editor<P>

<LI>rotate a plot when using SAS/INSIGHT software<P>

<LI>resize or move SAS
windows.<P>
</UL>
<P></DD>

<DT>dynamic graphics cursor shapes</DT>
<DD>enables applications to change the shape
of the graphics cursor to indicate the state of the application.  For example,
the graphics cursor typically changes shape when a user drags an object or
rotates a plot.<P></DD>

IBM 3179G, 3192G, 3472G, and 5550 terminals are all graphics terminals that
support the use of a mouse.  The IBM 3179G, 3192G, and 5550 terminals use
the three-button IBM 5277 Model 1 optical mouse, whereas the IBM 3472G terminal
uses the two-button PS/2 mouse.</A>
<P>SAS recognizes when the mouse is attached and automatically
places the graphics cursor under the control of the mouse.
<BR><H3>Using a Three-Button Mouse</H3>


<P>The IBM 5277 Model 1 optical mouse has three buttons: 
<DL>
<DT>leftmost
button</DT>
<DD>SAS uses the leftmost button as an ENTER
key.  The keyboard ENTER key is used to select menu items; to grow, shrink,
or move windows; to scroll using scroll bars, and so on. The text cursor moves
to the location of the mouse cursor whenever you press this mouse button.<P></DD>

<DT>center button</DT>
<DD>By default, SAS assigns the value of the
F15 function key to the center button.  You can use the KEYS window or the
KEYDEF command to change the definition of this button.  The button is designated
as MB2. See the help for base SAS for more information about the KEYS window
and the KEYDEF command.<P></DD>

<DT>rightmost button</DT>
<DD>The rightmost button is a reset button that
unlocks the keyboard.<P></DD>
</DL>

<P>For additional information about using a mouse, refer
to the appropriate documentation at your site.
<BR><H3>Using a Two-Button Mouse</H3>


<P>The 3472G terminal is a multiple-session graphics terminal.
 This device uses the two-button PS/2 mouse.  With the graphics cursor attached,
these buttons have the same functions as the leftmost and center buttons on
the three-button mouse.

<P><A name="z0599158">&#13;
  Depending on the type of terminal, SAS
uses either
programmed symbols or APL symbols to create window borders, scroll bars, and
widgets (radio buttons, push buttons, and check boxes).  This can cause SAS
windows to look different from terminal to terminal. </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>On devices that support programmed symbols, the
SAS windowing environment uses a predefined set of programmed symbols for
its window components.  Programmed symbols and APL symbols give window components
a different appearance. These programmed symbols are available for the four
most-common character cell sizes:  9 x 12, 9 x 14, 9 x 16, and 6 x 12.  Programmed
symbols are not used for any device that has a different character cell size
(for example, 10 x 14 on a Tektronix 4205), even though the device supports
programmed symbols. <P>

<LI>On 3270 terminals that do not support programmed
symbols, but which support the APL character set, the SAS windowing environment
uses APL symbols. APL is supported only on EDS devices, including all nongraphic
3279 and 3179 terminals, and on many PC 3270 emulators. The APL language relies
heavily on mathematical-type notation, using single-character operators in
a special character set.<P>

<P><A name="z0599164">&#13; The IBM 3290 terminal gives you the ability to change character
cell size (and therefore, to change screen resolution).  This capability is
useful if you are working with graphics, for example.</A>
<P>You use the CHARTYPE= system option to modify the character
cell size. For example, on a 3290 terminal that is configured as having 43
rows by 80 columns, CHARTYPE=1 (the default) produces a 62 x 80 display size.
<P>If you specify CHARTYPE=2, the display size will be
46 x 53.  Note that if you configure the 3290 as 62 x 160 (the maximum display
size available on the 3290), CHARTYPE=2 results in a display size of 46 x
106.  This results in a very legible and attractive windowing environment.
 See <A href="zhartype.htm">CHARTYPE=</A>
for more information about this option. 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you
are running in interactive graphics mode and you receive a message, your display
may become corrupted. To correct this and return the screen to its original
display, press ENTER in response to the SCREEN ERASURE message. Alternatively,
you can configure the 3290 as one logical terminal with a 62 x 160 character
cell size.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
