If there is a numeric character in the 71st column of a line in your EQS 
syntax file, this will turn on EQS's internal debugging message system.  
Having any characters, beyond the 70th column can result in other 
problems as well. Hence as a rule, limit the number of columns in 
the EQS syntax file to 70 columns. This way, this and other similar
problems can be avoided.
