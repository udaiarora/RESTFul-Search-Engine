If they complete their requirements in the fall, individuals may make one of two choices. They may elect to have their title changed to assistant professor during the fall semester and their salary increased by the amount designated by the university, effective as of the date of completion and prorated as of that date.  (In this case, the academic year will be considered the first year of their six-year probationary period.) They may elect to remain an instructor, with no increase in salary, for the fall semester, then elect to become an assistant professor with a base salary increase for the spring semester.  (In this case, the six-year probationary period will not begin until the fall semester after the individual&#146;s completion of the degree.) If individuals in this situation fail to complete their degree requirements within this first year, their employment may be terminated.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Duration of the Probationary Period</b></font><p>All full-time faculty appointed at the assistant professor rank have a maximum of six years in which to apply for tenure. All full-time faculty appointed at the associate professor or professor rank have a maximum of four years in which to apply for tenure. <p>Established faculty members, especially those who have had previous teaching experience and desire to be considered for tenure earlier than the date listed in their appointment letters, should consult with their unit heads and/or deans about the possibility of being reviewed and recommended for tenure prior to their final probationary year. Reviews of applications for promotion and tenure prior to the candidate&#146;s sixth year must include consideration of previous experience at ASU or in a tenure-track position at a peer institution.<p><b>Extension of the Normal Probationary Period</b><p>Untenured faculty members may request, no later than the fall semester of their fifth year (i.e., the year prior to the year their tenure decision will be made), a one-year extension of the probationary period.  If such a request is granted, the faculty member shall not be subject to additional scholarship requirements at the time of the tenure decision.  The request should be made in writing and should be forwarded through the head of the academic unit and supervising dean, who will consult with appropriate personnel committees and forward the request, with recommendations, to the campus provost, who will make the final decision.  The approval process must include an agreement for the timing of remaining probationary reviews.<p>The request for a one-year extension could be built around the following circumstances:<p><ol><li>A one-year or one-semester unpaid leave of absence granted for personal reasons and having no significant relationship to the professional activity of the faculty member may be exempted from the probationary period, if requested by the faculty member and deemed appropriate by the unit head, supervising dean, and campus provost.</li><p><li>A faculty member may request a one-year, good-cause extension of the probationary period while continuing employment.  Good cause refers to personal circumstances that are likely to interfere with a faculty member&#146;s efforts to carry on scholarship at the expected rate.  Good cause includes, but is not limited to, serious illness or other <a href="acd002.html#disability" target="New">disability</a> and exceptional <a href="acd002.html#family" target="New">family</a> care responsibilities such as pregnancy, childbirth, adoption, or being the primary caregiver of a minor <a href="acd002.html#child" target="New">child</a> or other individual who requires extraordinary care and depends upon the employee for that care.</li></ol><p>A one-year leave granted for professional reasons such as fellowships, visiting appointments, and research grants will not interrupt the sequence of probationary years.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Probationary Period for Faculty Members Who are Less than 100&#037; FTE</b></font><p>An individual working in a tenure-track position less than 100 percent FTE for one or more years may have his or her probationary period extended. In such a case, the quality of contributions should be the same as those for individuals with a regular probationary period, but the quantity of contributions should be proportional to the FTE effort.<p>At the time that approval for part-time work is given, an agreement must be drawn up and signed by the faculty member, the unit head, the supervising dean, and the campus provost stating whether the individual is working for tenure in a part-time of full-time line, the expectations for tenure and promotion, and the maximum time limit for the tenure review.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Review of Probationary Faculty </b></font><p><b>Annual Feedback on Progress Towards Tenure</b><p>The head of the academic unit, after consulting with unit faculty, is responsible for providing, at least once annually, feedback to each probationary faculty member about his or her professional development and progress towards tenure.  <p>The head of the academic unit will provide a written summary of the feedback session to the faculty member, the unit personnel committee, and the supervising dean. This feedback may occur at the same time as and be based upon the same materials submitted for the annual performance review. However, feedback on progress toward tenure for probationary faculty is distinct from the annual evaluation of performance.  The former is prospective and reflects the academic unit&#146;s estimates of future promise, whereas the annual performance review is retrospective and summative.<p>The midtenure formal, probationary review may serve the purpose of the annual feedback on progress toward tenure for the year it is scheduled. <p><b>Probationary Review</b><p>In addition to the annual feedback on progress towards tenure, all probationary faculty must receive a formal probationary review midway through their tenure period.  The purpose of the probationary review is to give faculty members multiple appraisals of their progress toward earning tenure.<p>For tenure-track assistant professors, this formal probationary review is conducted during the third year. The tenure review is conducted no later than the sixth year. <p>For nontenured associate or full professors, the probationary review is conducted in the second year. The tenure review is conducted no later than the fourth year.<p>Established faculty members who desire to be considered for tenure earlier than the date listed in their appointment letters may apply for tenure in the year of a regular probationary review.<p>Because of its purpose, the probationary review should closely resemble the actual tenure review, except that outside letters are not sought. The unit personnel committee, the unit head, the college personnel committee, and the supervising dean all review materials prepared according to instructions received from the campus provost.<p>Reviewers at each level write formal, independent assessments. These reports are forwarded to the campus provost, who makes the final decision regarding termination or retention. Copies of all reports are given to the probationary faculty member within 30 days after the campus provost notifies the supervising dean of the retention decision. <p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>Decisions of nonretention are not restricted to the years of the probationary reviews; they may be made in any year during the probationary period.</td></tr></table><p>If the tenure decision is negative the same materials may be used for the probationary review. If a faculty member receives a conditional contract, then either a probationary or tenure review must be conducted the following year so that an appraisal can be made of how well the conditions have been met.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Criteria for Retention of Probationary Faculty</b></font><p>The review must be consistent with the definitions described in <a href="acd506-02.html">ACD 506&#150;02</a>, &#147;Key Terms,&#148; and common evidentiary elements described in <a href="acd506-04.html">ACD 506&#150;04</a>, &#147;Appointments with Tenure.&#148; The criteria for retention must be analogous to those used for tenure and promotion decisions in the unit, taking into account the years in rank at ASU. <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Conclusion of the Probationary Period</b></font><p>During the final probationary year, the academic unit and/or college to which a probationary faculty member is attached must determine, according to established criteria, whether to recommend that tenure be granted to that individual.<p>For appointees who are granted tenure, the <a href="acd002.html#NoticeofAppointment" target="New">Notice of Appointment</a> for the following year and all succeeding years will be expressly &#147;with tenure&#148;; annual reappointment will only cease as provided in the university or Board of Regents&#146; policies. For appointees who are not granted tenure, the Notice of Appointment for the following year will be a terminal contract.<p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>For more information about promotion and evaluation, see:<p><ol><li><a href="acd506-05.html">ACD 506&#150;05</a>, &#147;Promotion.&#148;<p>and</li><p><li><a href="acd506-06.html">ACD 506&#150;06</a>, &#147;Evaluation for Tenure and Promotion.&#148;</li></ol><p>&#160;<p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
