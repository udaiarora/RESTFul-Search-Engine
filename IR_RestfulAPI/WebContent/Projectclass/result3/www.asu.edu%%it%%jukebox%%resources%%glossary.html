                  <p><a name="AFS">AFS</a>: Acronym for "Andrew File System", it is the location where many ASU web pages are stored.  ASURITE user directories are also located within AFS.  Technically speaking, AFS is a network filesystem which ASU servers such as general.asu.edu are "connected" to.</p>
                  <p><a name="ASURITE">ASURITE</a>: The standard account for computing services made available to ASU students, faculty, and staff. Getting an ASURITE UserID is a self-service process. There are special terminals in the Computing Commons Atrium, BAC16, Goldwater 185, and Technopolis (ASU West) that are set aside just for creating new accounts and adding new services. In most cases, you need an ASURITE UserID to be responsible for or maintain webspace at ASU.</p>
                  <p><a name="browser">browser</a>: A software program that allows you to access and navigate the graphical/interactive portion of the Internet known as the World Wide Web. Browsers come from many different companies. ASU recommends the use of Netscape Navigator 4.78 or Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or above.</p>
                  <p><a name="cyberspace">cyberspace</a>: The generic term for the Internet, usually meaning the World Wide Web. The Web is home to millions of machines "serving" out billions of webpages to users across the globe. The term "cyberspace" is usually used to help illustrate the vastness of this network of information.</p>
                  <p><a name="directory">directory</a>: With reference to the Internet, this term either means an index of items (as in an address book) or refers to a particular file on a server or your computer containing other files (like a folder). As you organized files in your webspace or on your computer's hard drive, you'll always want to pay attention to the location of files - or in other words, the "directories" they're in.</p>
                  <p><a name="domain name">domain name</a>: A domain name is the more convenient way of remembering an exact location on the Internet. Every computer on the Internet has an Internet Protocol (IP) address that stakes its place in the network. The domain name is tied to a particular IP address so it's easier to remember. It's like when a company advertises the corresponding letters of the digits in their phone number to you can remember the word or phrase and "decode" it when you're ready to dial. On the Internet, this decoding is done for you.</p>
                  <p><a name="download">download</a>: Refers to the process of transferring information (text, graphic, video, etc.) from a server on the Internet to your computer's local hard drive. Download speed usually depends on the speed of your connection to the Internet. Some files can download in a few seconds while others may take hours. Fortunately, most browsers will let you know how long what you're downloading will take to complete. Additionally, the opposite of downloading is obviously "uploading". "Uploading" refers to the process of transferring information (text, graphic, video, etc.) from your computer's local hard drive to a server on the Internet.</p>
                  <p><a name="editor">editor</a>: Usually refers to a program that helps a person design, construct, or maintain a webpage or web site. Most webpages are written in HTML, the language of the web. For many beginners, this language is confusing and hard to master. Commercial editors like PageMill, HomePage, and Netscape Composer help users to create content for their web pages easily and efficiently.</p>
                  <p><a name="flash">flash</a>: Flash is a file format used for the delivery of small, vector based images through a webpage or web site. Flash files are not comprised of pixels like GIF or JPEG images. Instead, they are created with lines and shapes and can include animation and interactivity. Viewing Flash files on the web requires the download and installation of the Flash Shockwave plug-in from the Macromedia web site at www.macromedia.com.</p>
                  <p><a name="FTP">FTP</a>: Acronym for "File Transfer Protocol", it's the process by which most files (webpages, graphics, video, etc.) are transferred to and from a server and your computer. The term "FTP" is sometimes used as a verb ("I need to FTP these files to my webspace."), and as an adjective or noun ("Why not use an FTP client for uploading these?" or "Use FTP to send me the file."). Just like you use a "browser" to explore the web, you use an FTP client (another term for software or program) to transfer files to and from your computer.</p>
                  <p><a name="GIF">GIF</a>: (Pronounced "jif" - that's right, as in the peanut butter.) Refers to a type of file format for graphics. GIF files are usually small in size and can be created by most graphics applications like Photoshop. GIF images are bitmaps (which means they're made of pixels), and have defined color indexes (which means that they have a limited number of colors - no more than 256).</p>
                  <p><a name="homepage">homepage</a>: Usually refers to the "main" or "first" webpage in your web site. Almost all web servers on campus are configured to recognize a webpage named "index.html" or "index.htm" as the homepage, or default page, of all pages in a particular directory.</p>
                  <p><a name="HTML">HTML</a>: Acronym for "Hypertext Markup Language", refers to the language which most webpages are written in. Colors, font specifications, image placement, form elements, and other layout functions of a particular webpage are written (or "coded") in HTML using commands called "tags".</p>
                  <p><a name="HTTP">HTTP</a>: Acronym for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol", usually found at the beginning of a web address. All these letters do is distinguish the address that follows "HTTP" as a web site address (as opposed to FTP, telnet, and others) for your browser.</p>
                  <p><a name="hyperlink">hyperlink</a>: Sometimes referred to as simply a "link", it the term used to describe a connection between one webpage and another.</p>
                  <p><a name="Internet">Internet</a>: The generic term for the worldwide network of computers which has grown over more than twenty years. It's a global communications network that allow people to exchange information from computer to computer.</p>
                  <p><a name="JPEG (or JPG)">JPEG (or JPG)</a>: (Pronounced "jaypeg".) Refers to a type of file format for graphics. JPEG files are usually small in size and can be created by most graphics applications like Photoshop. JPEG images are bitmaps (which means they're made of pixels), and have unlimited color palettes (which means that they can have an unlimited number of colors). However, JPEG files use a compression scheme that degrades the overall quality of the image as you try to compress it more and more.</p>
                  <p><a name="local">local</a>: Generic term relating to anything residing on your computer's hard drive or floppy disk. You'll hear phrases like "it's on your local disk" or "you're viewing these webpages locally". These mean that the files (webpages, graphics, video, etc.) you're viewing aren't on a server or even probably on the Internet for that matter - they're just on your computer and you're the only one who can see them.</p>
                  <p><a name="path">path</a>: Usually refers to the exact location of a file (webpage, graphic, etc.) on a server or your computer's hard drive. For example, on the ASU Web site, the complete path for the main menu web page is: "http://www.asu.edu/asuweb/index.html" - this would be called an "absolute" path meaning it contains the complete URL from beginning to end. Sometimes, depending on the server you're using for your webpages - "relative" paths will work. The "relative" path for the same page would simply be: "/asuweb/index.html" - the beginning slash tells the server to start from the first level (sometimes referred to as "root") of it's disk space, so it fills in the "http://www.asu.edu" for you.</p>
                  <p><a name="plug-in">plug-in</a>: In terms of the Internet, usually refers to an "add-on" piece of software that enhances the capabilities of your browser application to take advantage of special technologies available on some web sites.</p>
                  <p><a name="PPP">PPP</a>: Acronym for "Point to Point Protocol", refers to the standard by which Internet connections are maintained on computers without a direct link to the Internet, but WITH a modem and standard phone line. If you're connected to the Internet at home, you're probably connecting by way of a PPP account.</p>
                  <p><a name="Quicktime">Quicktime</a>: QuickTime is a file format used for the delivery of video, animation, and sound through a webpage or web site. QuickTime files use an excellent compression scheme which makes them ideal for web use. Viewing QuickTime files on the web requires the download and installation of the QuickTime plug-in from the Apple Computer web site at www.apple.com/quicktime - Netscape's Navigator and Communicator web browsers already include this plug-in.</p>
                  <p><a name="search engine">search engine</a>: Search engines are web sites that categorize, organize, and generally make finding things on the Internet easier for users. Popular engines like Yahoo, Infoseek, and Excite are just a few of the many sites online that help you find things online. The ASU Web also has a search engine to help find particular information on the ASU Web.</p>
                  <p><a name="server">server</a>: A server is a computer that is connected to the Internet and has software running on it which makes it "serve" out information to other users on the network. Servers come in all types - there are web servers, email servers, file servers, and more. Web servers are designed to "host" webpages for access by users all over the Internet.</p>
                  <p><a name="site">site</a>: A web site is a collection of one or more webpages. Most times, you'll hear people refer to their site as their "homepage" - this is somewhat misleading since their homepage might actually be comprised of more than one page. When you're talking about a collection of webpages in one spot, you should usually refer to them as a site.</p>
                  <p><a name="tag(s)">tag(s)</a>: Tags are the individual codes used in HTML to control colors, font specifications, image placement, form elements, and other layout functions on a webpage.</p>
                  <p><a name="telnet">telnet</a>: Refers to the process by which you can communicate between a server and your computer. The term "telnet" is sometimes used as a verb ("I need to telnet so I can check my mail."), and as an adjective or noun ("Why not use a telnet client for editing that page?" or "Use telnet to change those permissions."). Just like you use a "browser" to explore the web, you use a telnet client (another term for software or program) to communicate from your computer to a server.</p>
                  <p><a name="URL">URL</a>: Can be pronounced as "earl" or said as the letter "u", "r", "l". Acronym for "Universal Resource Locator", sometimes referred to as a netsite or web site address. When you watch TV and see a commercial with a line of text that begins with "http://" or "www.", that's a URL. When you get online, you type this URL into the box provided by most browsers to visit a particular web site. Arizona State University's URL is http://www.asu.edu/ - typing it in your browser will get you to the entrance page of the ASU Web.</p>
                  <p><a name="Virtual Include">Virtual Include</a>: An HTML file with only a portion of a complete webpage's information which is "included" into another file by way of a special line of code in the "complete" page. Many web designers like to use virtual includes since they let you keep commonly used portions of code or design of a page in ONE file... all your other webpages simply reference this file and "include" their contents into other pages. This way, when you need to make a change to a something that's in a virtual include file, you just change the ONE file, and then all the pages that reference change automatically. This concept is very similar to how some operating systems to use aliases to give a user a "bookmark" to another file.</p>
                  <p><a name="WWW (World Wide Web)">WWW (World Wide Web)</a>: The graphical, more interactive part of the Internet. The World Wide Web has been around since about 1992. Today, there are millions of web servers with billions of webpages throughout the globe.</p>
                  <p><a name="webpage">webpage</a>: An individual file that is made up of HTML code.</p>
                  <p><a name="webspace">webspace</a>: Generic term used to describe the hard drive space on a server that contains webpages and web sites (as opposed to the hard drive space that may exist on your own computer). The term "webspace" is sometimes used instead of "AFS space" - but usually mean the same thing.</p>
                  <p><a name="WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a>: Acronym for "What You See Is What You Get", refers to programs that allow you to create something in the format it will appear in when complete. This term was originally designed to describe programs which allowed a user to see things like font sizing, style, and typeface in a word processor or other desktop publishing program (in the early days of Windows and the Macintosh). Currently, this term is also used in describing certain programs' abilities to hide the HTML code that was developed while a user creates a webpage.</p>
