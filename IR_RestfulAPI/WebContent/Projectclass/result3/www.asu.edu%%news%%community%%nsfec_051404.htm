      <h2>Group targets early childhood education for Hispanics </h2>
      <p>The National Task Force on Early Childhood Education for Hispanics is being established this summer at ASU through a $400,000 grant from the Foundation for Child Development. The group will identify major educational challenges facing America 's Hispanic children, from birth through the primary grades, and make recommendations for actions. </p>
      <p>Task force members will include policymakers, practitioners, researchers and early childhood educators. Eugene E. Garcia, ASU College of Education dean and vice president for University-School Partnerships will serve as chairman of the taskforce. </p>
      <p>"The task force is being created for several reasons," Garcia says. "The research evidence indicates that the disparity in academic achievement that exists among Hispanic high school and college students compared to their white, Asian-American and African-American counterparts is heavily related to the lower levels of achievement that exist among Hispanic youngsters upon completion of third grade." </p>
      <p>"Grade three is a critical turning point in the education prospects of all children," says Ruby Takanishi, President of the Foundation for Child Development. "Results of the fourth grade testing from the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) in 2003 indicated that only 15 percent of Latinos were proficient readers. The national task force will address how these unacceptable results can be improved to assure that all Latino children are well-educated and prepared for the future." </p>
      <p>The research also suggests that dramatic differences in school readiness among Hispanic children entering kindergarten compared to white, Asian-American and African-American kindergarteners contribute to lower achievement in the primary grades among Hispanic youngsters. </p>
      <p>Additional data has revealed that Hispanic youngsters who have serious academic difficulties tend to be economically and educationally disadvantaged students. Their parents tend to have little formal <br>
  education and low incomes, and their schools typically serve high percentages of disadvantaged <br>
  students. </p>
      <p>"The circumstances of these youngsters' lives are also often complicated by the fact that a majority of disadvantaged Hispanic children are from immigrant families, which means that many are not proficient in English when they start kindergarten," Garcia says. "Clearly, there is a pressing need to improve educational outcomes for Hispanic youngsters across the early childhood years," he says. </p>
      <p>The task force will be convened for an initial period of two years that will culminate with the release of a comprehensive report on its findings and recommendations for action. </p>
      <p>The task force will address three major challenges as part of its charge. They are to: </p>
      <p>. Identify the most effective existing strategies for improving educational outcomes in the early childhood education years among Hispanic students, including determining the most effective approaches for promoting the development of infants and toddlers, preschoolers, and kindergarten through third-graders. </p>
      <p>. Determine an agenda for developing a larger set of proven early education strategies for Hispanic youth, because the existing body of proven strategies is relatively small. </p>
      <p>. Develop recommendations for policymakers, practitioners and other key parties that can help ensure that effective strategies are widely used with fidelity. </p>
      <p>Established in 1899, the Foundation for Child Development is a national private philanthropy organization dedicated to the principle that all families should have the social and material resources to raise their children to be healthy, educated and productive members of their communities. </p>
