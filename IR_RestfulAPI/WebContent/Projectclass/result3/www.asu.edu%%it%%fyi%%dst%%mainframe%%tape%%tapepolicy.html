      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A copy of the tape retention
      policy will be given to a customer anytime a Tape Volume Control
      form is filled out and turned in to the tape librarian.</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Owners of inactive tapes will
      receive a letter notifying them that their tapes have not been
      accessed for 2 years. The letter will be sent to the address
      given on the Tape Volume Control form when the tape was submitted
      to the library. A copy of the tape retention policy will be included
      with this letter.</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Inactive tapes will be placed
      in a holding area within the tape library for six months. Inactive
      tapes can be accessed in the usual way without any degradation
      of service.</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A customer may notify the tape
      librarian to retain tapes with an inactive status by providing
      a written request for a longer retention period.</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Five months after the first
      notification, customers of inactive tapes will be sent a second
      letter. This is to notify them that if the tapes are not claimed
      or requested for use in a job within 30 days, the tape will be
      placed in unsecured, off-site storage, and be destroyed after
      12 months.</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Access to tapes taken off-site
      will be provided within 48 hours of the request. A job requesting
      an off-site tape will ABEND (abnormally end) with a message from
      the operator to rerun the job after 48 hours have elapsed.</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A third notification will be
      sent to owners of tapes that have been in off-site storage for
      10 months.</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">After 12 months in off-site
      storage unclaimed tapes will be erased and discarded or used
      for other purposes.</FONT>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If a letter notifying a tape
      customer of impending action regarding the disposition of an
      inactive tape is returned with no known forwarding address, the
      tape will immediately be placed in off-site storage for 12 months.</FONT>
