      <h2>Nutrition researchers gauge the true costs of convenience meals</h2>
      <p>In a hurry and don't want to spend a lot of time preparing
            dinner? Before you reach into the freezer for the frozen entrees,
        you might want to
          consider the cost of convenience. </p>
      <p>"When you choose convenience, it comes
          with a price," says Linda Vaughan, chair of the Department of Nutrition.
          "That price can be in the higher
          costs of prepared or frozen foods, or it can be in the quality or nutritional
          value of the foods."</p>
      <p>In order to get a good handle on the additional costs
          of convenience foods, Vaughan and her students performed a systematic
          study of the time
          it took to prepare dishes traditionally and to prepare their convenience
          counterparts. They then determined the cost-per-hour equivalent the
        consumer pays for the convenience determined by the actual cost difference
        between
          the convenience and traditional foods. </p>
      <p>The products they worked with
          ranged from fruits and vegetables, to cheeses and on up the food chain
          to frozen entrees and boxed dinners. The study,
          performed at the request of the The Arizona Republic, compared 20 products
          and was done over a two-month period. It was repeated several times
        to factor out differences in the student's cooking abilities.</p>
      <p>Vaughan's group
          found that some convenience foods, like frozen pancakes, stacked up
        well when compared to pancakes made from scratch. </p>
      <p>Salad mixes
          in a bag and some processed vegetables, like pre-cut broccoli, also
        compared well. </p>
      <p>"I think bagged lettuce and salad mixes were a good
          bargain because the quality of the food was still high," she says.</p>
      <p>But with other foods, like
          sliced apples, celery, cheese sticks or shredded cheese, the high cost
          couldn't justify the time savings. </p>
      <p>"I think the
          sliced apples and celery were sort of a waste," Vaughan says. "They
        were anywhere from two- to two-and-a-half times more expensive
          and the quality was not as good as whole apples cut up by the consumer.
          Cheese sticks were three times more expensive than a block of cheese
          and it took only seconds to cut the cheese." </p>
      <p>The group determined that
          the consumer was paying the equivalent of $80 per hour for the convenience
          of buying shredded cheese, $75 per hour
          for sliced gala apples, and nearly $50 per hour for pre-cut celery. </p>
      <p>"If
          you are going to buy prepared foods, be selective because in some cases,
          like with shredded cheeses, they are greatly overpriced compared
          to just buying a block of cheese and shredding it yourself," Vaughan
          says. "But other foods, if you don't take food quality into account,
          and that's a very big if, they are very similar in terms of just raw
          costs."</p>
      <p>According to Vaughan, the processing of the frozen foods has much
          to do with the final product and the processing has a large effect
        on the
          nutritional value of your meal. Prepared dinners can be high in fat
        content and they typically are high in sodium content. </p>
      <p>Vaughan said the quality
          for many of the prepared dinners was rated as pretty low, and sometimes
          the convenience was questionable. For example,
          a frozen teriyaki dinner took 20 minutes to prepare and a teriyaki
        dinner from scratch took 30 minutes to prepare </p>
      <p>The lesson learned is that the
          consumer must consider each food or dish individually. But, Vaughan
        says, to go through and judge foods item by
          item in the grocery store is not always practical. What needs to change
          is the consumer's philosophy about convenience.</p>
      <p>"I think the best way
          in terms of nutrition and health is to simply prepare meals using basic
          foods that are quick to prepare," she says. "Rather
          than selecting bulk or frozen dinners that are supposedly convenient,
          use raw foods like chicken breasts, or loin of pork that are inherently
          quick and easy to prepare. </p>
      <p>"Just look at all the food stuffs available
          at the market and organize your meal around those 'quick to cook' foods,
          and save labor intensive
          meals for those one or two days each week when you have time to spend
          20 minutes preparing food and letting it cook for an hour," she adds. </p>
      <p>"You can get a meal on the table in 15 minutes using real foods, but
          you have to plan ahead and have the foods that are, by their nature,
          very basic," Vaughan adds. "An example might be grilled protein (meat,
          fish, poultry) and a couple of side dishes, or a meat-free meal based
          on legumes, rice or pasta. You will lower the fat and the sodium levels
        compared to what is found in convenience foods and you get higher quality."</p>
