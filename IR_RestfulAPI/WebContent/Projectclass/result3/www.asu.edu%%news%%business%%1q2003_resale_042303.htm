      <h2>First quarter 2003 resale market sets record</h2>
      <p>Despite war news and continuing economic concerns, the Greater Phoenix
        resale housing market set a record for first quarter with 15,030 recorded
        sales, according to the Arizona Real Estate Center at the W. P. Carey
        School of Business. Still, first quarter 2003 was down from the 15,780
        sales recorded in fourth quarter 2002.<br>
          <br>
          "Even though people may still lack confidence in the economy and/or
          the international situation, they appear to be confidant about the
          long-term expectations for their housing investment. Resale activity
          in the first quarter 2003 was appreciably strong," said Dr. Jay Q.
          Butler, director of the Arizona Real Estate Center. "January sales
          totaled 4,215, with 4,090 sales in February and 6,725 during a very
          strong March. The strength of the housing market - both in the number
          of sales and the strong appreciation in prices - continues to be one
          of the few bright points for the economy."</p>
      <p> "However, bear in mind that the current recorded sales activity represents
        decisions made several months ago," Butler said. "For last several months,
        the housing market has been positively reviewed as to the benefits of
        the low interest rates, rapid increase in prices and the investment opportunities.
        Further, there is increasing discussion that the housing market will
        retain its strength for 2003, even if the economy recovers with potentially
        higher interest rates."</p>
      <p>The previous record for a first quarter was set in 2001 at 13,275 recorded
        sales. First quarter 2002 fell some 600 sales below the high mark, logging
        12,655.</p>
      <p>The median home price also set a record at $148,750, topping the $147,000
        media price set in the fourth quarter 2002 and $139,700 a year ago. Since
        the Greater Phoenix area is so large, the median price can range significantly
        from $381,060 in North Scottsdale to $87,000 in the western areas of
        Phoenix, Butler explained. <br>
          <br>
          Since the resale townhouse/condominium housing sector set the record
          of 3,685 sales in second quarter 2002, it has slowly declined to 3,215
          sales for first quarter 2003. Since this market is good source of affordable
          housing and investment opportunities, the strong increase in the median
          price from last year's $94,000 to the current $101,000 could be limiting
          the market. This market can also have significant range in median prices
          from $164,800 in North Scottsdale to $85,500 in South Mesa.<br>
          <br>
          The median square footage for a single-family home recorded sold in
          first quarter 2003 was 1,640 square feet, which is larger than the
          1,610 square feet reported a year ago. In the townhouse/condominium
          sector, the median square footage was 1,185 square feet, which is larger
          than the 1,160 square feet reported a year ago. </p>
