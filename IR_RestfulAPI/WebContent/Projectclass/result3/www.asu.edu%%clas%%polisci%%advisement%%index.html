		<p>If you cannot meet with your assigned advisor, please come see <strong>Ms. Emy Matesan</strong>, the Department's walk-in advisor.</p>
		<ul class="breathe">
		  <li><em>Location</em>: COOR HALL 6694</li>
		  <li><em>Email</em>: <a href="mailto:Ioana.matesan@asu.edu">Ioana.matesan@asu.edu</a></li>
		  <li><em>Walk-in Hours</em>: Tuesdays 8:30-12 and 1-5:30		  </li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>* Please be aware that walk-in hours are to be used by students with quick questions. If your situation requires more than 10 minutes of advising, you MUST make an appointment with your advisor!</strong></p>
		
		<h4>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS</h4>
		<ol class="breathe">
		  <li>There are NO APPOINTMENTS scheduled <strong>THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF EVERY SEMESTER</strong>. Due to high volume, <strong>ALL THE ADVISORS TAKE WALK-INS ONLY</strong>. This means that for Spring 2007, there will only be walk-ins from <strong>January 16th-January 26th</strong>.</li><br />
		  <li class="push">Beginning on <strong>January 16, 2007</strong> (the first day of school), in order to meet with any academic advisor in our department, you <strong>MUST</strong> have a DARS/DARWIN report IN HAND when you come for your appointment.  If you do not have a DARS report IN HAND, you will need to reschedule your appointment.  The only exception to this rule is for brand-new ASU students.  All other students will be turned away if they do not have the DARS report with them.  Access your report at <a href= "http://www.asu.edu/interactive">http://www.asu.edu/interactive</a> Under â??Current Studentsâ?? click on â??Major Informationâ?? and follow the directions from there.</li><br />
		 
		  <li class="push">a. Ms. Emy Matesan is our new  walk-in advisor.Â  Mr. Rafael Jimeno is  the new advisor for students with last names (G-L).Â  Ms. Maria Ortuoste is no longer an academic  advisor for our department.</li>
		  <br />
		  3. b. <strong> We have changed our walk-in advising strategy</strong>. During walk-in advising, there will be a &ldquo;sign in&rdquo; sheet, in 20 minute increments. This is a <strong>&ldquo;first come, first serve&rdquo; basis</strong>. For example, let&rsquo;s say Joe Smith comes in at 9 am during walk-in advising. There are already 5 people waiting in front of him. He has a class at 9:40 and doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll be able to wait in line, or he&rsquo;ll miss class. Joe can sign up for the 11:40 slotâ??leaveâ??and then come back for his &ldquo;walk-in&rdquo; appointment. This will mitigate waiting time for students. Punctuality is key. <strong>If you are late (even a few minutes), you&rsquo;ll have to try again</strong>.</li><br/>
		  <br>
		  <li>When you enter the  department, you will see a large table on the right hand side.Â  There are many different forms/papers that  you may need.Â  Look at the forms.Â  Which form is appropriate for you?Â  Change of major?Â  DOG?Â   Take the form and start filling it out as much as you can.Â  This will help maximize efficiency during our  appointment.Â  </li><br/>
		  <li>Student responsibilities during advising appointments:
		    <ul class="bullet">
			  <li>Make informed decisions and plans for your education.</li>
			  <li>Learn the requirements for your degree. Read the relevant portions of the ASU Catalog, ASU Bulletins, and your Undergraduate Handbook.</li>
			  <li>Become familiar with the University and College of Liberal Arts and Sciences policies and procedures.</li>
			  <li>Select courses that complement your interests and career plans.</li>
			  <li>Be an active participant in the learning process.</li>

		<h4>Careers in Political Science</h4>
		<p>Sooner or later every political science major confronts the question: &quot;What can I do with a degree in Political Science?&quot; In one form or another, this same question is asked by history, English, sociology, anthropology, and other social science majors. As part of the liberal arts curriculum, these disciplines do not claim to train students for specific careers and occupations. And yet, as a result of their studies in these disciplines, students acquire a variety of skills which are essential for success in a wide range of careers and occupations.</p>
		<p>One effective answer to this question is to list some of the positions held by ASU graduates with degrees in political science. A short and very incomplete list would include:</p>
		<ul class="circle">
		  <li>Director of Undergraduate Admissions, major state university</li>
		  <li>Financial consultant and advisor</li>
		  <li>Television network news broadcaster</li>
		  <li>Political consultant, Washington, D.C.</li>
		  <li>Newspaper editorial-page columnist</li>
		  <li>Medical doctor</li>
		  <li>Television sportscaster</li>
		  <li>Dentist</li>
		  <li>Director of Water Resources for a western state</li>
		  <li>Superior Court judge</li>
		  <li>Tribal President for a Native American tribe</li>
		  <li>Budget Director for a western state</li>
		  <li>Director of Government Relations for a public utility</li>
		  <li>President of a business corporation</li>
		  <li>Owner of a private business</li>
		  <li>State legislator</li>
		  <li>Member of Congress</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>For more information about careers in political science, visit <a href="http://clas.asu.edu/students/clasworks/">CLASWorks</a> or contact Jan Pagoria, Director of CLASWorks, ASU Foundation Building, Suite 110 or call (480) 965-3819. You may also want to visit <a href="http://career.asu.edu/">Career Services</a> in the Student Services Building, Room 329 or call (480) 965-2350.</strong></p>
		<p>While the list could go on and on, it is important to keep in mind that a degree in political science prepares one for a career in a multiplicity of fields. The one common element in the above list of careers is that each occupant of the position graduated from college with a degree in political science.</p>
		<p>The reality is that a student's major is only one part of his or her education, and that the courses taken in areas other than the major will have a significant impact on what career a person pursues. Think about it: of all the courses you will take to graduate from ASU, about 25% will be in political science. So your major is only a part - albeit an essential part - of your education.</p>
		<p>It is important to realize that the professional and business world is comprised of positions occupied by people with particular skills. These range from analytical skills to computational and computer-related skills, from communication skills (both verbal and written communication) to &quot;people&quot; skills. So the real questions are: &quot;When you graduate from ASU, what skills will you have?&quot; and &quot;How can you take courses - both in your major and in other areas - that will help you develop these skills?&quot; The best time to begin thinking about these questions and developing your answers to them is in your first year in college - not a month or two before you graduate.</p>
		<p>Some of the more common career fields open to political science majors include:</p>
		<ul class="circle">
		  <li>federal bureaucracy</li>
		  <li>state and local government</li>
		  <li>legal profession</li>
		  <li>journalism</li>
		  <li>business and educational administration</li>
		  <li>higher education&#047;teaching&#047;research</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 class="normal">Federal Government</h5>
		<p>Careers within the federal government vary widely and include position such as a teacher of government in an overseas school for U.S. military children; a personnel specialist at a U.S. foreign embassy; a staff member of a Congressional committee; a staff aid to a member of Congress; a specialist in environmental protection at a regional office outside of Washington, D.C.; or an economist engaged in long range planning and resource allocation for the Department of Energy. To prepare for a job in the federal government, students should take an array of American politics courses as well as courses emphasizing research design, statistics, and computer utilization. Courses in public policy and public administration are also useful preparation for a career in the federal government. For those interested in federal government jobs overseas or that focus on relations with foreign governments and societies should also take courses in international relations and comparative politics.</p>
		<p>If you are uncertain about what kind of a government job might interest you, consider consulting the <em>U.S. Government Manual</em>, published by the U.S. Government Printing Office. The Manual is available online ASU's Hayden Library government documents section (GP 3.35:GOVMANUL). The Manual includes information about federal government departments, agencies, and offices; provides telephone numbers; and lists national, regional, and field offices. Two other useful sources published by the Congressional Quarterly are the <em>Federal Yellow Book</em> (Hayden Library reference JK6 .F45) and the <em>Washington Information Directory</em> (Hayden Library reference AS29.W37W3x). In addition, you may want to visit the <a href="http://www.usajobs.opm.gov/">web site of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management</a> for information about openings in federal agencies. Not only are job listings available, but instructions about how to apply for a federal position and other information useful for securing a federal position may be accessed on this web site. Federal government jobs listed at <a href="http://www.jobsfed.com/">http:&#047;&#047;www.jobsfed.com&#047;</a>, while the availability of federal jobs by state are listed at <a href="http://207.21.203.96/index.html">http:&#047;&#047;207.21.203.96&#047;index.html</a>. FedWorld's federal jobs locator is at <a href="http://www.fedworld.gov/jobs/jobsearch.html">http:&#047;&#047;www.fedworld.gov&#047;jobs&#047;jobsearch.html</a>. For a wider array of agencies with openings, visit <a href="http://www.jmu.edu/polisci/mpa/jobsites.htm">James Madison University's web site</a>. Another useful site with links to federal departments and agencies, the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives is: <a href="http://www.iccweb.com/">http:&#047;&#047;www.iccweb.com&#047;</a>.</p>
		<h5 class="normal">State and Local Government</h5>
		<p>State and local governments are expected to continue to expand significantly in the next century and personnel needs are likely to grow as well. Among the variety of state-level employment opportunities are: highway safety, soil conservation, consumer protection, industrial development and manpower training, water pollution, transportation licensing, intergovernmental relations and public administration, statistics&#047;data use-computer programming, urban and regional planning, housing (zoning), economic development, public safety, public welfare and community organization. In addition, as state and local governments grow so too will public and private interest groups seeking to influence government policy decisions. In preparing for a position in state and local government, students will benefit from courses in public administration, budgeting, intergovernmental relations, public policy, and in state and local government. Graduate training in public policy, public administration, and in politics coupled with courses emphasizing research design and statistical methodology will also be useful.</p>
		<p>A good place to search for a position in state or local government is the <a href="http://www.governmentjobs.com">state jobs web site</a>. Because not all states have listings at <a href="http://www.statejobs.com">http:&#047;&#047;www.statejobs.com</a>, search for a job listing in a state, county, or city of your choice by using a search engine such as http:&#047;&#047;www.profusion.com, http:&#047;&#047;www.hotbot.com&#047;, or http:&#047;&#047;www.google.com. Another potentially useful site is the <a href="http://www.multistate.com/">MultiState web site</a>, which has links to major cities, including Houston, Los Angles, Phoenix, and Seattle. If you are interested in an Arizona State government job or a position in the Phoenix metropolitan area, for example, consult <a href="http://207.21.203.96/az.html">http:&#047;&#047;207.21.203.96&#047;az.html</a> for state government positions; <a href="http://www.ci.phoenix.az.us/">http:&#047;&#047;www.ci.phoenix.az.us&#047;</a> for the City of Phoenix; <a href="http://www.tempe.gov/">http:&#047;&#047;www.tempe.gov&#047;</a>, for the City of Tempe; <a href="http://www.maricopa.gov/">http:&#047;&#047;www.maricopa.gov&#047;</a> for Maricopa County. Finally, doing an internship with a federal, state, or local agency is not only a good way to discover whether or not you want a government career, but it may also provide an entree into a position after graduation.</p>
		<p>For more information on seeking federal, state, and local government employment, consultation with the university career services office is advisable.</p>
		<h5 class="normal">Law</h5>
		<p>Although most lawyers are in private practice, many others work for large corporations, labor unions, trade associations, or for federal, state, and local government agencies. Many with legal training also pursue satisfying careers in politics, corporate management, legal publishing, public administration, and in the judiciary. A degree in political science, coupled with an emphasis on developing effective oral and written communication skills and an ability to think critically, is excellent preparation for one seeking a law degree. Pre-law students majoring in political science are encouraged to take courses in constitution law, in the law and society, and the Supreme Court. These courses not only provide an understanding of the relationship between the law and other institutions in society, but they are also useful in helping one decide whether or not to seek a career in law. You should also consult with the department's pre-law advisor, <a href="../people/hoekstra.html">Professor Valerie Hoekstra</a>, whose office is on the sixth floor of Lattie F. Coor Hall, Room 6770. You can also phone her at: 480-965-6627.</p>
		<p>Those planning to attend law school should consult <em>The Official Guide to U.S. Law Schools</em>, published each March by the Law School Admissions Council&#047;Law School Admission Services. Check the ASU bookstore for the Guide or order it from Law Services, Box 2000, Newton, PA, 18940. The <em>Guide</em> is also available at Hayden Library reference and on reserve at the Law Library (KF273 .A87).</p>
		<p>Apart from undergraduate grade point average, performance on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) is an important criterion for admissions to law school. The LSAT focuses on one's analytical and logical reasoning abilities and on reading comprehension. Consult the <em>Law Services Information Book (LSIB)</em> for information about the LSAT. The LSIB is available free of charge at most law schools and universities and may also be obtained from Law Services, Newton, PA. Law Services also publishes LSAT test preparation materials.</p>
		<p>You may also find it useful to visit various web sites with additional information on attending law school. Several places to start are: <a href="http://www.law.stetson.edu/career/handbook.htm">http:&#047;&#047;www.law.stetson.edu&#047;career&#047;handbook.htm</a>, which is Stetson University College of Law's Career Services Handbook. The Boston College Law School Locator at <a href="http://www.bc.edu/offices/careers/gradschool/law/lawlocator/">http:&#047;&#047;www.bc.edu&#047;offices&#047;careers&#047;gradschool&#047;law&#047;lawlocator&#047;</a> lists law schools by their admission standards based on a cross-tabulation of undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores. The Law School Admission Council's web page is: <a href="http://www.lsac.org/">http:&#047;&#047;www.lsac.org&#047;</a>. Also, the College of New Jersey Pre-Law web page provides information on the LSAT and other useful information about attending law school, <a href="http://fair.intrasun.tcnj.edu/index.html">http:&#047;&#047;fair.intrasun.tcnj.edu&#047;index.html</a>. Not to be overlooked is Yahoo's list of law schools at: <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Government/Law/Law_Schools/">http:&#047;&#047;dir.yahoo.com&#047;Government&#047;Law&#047;Law_Schools&#047;</a>.</p>
		<h5 class="normal">Education&#047;Teaching&#047;Research</h5>
		<p> Different levels of training are required for teaching with a political science degree at the post-secondary, secondary, and primary educational levels. Those seeking a career at the post-secondary level, which includes universities, four-year colleges, and two-year community colleges, should in most instances pursue a Ph.D. in political science. Keep in mind that universities and colleges often differ in the amount of teaching and research one is expected to do. At ASU and other major public and private universities that are considered research institutions the division of labor is (roughly) 40 percent teaching (two courses per semester), 40 percent research, and 20 percent service. At non-research institutions, such as small liberal arts colleges, more time is devoted to teaching and service and less to research. And two-year community colleges generally give heavy emphasis to teaching, with little or no emphasis on research.</p>
		<p>Teaching careers at the pre-collegiate level require students to pursue a broad-based curriculum that may include political science courses along with a wide variety of educational and social studies courses that provide a solid general education background. Often those wanting to teach social studies in secondary and primary schools are able to organize their curriculum to include a variety of political science courses that emphasize government, politics, political theory, and law. A focus on political science courses is also good preparation for pre-collegiate educational administration.</p>
		<p>The department participates with the College of Education in offering a Bachelor of Arts in Education for secondary education majors who want a focus in political science. For more information on this program, consult p. 428 in the Arizona State University General Catalog, 2000-2001 and&#047;or consult with Professor W. Thomas Keating, the Director of Undergraduate Advisement, who is located in Lattie Coor Hall Room 6698 and can be reached by phone at 480-965-1336 or by email at <a href="mailto:William.Keating@asu.edu">William.Keating@asu.edu</a>. A good way to find web sites with information on careers in education is to go to are <a href="http://www.google.com">http:&#047;&#047;www.google.com</a> and search on key words such as teaching+jobs. More specific information about job openings can sometimes be obtain by visiting the web site of a particular school or school district. The Mesa, Arizona, public school system, for example, has a web page at <a href="http://www.mpsaz.org/main2/">http:&#047;&#047;www.mpsaz.org&#047;main2&#047;</a>, as does the Maricopa County Community Colleges at <a href="http://www.maricopa.edu/">http:&#047;&#047;www.maricopa.edu&#047;</a>. Both contain information about employment opportunities. For other school web sites visit <a href="http://www.ade.state.az.us/">http:&#047;&#047;www.ade.state.az.us&#047;</a></p>
		<p>Graduates with a degree in political science, especially those who have M.A. and Ph.D. degrees, are often well trained for research positions in government agencies such as the Library of Congress, congressional and state legislative committees, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Department of Defense; or in public interest &quot;think tank&quot; organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the Brookings Institution; or in private corporations such as Booz-Allen, and Hamilton and other Washington, D.C.- based research entities popularly referred to as &quot;Beltway Bandits.&quot; Many of the &quot;think tanks&quot; are listed with a brief description at <a href="http://www.nira.go.jp/ice/">http:&#047;&#047;www.nira.go.jp&#047;ice&#047;</a>. Another &quot;think tanks&quot; listing with an indication of political ideology, publications, and goals is at <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/psthink.html">http:&#047;&#047;www.lib.umich.edu&#047;govdocs&#047;psthink.html</a>. In addition, political scientists increasingly have found positions in the area of campaign management and political polling.</p>
		<p>Students interested in a research or a campaign management career should take courses on research methodology, statistics, multivariate analysis, survey research, and research design in addition to courses in a substantive area of interest. Students should also be at ease using the Internet for research purposes. For example, one interested in doing political risk analysis in Asia should take courses in Asian languages and the politics, history, and cultures of Asia, while another interested in running a U.S. Senate campaign would structure a curriculum with an emphasis on American politics and history. Both, however, should have preparation in variety of research methodologies and technical skills.</p>
		<h5 class="normal">Journalism</h5>
		<p>Globalization has been a boon for political scientists interested in journalism and journalists interested in political affairs at home and abroad. For a political scientist interested in a career in journalism, an ability to write quickly and with clarity is a must. Preparation for seeking a job in journalism should include a variety of courses in English, journalism, communications, and in other departments that emphasize writing. Students should also look for opportunities to serve on college newspapers and&#047;or seek experience writing for local newspapers or community newsletters to gain experience in research, writing, and meeting deadlines. Political science majors should also take courses in American national, state, and local politics that provide a broad background on American society and politics as well as an array of courses in international relations and comparative politics that provide insights into foreign societies and cultures and the relations between and among nations. Courses in the areas of public administration, campaigns and elections, and public finance are also helpful.</p>

		<p>Perhaps as many as one-third of political science graduates find employment in small businesses and corporations in areas such as public relations, finance, marketing, human resources, and advertising. Increasingly, businesses must interact with governments - national, state, and local - at home and abroad. With an understanding of government, politics, and bureaucracy, coupled with good writing and analytical skills, political science graduates are well positioned to work in the business and corporate world. Moreover, just as in seeking a research career in government and the private sector, political science students interested in a career in business should structure their curriculum to include courses in math, statistics, accounting, and computer utilization. A diversity of political science courses in American politics, public administration and policy, international relations, and comparative politics are important preparation for an increasingly global business environment. In addition, students should consider taking courses that provide fluency in foreign language and an understanding of different religions and cultures. Academic work outside of political science should include courses in business, marketing, and finance.</p>
		<p>Because scores of businesses recruit on campus annually, students should visit ASU's Career Services Offices for information about business career opportunities or visit the <a href="http://career.asu.edu/">web site</a>. and the <a href="http://clas.asu.edu/students/clasworks/">College of Liberal Arts and Sciences web site</a>. In addition jobs in investment banking, international organizations, consulting, and abroad are listed at The John Hopkins University, <a href="http://www.sais-jhu.edu/studentservices/career_services/index.html">School of International Studies (SAIS) Career Services web page</a> under &quot;Useful Links&quot;</p>
