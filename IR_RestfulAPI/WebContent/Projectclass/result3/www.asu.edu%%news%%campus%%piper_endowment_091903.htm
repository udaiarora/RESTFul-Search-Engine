      <h2>ASU Creative Writing Program nets $10 million gift for center</h2>
      <p>        ASU announced this week a $10 million gift from The Virginia G. Piper
          Charitable Trust to establish the Virginia G. Piper Center for Creative
        Writing at ASU. </p>
      <p>The gift is the largest ever to a humanities program
            at ASU, and follows three other "largest ever" gifts to the university
            since January - a
          $50 million gift from William Polk Carey, on behalf of the W. P. Carey
          Foundation, to endow the W. P. Carey School of Business at ASU; a $50
          million gift from Ira Fulton to endow the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering
          at ASU; and $5 million from Fulton to the College of Education.</p>
      <p>The $10
          million for creative writing will help elevate the Creative Writing
        Program from its impressive top 20 ranking to even greater national and
          international prominence, and will help solidify metropolitan Phoenix
          as a hotbed for the art of creative writing.</p>
      <p>"The enormity of what this
          gift means for the future of ASU's creative writing program and the
        Valley's emergence as a leader in cultivating
          the arts, culture and humanities is immeasurable," said ASU President
          Michael Crow. "Our creative writing faculty ranks among the best in
        the nation, and they will use this gift to transform an already superb
        program
          into one that is an exemplar."</p>
      <p>Original literary production and publication
          have been encouraged at ASU since its beginnings. In establishing the
          Center for Creative Writing,
          the university will have a vehicle for developing and expanding innovative
          programs, including an annual writers conference, an annual distinguished
          visiting writers series, new community outreach programs and an international
          writers exchange.</p>
      <p>As part of the gift, the Virginia G. Piper Chair in
          Creative Writing is being established and will be held by Professor
        of Creative Writing
          and English Jewell Parker Rhodes, who also is named artistic director
          of the center. </p>
      <p>"Like the best poetry and prose, the Virginia G. Piper
          Center for Creative Writing will foster a deep love and appreciation
          for language and our
          common humanity," said Rhodes. "The center will be progressive, innovative,
          and inspire students and citizens of all ages. With utmost passion
        and commitment, the center will lead in the world arena. I am honored
        by
          my appointments to the Virginia G. Piper Chair and the Virginia G.
        Piper Center directorship."</p>
      <p>The Piper Trust is the largest charitable foundation
        in Arizona and is committed to improving quality of life through programs
        that support
        children, elderly, arts &amp; culture, health care and medical research,
        education, and religious organizations.</p>
      <p>"Virginia Piper was known for
          her carefully crafted prose and deep love for the written word," said
          Judy Mohraz, president and CEO of the trust.
          "She would be proud that the Piper Trust, in making this gift to ASU's
          Creative Writing Program, is advancing an art form she was passionate
          about and displayed to friends and colleagues through her own eloquently
          written letters and personal messages."</p>
      <p>David Young, dean of the College
          of Liberal Arts and Sciences, said one of his goals is for the Creative
          Writing Program to rise from its impressive
          status as a top 20 ranked program to one of the nation's elite top
        five programs.</p>
      <p>"Our program is young, vibrant and built on excellence," Young
          said. "It is poised to become a national and international leader,
        invigorating intellectual and creative activity with innovative new programs
        that
          promote the notion of the citizen-artist. The extreme generosity of
        the Piper Trust will ensure our success in taking this program to the
        top."</p>
      <p>Crow
          praised the ASU Creative Writing Program as an exceptional team of
        nationally renowned writers, poets and playwrights. </p>
      <p>Notables include
          Jewell Parker Rhodes, author of two writing texts and three novels,
        including "Douglass's Women," which has been awarded the
          PEN Oakland Josephine Miles Award, the Black Caucus of the American
        Library Award and the Before Columbus Foundation American Book Award;
        Norman
          Dubie, author of more than 20 volumes of poetry and recipient of numerous
          awards, including the 2002 PEN USA Literary Award, honoring "Mercy
        Seat," his collected poems; Alberto Rios, author of eight books of poetry,
        three
          collections of short stories, and a memoir, and a finalist last year
          for the National Book Award; and Ron Carlson, author of seven books
        and widely acclaimed by critics as a "master storyteller."</p>
      <p>Thanks to the gift,
          plans to expand ASU's creative writing faculty will move forward with
          the goal of adding depth and breadth to the program
          to bring enhanced national exposure and reputation. The faculty additions
          will allow for increased flexibility in teaching and mentoring assignments
          to help faculty balance the demands of intensive one-on-one teaching
          that characterizes the program with their need for productive, creative
        writing time.</p>
      <p>Students will benefit greatly from the gift in many ways
          as well. Dean's fellowships will be established, offering full tuition
          scholarships and
          a three-year, $20,000 per year stipend. These fellowships will enable
        the university to recruit the very best writing students in the country.</p>
      <p>Young
          said that as the ASU Creative Writing Program develops into a top-ranked
          program nationally, both the campus and the Phoenix metropolitan community
        will be enriched. </p>
      <p>"This program will go a long way in enlivening the
          local cultural and literary scene," said Young. "Our hope is that the
          Piper Center for Creative
          Writing will be the artistic and intellectual heart of a newly vibrant,
          multinational and culturally diverse world of writers, built on the
        many strengths of our program."</p>
