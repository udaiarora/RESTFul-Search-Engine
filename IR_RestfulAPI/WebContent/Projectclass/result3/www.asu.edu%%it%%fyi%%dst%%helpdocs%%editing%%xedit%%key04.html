<h3>Choose Corresponding Key</h3>

<p>The above figure assumes you chose to define the PF8 3270 key. If you 
want the pc keyboard F8 key to correspond to the PF8 key, you press the 
F8 key in response to the prompt. NOTE: Do not press any other key, 
including the enter key. After a brief pause the utility automatically 
proceeds to the next prompt.</p>

<p><em>Special note:</em> Even though you are defining the mapping for a 
terminal keyboard, you are in all likelyhood not using a real terminal. 
You are probably using the keyboard on a pc or mac which is emulating a 
terminal. Bear in mind that the vendors of the various terminal 
emulators, one of which you are using on your pc or mac, vary in how 
they map the pc/mac keyboard keys to the emulated terminal keys.</p>

<p>For example, a real vt100 terminal (a common terminal type many 
vendors have included in their emulators) has four PFx keys in the upper 
right portion of the keyboard. Some common pc keyboards have twelve Fx 
keys positioned horizontally across the top of the pc keyboard. Some 
emulators define pc keys F1-F4 to be the vt100 keys PF1-PF4; others use 
pc keys F9-F12 to correspond to vt100 keys PF1-PF4 because these pc keys 
are in nearly the same physical position as the PFx keys on a real vt100 
terminal. Additionally, some vendors have mapped the remaining pc Fx 
keys to other vt100 keys, while other vendors have chosen to disable the 
remaining pc Fx keys entirely.</p>

<p>In the latter situation, the remaining pc Fx keys cannot be remapped 
to any 3270 keys by the key utility. Pressing a disabled key in this 
instance would be exactly the same as not pressing any key; i.e., 
nothing gets transmitted from the pc to the unix system. If your 
terminal emulator is one which disables some of the pc's Fx keys, try 
setting your terminal emulator to a different terminal type, such as 
vt220 (because a real vt220 does have the additional PFx keys). If you 
do choose a different terminal type for your terminal emulator, you may 
need to change the TERM environment variable on Unix. (This is usually 
done in the ".profile" file for korn shell users or the ".login" file 
for c-shell users.)</p>
