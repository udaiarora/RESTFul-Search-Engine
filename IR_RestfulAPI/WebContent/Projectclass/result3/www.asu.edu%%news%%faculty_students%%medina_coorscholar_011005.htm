      <h2><strong>Coor Scholarship boosts first-generation student </strong></a></h2>
      <p> ASU freshman Leticia Medina has the honor of being the first recipient of the Lattie F. and Elnora W. Coor Scholarship, established by former ASU President Lattie Coor and his wife, Elva, to honor his parents. </p>
      <p> <img src="facstudents_images/Leticia-Medina.jpg" alt="Leticia Medina" width="180" height="263" align="right">Medina is the first member of her family to attend college. She started coming to the ASU campus in the eighth grade, when she and her mother became part of the ASU Hispanic Mother-Daughter Program. She learned how to set and achieve her goals, and how to prepare herself for college. Her mother learned how to assist her. </p>
      <p> Medina, who is enrolled in the Barrett Honors College as a Presidential Scholar, will receive a $5,000 award each year for four years, as well as the moral support and personal mentorship of the Coor family. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;I want to make myself, my mother, and my entire family proud of me and what I can accomplish,&rdquo; Medina says. &ldquo;I have worked very hard throughout my entire high school career and have given my best effort at everything I do. This scholarship will help me in a big way.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> Medina says she is aware of the high dropout rate among Hispanic youths, particularly females, and she wants to be a role model by continuing her involvement in the Hispanic Mother-Daughter program. She was born and reared in south Phoenix, where she graduated from Cesar Chavez High School, and she hopes to become a nurse, to provide care for other people and to achieve a career. </p>
      <p> The Coor family established the scholarship to honor their parents, who dedicated their lives to the teaching of youngsters who had limited opportunities. Lattie Coor Sr. and his wife, Elnora, spent 36 years in the small rural community of Avondale, where she taught fifth grade and he was the school superintendent. </p>
      <p align="left"> &ldquo;Their commitment was to provide every young person, regardless of background and family circumstance, the opportunity, through education, to pursue his or her dreams, no matter how ambitious and far-reaching,&rdquo; Coor says of his parents. &ldquo;In the spirit of our parents&rsquo; lifelong commitment to education, it is our hope that this scholarship will enable each recipient to realize his or her dreams for generations to come.&rdquo; </p>
