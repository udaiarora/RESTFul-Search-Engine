However, if the e-mail address is currently a personal one changing to another personal one, or if the address was incorrect (regardless of whether it was a personal or departmental address), then the requested changes are made.</p><p>Our goal is to present a professional image to the Web audience and to minimize Web updates when e-mail or Web addresses change. Therefore, departments and programs are encouraged to choose an e-mail (or Web) address that will be stable, at least for six months but preferably a year and longer.</p><p>One thing you can do is create an alias that looks like a professional or departmental address, even if it is to a personal account (similar to &#8220;web.catalogs@asu.edu&#8221; going to a personal e-mail account). If that person leaves, then the same alias can be used for the next person (if a true departmental account isn&#8217;t obtained yet for that purpose).</p><p>You can create your own alias by going to the secure site, <a href="https://www-sec.asu.edu/epo/index2.html">www-sec.asu.edu/epo/index2.html</a> to access the EPO Account Update screen. It may take a day for the created alias to take effect. </p><a name="web-addresses"></a><p><font color="maroon" size="+1"><b>Web addresses</b></font></p>It&#8217;s best to design your Web site with the idea that file names and file locations will remain stable. Renaming or moving your files and folders in your Web site changes the Web address. Whenever a file or folder name or location changes, links from other pages or sites to your file become invalid unless also changed. Some Web surfers like to type in Web addresses rather than find pages with links, so in general, a shorter Web address is better than a longer one. <a name="archived-copies-of-web-catalogs"></a><p><font color="maroon" size="+1"><b>Archived copies of Web catalogs</b></font></p><p>Current and past catalogs are on the Web in PDF and HTML formats.</p><p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/catalogs/catalog_course-archives.html">Archived copies</a> of catalogs and courses can be found from the main catalog page.<br /><br />Note that course information is now available in a <a href="https://sec.was.asu.edu/coursedb/search/index.jsp">database</a>.
