      <h2>Arizona Leading Index inches upward in February </h2>
      <p>The Bank One Arizona Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.2 percent in February to 124.2. The number compares with 123.9 for the previous month, and is 4.4 percent above the February 2003 number of 119.0 (1987 = 100). </p>
      <p>The best economic news in February was that national employment data showed their first increase in more than three years, according to Tracy Clark, associate director of the Bank One Economic Outlook Center. "The March numbers are out, and they show an even stronger jump in the number of jobs for the nation as a whole," Clark said. "However, there is a long way to go - February showed a 0.1 percent increase, and March a 0.5 percent increase, which does not compare well to the 2-plus percent annual growth of the 1990s." </p>
      <p>"The better job growth results - if they persist - will put pressure on the Federal Reserve to increase the Federal Funds rate before the end of 2004," Clark said. "The Fed has been reluctant to raise rates even though the GDP numbers have been robust. The primary reason is the weak job growth performance that has accompanied the GDP results. The Fed will want to make sure the job growth numbers hold up - but a very gradual increase in rates is more likely now than just a few months ago." </p>
      <p>Arizona has fared much better than other states all along in employment, posting year-over-year growth consistently since October of 2002. However, Clark noted, "Arizona is not without its own worries, primarily because through February the state has posted three full years of employment declines in manufacturing. Some of the job loss is the result of the weak demand for semiconductors, which has only recently reversed itself. The productivity gains, which benefited all manufacturers in the 1990s, have certainly contributed to the weak manufacturing job market. It will not be clear until later in the cycle how much of the job loss is due to outsourcing or the evaporation of some firms." </p>
      <p>Among February's Arizona Leading Index components, positive values were reported in the inflation-adjusted value of the M2 money supply, delivery times, the inflation-adjusted value of Maricopa County residential building permits and production. Employment from the Business Conditions Survey, hours worked in manufacturing, materials inventories and new orders were negative. Sensitive materials prices were neutral. </p>
