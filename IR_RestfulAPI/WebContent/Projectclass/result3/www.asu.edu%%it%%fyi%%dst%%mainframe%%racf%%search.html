FUNCTION
          5740-XXH  (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 1987

  The SEARCH command is used to obtain a list of resource names in a
  given class from the RACF data base.  You may specify AGE and VOLUME
  criteria for the resources that are to be listed, and you may
  specify that resource names which meet all criteria be put into a
  CLIST data set along with specified leading and trailing strings.

  In order to list the name of a resource which meets all the
  criteria you specify:
        - You must be the owner of the resource, have the SPECIAL,
          OPERATIONS, or AUDITOR attribute, or if you are listing
          data sets, your userid must match the first-level qualifier
          of the data set, or
        - You have group-SPECIAL, group-AUDITOR, or group-OPERATIONS
          authority in a group and (1) the resource is owned by the
          group or by a user owned by the group or (2) the resource
          is a data set profile and its high-level qualifier is the
          group name or a userid owned by the group, or
        - If you are explicitly authorized to the resource, you must
          have at least READ authority, or
        - If your current connect group is explicitly authorized to
          the resource, the authority must be at least READ, or
        - The universal access of the resource must be READ.

   DEFAULTS - CLASS(data set)
            - If both MASK and NOMASK are omitted, your userid is used
              for char1 if data sets are being searched. For other
              classes all resources will be searched.
            - LIST is the default
            - ALL is the default
   ALIAS    - SR


OPERANDS

  CLASS(profile-name-class)
      The name of the class to which the resource belongs (e.g.,
      DATASET, DASDVOL, TAPEVOL, TERMINAL, USER, GROUP).

  MASK(char1 | *,char2)
      Specifies the MASK against which entries in the RACF data base
      are compared.  To meet the MASK criteria, the name of the entry
      must begin with char1 and if char2 is provided, must contain
      this string somewhere in the name beginning after char1.  If
      char1 is *, your userid is substituted if the class is data set,
      otherwise char1 is considered to be omitted and the SEARCH for
      CHAR2 begins in position 1 of each name.

  NOMASK
      Specifies that all resources (to which you are authorized) in
      the specified classes will be selected.

  FILTER(filter-string)
      Specifies the string of characters used to search the RACF data
      base. FILTER is an alternative to MASK operand and is mutually
      exclusive to it. FILTER allows much more flexibility than MASK,
      since it allows to generalize the character string you specify
      to match multiple qualifiers or multiple characters within
      a profile name. You can also specify a character string to match
      a single character regardless of its value or search for
      a character string anywhere in a profile name.
      The following generic characters can be used:

              %    Matches any one character in the profile name,
                   including a generic character.

              *    Matches zero or more characters in the profile name.
                   For the data set profiles matches a whole qualifier
                   or the remainder of a qualifier. For the general
                   resource name matches the whole name or the
                   remainder of the name.

              **   Matches zero or more qualifiers. ** cannot be
                   mixed with other characters within a qualifier.
                   ** can only be used to search for data set
                   profiles.

  VOLUME(volume-serial...)
      If the VOLUME keyword is specified, VOLUME information will be
      listed for those data sets that meet all SEARCH criteria.  If
      the volume serial list is also provided, only data sets that
      reside on at least one of the specified volumes are listed.
      VOLUME is ignored for classes other than data set.

  AGE(days)
      Only resources which have not been referenced for more than the
      specified number of days are listed.  If CLASS(group) is
      specified, the AGE is determined from the DATE that the group
      was created.

  LIST
      Resource names that meet the selection criteria are listed at
      the terminal.  Volume information is listed for data sets if the
      VOLUME keyword is also specified.

  NOLIST
      No resource names or VOLUME information are listed at the
      terminal.

  CLIST('string1','string2')
      The CLIST operand causes a data set named userid.EXEC.RACF.CLIST
      to be created.  One record is put into the CLIST data set for
      each selected resource name.  Two quoted strings may also be
      specified.  string1 is placed directly before each selected name
      and string2 is placed directly after each name.

  ALL
      Specifies that both VSAM and non-VSAM data sets are to be
      selected.  This operand is ignored for classes other than the
      data set class.  All is the default if VSAM, non-VSAM, ALL,
      MODEL, GENERIC, and NOGENERIC are omitted.

  GENERIC
      Specifies that only generic profiles are to be selected.  this
      operand is ignored if generic command processing is inactive.

  NOGENERIC
      Specifies that only discrete profiles are to be selected.  this
      operand is ignored if generic command processing is inactive.

  VSAM
      Specifies that only VSAM data sets are to be selected.  This
      operand is ignored for classes other than the data set class.

  NONVSAM
      Specifies that only non-VSAM data sets are to be selected.  This
      operand is ignored for classes other than the data set class.

  MODEL
      Specifies that only the MODEL data set profiles are to be
      selected.  This operand is ignored for classes other than the
      data set class.

  TAPE
      Specifies that only tape data sets are to be selected.  This
      operand is ignored for classes other than data set.

  WARNING
      Specifies that only resources with the WARNING attribute are to
      be selected.  This operand is ignored when the class is
      specified as user or group.

  EXPIRES(days)
      Specifies that only tape volumes on which all data sets are
      expired, or will expire within the number of days specified, are
      to be selected.  The range of days which can specified is
      1-65533 or 99999 to find TAPEVOL profiles with data sets all of
      which will never expire.  This operand will be ignored for
      classes other than TAPEVOL.

  LEVEL(number)
      Specifies that only profiles with a value in the LEVEL field
      equal to the given LEVEL, are to be selected.  Number may be a
      value from 0 to 99.  This operand is ignored for classes other
      than data set and general resource classes.

  SECLEVEL(seclevel-name)
      Specifies that only profiles with the given security LEVEL are
      to be selected.  If SECLEVEL is specified without a
      seclevel-name, only profiles with invalid (undefined) security
      level names are selected.  This operand is ignored for classes
      other than data set, user, or a class name defined in the RACF
      class descriptor table.

  CATEGORY(category-name)
      Specifies that only profiles with the given category name are to
      be selected.  If category is specified without a category name,
      only profiles with invalid (undefined) category names are
      selected.  This operand is ignored for classes other than data
      set, user or a class name defined in the RACF class descriptor
      table.

  USER(userid)
      Specifies the user on whose behalf the SEARCH command is to be
      processed. The issuer of the SEARCH command must be authorised
      to list information about the specified user.

  ICH31001I NOT AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE SEARCH

            Explanation:  You are not defined to RACF and cannot issue
            the SEARCH command, or RACF is not active.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH31002I UNABLE TO OPEN CLIST DATA SET, COMMAND TERMINATED

            Explanation:  SEARCH command processing could not open the
            specified CLIST data set.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH31003I MASK TOO LONG, COMMAND TERMINATED

            Explanation:  The character string specified on the MASK
            operand is longer than the maximum allowable length for
            the entity name in the specified class.  For the DATASET
            class, the maximum length is 44 characters; for the
            DASDVOL and TAPEVOL classes, the maximum length is 6
            characters; and for the TERMINAL class, the maximum length
            is 8 characters.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH31004I LIST AND CLIST OMITTED, COMMAND TERMINATED

            Explanation:  CLIST must be specified on the SEARCH
            command when NOLIST is specified.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH31005I NO ENTRIES MEET SEARCH CRITERIA

            Explanation:  You do not have sufficient authority to list
            the entries in the RACF data set for the class specified
            on the command that meet the criteria specified on the
            MASK operand, or no entries exist in the class that meet
            the search criteria.

  ICH31006I CLIST DATA SET ORGANIZATION IS NOT SEQUENTIAL,
            COMMAND TERMINATED

            Explanation:  The CLIST data set found does not have
            physical sequential organization.

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.

  ICH31007I COMMAND ENDED DUE TO ERROR

            Explanation:  A RACF manager error occurred.  This message
            is accompanied by a message explaining the error.

  ICH31008I CATEGORY category-name IGNORED

            Explanation:  The user does not have sufficient authority
            to list the entries in the RACF data set for the security
            category name specified on the command, or the security
            category name does not exist.

  ICH31009I FILTER STRING LONGER THAN PROFILE NAME

            Explanation:  A filter string was specified longer than
            the maximum allowable for a profile name in that class.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31010I FILTER AND MASK BOTH SPECIFIED

            Explanation:  The FILTER operand is an alternative to the
            MASK operand; they are mutually exclusive.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31011I BLANK FOUND IN FILTER STRING

            Explanation:  The filter string cannot contain blanks.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31012I CHARACTER FOUND AFTER ** IN FILTER STRING

            Explanation:  Double asterisks must be the last
            (rightmost) characters in the filter string.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31013I INVALID LEADING CHARACTER IN FILTER STRING

            Explanation:  A character that is not considered valid was
            used to start a filter string.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31014I INVALID USE OF ** IN FILTER STRING

            Explanation:  Double asterisks can not be mixed with other
            characters within a qualifier.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31015I INVALID USE OF * IN FILTER STRING

            Explanation:  The asterisk is used incorrectly.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31016I INVALID CHARACTER IN FILTER STRING

            Explanation:  A character(s) that is not considered valid
            was specified in a filter string.  Only alphanumeric
            characters, a single asterisk (*), a double asterisk (**),
            or the percent sign (%) are allowed.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31017I FILTER QUALIFIER LENGTH INVALID FOR CLASS

            Explanation:  The specified filter string is too long.
            The filter string length must not exceed 44 characters for
            a tape or DASD data set name.  For general resource
            classes, the filter string must not exceed the length
            specified in the class descriptor table.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31018I INVALID FILTER STRING

            Explanation:  An error was detected in the specified
            filter string.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31021I NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPECIFY USER userid

            Explanation:  The issuer of the command is not authorized
            to list information about the user specified by the USER
            operand.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31022I USER userid IS NOT DEFINED TO RACF

            Explanation:  The user specified by the USER operand is
            not defined to RACF.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31023I RACINIT WAS FAILED BY THE INSTALLATION EXIT ROUTINE

            Explanation:  RACINIT processing for the user specified by
            the USER operand was failed by the installation exit
            routine.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31024I THE ACCESS OF THE SPECIFIED USER HAS BEEN REVOKED

            Explanation:  RACINIT processing for the user specified by
            the USER operand failed because the access of the user has
            been revoked.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31025I USER ACCESS TO THE DEFAULT GROUP HAS BEEN REVOKED

            Explanation:  RACINIT processing for the USER specified by
            the USER operand failed because this user's access to the
            default group has been revoked.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.

  ICH31026I UNEXPECTED RETURN CODE return-code FROM RACINIT

            Explanation:  RACINIT processing for the user specified by
            the USER operand failed with an unexpected return code.

            System Action:  RACF terminates command processing.
