<p><br>





<b>Q:</b> What does FERPA/Buckley really mean for me as a university faculty or staff member?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> You share the responsibility for protecting the privacy rights of ASU students and their records. You should become familiar with the various requirements of FERPA, a synopsis of which is available at this website: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/registrar/general/ferpa_policy.html" target="_blank">http://www.asu.edu/registrar/general/ferpa_policy.html</a>. University policy regarding the management of student records is based on this federal legislation. The penalty for inappropriate disclosure is the withdrawal of federal funding of essentially all types. The staff in the University Registrar's Office is available to provide guidance for any situation.<br>

<br>

Additional information is available at these web sites:<br>

<br>

USI 107-01 Release of Student Information: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/usi/usi107-01.html">http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/usi/usi107-01.html</a><br>

ACD 304-03  Posting of Student Grades: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-03.html" target="_blank">http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-03.html</a><br>

Office of General Counsel, Briefing Paper, Student Educational Records: FERPA <a href="http://www.asu.edu/counsel/brief/ferpa.html" target="_blank">http://www.asu.edu/counsel/brief/ferpa.html</a><br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> I have received an off-campus request for a student's information. The student does not have a "do not release" message on their record. Is it ok to release?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> You are encouraged to refer the requestor to ASU at the Tempe campus,  University Registrar's Records Information Section, either in person at the Student Services Building, SSV 144, or by telephone at (480) 965-3124. Responding to requests for student information is part of the Record's staff's assigned job responsibilities, and they are very familiar with all aspect of FERPA/Buckley, including both restrictions and exceptions.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> Why can't I post lists of students and their grades on the department bulletin board or on my web site?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> FERPA does not permit the public disclosure of personally identifiable student information. Posting grades in the manner you have described would be a violation. It is, however, permissible to post student grades if you use the methods approved by the university. For example, you may use the Posting-ID that is provided on your class rosters. Additional information is available in the Academic Affairs Policy Manual, ACD 301-04, <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-03.html" target="_blank">http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd304-03.html</a><br>

<br>

Also, with the new Rostergrades web application for posting final grades, you may not find it necessary to post final grades at all. After you have submitted grades through the web application, your students will be able to access their grades on ASU Interactive  after the next nightly processing. Finally, be certain you protect any student information you store in your web space.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> A student complained after I left a stack of graded assignments in a box outside my office door. I did this so everyone in both of my classes could pick up his or her own paper at their convenience, including those times when I am not in my office. Is this a problem?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> Yes, this is a problem. Although it may seem like a good service to your students to provide quick return of materials in this way, there is nothing to prevent anyone from inappropriately sifting through all of the papers to learn grades other than their own and possibly to obtain other students' identifying information, all of which is protected.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> To save class time, at the beginning of the semester, I like to pass a class roster around during my class, so students can check their information and confirm their registration. A colleague told me that was bad practice. Is it?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> Your colleague is correct. While there is an expectation that students may learn each others' names through the course of regular class activities through the term, official class rosters include student names and ID numbers, which may not be disclosed without the advance written consent of each individual student. A better approach would be to encourage your students to go to ASU Interactive on the web to confirm their registrations. If they have individual questions or concerns, they should contact any registration location.<br>

<br>

Note: Remind your students that official registration and signing up for a class in myASU are two separate activities. To be officially registered, they must use pre-registration,  ASU Interactive, or in-person registration and drop/add. Signing up for a class in myASU is merely giving them access to the electronic teaching environment.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> At my former institution, I had been given the assignment of writing my department's annual report. We had several top-notch students and included information about them and their accomplishments in the publicly available report. Here at ASU, I've been told I may not do so. Is that correct?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> The answer is perhaps. It would be a FERPA violation to include information about any student who has directed the university not to release their information. Additionally, without advance written consent, it would be a violation to disclose grades or performance indicators for any student. If you obtain written permission from each student, it would be permissible to include the information. The department would need to retain the written permission as documentation about the release.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> Former students frequently use my name as a reference when they are applying for a job. Are there any liabilities that I should be aware of?  Also, some of them have not discussed this with me in advance to obtain my permission, which means I am taken by surprise and am not prepared.<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> While we would prefer that students follow generally accepted protocol and ask permission in advance of using your name as a reference, you may still be able to provide assistance. First, if this is a frequent occurrence, you may wish to notify your current and future students that they need to discuss this with you in advance. Second, you should require written permission from each student who wishes to use you as a reference. For you to discuss the student and his/her performance freely, the permission needs to be worded very broadly. If the authorization is worded narrowly, be certain that you only discuss those areas which you have been given permission to disclose.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> Our department just received a subpoena for student records. What is the right way for me to respond to a subpoena, court order, or request from a law enforcement professional for student records or information?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> The Office of the University Registrar serves as Custodian of Records for the university. All requests for student information, whether by subpoena, court order, or authorization, should be sent to the University Registrar's Administrative Office for review and processing. If the request calls for more information than is available directly from the University Registrar's Office, those materials will be gathered together under the direction of the Office of General Counsel and submitted as a package in response to the request.<br>

<br>

Do not be intimidated by a badge. Refer all inquiries to the University Registrar's Office.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> Parents often inquire about their student's performance in my class. What rights do parents and spouses have in terms of access to student information?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> This can be an extremely frustrating area for parents of traditional age students, particularly if the parents are paying the bills. Nonetheless, all FERPA rights transfer from the parent to the student when the student either reaches the age of eighteen or moves into post-secondary education, regardless of age. This means that you may not discuss anything about a student with a parent or spouse, unless you have advance written consent from the student. For students who have directed the university not to release their directory information, you may not even acknowledge that the student is present at ASU. There may be an occasional exception in the case of a legitimate emergency, but in that case law enforcement personnel will be involved, and they will work through the Office of the University Registrar.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> What about writing letters of recommendation, for purposes of either future employment or admission to an advanced degree program?  What may I say or not say?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> Again, it is required that you have written authorization from the student, if you are going to discuss anything about their performance, which is likely what the recipient of your letter will be looking for. In addition, if you are writing a letter of recommendation for admission to a graduate program, you may also be shown a copy of a form the student has signed waiving his/her right to view your letter. It is good practice to copy that form and retain it for your own records, along with the student's written authorization document.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> I  serve in an advising role, and some of my students want to be advised either by mail or by e-mail. Are there any issues involved with exchanging information in these ways?  What are the differences from advising in person?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> The biggest difference is that when a student comes to your office, you will ask for picture identification, and you are unable to do that through the mail or e-mail. It is always appropriate to communicate with a student by mail, provided that you use the student's address of record with ASU, which you may find in the Student Information System.<br>

E-mail is another situation entirely. So much of our work has been improved by the use of technology, and both the ease and the speed of e-mail make it a very appealing communication choice. However, e-mail is not necessarily secure, confidential, or the appropriate communication choice. If a student insists on using e-mail, you need to obtain his/her advance, signed, written authorization to exchange information by e-mail. The document must include their understanding that they assume all risk assumed with any possible inappropriate interception of an e-mail transmission. Here is a sample on which you might want to model your form. <a href="advisingbye-mailmemo.doc">Advising by E-mail Memo.doc</a> If you do follow this approach, be certain to retain the signed authorization document in the student file.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> I believe my department/area coordinator/colleague has placed class information including names, ASU ID numbers, and grades, on the web. Although there are no links to the information, if you do a search, you can find it. What should I do?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> This should be reported to your department chair, so that the protected information can be removed from public access immediately. If that is not possible, please consult with a member of the University Registrar's administrative staff at 965-7302. 

Experience has shown that when this occurs, it is generally unintentional. Many people have the mistaken notion that if they do not provide a link to their web space, it is private. With the powerful search engines that are available today, everyone must ensure that they are using appropriate security measures when placing sensitive information on the web.<br>

ASU employees who inappropriately post student information to publicly accessible web space risk losing access to their own ASU web space.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> What do I do if a student tells me that they believe a colleague has inappropriately disclosed their student information?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> With the student's permission, you should discuss this with your colleague. If that is not possible, please consult with a member of the University Registrar's administrative staff at (480) 965-7302.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> My department maintains a separate database of all students in our major. Is there any reason to safeguard these records? <br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> Yes!  All student records that are created and/or maintained by anyone in the university are protected by FERPA in exactly the same way as the central Student Information System records are protected. This includes derived databases in academic departments, colleges, business offices, etc., as well as the Data Warehouse, Benefactor, the Retention Tool, etc.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> A student complained that I left my grade book open on my desk and he could see not only his own grades, but grades for the whole class. Isn't that getting a little picky?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> No, actually, it's not. Everyone who deals with protected student information needs to be cautious about "passive" and unintended releases of information. This includes leaving information visible on your desk or walking away from a computer screen that displays student information. We even need to be alert to where monitors are placed, so that they are not visible through a window or doorway.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> I have been told that I can release directory information. Does that mean the information that's in the university telephone book or the Alumni directory?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> Not necessarily. ASU permits release of directory information, unless a student directs us not to release. Referring a requestor to the University Registrar's Office is always appropriate in this situation. Otherwise, please go to the policy to view ASU's definition of directory information, and make your decision based on that. <br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> What do you do when you receive a request for information about a student who has directed the university not to release any information?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b>This can be very awkward. If the student has told us not to release any information, university employees may not even acknowledge that the person is or has ever been a student here. You might say, "I have no releasable information."  If the caller questions that statement, you may reiterate what you have already said; or, of course, you may refer them to the University Registrar's Office at (480) 965-3124.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> My car was just stolen along with my briefcase in which I had student exam and a diskette that included an Excel spreadsheet with this semester's grade information, including student names and ASU ID numbers. What should I do?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> ASU has a policy/procedure that must be followed when information is lost or stolen. Please go to this web page for instructions: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/usi/usi107-02.html">http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/usi/usi107-02.html</a>. The staff in the University Registrar's Administrative Office is available to provide assistance as needed.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> What is the best way to dispose of sensitive materials?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> After confirming that you are following the appropriate retention schedule, shredding is the preferred method. In addition, the university contracts with a recycling company that offers secure recycling of sensitive materials. Call Surplus Property at (480) 965-7640 for more information.<br>

<br>

<br>



<b>Q:</b> I am the faculty/staff sponsor for the local chapter of an honorary organization that is an officially registered campus group. The national chapter has asked me for a list of candidates so they can send membership invitations, but one of the criteria is a certain GPA. May I send them the list?<br>

<br>

<b>A:</b> No, it would be inappropriate to provide any information that has been sorted by GPA or any other piece of non-directory information. What you may do is send the mailing from here without providing your national office the list. 
This gives students the opportunity to self-select by responding or not responding to the invitation, and keeps ASU compliant with FERPA. 
Note that it is also inappropriate to permit any student members to have access to candidate information, if it is prepared using any non-directory information. 
Developing a list of potential candidates is not accomplished centrally. Your department or college has a Data Warehouse person who can prepare this list for you.
