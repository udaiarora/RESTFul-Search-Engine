<H4>Arizona State University Criteria Checklist for
<BR>Mathematical Studies (CS)</H4></CENTER>
<P> 
<P><U><B>Rationale and Objectives</B></U>
<P>The <B>Mathematical Studies</B> requirement is intended to ensure that students have skill in basic mathematics, can use mathematical analysis in their chosen fields, and can understand how computers can make mathematical analysis more powerful and efficient.  The <B>Mathematical Studies</B> requirement is completed by satisfying both the <B>Mathematics (MA)</B> requirement and the <B>Computer/Statistics/Quantitative Applications (CS)</B> requirement explained below.

<P>The <B>Mathematics (MA)</B> requirement, which ensures the acquisition of essential skill in basic mathematics, requires the student to complete a course in College Mathematics, College Algebra, or Precalculus, or demonstrate a higher level of skill by completing a mathematics course for which any of the first three courses in a prerequisite.

<P>The <B>Computer/Statistics/Quantitative Applications (CS)</B> requirement, which ensures skill in real world problem solving and analysis, requires the student to complete a course that uses some combination of computers, statistics, and mathematics.

<P>Approved:  Feb. 2000
