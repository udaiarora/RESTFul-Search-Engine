Where does the output give fewer indices in 5.1 than in 5.6?

<p> 
Question:<br>
When I run my EQS program in version 5.1, I receive fewer indices than in 
version 5.6.  I am particularly interested in RMR or the Standardized RMR or
the RMSEA.  What might be the problem?
<p>
Response:<br>
Since version 5.1 was developed before 5.6, these indices are not part of 
that version but were added in 5.6.
