            LIST's Newsletter<br>
            January, 2004</p>
          <div align="left">
            <h3><br>
              Project Updates</h3>
            <p> LIST has the following improvements in progress: </p>
          </div>
          <p align="left">&middot; The wireless Ethernet network for coverage 
            of Hayden Library's lower &amp; upper concourse, C6, and C6 West is 
            scheduled for completion by January 29th.<br>
            &middot; The C6 West Classroom project should be ready for use by 
            mid-February. There had been a delay due to the availability of the 
            LCD projector and the fact that the classroom workstations are dependent 
            on the wireless Ethernet system, which is in the process of being 
            completed.<br>
            &middot; The public workstation project in the lower concourse area 
            (across from the Reference Desk) will begin again in March with the 
            addition of 10 new computers and 5 new Falcon tables. The project 
            will be scheduled once the tables are shipped and delivered from Falcon. 
            In order to minimize any disruption caused by the placement of the 
            tables and the installation of new Ethernet lines and AC power to 
            them, the project may be scheduled to begin over Spring Break in mid-March.</p>

            Video Courses Online Returns after Successful Fall Debut</h3>
          <div align="left"> LIST&#8217;s first semester offering Distance Learning 
            courses online in streaming digital video was a huge success! We provided 
            39 classes and over 1600 course units to about 2,100 students, and 
            the videos were viewed more than 59,000 times. A new semester of Video 
            Courses Online is now underway. Although we will be streaming only 
            16 courses this time, we expect the number of viewings to drop only 
            slightly because the remaining courses accounted for the majority 
            of hits last semester. Two additions include the Women and Social 
            Action course (WST 294) and Introduction to Parenting (FAS 301). These 
            two classes were formerly held on reserve and their inclusion in Video 
            Courses Online frees up additional shelf space and reduces checkout 
            time for Access Services. <br>

            Off Campus Access Page Improvements</h3>
          <div align="left">The web team has updated the off campus access page

            and made it easier for students to get help with authentication problems. 
            Outdated troubleshooting information has been removed, and the new 
            page now provides contact information for the Circulation desk and 
            a link to help in setting a PIN. Error screens have also been made 
            more user-friendly. </div>

          <p align="left"> <em>Please send questions on any library technology 
            topic to Heather Knowles to be answered in future columns.</em></p>
          <p align="left"><strong>Q. <em>&quot;Is there any way to keep spam out 
            of my inbox?&quot;</em></strong></p>
          <div align="left">
            <p><strong>A.</strong> Once you start getting inundated with spam, 
              the game is over, short of changing your email address (see the 
              September issue of <a href="sept03.htm">We're Listening</a>). All 
              you can do is use anti-spam software or the Outlook Rules Wizard 
              to help you sort it out and make it easier to delete. But if you&#8217;re 
              still relatively spam-free, here are some tips that might help you 
              stay that way: </p>
            <p>1. Opt out of receiving newsletters, email updates, etc., from 
              websites. On some sites YES is automatically selected and you have 
              to uncheck it; on others you have to click to say NO. If you don&#8217;t 
              want to opt out, provide a non-ASU email address (see #3 below). 
              <br>
              <br>
              2. Be careful when downloading and installing utilities such as 
              Hotbar, the Google toolbar, etc. While these can be useful tools, 
              you may be inadvertently agreeing to receive spam or pop-up ads. 
              Look carefully at all the options presented and uncheck anything 
              offering to install enhanced features or to send you notification 
              of special offers, etc. <br>
              <br>
              3. Set up a separate email account on Yahoo, Hotmail, or some other 
              free email site, and use it when you need to provide an email address 
              in order to receive a service, place an order, or to have a password 
              or other information sent to you for access. While this email address 
              will be available to most spammers, there will usually be a &#8220;bulk&#8221; 
              mailbox to accumulate the spam, which can then be deleted with a 
              couple of mouse clicks. Be aware, however, that you must check this 
              mail account periodically, sometimes as often as every 30 days, 
              or the account will be closed. Use your regular email address only 
              for trusted entities with whom you may need to communicate, such 
              as your bank or credit card company. <br>
              <br>
              4. Never reply to spam messages. This simply confirms that your 
              email address is valid, and may increase the amount of spam you 
              receive. <br>
              If you&#8217;re thinking the new federal &#8220;Can Spam&#8221; 
              law will help, don&#8217;t count on it. Some analysts believe the 
              net result will be more spam. According to Scott Hazen Mueller, 
              CAUCE Chairman (<a href="http://www.cauce.org/">http://www.cauce.org/</a>), 
              &#8220;This bill does not stop a single spam from being sent&#8230;.[W]e 
              have no faith that this law will significantly reduce the amount 
              of spam that American Internet users receive.'' <br>
              <br>
              If you missed out on Spam Inspector or are looking for an alternative, 
              there is also a spam filter available through EMMA. This has worked 
              well for a number of users. To activate it, go to <a href="http://www.asu.edu/emma">www.asu.edu/emma</a>, 
              log in (top of the screen) with your asurite username and password, 
              then in the upper right of the next screen click on &#8220;Click 
              here for Emma Applications.&#8221; In the new window that opens, 
              about halfway down the column on the left, click on Spam Filtering, 
              next click &#8220;Settings&#8221;, then click on the No (to change 
              it to Yes) to enable spam filtering on your email account(s). Click 
              on Help for more information on how to manage the filtered (quarantined) 
              email and to manage email addresses on the spam list. <br>
              <br>
              Remember that filtering software (including the Outlook rules wizard) 
              is not perfect, so you must always check the filtered emails before 
              deleting them. If legitimate emails have been mistakenly quarantined, 
              marking these messages and selecting &#8220;Deliver Now&#8221; will 
              deliver them to your Outlook inbox and add the addresses to your 
              &#8220;white list&#8221; so they won&#8217;t be quarantined in the 
              future. <br>
