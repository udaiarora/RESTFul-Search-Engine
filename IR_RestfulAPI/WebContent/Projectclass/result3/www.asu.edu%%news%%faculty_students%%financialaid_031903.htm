      <h2>Degree long-term investment for college students, families</h2>
      <p>Financial aid experts say higher tuition rates should not discourage
        current and potential students from pursuing a college degree. </p>
      <p>"The
            financial aid process has become a lot easier," says Diane Stemper,
          director of ASU's Student Financial Assistance Office. "The real challenge
          is making sure you complete your courses in order to earn your degree."</p>
      <p>On
          March 6 the Arizona Board of Regents voted 9-0 in favor of raising
        ASU tuition $1,000 for resident and nonresident students and $1,200 for
          resident and nonresident graduate students for the 2003 - 04 academic
          year.</p>
      <p>ASU President Michael Crow said the revenues generated by the increase
          will increase financial accessibility by making more funds available
          for needs based financial aid. </p>
      <p>ASU has received more than 14,000 applications
          for next year so far and Stemper says more funds were obtained for
        students with financial need.</p>
      <p>Stemper
          says the most frequently asked question made by families seeking financial
          aid is "What is the most money a household can make and still
          receive financial aid?" The answer, she says, "There isn't one." </p>
      <p>A family
          that brings in a total of $80,000 could have the same opportunity to
          receive financial aid as a family that makes a total of $40,000. </p>
      <p>"Each
          family situation is different," Stemper says. "A family that makes
        $80,000 could have a total of nine people in the household with five
          children in college. This family would be eligible for some sort of
        financial assistance. Each family should make sure they look at their
        situation
          closely before eliminating their options of financial aid."<br>
        Stemper offers the following advice to students and families seeking
          financial assistance:</p>
      <p>Try not to let the financial aid form intimidate
          you. It can be very overwhelming for people who have never filled one
          out. Keep in mind that
          it becomes easier when you begin answering the questions.</p>
      <p>File your financial
          aid form early. Many people don't realize that they can use estimated
          information regarding their income taxes.</p>
      <p>Students and
          their parents should work on filling out the financial aid form together.
          It's a joint venture that will ultimately affect both
          the student and the parent. </p>
      <p>The priority deadline date for the Free Application
          for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form was Feb. 15, but Stemper says
        there are still funds
          available for students who decided to turn in their forms after that
          date. In addition to obtaining a FAFSA form online, there are deadline
          updates available at: (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) and suggestions on
        how to fill out the form, including instructions in Spanish.</p>
      <p>The General Scholarship
          Application for the 2003 - 04 academic year is also available online
          at (http://www.asu.edu/fa/scholarships/general.html).
          Priority deadline is March 15. </p>
      <p>Notification of awards will begin in March
          and continue on a rolling basis throughout the year. Awards made through
          the General</p>
      <p>Scholarship
          Application are not automatically renewable. Students must submit a
        new General Scholarship Application every year by the priority
          deadline in order to be considered for an award.</p>
      <p>A list of additional
          outside scholarships is available online at: (http://www.asu.edu/fa/scholarships/index.html).
          Scholarships are listed in five categories: freshmen scholarships,
        tuition waiver scholarships, departmental/college scholarships, private
        scholarships
          and community scholarships. Deadlines for applications may vary.</p>
      <p>Taking
          out a loan is another option that students may consider. Information
          on loans is available online at: (www.asu.edu/fastt/loans/dirinfo.html). </p>
      <p>"Even though we would all like to complete college without having to
          pay back any loans," Stemper says, "I think as long as you are careful
          not to take out too many loans, then you should be fine. </p>
      <p>"I can't think
          of anything that a person can invest in that will have a greater pay
          off in the long run," Stemper says. "The important thing
          to consider is making sure that you finish, because that's when the
        payoff comes. A college graduate has more opportunities to make a better
        salary
          that someone without a college degree."</p>
