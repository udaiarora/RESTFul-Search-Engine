Why does EQS 5.1 state that "EQS is not installed or unauthorized copy"?
</center></h2>
<p> 
Question:<br>
The output from EQS 5.1 states that "EQS is not installed or unauthorized 
copy".  This message appears at the beginning of each page of output. 
What does it mean?
 <p>
Response:<br>
EQS 5.1 is producing the license error message because that part of the
program is not Y2K compliant.  Simply ignore the message.  This will be 
fixed in later releases.
