<P>
Henry Lyte translated into English this originally Dutch work
 by Dodoens titled <i>Cruydeboeck</i>.  In this Dodoens did not follow
 the alphabetical arrangement of past authors, but instead, took
 a step forward by grouping the plants according to their
 characteristics.  Dodoens, Clusius, and de L'Obel worked
 so closely together that it is difficult to tell exactly
 who wrote what.  They corresponded frequently, sharing their
 findings, and they even shared illustrations of their works
 with each other.  Dodoens' first major work was <i>Cruydeboeck</i>,
 but after repeated usage the blocks began to show signs of wear.
  Some of the blocks are still preserved in the Museum Plantin-Moretus
 in Antwerp, Belgium.  Dodoens is best known to English readers
 through translations of his work by Henry Lyte, who deserves
 much credit for his accuracy.  Unlike most translators, Lyte
 was an amateur botanist who understood the material he was translating.
  He is credited with making significant corrections to the original
 text and accurately incorporating new material sent him by Dodoens
 during the course of his work.  It is possible that Shakespeare
 consulted the <i>Niewe Herball</i> for information regarding plant lore
 found in his plays.  Edmund Spencer's references to flowers in his
 <i>Shepheardes Calendar</i> may have been inspired by his seeing this
 herbal where Lyte describes, among others, the "gillofers and pinkes."
