CROW<br>          Economic Club of Phoenix Luncheon<br>          May 12, 2005</h2>        <div class="indent">          <p>As we conceptualize the future of the university, and make progress on our plans for growth and expansion, we are beginning to hear that some of our intentions might have been misinterpreted.&nbsp; There is a perception that those of us in positions of leadership at the university&mdash;myself, the deans, some of our faculty, and others&mdash;don&rsquo;t think that the future is bright for Arizona, that our countenance is negative.&nbsp; </p>          <p>The future for Arizona is not only bright&mdash;it is unbelievably bright.&nbsp; The potential for Arizona, in my opinion, is as good or better than any other state in the nation.&nbsp; Let me put that into perspective as it relates to the future of the United States.&nbsp; I could give you a long list, but I have narrowed it down to what I think are four principal reasons.&nbsp; </p>          <p>The first, and I think the most important point, is that Arizona is unique in that it is one of a handful of states where remnants of the fundamental economic premise on which our country was built&mdash;free enterprise&mdash;remains strong.&nbsp; Unlike other parts of the country, a system that encourages the individual to focus on economic competitiveness is still strong here.</p>          <p>The second main driver for our bright future is what I call the &ldquo;power of advanced immigration.&rdquo;&nbsp; The people who are moving here from California, Mexico, India, and other parts of the world are moving here because they know of the opportunities that await them.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re not here by mistake or because they read a travel brochure.&nbsp; People who move here know they will be able to find work, make money, and move forward.&nbsp; We can never discount the power of that force and the potential that it gives us. </p>          <p>We also have a strong physical infrastructure.&nbsp; It needs enhanced management and conservation planning, but the infrastructure for water, transportation, and the other things we need for growth already exist.</p>          <p>Fourth on the list is our tremendous natural capital&mdash;the place itself.&nbsp; You cannot fail to feel, sense, smell, and see the beauty and promise of Arizona and not be awed and inspired by it. </p>          <p>If you take those four things together, particularly the first two, we have an unparalleled foundation upon which to work.&nbsp; Arizona is reaching a critical mass, and critical mass is achieved through an amalgamation of people, energy, resources, and ideas that come together to create purposeful growth.</p>          <p>I think that Arizona will play a very important role in the future of the United States.&nbsp; Arizona will not just be a large state in terms of population, but will become a leading state when it comes to what it can do and what it can achieve.&nbsp; The leading states in the nineteenth century were Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia.&nbsp; Later, they were Ohio and Michigan.&nbsp; In the twentieth century California had the brightest future.&nbsp; What will be the leading place to build the American dream in the twenty-first century?&nbsp; I would argue that it will be Arizona, and that by learning from the experiences of states before us, we will stand as a potential bastion for American economic competitiveness.&nbsp; </p>          <p>How do we get there?&nbsp; There are yellow caution flags that should make us take a serious look at the United States itself.&nbsp; Two of our largest corporations, Ford and General Motors, now have junk bond status for their debt.&nbsp; That might not bother some of you until you start delving into why that happened, how they&rsquo;re doing against their competition, their rate of innovation, and openness to change.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t blame it all on unions.&nbsp; Loss of production is a factor but it goes much deeper than that.&nbsp; Instead, read about why they will have to pay Toyota for hybrid technology so they can have some cars to sell ten years from now.&nbsp; </p>          <p>The trade deficit is another significant factor in our national competitiveness.&nbsp; Imagine how you would be affected if it cost a hundred dollars to fill up your car with gas.&nbsp; Now imagine that you&rsquo;re at one-tenth or one-twentieth of your current income level, and you can see what a serious issue this becomes.</p>          <p>Something else in the news in the last six months:&nbsp; the United States is no longer the dominant source for discovery and innovation through science and technology.&nbsp; We have fallen from a position that we had held through almost the entire twentieth century.&nbsp; </p>          <p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to stay that way.&nbsp; The world is not static.&nbsp; Free enterprise, education, and innovation can be brought together into what I call a &ldquo;combined asset.&rdquo;&nbsp; Economic success does contribute to social success&mdash;in fact it is the main driver in the works.&nbsp; Without it, we may face a reduction in our quality of life, something unheard of in the past.&nbsp; The generation born after 1985 could be the first generation in the history of the United States that has either the same wealth or less wealth than their parents according to our models. </p>          <p>For those of us in Arizona, I think there are four things that are key in reaching our goals.&nbsp; First and foremost is education.&nbsp; Second is innovation.&nbsp; Without these the capacity to adapt, create, and compete is lost.&nbsp; Without these we may become rich, but we will be fat and lazy.&nbsp; Without the drive to continue to innovate and create new technologies and products and processes to replace the old ones&mdash;what Joseph Schumpeter and other economists call the process of &ldquo;creative destruction&rdquo;&mdash;we&rsquo;re dead.</p>          <p>The third key is to renew free enterprise across the country in places where it has been lost.&nbsp; And lastly, we must make certain that we always have global competitiveness in mind.&nbsp; We are competing with billions of people all across the globe, and not just locally or even nationally. </p>          <p>If we maintain this free enterprise foundation here in Arizona, I think that there is a role for Arizona as representative of the American ideal&mdash;the place where we still get things done in the way that this country was designed to work, a center for education, innovation, opportunity, and global engagement.&nbsp; For the sake of our country we need to show the way and be the leading state in the nation.&nbsp; If the will of the citizenry is there, we have the capacity to achieve this vision.</p>          <p>The principle battlefield of competition will be played out in science and technology.&nbsp; Most people intuitively do not understand this, but ask yourself how many computers are in your car or your Blackberry or your television or your digital disc, or other devices you use everyday without being aware of the advanced technology that makes them work.&nbsp; We need to become a leading center for innovation in all things, including art, music, and business, but particularly in science and technology. </p>          <p>America must be competitive and we can help accomplish this by working to move Arizona forward.&nbsp; By harnessing the energy of education, the dynamism of innovation, and the creativity that free enterprise produces, those of us at ASU think we have a way to help bring about this future, and we are committed to making Arizona one of the greatest places that ever was.&nbsp;
