If either office determines that the behavior poses or has posed a serious threat to personal safety or to the welfare of the campus, the student will not be permitted to return to campus or reside in any ASU residence hall until an appropriate threat assessment has been completed and, if necessary, conditions for return are imposed. ASU DPS, the Office of the Dean of Students, and other appropriate offices will coordinate the assessment in light of the relevant circumstances.<p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>Physical contact that occurs during the performance of and as an integral part of participation in intercollegiate, intramural, or other sporting events, practices, or games is not, in itself, required to be reported under this policy; it is understood that participants assume the risks of this contact when they choose to participate.
