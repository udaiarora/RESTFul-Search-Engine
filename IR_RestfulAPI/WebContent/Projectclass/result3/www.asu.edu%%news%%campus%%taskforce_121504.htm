      <h2>Task force tackles future of university curriculum </a></h2>
      <p> A new task force at ASU is taking on a tall order: to identify the learning goals of the curriculum of the New American University. </p>
      <p> The goal is to create an institution that measures its academic quality by the education that its graduates receive, instead of the academic credentials of its incoming freshman class. </p>
      <p> The inaugural meeting of this task force will take place Dec. 10, and the clock already is ticking to produce results. According to ASU Vice Provost Nancy Gutierrez, the committee faces a mid-May deadline to have its report turned in to ASU President Michael Crow. </p>
      <p> The co-chairs of the task force are Ron Carlson, Regents Professor of English and creative writing on the Tempe campus, and Afsaneh Nahavandi, professor of global management and leadership on the West campus. The group, composed of two dozen faculty and staff members, is a joint effort of the Office of the University Provost and the academic senates from the East, West and Tempe campuses. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;This is the signature piece of the New American University ,&rdquo; Gutierrez says. &ldquo;I hope it will change the undergraduate experience at ASU.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> &ldquo;Any time you step back and attempt to assess what your goals and methods are, things get better,&rdquo; adds Carlson. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re braced because you find out about the things you&rsquo;re doing beautifully, and you&rsquo;re helped by seeing where you could do more. Schools evolve, and our committee is one of the first gestures in this new university to begin to describe that evolution.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> The impetus for re-evaluating the goals of the undergraduate curriculum began with a look at ASU&rsquo;s general studies program. A faculty survey was conducted in the fall of 2003, and information also was obtained from student and faculty focus groups, as well as from evaluations of the university&rsquo;s literary and math requirements, Gutierrez says. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;All of these were done to gather data and perceptions about the program,&rdquo; she says. </p>
      <p> In May, Gutierrez took a team of faculty from the East, West and Tempe campuses, plus a faculty member from the Maricopa Community College District, to an institute on general education, sponsored by the Association of American Colleges and Universities. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;We came back with an understanding that we needed to think about the learning goals of the undergraduate curriculum as a whole, not simply one piece of it &ndash; not simply those in the general studies program,&rdquo; Gutierrez says. &ldquo;In particular, there were two things that we knew were important. One, we&rsquo;re developing into a school-centric university, according to President Crow&rsquo;s vision; and two, our design team recommended one general studies program for the entire university. If we have one general studies program for all the campuses, we first must think about learning goals and competencies overall.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> A &ldquo;school-centric&rdquo; university is one in which schools and colleges will be responsible for the quality of their programs, according to the charge given to the task force members. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident that the task force will review the best and most pertinent literature on undergraduate, liberal and professional education, examine the current practices at ASU, and particularly the general studies program and its relationship to our community college partners, and offer recommendations for improvement,&rdquo; says task force member Glenn Irvin, dean of East College on ASU&rsquo;s East campus. </p>
      <p> The charge also notes that a comprehensive review of student learning outcomes and competencies has not taken place at ASU. Because of this, the task force faces finding the answer to this question: What should an ASU graduating senior look like? </p>
      <p> Coming up with a suitable answer is not a simple chore, Gutierrez notes. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;We want our general studies courses, as well as all other courses, to be competency-driven, not &lsquo;seat-time&rsquo; driven,&rdquo; Gutierrez says, making a distinction between the time spent in the classroom and what a student ultimately gets out of the educational experience at ASU. &ldquo;We have to have a way to evaluate those competencies.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> &ldquo;We have a very challenging and exciting task ahead of us,&rdquo; adds Nahavandi. &ldquo;It is not every day that we get a chance to take a fresh look at how we educate our students.&rdquo; </p>
