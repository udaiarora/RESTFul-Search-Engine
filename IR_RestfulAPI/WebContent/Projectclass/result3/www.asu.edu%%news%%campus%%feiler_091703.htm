      <h2>Journalist, commentator and Middle East authority to discuss possibilities
        for peace </h2>
      <p>This fall, Arizona State University's Center for the Study of Religion
        and Conflict brings to the Valley Bruce Feiler, New York Times best-selling
        author and NPR commentator. Feiler will be delivering a lecture entitled,
        "Abraham: A Journey to the Heart of Three Faiths" as part of the Center
        for the Study of Religion and Conflict's "Religion and Conflict: Alternative
        Visions" lecture series. </p>
      <p>The free public lecture is 7:30 pm on October 9, 2003 at the ASU College
        of Law Great Hall (Armstrong Hall, room 113). The talk will be followed
        by a book-signing. Reservations are required - for more information see
        the end of this release.</p>
      <p>Feiler's visit will be the first in this series of public conversations
        with nationally and internationally recognized writers, scholars, and
        policy experts. The series will explore the sources of religious conflict
        and strategies for their resolution.</p>
      <p>"In this lecture series, the Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict
        is bringing real insight about some of the biggest issues affecting the
        outside world home to Arizona," said ASU President Michael Crow. "Bruce
        Feiler, for example, is the kind of public intellectual whose thinking
        about religious conflict has enough impact to grab the cover of Time
        magazine. This is the kind of intellectual enrichment that a great university
        can bring to the community."</p>
      <p>"We're excited to have Bruce Feiler inaugurate this year's lecture series,"
        said Linell Cady, director of the Center for the Study of Religion and
        Conflict. "Anyone seeking greater understanding of the religious roots
        of violence within and between the monotheistic religions will find his
        work fascinating."</p>
      <p>Feiler's lecture takes it name from the title of his sixth and most
        recent book, Abraham: A Journey to the Heart of Three Faiths (2002).
        The book, a runaway New York Times bestseller, tells the story of Feiler's
        own personal search for the shared ancestor of Jews, Christians, and
        Muslims. Abraham is "exquisitely written," according to the Boston Globe,
        "100 percent engaging." The book was featured on the cover of TIME Magazine,
        in which it was praised as "a revolution in thought." Abraham was listed
        as one of the best books of the year by Amazon.com, Borders, and Publishers
        Weekly.</p>
      <p>Abraham's popularity certainly has something to do with its author's
        skills - Feiler is an incredibly talented storyteller who frequently
        writes for the New York Times, The Washington Post and Gourmet, where
        he is a contributing editor. He is also a contributor to National Public
        Radio. Feiler has been praised as one of the leading writers of his generation,
        and his work has won him the ASCAP/Deems Taylor Award for Excellence
        in Music Journalism, the International Association of Culinary Professionals
        Award for Excellence in Food Journalism and two James Beard Awards for
        writing about food and restaurants. Having traveled in more than 60 countries,
        Feiler has a great deal of world experience from which to write.</p>
      <p>Feiler is the author of five other books. Walking the Bible: A Journey
        By Land Through the Five Books of Moses (2001) recounts Feiler's year
        in the desert, on the trail of the greatest stories ever told. On other
        topics, Feiler is the author of Learning to Bow: Inside the Heart of
        Japan (1991), Looking for Class: Days and Nights at Oxford and Cambridge
        (1993), Under the Big Top: A Season with the Circus (1995), and Dreaming
        Out Loud: Garth Brooks, Wynonna Judd, Wade Hayes and the Changing Face
        of Nashville (1998). </p>
      <p>Feiler's success with Abraham may have been due to its message - one
        of interfaith understanding and hope, and of recognition of the great
        commonalities of the world's three great monotheistic religions. Abraham,
        in Feiler's vision, holds the key to reconciling the differences of Jews,
        Christians and Muslims in today's world.</p>
      <p>The message is not confined to the book. Since Abraham's publication,
        Feiler has organized a nationwide network of grassroots "Abraham Salons"
        - open forums in which religious leaders and laypeople can participate
        in interfaith discussions. Feiler's "Abraham Initiative" has also made
        its way into universities, local non-profits, religious and community
        institutions. The Initiative holds the promise of a major breakthrough
        in building peaceful relations among the religions.</p>
      <p>Of Feiler's lecturing style, Ball State University wrote, ". . . a joy
        . . . genuine and well spoken . . . one of the best speakers in the history
        of the program . . ." The Smithsonian Institution remarked that their
        audience was left "thrilled with the presentation." According to the
        Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict, Feiler's lecture will
        explore the Biblical landscape and the figure of Abraham as sources of
        division and hope. It will also recount Feiler's travels in the Middle
        East as he searched for the meaning of the figure of Abraham for Jews,
        Christians and Muslims.</p>
      <p>Future lectures in the Alternative Visions series will include "Reading
        Lolita in Tehran: Women, Religion and Global Politics" with Azar Nafisi,
        best-selling author and international activist on behalf of women's rights
        and democracy, in February, followed by "When Religion Becomes Evil"
        with CNN commentator, government policy advisor and Wake Forest University
        Religious Studies Professor Charles Kimball in March.</p>
