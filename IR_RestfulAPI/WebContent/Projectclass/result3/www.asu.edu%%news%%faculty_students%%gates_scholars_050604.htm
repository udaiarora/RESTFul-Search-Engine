      <h2>Gates Millennium Scholars reception promotes grad school <strong></strong></h2>
      <p>ASU student winners of the Gates Millennium Scholars award were honored at a reception on April 28. </p>
      <p>The reception, hosted by the Graduate College, was an effort to recognize the 45 scholars who attend ASU, and encourage them to begin thinking about graduate studies, says Associate Dean Marjorie Zatz. </p>
      <p>"This is one facet of our efforts to recruit highly qualified students from diverse backgrounds," Zatz says. </p>
      <p>Antonio Benavidez, a freshman majoring in math and economics, says such efforts benefit students like him. He says his future plans may include graduate level studies. </p>
      <p>"With minority students, knowing about opportunities available to them is half the battle," he says. "Much of what I know about college came, in large part, from outreach programs at high school and the university specifically designed to show minority students that higher education is not only within their abilities but well within reach financially, granted with the help of financial aid. Any kind of event which has the purpose to inform and possibly motivate can only help. </p>
      <p>"That it also creates a sense of community and camaraderie is an added bonus," Benavidez says. </p>
      <p>Several staff members from the Graduate College were present to talk to students about pursuing advanced degrees. Scholars heard from the college's recruitment and retention specialist about Project 1000, a national program that facilitates the graduate school application process for <br>
  African-American, Hispanic and American Indian students. They also learned about programs that provide academic, social, and financial support to underrepresented students, as well as professional development programs that train students for careers in academia as well as the private, public and nonprofit sectors. </p>
      <p>"These are stellar undergraduate students," Zatz says. "And ASU wants to encourage them to continue to graduate school whether at ASU or another institution. We're trying to improve the pipeline for students of color to go on to graduate studies. </p>
      <p>"These are our future writers, engineers, and scientists," Zatz says. "And we want to see them continue through the doctorate and move into key positions of leadership in universities, industries, and national and state governments." </p>
      <p>The Gates Millennium Scholars program provides financial support to high-achieving minority students pursuing undergraduate and graduate education. The program has assisted more than 7,000 students across the country since it was launched in 1999 with a grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. </p>
      <p>Coronado, with the Graduate College, can be reached at (480) 965-5995 or (nora.coronado@asu.edu). </p>
