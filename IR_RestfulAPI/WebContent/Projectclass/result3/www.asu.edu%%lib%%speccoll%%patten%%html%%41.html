<P>This was one of the most popular gardening books of the early 1800's
and went through several editions. The work begins with an alphabetical
listing of fruits and vegetables. Each entry gives complete instructions
for the planting, cultivating, and harvesting of the individual fruit or
vegetable. Herbs are included as well. All ornamental flowers appear in
one entry for flowers, ornamental, but there are individual discussions
for each, also done alphabetically. There is a similar section for fruits.
Other related topics, such as greenhouses and insects, are similarly included
in the alphabetical listing. The work also has a calendarial index, the
object of which is "to give brief intimations of work to be performed in
a garden, together with some approximation to the time of year in which
it should be accomplished." The work concludes with a general index, a
seed catalogue, and various advertisements.
