LIST's Newsletter<br>

<h3>Customer Service Contact Information</h3>
<p align=justify>
Keith Swartz, the new Customer Service Facilitator, now has his own phone number, e-mail, 
and pager. You can reach him by phone at 5-2854, through Outlook, or by paging him at 
602/229-6473. You can also send an email to him in Outlook with 
"pagekeith" (no quotes) in the "Subject:" line and the message will be forwarded to his pager. 
Or feel free to just drop in and see Keith and the rest of the staff in the Digital 
Library/Customer Service Center (C2).

<h3>The Times, They Are A-Changin'</h3>
<p align=justify>
Positioning ourselves to better serve the Libraries, LIST has recently completed a physical 
reorganization of the department. This will also allow us to take advantage of newly-acquired 
space and to make room for the absorption of staff and equipment from Video Resources. 
Many staff members have changed locations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Fred McIlvain, III administrator, is now located in 110C;</li>
<li>Rob Fidler, Personal Computer/Data Communications Manager, has moved to 110B;</li>
<li>Steve Tanner and Mike Sawitzke, Windows System Administrators, have relocated to 110C;</li>
<li>John Barnard, Instruction Team Leader, can now be found in 107;</li>
<li>Diane White, Systems Programmer, has moved to an office in 109B;</li>
<li>Heather Knowles, Digital Library Project Coordinator; Keith Swartz, Customer Service 
Facilitator; and the Systems Operation Support (S.O.S.) desk are all now housed in C2, the 
new Digital Library/Customer Service Center.</li>
</ul>
<p align=justify>
The off-air taping program that LIST is taking over from VR will be housed in C42, along 
with staff members Kirk Manegold and Matt Harp. Bill Gertz, also from VR, will eventually 
be located in C2 and will assist in providing customer service. 
<p align=justify>
Staff phone numbers have not changed as a result of the moves, and the following staff 
members can still be found in their original locations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Scott Herrington, Department Head, remains in 110D;</li>
<li>Philip Konomos, Special Projects Manager, is in 110E;</li>
<li>Yuwu Song, Instruction Librarian, stayed in 110;</li>
<li>Qunying Li, Digital Collections Librarian, remains in 107;</li>
<li>Pam Dunlock, Systems Programmer, is still in 109A.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<h3>S.O.S. Online System New and Improved!</h3>
Steve Tanner has recently overhauled the entire Systems Operation Support online problem 
reporting and tracking system. You can submit a problem report for any library computer online at 
<a href=http://sos.lib.asu.edu/>http://sos.lib.asu.edu/</a>. You will receive a response within 30 
minutes, and you can also track the progress of your problem's resolution online. In addition, 
we will be adding helpful tips and FAQs for common computing difficulties, as well as instructions 
for setting up antivirus software and other information library staff need to keep their 
computers running well. Please try out the new system and let us know what you think of it.

<h3>We Want Your Feedback</h3>
<p align=justify>
Let us know what you think of this first issue, and what topics you'd like to see in the next.
Send comments and suggestions to Heather Knowles.
