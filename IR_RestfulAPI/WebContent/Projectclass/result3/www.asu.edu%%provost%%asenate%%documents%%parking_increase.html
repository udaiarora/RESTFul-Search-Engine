<h2>Cost of parking at ASU Main is going up</h2>
<h3>Taking a bite out of the increase</h3>
This article appears in the <a href="../newsletters/newsletter.html" tabindex="1" title="Senate Newsletter">December, 2002, Academic Senate Newsletter</a>.
<p>It is bad enough when a pay increase is largely wiped out by increased payments 
  required for services, such as health insurance, as we witnessed last year. 
  It is even more aggravating not to receive any pay increase at all, yet still 
  be asked to pay more for these services. An announced increase in parking for 
  the next academic year is not welcome news, all the more so perhaps because 
  we are not used to seeing this particular cost increase. It may be little solace 
  that parking at ASU remains a bargain compared to other universities and to 
  other places in the Valley. Table 1 below compares ASU with its sister institution 
  to the south and with the PAC-10 and ASU peers, respectively. The intervals 
  displayed for the PAC-10 and peers represent the average of the lowest fees 
  and average of the highest fees across these institutions, including ASU, there 
  often being a range of options for different lots, as there is here. </p>

<p>  It is more than a psychological comfort, however, to know that the increase 
  will be considerably cushioned by the ability to pay for parking with pre-tax 
  dollars, resulting in a tax savings by reducing taxable income. Keep in mind 
  that a reduction in taxable income affects both federal and state tax, as well 
  as Social Security/FICA taxes. Table 2 illustrates the difference between the 
  gross increase in parking and the net increase, after taxes, using a hypothetical 
  33% combined tax bite. That likely covers most who have a family income of $40,000 
  or more.</p>

<p>For Access A decal holders, this means that a substantial increase of $111 over 
  the next three years nets out to only about $32, roughly $10 more each year. 
  For Access B and perimeter parkers, the news is even better. Both groups experience 
  a net decrease in the first year through tax recovery. In the case of many Access 
  B holders, for example, the increase from $100 to $125 next year will see a 
  tax savings of about $41, meaning that their net parking cost has been reduced 
  by about $19. By the end of the three -year increase, most Access B holders 
  will be out no more money than they were this year. </p>
  
<p>The ability to use pre-tax dollars to pay for parking allows Parking Services 
  to gain the considerable additional revenue to provide additional parking, to 
  maintain important services and improve in other areas. There aren't many alternatives 
  for an administrative unit that must pay its own way, a working assumption for 
  them for many years. Increased parking fines provide nowhere near the revenue 
  needed to provide new spaces. Moreover, ASU will lose over 3,000 parking spaces 
  to new construction in this year and next. And while it might be environmentally 
  preferable to have fewer spaces to encourage alternative travel means into campus, 
  the fact is that for now we're stuck with the current limited methods of travel 
  reduction and we need to have parking spaces. </p>
<p>Most of us are aware of many of the services that the parking fee covers in 
  addition to a parking space. The motorist assistance program and the FLASH shuttle 
  are two of the more prominent services. In addition, Parking Services covers 
  the costs of the call boxes in parking areas, temporary parking for new faculty 
  and car rentals, and visitor lots. With the new revenues, we should see upgraded 
  lighting in parking lots and a new 'hands free' gate arm system, along with, 
  of course, new parking structures. </p>
  
<p>While the pre-tax payment of parking is certainly welcome, its impact is nonetheless 
  regressive, that is, those with lower income reap less benefit. Perhaps, the 
  University should consider holding harmless individuals below a given income 
  level, much like the effort to hold certain students harmless from increases 
  in tuition. This applies more to staff than faculty, but it seems that in these 
  hard times, we particularly need to pay attention to ways that we can buffer 
  our staff against increases in service costs, especially with the expectation 
  that we are likely to see an increase in health costs around the corner. </p>
