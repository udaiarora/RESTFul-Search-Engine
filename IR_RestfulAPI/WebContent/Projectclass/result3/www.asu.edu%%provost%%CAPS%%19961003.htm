<h2>Minutes of Meeting</h2>

<b>October 3, 1996</b>

<P>
<P>

1. The minutes of the Sept.5 meeting were approved.  Approval of the 

minutes of the Sept. 19 meeting is still pending. 
<P>

  

2. The members of PACAPS were invited to attend this meeting, and the following members were
in attendance:  Alison Ewing, Richard Filley, Cristina Gonzalez (member of both committees),
James Lehman and Heather Lineberry. 
<P>

  

3. After going over the history to bring the PACAPS members up to date, Gary discussed the
Provost∆s and Vice-Provost∆s response to the letter from Gary regarding ADC 507-05.  Dr.
Glick indicated that he was not familiar with the situation.  Dr. Harris  said that, according to
ASU legal counsel, the revised policy was not acceptable because it was based on deleted faculty 

policy.  Therefore, the rewrite will be returned to the Academic Senate Personnel committee for
further revision.  The CAPS committee will try to work with the personnel committee regarding
the rewrite.  Gary will contact Dr. Glick , reporting what he learned from Dr. Harris, in order to
make sure that in the future the Provost will be kept informed regarding CAPS and AP issues.  At
the same time Gary will extend an invitation to  Dr. Glick to attend and address the AP Caucus on
October 31, 1996. 
<P>

  

4. AP Caucus:  Gary has arranged for a mailing to all APs (caucus 

announcement, welcome back letter).  The caucus is scheduled for 12 Noon, Pima Room (MU
218), Memorial Union on Thursday, October 31.  Alison requested time for PACAP on the
agenda. It was also suggested that we should address what the post-tenure review process
could/should mean to academic professionals.  Other agenda items 

may be added but we are largely interested in addressing issues from the floor. 
<P>

  

5. PACAP Elections:  Alison Ewing, Law Library, nominated by Dick Filley and seconded by
Heather Lineberry, was elected chair.  Cristina Gonzalez, Campus Communities, nominated by
Dick Filley and seconded by Alison Ewing, was elected recorder.  Alison will call a meeting of the
committee for after the caucus.
<P>
  

6. Roles of CAPS and PACAP:  The general understanding is that CAPS is focused on specific
tasks from the constituents and from the administration; PACAP serves a linking function and is
more of a funnel for issues.  Both committees are under the Provost.  There was considerable
discussion on how the two committees could better work with each other and also with the
Academic Senate (e.g. AP representation on all senate committees) and the administration
representing AP concerns.  We also discussed how we could bring APs together, entertaining
suggestions from social events to revisiting 

the idea of an electronic listserv.  We have decided to organize a listserv, not a one-way
communication like the bulletin board, but an interactive forum. Every academic professionals will
be automatically subscribed (removed at their request).  Cristina and Richard have very graciously
volunteered to be in charge of the list.
<P>
 

7. Agenda for the year:  we discussed inviting academic professionals (involved in governance)
from the University of Arizona and from Northern Arizona University to a meeting to initiate
communication among the academic professionals of Arizona universities.  We will invite the 
Vice-Provost to meet with the committee.  We intend on working as closely as possible with the
Academic Senate Personnel committee regarding the revision of ACD 507-05.  Work on our
identity as a classification:  pursuing possibly a series of articles in Insight, for example. 
[Academic 

Professionals:  scholarship in application to the university and to the community. (Cristina
Gonzalez)  This may not actually fit here, but its much too good a statement to be lost.] 
<P>

  

8. Karl distributed a revised CAPS bylaws document.. The committee 

members will review the document and discuss it again at the next meeting. 
<P>
  

9. Clerical support for CAPS.  As Gary found out when he was arranging for our mailing, unlike
other campus committees and organizations, CAPS does not have clerical support from the
Provost∆s office.  Cristina has offered the use of her staff on those occasions when we may need
to prepare a mailing.
</P>
