    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H-AMINDIAN is an electronic discussion list and web 
    site devoted to American Indian Studies and is operated at Arizona State University 
    by graduate students under the direction of Justina Parsons-Bernstein, a post-doctoral 
    research associate, along with a local faculty managing board.<br>
    H-Amindian pursues an active agenda, with topical discussions, bibliographical 
    essays, online seminars, and book reviews. Emphasis is placed on historical 
    study, but participation is welcomed by scholars in literature, anthropology, 
    sociology, political science, and other fields.

    the H-Amindian Website and Listserv. She was awarded her PhD in American and 
    Global history at Rutgers University in 2000. She wrote her dissertation on 
    the ethnic reorganization of Shoshone and Bannock groups in the 19th and 20th 
    centuries, with emphases on technological adaptation and life cycle and gender 
    role changes. Her research interests for the near future concern the ways 
    in which indigenous groups and individuals around the world are accessing 
    and utilizing the internet. She is extremely pleased to be working on H-Amindian 
    at ASU, and she is also looking forward to teaching American Indian history 
    courses for Fall and Spring Semesters.</p>

    in date from 1969 to 1994. The bulk of the material dates from 1982 to 1990

    and later President of the Navajo Nation. There is also material on the Navajo 
    - Hopi Land Dispute, Big Boquillas Ranch, DNA Legal Service, Education and

    valuable discoveries during fieldwork at Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon, New 
    Mexico, in the summers of 1896-1900. Though he also took part in excavations 
    in Mexico and Ecuador, the emphasis of his collection is upon the Navajo, 
    Hopi, and Zuni Indians, their customs, language, textiles, pottery, religion, 
    and way of life. Included are correspondence, diaries, maps, paintings, and 
    photographs. Of note is the Washington Matthews manuscript of &quot;The Night 
    Chant,&quot; and &quot;A Navajo Ceremony.&quot; The originals occupy fifteen

    to Tuba City. The collection consists of 35 handwritten letters by Dr. Newton 
    to his wife and five other individuals from the school mainly between 1902 
    and 1903. Dr. Newton writes about the school, some of his patients, and various
