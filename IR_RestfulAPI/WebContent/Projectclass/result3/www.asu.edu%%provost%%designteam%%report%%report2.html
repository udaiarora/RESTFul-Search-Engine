            <p>The University Design Team (UDT) was appointed at the start of
              the spring 2003 semester and was asked to examine a set of issues
              within the context of preparing a five to ten year "road map" to
              accommodate increasing numbers of students.  Specifically,
            the University Design Team was charged to: </p>            <h2>Phase I </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Determine the identity and character of the four
                different campuses. How does one establish differentiation
                among the four campuses?  Do they have distinctive missions,
                thrusts, and/or topical clusters of programs?  Do
                they all have the ASU brand? </li>
              <li>Recommend programs that are needed at the campuses
                to support or define those identities in charge # 1. Should
                existing programs on one of the campuses be moved to reinforce
                the identity of another campus?  Should new programs be
                started that help build the image of a particular campus? </li>
            </ul>            <p>Phase I recommendations are addressed in <em><a href="report.html">University Design
                Team Phase I Report and Recommendations</a> </em>(May 2003). </p>
            <h2>Phase II </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Determine how the various university services need
                to be provided.  Should support services be centrally organized
                and managed or should they be decentralized to the campuses?  How
                much autonomy should each campus have in the various service
                areas?  Should
                the roles of the Graduate College, College of Extended Education,
                and the Office of VPR be revised?  (Also coordinate with
                the other task forces, such as the admissions standards, University
                College, etc.) </li>
              <li>How should we manage enrollment within and among
                campuses? </li>
            </ul>            <h2>University College </h2>
            <p>The UDT began by reviewing <em>A Design for University College, </em> a
              report prepared by another university working group.  The
              following recommendations are based on that review and subsequent
              discussions of the UDT: </p>
            <p><strong>Serving Students in Transition </strong></p>
            <p>First, the primary purpose of University College should be as
              the academic home and/or help/success center for students in transition,
              whether they be new undeclared students, highly qualified students
              seeking to explore the many disciplines of the university, students
              leaving a major and in search of another, students seeking to move
              between campuses, etc.  &nbsp; Further, as a part of this
              focus on students in transition, the College should place particular
              emphasis on academic advising and career exploration and guidance.  With
              an emphasis on these kinds of student academic services, students
              who are immediately admissible and/or continuously qualified for
              their chosen major should receive such services from their college
              or school rather than from University College.  That is,
              University College should not be structured to provide such services
              to all undergraduate students.  However, University College
              and its services should have a presence on all campuses, although
              tailored to meet the special needs of each student body.  </p>
            <p>While there may be other organizational drivers for the creation
              of University College, the UDT believes it should be designed to
              influence specific student outcomes including: improved retention
              and graduation rates for both first-time freshmen and transfer
              students, decreased time to degree for students, and increased
              levels of student satisfaction with the academic experience, in
              general, and with academic advising, in particular. </p>
            <p><strong>Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (BIS) Program </strong></p>
            <p>The UDT also recommends that University College not be the home
              of the BIS.  Rather, the UDT believes that BIS students at
              ASU Main would be served best by the creation or designation of
              an academic home (e.g., school or department) for the program,
              students, and faculty.  Similar programs at ASU West (Integrative
              Studies) and ASU East (BIS) already reside in academic units.  Some
              concerns were expressed that the creation of an independent academic
              entity would enable the BIS entrance and curricular requirements
              to be changed in ways that lock out many of the students it was
              designed to serve.  As a part of creating this type of unit,
              the Design Team believes that mechanisms should be set in place
              to ensure this would not occur. </p>
            <h2><strong>Graduate College </strong></h2>
            <p>(In this section, the term "Graduate College" will be used
              to refer to an organizational entity that serves as a facilitator
              of graduate education processes in the university.  As used
              at other universities, alternative labels include Graduate School
              or Graduate Division.) </p>
            <h3>Background </h3>
            <p>The UDT collected information about the structure and function
              of graduate colleges at several other universities as a basis for
              discussing possible changes for ASU.  The other universities
              included UCLA, University of Oregon, University of Washington,
              University of Michigan, Rutgers, and Ohio State.  The roles
              of these various graduate colleges are similar to those at ASU,
              although the extent to which some of the functions are decentralized
              to colleges and schools varies considerably among the institutions. </p>
            <p>The biggest issues with the current functioning of the Graduate
              College concern the delays in processing of applications and the
              admissions process more generally.  Also, concern was expressed
              that the most critical roles of the College (i.e., serving and
              advocating for graduate students, quality oversight) had become
              secondary to the more peripheral roles of program review and accreditation
              oversight.  Based on these concerns and the review of other
              universities' graduate processes, the UDT recommends the following. </p>
            <h3>Proposed Functions of the Graduate College </h3>
            <p>First and foremost, the Graduate College should be an academic
              service unit that serves and advocates for prospective and current
              graduate students and that offers varying levels of service to
              academic departments/units to assist them in recruiting and retaining
              the best students.  Toward that end, the UDT supports the
              new dean's effort to streamline the admissions and financial aid
              processes to better serve graduate students and academic departments.  With
              quality control and customer service as goals, this streamlining
              effort should consider: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Establishing the department/unit as the first
                point of contact for graduate applications materials; </li>
              <li>Maximizing the benefits of an electronic application; </li>
              <li>Creating electronic copies of application materials
                  only for students admitted to the university; </li>
              <li>Defining the quality control role of the Graduate
                  College at the end of the admissions process; </li>
              <li>Managing financial aid processes to ensure departments
                  can make timely offers to prospective students; </li>
              <li>Continuing the role of the Graduate College in
                managing the evaluation of international and non-degree applicants;
                and, </li>
              <li>Examining the appropriate role of the Graduate
                College in post-baccalaureate and certificate program admissions. </li>
            </ul>            <p>Also as a part of serving and advocating for graduate students,
              the Graduate College should continue to coordinate programmatic
              initiatives such as Preparing Future Faculty, Preparing Future
              Professionals, and Integrative Graduate Education and Research
              Training Program. </p>
            <p>Underlying this key role as an academic service unit, the Graduate
              College should provide strategic direction for the development
              of graduate education.  This includes fostering differentiation
              and diversity among campuses as well as development of the ASU
              brand of graduate education through appropriate new program development
              and program review processes.  As a part of this role, the
              Team recommends that the Graduate College be reestablished as a
              single administrative unit with university-wide responsibility,
              headed by a dean that reports to the University Provost. </p>
            <p>In addition, several of the current functions of Graduate College
              ought to be reassigned to a different organization within the university
              to better enable its focus as a service enterprise.  In particular,
              oversight of accreditation processes and undergraduate program
              review should be assigned to a university officer within the Office
              of the University Provost.  Also, the administration
              of interdisciplinary graduate programs should be evaluated on a
              case-by-case basis and be located in the most appropriate administrative
              home.  For many interdisciplinary programs, the most appropriate
              administrative home may be a college or school because those entities
              are better able to adjust resource levels to support interdisciplinary
              initiatives than the Graduate College.  </p>
            <h2>Extended Education </h2>
            <p>The Design Team reviewed and discussed the current organization
              and functions of the College of Extended Education.  Recognizing
              how the current structure and function of Extended Education has
              evolved based on several studies of other universities, the UDT
              chose not to do a similar review.  As such, the focus of
              the discussion and recommendations were based on an assessment
              of the appropriate roles for extended education within ASU today.  </p>
            
        <p>Extending programs and services beyond the boundaries of the four campuses 
          is essential to implementing &quot;ASU as a force, not just a place&quot;. 
          Given that context, the primary goal of an extended education organization 
          ought to be identifying new markets and facilitating the process to 
          serve those markets. The range of products ought to include programs 
          and courses for credit and/or non-credit, including training programs 
          for specific populations (e.g., state agency professionals). As an academic 
          service enterprise, the extended education entity should focus on assisting 
          academic units to connect with these new markets and vice versa. As 
          well, extended education might develop programs and courses to serve 
          markets that are outside the bounds of the academic colleges and schools. 
          Potentially, extended education could move into offering degree programs, 
          if colleges and schools choose not to respond to certain market demands. 
        </p>
            <p>Organizationally, the UDT believes that extended education, as
              an academic service unit, might be headed best by a dean or vice
              provost. Whether or not it should be a "college" ought
              to be answered dependent on the function's revised portfolio. 
              As a means to foster cooperative relationships and positive responses
              to the market, the UDT recommends that extended education assign
              staff liaisons to work with each college or school.  Finally,
              it is important to establish clear distinctions between the Downtown
              Campus and Extended Education as the two entities evolve. </p>
            <h2><strong>Enrollment Management </strong></h2>
            
        <p>Consistent with recommendations in the Phase I report of the Design 
          Team, admission standards to the university should continue to be the 
          same at all campuses, with variations in the standards and requirements 
          among programs and schools. In support of such a policy, there should 
          be a single administrative office within the university responsible 
          for undergraduate admissions. One, university-wide, organization responsible 
          for admissions will require redesign of some aspects of the process 
          including: a new application that enables indication of student preference/priority 
          for multiple programs and/or campuses; creation of structures and processes 
          to guide the distribution of students among programs and campuses; and 
          recruitment and follow-up processes that market and support all programs 
          and campuses in the university equally. Finally, given the university-wide 
          mandate, locating the undergraduate recruitment and admissions functions 
          off of the Main campus should be considered seriously.
