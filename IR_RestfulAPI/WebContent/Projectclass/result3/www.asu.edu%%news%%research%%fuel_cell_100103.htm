      <h2>ASU researchers advance fuel cell technology by going small scale</h2>
      <p>        The power outages that plagued the northeast this summer have many people
          re-examining the idea of electrical generating systems that would be
          more flexible, cleaner and less prone to major catastrophic failure.
          One such energy source that could fill these electrical power needs
        is fuel cells. </p>
      <p>Fuels cells, which cleanly and quietly generate electric
            power by passing fuels like hydrogen over one electrode while passing
            air over a second,
          have been around for more than 100 years. But their development has
        long been dogged by costs of the technology as well as safety concerns.</p>
      <p>Now,
          researchers at ASU are applying advanced principles of nanotechnology
          to the design of fuel cells. Their work could lead to "several new
        ways of dealing with shortcomings of conventional fuel cells while advancing
          the technology into new markets and uses," says Frederic Zenhausern,
          director of the Center for Applied Nanobioscience (ANBC) at Arizona
        Biodesign
          Institute. </p>
      <p>"What we are doing is incorporating microfluidics and nanotechnology
          in the fuel cell design to help develop cells that operate at room
        temperatures and yet have a very high energy density," Zenhausern says. </p>
      <p>At ANBC, Professor
          Don Gervasio and his team are developing micro-fuel cells for portable
          applications. Gervasio, who has worked on a variety
          of fuel cell technologies for 20 years, says his team's goal is to
        develop a complete micro power system, envisioned as a hybrid device
        made up
          of a fuel cell subsystem, a battery and controller. Pound for pound,
          it would supply more energy (application lifetime) than batteries alone,
          he said. </p>
      <p>Presently, micro power means batteries, and these batteries,
          which cost around $10 per Watt, have always been significantly higher
          in cost than
          grid ($0.25 per Watt) and automotive ($0.04 per Watt) power applications.
          The high cost of batteries means battery-replacement micro-fuel-cell
          systems are the most likely first practical fuel cell products. They
          are targeted at personal portable electronics for consumer and military
          markets, to power a vast new array of cell phones, sensors, radios
        and laptop computers. </p>
      <p>Gervasio says the team also is exploring novel materials,
          as well as working out systems issues for making the fuel-cell power
          supply systems.
          Applying nanotechnology to make inexpensive, yet effective, fuel-cell
          and fuel-processing-catalysts and using plastic microfluidics and micro-ancillaries
          (like low-power miniature pumps, fans and controllers) to effectively
          shrink the fuel cell systems will help get a foothold on some problems
          that are encountered with larger-scale fuel cell technology.</p>
      <p>One key material
          is the fuel. Hydrogen is the most desired fuel but is troublesome because
          its storage is too hazardous and bulky to be attractive
          for commercial portable uses. For automotive applications, a new water-based
          hydrogen storage solution developed by Millenium Cell, Eatontown, N.J.,
          solves these problems. The new aqueous borohydride fuel has comparable
          energy density to gasoline and methanol, and yet it is safer to handle
          because the borohydride solution is not flammable. </p>
      <p>The ASU team is taking
          the borohydride hydrogen storage scheme and using a microfluidics reactor
          to get the hydrogen out. By using this approach,
          at any given instant, less than a milliliter of cool, low-pressure
        hydrogen gas would be present during fuel cell operation. This is much
        safer than
          operating conventional fuel cells, which typically involve liters of
          high-pressure hydrogen or flammable hydrocarbons. </p>
      <p>Other key fuel cell
          materials under study at ASU are: low-cost, lightweight plastic microfluidic
          housings for the fuel cell sub-system; low-cost,
            high surface-area nano-catalysts; and advanced proton conductors.
        In particular, advancing the proton electrolyte membrane materials could
            greatly simplify the system. Gervasio is collaborating with ASU Chemistry
            Professor C. Austen Angell to exploit the ion-conduction concepts
        that
            Angell's ASU team has developed to make improved lithium ion conductors.</p>
      <p>Because
          the materials issues are still not completely resolved, the ASU researchers
          expect that a practical room temperature fuel cell prototype
          is probably still three years away, and that it would take an additional
          two years to bring a pre-commercial prototype to market. Several consumer
          product manufacturers have already expressed interest in ASU's technology. </p>
      <p>While it is reasonable for micro-fuel cells to displace batteries, costs
          must be reduced if fuel cells are ever to displace grid power and the
          internal combustion engine, and keep alive the promise of clean and
        quiet alternative power supplies for larger applications.</p>
