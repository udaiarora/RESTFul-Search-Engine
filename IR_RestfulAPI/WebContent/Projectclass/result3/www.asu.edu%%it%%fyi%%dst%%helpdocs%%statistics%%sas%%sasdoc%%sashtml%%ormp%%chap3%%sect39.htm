<A NAME="idxlp70472">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxlp70473">&#13;</A>There are no restrictions on the problem size in the LP procedure.
The number of constraints and variables in a problem that PROC LP
can solve depends on the host platform, the available memory, and
the available disk space for utility data sets.
<P>Memory usage is affected by a great many factors including
the density of the technological coefficient matrix,
the model structure, and the
density of the decomposed basis matrix.
The algorithm requires that the decomposed basis fit completely in
memory. Any additional memory is used for nonbasic columns.
The partition between the decomposed basis and the nonbasic
columns is dynamic so that as the inverse grows, which
typically happens as iterations proceed, more memory is
available to it and less is available for the nonbasic columns.
<P>The LP procedure determines the initial size of the decomposed basis matrix.
If the area used is too small, PROC LP must spend time compressing
this matrix, which degrades performance.  
If PROC LP must compress the
decomposed basis matrix on the average more than 15 times per iteration,
then the size of the memory devoted to the basis is increased.  
If the work area cannot be made large enough to invert the basis, an error
return occurs. 
On the other hand, if PROC LP compresses the decomposed basis
matrix on the average once every other iteration,
then memory devoted to
the decomposed basis is decreased, freeing memory for the nonbasic columns.
<P>For many models, memory constraints are not a problem because both
the decomposed basis and all the nonbasic columns will have no problem
fitting. 
However, when the models become large relative to the available
memory, the algorithm tries to adjust memory distribution in order to
solve the problem.  
In the worst cases, only one nonbasic column fits
in memory with the decomposed basis matrix.
<P>Problems involving memory use can occur when solving mixed-integer
problems.  
Data associated with each node in the branch and bound tree
must be kept in memory.  
As the tree grows, competition for memory by the
decomposed basis, the nonbasic columns, and the branch and bound tree
may become critical.  
If the situation becomes critical, the procedure
automatically switches to branching strategies that use less memory.
However, it is possible to reach a point where no further processing is
possible. 
In this case, PROC LP terminates on a memory error.
