<h1 class="storyhead">Ant expert Hoelldobler focuses on social complexity</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" -->
<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note:</em><em> This is the first in a series of articles that examine the work, motivation and influence of some of ASU&rsquo;s top researchers.</em></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/NewExplorer_Logos_000.gif" width="100" height="100" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Sociobiologist Bert Hoelldobler, an internationally renowned researcher and one of the leading authorities of our planet&rsquo;s most successful life forms &ndash; ants &ndash; has joined ASU as a professor in the School of Life Sciences.</p>
<p>Hoelldobler brings to ASU its third Pulitzer Prize winner (1990 general nonfiction), and its third member of the National Academy of Sciences. He also has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, to the American Philosophical Society, and to several other international academies.</p>
<p>But it is his work with ants that is Hoelldobler&rsquo;s passion. Ants, as Hoelldobler notes in &ldquo;The Ants,&rdquo; his Pulitzer Prize-winning volume (co-authored with Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson) are among the most dominant organisms on Earth.</p>
<p>Ants are found in virtually every terrestrial environment (not to mention the kitchen), from the tundra to the rain forest to the desert, and on every continent except Antarctica. Though they are tiny, their total collective mass on the planet rivals that of humans. Hoelldobler estimates that their global population numbers are around 10 thousand trillion (10 times 10 to the 15th power). In the life-rich Amazon, for example, they make up a third of the total animal biomass.</p>
<p><img src="images/bhoelldobler0405.jpg" width="150" height="159" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Though most city dwelling people consider ants pests, they play a critical role in many ecosystems, being the main predators of other insects, a major force in processing and turning the soil, and one of nature&rsquo;s main distributors of nutrients and plant seeds. The many thousands of ant species are highly specialized and eat everything from aphid secretions to plant and animal materials to fungus (which they farm themselves). </p>
<p>Hoelldobler&rsquo;s interest in ants goes well beyond their ecological importance and focuses on the real reason for their success: their highly evolved social behavior. Hoelldobler is at the center of a large, multidisciplinary group of ASU researchers that are coming together to tackle an issue that can generally be described as the biology of social behavior, or &ldquo;social complexity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ants, together with their cousins the bees and wasps, were among the first organisms in evolution to develop true social behavior more than 100 million years ago.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Of ants and men</strong></p>
<p>For this reason, social insects are important objects of study not just for naturalists, ecologists and entomologists, but also for researchers interested in social behavior. Researchers like Hoelldobler who study social insects are at the cutting edge of research aimed at understanding the biology of social systems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can learn a lot by studying social insect behavior,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In the 1980s, I wrote a paper called &lsquo;Territorial Strategies in Ant Societies,&rsquo; and I was amazed by all the places from which I got reprint requests &ndash; the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, the Pentagon. I wondered, &lsquo;Why do they want to know about this?&rsquo; A Harvard researcher said: &lsquo;We are interested in how, through evolution, territorial strategies have been optimized.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

    <td width="172" valign="top"><p class="indexblurbheads">Ant drama nets Hoelldobler film prize</p>
        <p>The study of ants has brought Bert Hoelldobler many accolades, but last September he received a surprising one. The film, &ldquo;Ants &ndash; Nature&rsquo;s Secret Power,&rdquo; which is about Hoelldobler&rsquo;s research with ants, won a Special Jury Prize at the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival in Jackson Hole, Wyo.</p>
        <p>The Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival is dedicated to promoting natural history programming that raises awareness and sensitivity to the &ldquo;wild world around us.&rdquo; It is one of two major film festivals of its type; the other is held in Bristol, United Kingdom. </p>
        <p>&quot;It was a total surprise to me that the film won this award,&rdquo; Hoelldobler says. &ldquo;This is comparable to winning an Oscar. There are like 500 films being considered in 20 categories at this event. The film&rsquo;s success is mainly due to the superb cameraman Wolfgang Thaler from Vienna, and to my outstanding scientific collaborators.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Hoelldobler says the film, which was shot in 2003 and 2004, shows how his group uses the state-of-the-art technology to monitor the secret societies of the ants.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;People are fascinated by this,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They want to know how did you decode the communication system of ant societies, and this film shows some of the techniques we use in the field and in the laboratory.&rdquo;</p></td>

<p>&quot;Ants have very, very aggressive societies,&rdquo; Hoelldobler says. &ldquo;If they had the atomic bomb, the world wouldn&rsquo;t exist any more. Or perhaps not, because the way they conduct warfare depends very much on resource distribution &ndash; and, depending on that, they have very different kinds of territorial strategies. No colony really invests more energy in territorial defense than they get back in resources. It&rsquo;s a cost-benefit relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The genetic basis for certain social behaviors in ants and humans are the same, Hoelldobler says. Although they evolved independently, elementary social organizations and ants are similar.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t want to be seen as someone who looks at ants and says we have these little human societies &ndash; they are totally different things,&rdquo; Hoelldobler says. &ldquo;But what we learn in studying the biodiversity of animal societies is that there are certain principles that keep popping up: division of labor, social hierarchies, social networks, communication systems, kin recognition and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>High hopes</strong></p>
<p>In addition to Hoelldobler, ASU is assembling a team of scientists to conduct social complexity research. He has joined a group of faculty that will be developing a center for the study of social dynamics and socio-complexity in animals, including humans. </p>
<p>New theory and empirical research is aimed at understanding the dynamics of social systems and their evolution. Several disciplines and programs across the university and within the School of Life Sciences, (such as the Human Dimensions of Biology Program), will cooperate in the new center.</p>
<p>&quot;ASU has shown an incredible drive to establish standards of excellence,&rdquo; Hoelldobler says. &ldquo;What the university is doing right is focusing on a couple of points and figuring out who can be hired in these areas and recruiting a critical mass. In social systems and biocomplexity research, it can be the center of the universe.</p>
<p>&quot;Innovation in the School of Life Sciences also attracted me to ASU,&rdquo; Hoelldobler adds. &ldquo;Of all the departments I have seen, including those in Europe, this is unique. We have a life sciences department where there are philosophers of biology, historians of biology, experimental biologists working at the molecular, cellular or organismal level, all under the same organizational umbrella. It is very stimulating.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Before coming to ASU, Hoelldobler was chair of sociobiology and behavioral physiology at the Theodor Boveri Institute at the University of Wuerzburg (Germany). Before that he was the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard University&rsquo;s Museum of Comparative Zoology. In addition to the Pulitzer Prize, he has been the recipient of the U.S. Senior Scientist Prize of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the German government, two of the most prestigious science prizes given in Europe.</p>
<p>Hoelldobler is no stranger to Arizona, having conducted frequent research studies here over the past 35 years.</p>
<p>&quot;Arizona reminds me of my home country, Bavaria,&rdquo; Hoelldobler says. &ldquo;The people are highly independent. I have wonderful friendships with many of the people I&rsquo;ve met here over the years. It is a good feeling being part of ASU.&rdquo;</p>
