      <h2>W. P. Carey School goes back to high school to prevent dropouts</h2>
      <p>        When the W. P. Carey School of Business launched the Rodel Community
          Scholars initiative in 2001, the mission was ambitious: to develop
          civic leadership in some of ASU's top business students, and to address
        the conditions that drive Arizona's high school dropout problem.</p>
      <p>Now
            in its third year, Rodel is already paying dividends. The lives of
            some 310 high school students and their families have been impacted,
          as well as lives of the 56 Rodel Scholars. The program has expanded
        from the original three high schools to involve a total of six, including
          one on the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community, and the business
          plans developed by the teams promise to affect many students outside
          the target populations. This year Rodel also moved its focus to campus,
          as four W. P. Carey MBA students apply their business acumen to the
        issues
          that contribute to academic success in the university setting. </p>
      <p>It is
          the business approach that sets Rodel apart, and the program's mission
          fulfills the school's new motto: "doing good while doing well." </p>
      <p>"We asked ourselves how we could develop in undergraduate students the
          skills and values that would make them want to be civic leaders as
        well as successful business people," said Rodel Director Raul Cardenas.
        "We
          grounded the students in what they know - business. They look at schools
          as business operations and students as customers."</p>
      <p>The approach has yielded
          business plans for academic retention in Camelback, Tolleson, Chandler
          and Bourgade High Schools. Teams of Rodel Scholars
          continue to build upon the plans developed for Camelback and Tolleson,
          and implementation is under way in Chandler and Bourgade. The plan
        in each school is different, reflecting the varying needs the Rodel Scholars
          found in those communities. This year, teams are also working at La
        Joya
          Community High School in the Tolleson Union High School District and
          on the Salt River Pima Maricopa Community at Desert Eagle Secondary
        School. </p>
      <p>At Tolleson High School, for example, the Rodel Scholars determined
        that awareness, family support and financial concerns were some of the
        biggest
          challenges facing students - even those with the talent and work ethic
          to achieve. The Tolleson plan includes College 101, a course designed
          to outline the steps needed to be ready to go to college, Tolleson
        Outreach to Parents (TOP), which builds family support for higher education,
        and
          eventually a scholarship program. In response, Tolleson teachers built
          a course called Rodel math, which compacts two years of college-required
          math into one, allowing students whose plans have expanded to catch
        up in time to apply to a university. </p>
      <p>As Cardenas puts it, "at a time when
          these kids are struggling to stay in school, the Rodel Scholars supply
          the answer to the question why."</p>
