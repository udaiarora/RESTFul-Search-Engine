      <h2>Unearthing history<br>
        Construction site yields relics of vanished town</h2>
      <p><em><img src="research_images/potshards.jpg" alt="pot shards" width="288" height="216" align="right">Shards 
        from a pot in the photo above show the presence of manure (black), used 
        to temper the clay to help it better withstand fire when used for cooking. 
        This archaeological dig occurred in late May under what had been a visitor 
        parking lot at the corner of College Avenue and University Drive in downtown 
        Tempe. <br>
        </em></p>
      <p>Tempe, Ariz., the home of ASU, is a city built on top of layers of earlier 
        towns. For centuries, the Hohokam had a village on the site, using water 
        from the Salt River to irrigate their farms. And in the late 19th and 
        early 20th centuries the town of San Pablo, a small Hispanic community, 
        occupied the site. </p>
      <p>Now a modern college town, no trace of either of these remains, until 
        you start to dig, that is. <br>
        When ASU constructed new residence halls north of University Drive in 
        the summer of 2000, excavation of a parking lot revealed Hohokam canals 
        and remnants of a San Pablo boarding house. Now, as the university is 
        preparing the construction site for a new building to house the ASU Foundation, 
        more history has been found lying mere inches beneath another parking 
        lot. </p>
      <p>According to ASU Cultural Resource Manager Glen Rice, the site, located 
        at the corner of College Avenue and University Drive, was once the center 
        of downtown San Pablo. Dewey Street, the village&#146;s main drag, ran 
        east-west down the middle of the current parking lot, running from the 
        current Catholic church through Palo Verde West Hall. Most of the buildings 
        of the town disappeared and houses and businesses of old Tempe replaced 
        them. With the growth of the university, these houses in turn were razed.</p>
      <p>Surveying the site, Rice expected to find remnants of the older Tempe 
        buildings, but was surprised to also discover the foundation of an older, 
        San Pablo era house.</p>
      <p>Roughly dated at 1900 A.D., the ruin includes a floor built with handmade, 
        low-fire bricks, surrounded by a two-foot border of river rocks &#150; 
        the foundation of a thick adobe wall. Adjoining this structure is a newer 
        room with a modern brick wall and cement and wood flooring.</p>
      <p>&#147;Clearly someone added on to the building and tried to make it look 
        more up-to-date,&#148; Rice said. &#147;The brick wall represents new 
        technology, though, ironically, it would not have been as comfortable 
        in this climate as the thicker adobe walls, which provide more insulation 
        and can be cooled by sprinkling water around.&#148;</p>
      <p>Rice says the adobe design, which includes a wooden post in the middle 
        of the floor to support the roof, was a long-standing building model in 
        Arizona. </p>
      <p>&#147;This was an ancient design, made with local materials, well adapted 
        to the area, and probably not too different from houses the Hohokam and 
        other Indians had been building for centuries,&#148; he said. <br>
        Also found on the site were a number of artifacts, including a large hand-made 
        Indian pot containing the skeleton of a cat (apparently the burial of 
        a beloved pet). A trash pit yielded numerous glass bottles, which mainly 
        contained veterinary medicines for horses (Rice thinks one of the buildings 
        on the site was a stable), but a Coca Cola bottle (dated 1905 to 1910) 
        is a reminder that the culture here was on the verge of becoming modern 
        America.</p>
      <p>However, when the archaeologists dug deeper, they found remnants of an 
        older culture as well. A few feet from University Drive, the team found 
        the remains of ancient Hohokam fire pits at about five feet below the 
        current surface. Rice says the fireplaces, now just rings of soot and 
        ash, are probably signs of field encampments used by the Hohokam while 
        tending their nearby fields. </p>
      <p>The dig is being directed by Denise To, a doctoral student in the anthropology 
        department. The team will be excavating the site through May 30. </p>
