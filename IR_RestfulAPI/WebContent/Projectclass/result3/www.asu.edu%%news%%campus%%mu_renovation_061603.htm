      <h2>Renovation to bring more seating, food options to ASU's Memorial Union</h2>
      <p>ASU's Memorial Union (MU) serves as the landmark for students and university
          employees to meet, eat and be entertained. This summer, renovations
          are being made to better serve its customers and enhance the university
      environment for everyone. </p>
      <p>Construction, which began in May, will convert
            Union Square, the all-you-can-eat dining facility, into a multi-purpose
            gathering, eating and programming
          space. Union Square, which was open only weekdays for breakfast, lunch
          and dinner and for brunch and dinner on the weekends, will extend its
          hours to the scheduled MU building hours.</p>
      <p>Becky Sojak, communications
        coordinator for Student Development and the Memorial Union, says the
        renovation of Union Square will follow a philosophy
        similar to the one used when the Art Caf&eacute; was finalized on Aug.
        19, 2002 - more seating with an eclectic feel.</p>
      <p>"We've had such wonderful
        success with the Art Caf&eacute; by incorporating
        a food concept (Einstein Bros. Bagels) and community and performance
        space, that we would like to mirror those objectives for the former Union
        Square area," Sojak says. "Many students are looking for a place to hang
        out and relax. We're hoping the renovated area will lend itself to those
        needs and more."</p>
      <p>The new retail dining restaurants to be located on the
          main floor, will include Mein Bowl, which specializes in Chinese favorites
          with authentic
          flavor. At Mein Bowl, customers will be able to pick from entrees like
          Sweet and Sour Pork and Kung Pao Chicken with a choice of low mein
        noodles, rice or fried rice.</p>
      <p>Pandini's is a mini bistro serving fresh Italian food,
        including upscale oven pizza, salads, sandwiches and pastas. Salsa Rico
        is a Mexican grill
        eatery serving Baja style chicken and steak burritos, tacos, chips and
        salsas and quesadillas using freshly prepared items. The Gourmet Grounds,
        located on the main floor will close this fall, but a full-service Starbucks
        Coffee, offering a menu similar to what is currently available in the
        W.P. Carey School of Business caf&eacute;, will be added. </p>
      <p>"The restaurants
          will offer students and other visitors a variety of choices for food,"
          Sojak said. "I think people will be very happy with
          the quality of food that will be offered."</p>
      <p>Temporary drywall was installed
          several weeks ago on the main north/south corridor of the MU for the
          expansion project of Chick-fil-A. To accommodate
          the high volume of business, Chick-fil-A will expand its present location
          to incorporate the area occupied by neighboring Pizza Hut. Pizza Hut
          will move inside Union Market and reopen for fall.</p>
      <p>For visitors seeking
          visual entertainment, a large video wall will be installed in the renovated
          area. As part of a class gift, ASU's class
          of 2003 will provide funding for the high-tech wall, which will broadcast
          university events including news, sports and musical entertainment.
        In addition, approximately six TV monitors will also be placed throughout
          the seating area. </p>
      <p>"We think the video wall will draw a lot of attention
          from our visitors," Sojak says. "There's a lot of potential for campus
          organizations, community
          groups and individuals to utilize the video wall to promote ASU affiliated
        events and programs."</p>
      <p>The MU's interior will have about 300 seats. In
          addition, the restrooms will be renovated and a family restroom will
          be included.</p>
      <p>The north exterior
          of the MU will also get a new look with a multi-level exterior seating
          platform in the Union Square renovation, which will
          allow for about 200 additional seats. A staging area will also be created
          for student programming and other special events. Newspaper and other
          periodical racks will be relocated to the east side of the MU. </p>
      <p>The project
        general contractor is Adaptive CM and the architect is Larson Associates
        Architects, Inc., both of whom were hired for the Art Caf&eacute; project
        last summer.<br>
        Construction is scheduled to be complete by early August and ready to
        open its doors before the beginning of fall semester.</p>
