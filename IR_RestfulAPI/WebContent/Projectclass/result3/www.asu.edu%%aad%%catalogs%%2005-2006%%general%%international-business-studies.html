Certificate in International Business Studies</b>
<a id="a87561"></a></h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The Certificate in International Business Studies is designed to prepare students for positions with multi<b>
</b>
national firms, banks, government agencies, and inter<b>
</b>
national organizations. The certificate is not a substitute for the listed areas of business specialization; rather, the program of study for the certificate enables students to apply business skills in a global environment.</p>
<p>
Requirements for the certificate are designed to provide an understanding of international business environments, principles, and operations; to provide an awareness of global social processes and a sensitivity to foreign cultures; and to develop competence in a foreign language. These objectives are met in the following ways: international business principles and operations, global and area studies, foreign language, and GPA proficiency. Students seeking the certificate are strongly encouraged to obtain some international experience through study in a foreign country.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>

W. P. Carey School of Business
 seminar of at least a six-week duration or in an approved internship abroad of at least eight weeks satisfy six of the nine semester hours.</p>
