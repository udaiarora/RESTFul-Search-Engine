<font size=+1><b>Conditions of Service</b></font>

<p>
The <a href="acd002.html#board" target="New">board</a> has established the <a href="acd501.html"><i>Conditions of Faculty Service</i></a> and the <a href="acd503.html"><i>Conditions of Professional Service.</i></a> These documents constitute the policies under which the <a href="acd002.html#facultymember" target="New">faculty</a> and <a href="acd002.html#academicprofessional" target="New">academic professionals</a> of ASU are employed.  Each Notice of Appointment shall provide that acceptance of the <a href="acd002.html#NoticeofAppointment" target="New">Notice of Appointment</a> constitutes recognition that the applicable policy shall be the conditions of employment.  The board states that it shall not be bound by, nor does it adopt or incorporate herein, the interpretations, policies, or recommendations of other organizations.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Additional Policies</b></font>

<p>
The board has adopted various additional policies which are part of the employment relationship.  Among these policies are the <i>Code of Conduct,</i> patent policy, royalty policy, and sabbatical leave policy.  Changes in such policies will be made by the board to be effective normally upon the start of the succeeding <a href="acd002.html#Appointment" target="New">appointment</a> period.  Additional policies may become effective at a time determined by the board.  ASU maintains a compilation of such policies and shall take reasonable steps to inform the faculty and academic professionals of the existence of such policies.  A complete compilation of board policies is available in the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Salaries and Benefits</b></font>

<p>
Maximum and minimum salary scales for faculty ranks are set by the board. The <a href="acd002.html#president" target="New">president</a> shall approve individual salaries within those scales or as otherwise approved by the board.  Salary rates for reappointments will depend upon available funding.  Merit raises are allocated by the president within the limitation of available funds.  Certain fringe benefits are made available to all state <a href="acd002.html#employees" target="New">employees</a> and are subject to change by the legislature or the board.  Policies governing outside activities and supplementary compensation are administered by ASU.
