Significantly reduce MVS resource overhead by tuning your SAS              applications! This book reveals the secrets of exploiting the MVS
environment to create and tune efficient SAS applications. Programmers     at every level will learn how to take advantage of performance tools
that make tuning easy. Topics include using MVS performance metrics;       efficiently storing SAS data sets and sequential data sets on DASD and
tape; using buffer number, buffer size, indexes, and data compression to   improve performance; optimizing VSAM processing, using the stored
program facility to reduce compile time; and exploiting MVS hiperspaces    to reduce processor overhead. A section devoted to MVS environmental
factors unrelated to SAS provides readers with an understanding of MVS     events that may affect their application performance every day. SAS
programmers working with business, scientific, statistical, or             pharmaceutical applications under MVS will appreciate this book's
comprehensive focus on efficiency issues in that environment.
