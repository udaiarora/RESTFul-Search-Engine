      <h2>Ceramics faculty selects the best of the best from collection for summer
        exhibition</h2>
      <p>The Ceramics Research Center at the ASU Art Museum will
        kick off new summer hours with the pick of its collection in an exhibition
        that runs June 7 - Sept. 14. Ceramics Faculty Selects: Clay from the
        Permanent Collection consists of 36 works chosen from the center's 3,000-piece
        collection by the Herberger College's three ceramic faculty members.
        The center's hours will parallel those of the museum's Nelson Fine Arts
        Center location: Tuesday - Saturday, 10 a.m. - 5 p.m.</p>
      <p>The selected objects demonstrate the full range of technique and stylistic
        possibilities within the ceramic field, from historical work to wheel-thrown
        functional pottery to avant-garde sculpture. Some of the artists represented
        in the exhibition include Robert Arneson, Rudy Autio, Ruth Duckworth,
        Maria Martinez, David Shaner, Toshiko Takaezu, Peter Voulkos and Betty
        Woodman. </p>
      <p>The Herberger School of Art's ceramics faculty - Kurt Weiser, Randy
        Schmidt and Jeanne Otis - have nearly a century of combined experience
        as artists and educators. In addition to the selected works, each faculty
        member will have one of their own art works on exhibit to illustrate
        their personal work. </p>
      <p>Weiser, Schmidt and Otis teach in the Herberger College's ceramics program,
        which was recently ranked 14th in the country by U.S.News &amp; World
        Report. They have diverse backgrounds, concepts and technical skills
        in the ceramics field, which are reflected in the works selected for
        this exhibition.</p>
      <p>Curator of ceramics Peter Held said that the size of the ASU Art Museum's
        collection made the process of selection a rewarding but somewhat daunting
        task. "The end result mirrors the diversity of the permanent collection,
        which is used as a teaching tool for many of their students," Held said.</p>
      <p>Jeanne Otis's background and training as an artist began in painting
        and drawing, and color continues to be important in her ceramic work.
        She also is drawn to artists with a painterly quality such as Toshiko
        Takaezu, Betty Woodman and Jun Kaneko. In addition, she is attracted
        to the unexpected in functional forms, such as the work of Anne Hirondelle
        and Phil Cornelius, who incorporate a strong sculptural element in their
        work.</p>
      <p>Randy Schmidt is trained as a sculptor and his selections reflect his
        concerns with form and volume. Among his choices for this exhibition
        is a piece by Robert Arneson, who was part of the funk movement that
        created controversy during Schmidt's formative years at graduate school.
        Schmidt's own work is that of an object-maker, often combining other
        media with clay that has a personal narrative quality.</p>
      <p>Many of Kurt Weiser's choices include his appreciation of functional
        forms. The work of David Shaner, Chris Staley and John Ward demonstrates
        the self-assured hand of the makers, with simple yet compelling form.
        Weiser's passion for Asian ceramics and obsessive decoration is illustrated
        in the work of Ralph Bacerra, which he also selected for the exhibition.</p>
      <p>Ceramic Faculty Selects: Clay from the Permanent Collection will close
        with a free public reception,<br>
        7-9 p.m., Sept. 13, during which the ceramic faculty members will lead
        a gallery walk-through to discuss the various pieces they selected for
        the exhibition.</p>
