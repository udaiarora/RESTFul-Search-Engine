SAS Companion for the CMS Environment, Version 8
</H1><P>
Here's your best resource for information about CMS-specific aspects of    the SAS System. The usage section shows you how to perform common tasks
such as allocating and accessing files, customizing your SAS session, and  redirecting the SAS log and SAS procedure output.  The reference portion
describes SAS language features that are CMS-specific or that have         CMS-specific aspects, such as system options, statements, and procedures.
This title is intended for users who are familiar with the SAS System,     but who have not necessarily used the SAS System under CMS.
