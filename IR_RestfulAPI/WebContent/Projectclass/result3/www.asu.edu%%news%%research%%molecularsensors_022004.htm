      <h2>Research offers new platform for molecular sensors </h2>
      <p>ASU researchers have successfully demonstrated chemical and biological sensors that can detect the presence of specific compounds on a molecular scale. </p>
      <p>The work is led by Nongjian Tao, an ASU professor of electrical engineering. It could lead to smaller and faster integrated sensors that could provide an early warning of the presence of pollutants or act as in vivo glucose monitors for blood. Because the underlying methods, or platform, Tao uses in these devices are the same, they offer great flexibility and the possibility of making much more sophisticated, integrated sensors. </p>
      <p>Tao presented the findings at last week's annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Seattle. </p>
      <p>Tao is building integrated chip type devices and using nanojunctions, very tiny gaps between two materials that are only a few molecules thick, as the heart of the measuring device. </p>
      <p>"Because everything is at such a small scale, we can make measurements very quickly and the devices require very small samples," Tao says. </p>
      <p>In making the sensors, Tao positions two minute pads of material so close together that they are only a few molecules apart. He connects the pads with specific molecules to form molecular junctions depending on the compound he wants to detect. </p>
      <p>In operation, when only a few molecules of the material the sensor is designed to detect interact with specific molecules in the junctions, they detect a current change. </p>
      <p>Tao says the sensors have exhibited high sensitivity, on the order of a few parts per trillion in the case of lead ions, and high specificity of the material they are trying to detect. </p>
      <p>"The basic idea is that if you get the right molecule it will interact with the molecules you are trying to detect," Tao explains. "That molecular interaction is basically the ability to measure the conductance or resistance of the overall system of molecules. Whenever there is a specific interaction between the molecule (in the sensor) and the molecule we want to detect, then there will be a change in conductance. </p>
      <p>"These platforms can be used to detect different things," Tao says. "In one instance we've used it to detect heavy metal ions in water samples and in another we have used it to detect glucose levels in blood. </p>
      <p>"The basic platform has molecules that are wired into the electrical circuits so you can measure or monitor the conductance of the molecules," he says. The only difference is in what you want to detect. </p>
      <p>"If you want to detect lead ions only, then you put specific molecules on that molecular junction. On the next junction you might put enzymes there, so this junction will detect glucose." </p>
      <p>The research, which is funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, could lead to cheaper, smaller sensors, Tao says . His experimental devices already exceed EPA standards for detection of lead ions. </p>
      <p>A finished product employing the molecular nanojunctions could be hand-held type devices capable of providing readings in less than a second. Today's standard procedure is to take water samples from an area and transport them back to a lab for analysis, requiring several days time and opening up the potential for sample contamination. </p>
      <p>Molecular nanojunction based devices could lead to an integrated and miniaturized sensor for in vivo monitoring of a range of species like glucose, hormones, neurotransmitters," Tao adds. </p>
