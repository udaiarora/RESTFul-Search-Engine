Paid parental leave is paid at 100 percent of the employee&#146;s regular rate of pay (based upon FTE).   If the birth or adoption of a child occurs outside of the academic year for an academic year appointee, the academic year appointee is eligible to receive a pro-rated amount of paid parental leave for any portion of the six-week period that occurs in the new academic year period. <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Request for Use</b></font><p>Paid parental leave will be approved if the eligible employee provides a written request to the unit head (i.e., chair or director) requesting paid parental leave at least 60 days before the leave is to begin, if the leave is foreseeable.  If the leave is not foreseeable (e.g., for adoption), the employee must provide a written request as far in advance as is possible.  All requests should specify an approximate start date and an end date.  A <a href="acd-hrforms.html">Request for Leave of Absence</a> form is available. </p><p>Use of these parental benefits shall not adversely affect the faculty or academic professional&#146;s standing or consideration for future salary adjustments in any manner.</p><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Coordination with Other University Policies</b></font><p><b>Family Leave</b></p><p>Under the family leave policy (ACD 702&#150;03), an eligible employee can request up to 12 weeks of leave for the birth or the adoption of a child. If the employee wishes to take a leave of absence for a period of time beyond the six weeks or such lesser amount of pro-rated paid parental leave, he or she must note that request on the Request for Leave of Absence form.  Family leave is unpaid, therefore, the employee must utilize accrued sick (<a href="acd702-02.html">ACD 702&#150;02</a>) or vacation (<a href="acd704-02.html">ACD 704&#150;02</a>) hours if he or she wishes to remain in pay status for any time taken beyond the paid parental leave period.  </p><p><b>Disability Benefit</b></p><p>Paid parental leave will coordinate benefits with any group disability income replacement benefit policy (e.g., short-term disability insurance), up to 100 percent of the recipient&#146;s base salary. For information on short term disability insurance benefits, see HR Benefits <a href="acd-hrbenefits.html">Web</a> site.</p><p><b>Insurance Premiums and Retirement Contributions</b></p><p>Because the employee remains in full pay status during parental leave, the university will continue to pay the employer&#146;s portion of health insurance premiums for benefits coverage and the employee will remain responsible for the employee&#146;s portion.  The employee will continue to earn service credit and will have retirement contributions paid by the university during the paid parental leave.</p><p><b>Stillbirth</b></p><p>Paid parental leave may be used in cases of stillbirth.  In such an event, a maximum of two weeks of paid parental leave may be used.  This form of paid parental leave is used in place of the university&#146;s bereavement policy (<a href="acd702-04.html">ACD 702&#150;04</a>).  Additional time may be used under <a href="acd702-03.html">ACD 702&#150;03</a>, &#147;Family Leave&#148; and <a href="acd702-02.html">ACD 702&#150;02</a>, &#147;Health-Related Leave&#148; when supported by medical documentation.</p><p><b>Probationary Appointments</b></p><p>For faculty and academic professionals on probationary appointments, use of parental leave under this policy shall be considered good cause for extending the probationary period under <a href="acd506-03.html">ACD 506&#150;03</a>, &#147;Probationary Appointments&#148;  and <a href="acd507-05.html">ACD 507&#150;05</a>, &#147;Probationary Appointments and Review.&#148;</p><p><b>Sabbatical Leave</b></p><p>Sabbatical leaves (<a href="acd705.html">ACD 705</a>) are intended for professional development and may not be used for parental leave.</p><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Temporary Assignment of Alternate Duties</b></font><p>Department chairs and deans are expected to accommodate requests by tenure-track/tenured faculty for a temporary assignment of alternate duties for a period of 12 weeks beyond the six weeks of paid parental leave.  If this period ends during a semester, this temporary assignment of alternate duties will be further extended to the end of the academic term in progress.  Alternate duties should be designed to make it more feasible for the employee to remain on full active employment at the university following the birth of the employee&#146;s child or the adoption by the employee of a child.  Any reduction in teaching is not to be made up at a later date.</p><p>Examples of alternate duty assignments include, but are not limited to, research, course development, curriculum development, working on program reviews or accreditation reviews and related documents, and the mentoring of graduate students.  </p><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Failure to Return to Work</b></font><p>If the faculty member or academic professional fails to return to work after the expiration of this leave and/or any other authorized leave period (e.g., family leave) and/or the expiration of a temporary assignment of alternate duties, or returns to work but fails to remain for at least 30 days, the employee agrees to reimburse ASU the salary paid under this policy.</p><p>ASU will excuse reimbursement when the failure to return is due to the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition of the employee or the child that would otherwise qualify the employee to leave under the family leave policy, or other circumstances beyond the employee&#146;s control.</p><p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>For information on leaves of absence from the university, see:<br><p><ol><li> <a href="acd702-02.html">ACD 702&#150;02</a>, &#147;Health-Related Leave&#148;<p>and</li><p><li><a href="acd702-03.html">ACD 702&#150;03</a>, &#147;Family Leave.&#148;</li></ol></p><p>For information on salary continuance policies while an employee is absent from work, see:<br><p><ol><li><a href="acd704-01.html">ACD 704&#150;01</a>, &#147;Vacation Leave&#151; Academic-Year Appointments&#148;<p>and</li><p><li><a href="acd704-02.html">ACD 704&#150;02</a>, &#147;Vacation Leave&#151;Fiscal-Year Appointments.&#148;</li></ol></p>  <p>For information on sabbatical leaves, see <a href="acd705.html">ACD 705</a>, &#147;Sabbatical Leave.&#148;</p><p>&#160;<p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
