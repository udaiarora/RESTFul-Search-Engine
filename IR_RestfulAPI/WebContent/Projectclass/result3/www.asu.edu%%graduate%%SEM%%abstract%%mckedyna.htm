Hg<sub>x</sub>TiS<sub>2</sub>(1.25<img src="../images/gteql.gif">x&gt;0.00) was chosen as a model low-valent (very little ionic guest-host charge transfer) intercalation system for detailed investigation. Complete deintercalation of stage-1 Hg<sub>1.25</sub>TiS<sub>2</sub> was induced in situ by resistive and electron-beam heating (-170°C to above ambient temperature). Deintercalation onset was most often observed at the externalmost guest layers, consistent with greater external host-layer flexibility.  Onset also frequently occurred at internal guest layers, which can be associated with the strain induced by defects reducing the deintercalation activation energy of internal guest layers locally. Deintercalation generally progresses away from the onset layers(s) forming primarily randomly staged regions, with occasional short-range order.  Guest and host-layer behavior during deintercalation provide strong support for the applicability of the Daumas-Hérold guest-island model of staging to intercalation/deintercalation reaction processes. These observations include guest-island formation and deintercalation, frequent formation of stable staggered domain-wall boundaries, and guest-layer separation. The symmetry (or asymmetry) of guest-edge dislocation terminations is directly associated with the minimization of local host-layer strain energy and host-layer restacking.<p><i>Chem.
