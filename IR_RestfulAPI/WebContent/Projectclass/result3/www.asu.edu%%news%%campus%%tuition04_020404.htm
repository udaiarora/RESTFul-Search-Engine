      <h2 align="left"><strong>ASU President Michael Crow announces </strong><strong>tuition, fees increase recommendation </strong></h2>
      <p align="center"><em>--Providing quality education and increased access are first priorities </em></p>
      <p>Tempe, AZ - Arizona State University President Michael Crow today announced he is recommending to the Arizona Board of Regents that state resident students pay an increase of $335 (to $3,843) and nonresident undergraduate students pay an increase of $670 (to $12,698) in annual tuition for the 2004-05 academic year. </p>
      <p>Crow also recommends resident and non-resident graduate students pay an additional $1,200 annually for tuition, with graduate teaching and research assistants and associates held harmless. If the board approves the increase at its March 11-12 meeting, scheduled at the University of Arizona, ASU's undergraduate resident tuition level would follow ABOR policy and remain in the lower one-third of all U.S. public universities. </p>
      <p>Crow says ASU's overarching goal is to provide access to as many academically qualified students as possible, regardless of financial need, and to improve the quality of the student experience at ASU. </p>
      <p>"Student involvement in the tuition setting process last year was critically important, and I look forward again this year to engaging the student leadership in a productive dialog to address their desires for using tuition revenue to benefit students," Crow said. </p>
      <p>Students are the major beneficiaries of last year's tuition increase at ASU, though the increased revenues help lift the entire university. The largest portion provided increased financial assistance for students. Other improvements funded with tuition revenues include expanded library hours, improved classroom facilities, better access to advising and increased availability of classes, as well as improved compensation for teaching assistants. </p>
      <p>The set-aside from last year's tuition increase of&nbsp; $1,000 per year increased financial aid for needy students by 140 percent. Despite last year's tuition increase, ASU experienced a record number of applications, and enrollment climbed to an all-time-high of 57,543 students this fall, including the largest freshman class in history. This represents a 3.7 percent increase over last year's enrollment of 55,491 students. </p>
      <p>Minority enrollment at the university also increased, reaching a record high 22 percent of the total student body, up from 10 percent in 1985 and 15.5 percent just 10 years ago. Hispanics make up the largest group at 6,649, an increase of 10.4 percent over last year. The highest growth rate was in the number of African Americans, at 2,005, a 13.4 percent jump. A record 1,276 American Indians and 2,757 Asian Americans enrolled, both up about 9 percent. </p>
      <p>Crow said ASU is focusing on improving accessibility for students with unmet financial needs, as determined by federal guidelines. </p>
      <p>"We are committed to doing everything possible to mitigate the effects of a tuition increase by further increasing financial aid for qualified Arizona families," Crow said. </p>
      <p>Currently, tuition covers only a fraction of the university's cost of educating a student. According to calculations by U.S. News &amp; World Report, at ASU it costs $13,500 to educate each student. </p>
      <p>Along with the tuition increase recommendation, Crow is asking the Regents to approve a $40 per semester ($20 in the summer) student health fee to provide greater access for students to a broader array of health care services. ASU is one of the last universities nationwide with fully subsidized health services. With the new fee, ASU Student Health Services can move to become self-supporting, freeing up state subsidized funds for educational purposes, such as reducing class size. </p>
      <p>In addition, there is a possible $25 per semester fee for student services facilities, which would require several steps: A student referendum, presidential approval, and approval by the Regents. At this point, the fee, if approved, would only affect students enrolled on the Main Campus. </p>
      <p>In addition to an increase in tuition and the fees outlined above, Crow is also recommending the following: </p>
