                <p align="center"><strong><i>Interim athletic director named, conduct codes tightened</i></strong></p>
                <p>TEMPE, AZ &ndash; Arizona State University President Michael M. Crow has appointed ASU Law Professor Myles Lynk to conduct a thorough investigation of how the university&rsquo;s various units handled issues concerning ASU student Loren Wade, who was this week charged with first degree murder. The committee, which is still being assembled, will include community representatives.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Professor Lynk is thorough, tough and fair,&rdquo; said Crow.&nbsp; &ldquo;His experience as faculty athletics representative at ASU &ndash; the faculty&rsquo;s watchdog over intercollegiate sports &ndash; makes him the ideal person to lead this assessment.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>In describing the scope of this assessment, Crow explained, &ldquo;Loren Wade was a student first and athlete second. A number of university departments, including Student Affairs, Academic Affairs and Academic Advising, as well as Intercollegiate Athletics, were involved with providing student services to Loren Wade and other students who were teammates of Loren Wade or were otherwise acquainted with him. The support services of all of these university departments or units, and the manner in which they are delivered, will be assessed.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The committee will also review how Wade&rsquo;s teammates and friends might have been more helpful in uncovering and addressing the various issues raised this week, and will examine ways to enhance communication between ASU&rsquo;s Department of Public Safety and area municipal police departments when they are investigating incidents involving ASU students.</p>
                <p>Crow appointed Senior Vice President Christine Kajikawa Wilkinson as interim athletic director, a role she has assumed twice before in the past, to replace current athletic director Gene Smith when he leaves for a new job at Ohio State on April 8.&nbsp; The university is in the midst of a search for a permanent successor to Smith.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;In the past, Christine Wilkinson has been called upon to be a steadying influence in the athletic department during a time of transition and, more importantly, provided leadership to move the department forward,&rdquo; Crow said. &ldquo;She has provided excellent leadership and we are, once again, asking her to guide this department during a trying time.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>ASU has a strict code of student behavior approved by the Arizona Board of Regents.&nbsp; In addition, the ASU Athletics Department has a code of student-athlete behavior that holds student-athletes to a higher standard of behavior. The football team also has its own Foundation for Success Program that includes guidelines for correct behavior on and off the field. These codes and the Foundation for Success Program address topics like criminal activity, abusive behavior and possession of weapons on campus. They set out certain disciplinary actions along with remedial and preventive counseling.</p>
                <p>These behavior codes have been tightened even further with two additional announcements made by Crow: </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>ASU already bans the possession of weapons on campus.&nbsp; The revised weapons policy will require students and employees to inform the ASU Department of Public Safety of any violations of the weapons policy.&nbsp; Failure to do so will result in sanctions under existing employment and student policies.</li>
                  <li>Any student or employee making a threat of violence, if that threat is verified, will be sent for mental health assessment and may be removed from campus and all programs.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>&ldquo;With these actions, ASU will be implementing new tools to proactively address not only violent behavior but threats of violence as well,&rdquo; said Crow.</p>
                <p>Finally, Crow will activate a university committee to adjudicate all possible violations of the student athletic code of conduct.</p>
