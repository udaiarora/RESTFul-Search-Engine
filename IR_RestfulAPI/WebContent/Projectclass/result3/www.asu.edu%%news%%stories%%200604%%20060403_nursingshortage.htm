<h1 class="storyhead">College takes closer look at state's nursing shortage </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>Short-term improvements in Arizona's nursing shortage are unlikely to prevent the state from the long-term crisis it is likely to face if measures are not taken to improve the health care workplace. </p>
<p>Despite an increasing number of new nurses being licensed and rising nursing school enrollments, turnover of the work force remains high, according to results of a survey by the ASU College of Nursing. </p>
<p>The College of Nursing conducted the survey of chief nursing officers of Arizona hospitals and correctional facilities, and provided statistical analysis for the report. The college's dean, Bernadette Melnyk, presented the survey results recently to Gov. Janet Napolitano and members of the former Task Force on the Nursing Shortage. </p>
<p>Applications for registered nursing licenses increased 47 percent to more than 6,000, and nursing school student enrollment rose by 26 percent since 2002, according to state records. ASU College of Nursing enrollment has increased more than 80 percent to 290, compared to its historical 160 annual admissions, and the college is on track to admit 320 students per year to its baccalaureate program in 2008. </p>
<p>The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HRSA) also recently released a preliminary report from the 2004 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses, which indicated that Arizona has improved its ranking three spots to No. 45 in the United States for employed registered nurses per 100,000 people. California , Nevada , Texas , Idaho , and Utah had lower ratios of employed nurses to population than Arizona 's 681-to-100,000 ratio. </p>
<p>Most of the short-term improvement in Arizona's ranking reflects implementation of programs to increase the number of new nurses and retain nurses working in health care. </p>
<p>Some of the programs included: </p>
<p>. State-supported growth of nursing student enrollment and programs in community colleges and universities. Napolitano signed Senate Bill 1254 into law in 2005 to appropriate $20 million to increase the number of nursing educators in colleges of nursing, so enrollments can continue to be increased. </p>
<p>. Establishment of a program to prepare internationally educated nurses who reside in the United States for licenses as registered nurses. </p>
<p>. Educational partnerships developed between industry groups to increase the number of graduating nurses and decrease length of time to graduation. </p>
<p>"While the task force's accomplishments are impressive, the nursing shortage is far from over and additional strategies must be urgently undertaken to prevent a health care crisis in the next decade," Melnyk says. "New factors, such as Arizona's rapid growth, an aging baby boomer population and increases in the number of acute care beds, have developed that make it likely that the shortage of nurses in Arizona will worsen." </p>
<p>The nursing shortage in Arizona, despite short-term gains, continues to be worse than in most other states. In acute health care settings in the United States, the average number of registered nurses is 3.3 for every 1,000 people, but in Arizona the ratio is 1.9 registered nurses for every 1,000 people, according to HRSA studies. For all levels of health care, Arizona has 681 nurses per 100,000 population compared to a nationwide average of 782 nurses per 100,000, a 20 percent difference, but an 8.4 percent improvement since 2002. </p>
<p>A recent study published in the journal <em>Health Affairs </em>concluded that increasing the number of nurses and hours of nursing care nationally would save 6,700 lives - and 4 million days of patient care in hospitals - each year. </p>
<p>ASU College of Nursing survey results indicated employment issues such as compensation, job satisfaction and work environment impact turnover, and vacancy and nurse-to-patient ratios in hospitals and correctional facilities in the state. </p>
<p>Respondents to the survey indicated that registered nurse salaries in Arizona metropolitan-area hospitals increased an average of 23 percent - but just 2.4 percent in correctional facilities - since 2001. Despite the compensation increases, hospital turnover and vacancy rates were 14.9 percent and 15.8 percent, respectively. About 30 percent of hospital survey respondents had job vacancy rates greater than 20 percent, which is higher than the national average. </p>
<p>Fifty-six percent of chief nursing officers who responded to the survey believe that there are better patient outcomes, higher job satisfaction among staff nurses, and lower vacancy rates in work environments that employ advance practice nurses to mentor direct care providers in evidence-based practice (EBP). Hospitals reporting the employment of advanced practice nurses as EBP mentors have a registered nurse vacancy rates of 12 percent, compared to the 18 percent vacancy rate of hospitals that do not. </p>
<p>In EBP, the practitioner makes decisions by integrating research with clinical expertise and evidence from the patient's medical history and condition, as well as the patient's preferences and values for treatment. Based on research and the individual's data and values, the clinician then makes a decision with the patient. </p>
<p> &#8220;Clinicians who consider their expertise and the patient&#8217;s desires and values while basing everyday decisions on the best available information we have from research and other objective data, such as quality improvement initiatives, help ensure quality healthcare outcomes for their patients,&#8221; says 


Ellen Fineout-Overholt, director of ASU&#8217;s Center for the Advancement of Evidence-based Practice. &quot;Evidenced-based practice further assists in retaining nurses in that clinicians who care from an EBP philosophy have indicated that it provides them with ownership of their practice. Some nurses who were going to leave the profession credit EBP with turning around their careers and now they are mentoring others in EBP.&#8221; </p>
<p>Melnyk says that about 15 percent of health care providers use EBP for making clinical decisions, while the rest rely upon traditional practices and the provider's own experience. When patients receive care from providers who implement EBP, they can expect 28 percent better health outcomes. </p>
<p>"The nursing shortage is far from over," says Joey Ridenour, executive director of the Arizona State Board of Nursing. "The work of the task force would not be complete without recommendations that build on programs in progress and other identified needs. We look forward to partnering with ASU and other partners to continue the work started by the task force." </p>
<p>Strategies and program recommendations added as supplemental information to the task force's original report include: </p>
<p>. Work with federal legislators to secure matching funds for the Arizona Partnership for Nursing Education (APNE) Demonstration Project. </p>
<p>. Expand the preliminary study on the variables affecting nursing care delivery to include long-term care, outpatient and ambulatory care, and home health. </p>
<p>. Provide ongoing financial support for the Arizona Center for Nursing, pending approval from the National Centers for Nursing. The center will provide a virtual organization that will provide comparative data, work force prediction models and grant information for state, professional organization and educational stakeholders. </p>
<p>. Fund a multi-site study through the Arizona Consortium for the Advancement of Evidence-Based Practice to test the effects of placing advance practice nurses as EBP mentors in health care settings on nurse satisfaction, EBP beliefs, implementation, and nurse retention. This study would support survey findings that EBP has improved health care quality as well as patient outcomes, and could serve as a key strategy for increasing nurse satisfaction and decreasing turnover. </p>
