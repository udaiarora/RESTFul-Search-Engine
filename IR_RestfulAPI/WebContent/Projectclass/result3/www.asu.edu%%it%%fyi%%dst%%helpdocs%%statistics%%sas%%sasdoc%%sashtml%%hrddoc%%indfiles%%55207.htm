Listen and learn everything you need to know to use SAS software for       writing efficient SAS programs to manage data with these audiocasettes.
This two-tape set is the first in the Attitude series by Rick Aster,       author of four outstanding books on SAS software. This humorous but
information-packed tour of the SAS System will talk you through working    with SAS data libraries, creating SAS data sets, and using data set
options to subset and select observations. Also learn to master the art    of manipulating data with SAS procedures, using compression to save disk
space, and creating passwords for protecting SAS data sets.
