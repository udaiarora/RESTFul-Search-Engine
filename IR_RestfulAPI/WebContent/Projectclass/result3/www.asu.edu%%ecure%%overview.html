<p>Managing electronic information is of the most complex and important
challenges in higher education today. Virtually every program and planning
decision made today&nbsp;&#8212; from student information systems and online
courses, to Web-based manuals and recruitment, to expansion of research
efforts&nbsp;&#8212; involves creating and managing electronic records.</p>

<p>At the same time, the legal, policy, and political environments are shifting
rapidly and dramatically. Changes in copyright law, legal discovery practices,
and state and federal records management requirements continually redefine the
environment in which educational institutions operate. Efforts to improve
business systems and increase access through process reengineering raise
questions about the relevance of core services and the need for records that
were once considered vital to the organization. Pressures for increased access
to student transcripts, registration and recruitment materials, and the
intellectual output of institutions in the form of research data, theses and
dissertations, and faculty publication add further complications.</p>

<p>The fifth annual 
<strong><acronym title="Electronic College and University Resources">ECURE</acronym>&nbsp;2005: 
Preservation and Access for Digital College and University Resources
Conference</strong> once again brought together a unique blend of resources
to discuss and analyze the issues related to managing institutional information
in electronic form. The conference partnered knowledgeable individuals from
a range of backgrounds&nbsp;&#8212; comptrollers, attorneys, registrars,
technologists, archivists, academic administrators, and faculty&nbsp;&#8212; to
begin the interdisciplinary dialogue necessary to identify viable solutions and
best practices for management of electronic information and creation,
retention, and disposition of electronic records. The goal was to continue the
dialog begun in 
<acronym title="Digital College and University Resources">ECURE</acronym>&nbsp;1999,
to help participants better understand the issues and challenges, learn about
models for collaboration, and prepare to address the challenges of planning and
managing electronic records in today&#8217;s complex policy, technological, and
political environment.</p>
<p> The <strong>ECURE 2006</strong> program will focus on the topic of bioinformatics, the infrastructure required to collect, sustain and make available associated research data and administrative records, and the policy and regulatory environments that drive this activity at the institutional or national level. Specifically ECURE will seek presenters who are investigating the nature of biomedical research data and designing information systems that accommodate appropriate use, reuse and preservation. Research faculty and administrators, policy analysts, technology professionals, librarians, records managers and archivists would be potential speakers and the target audience for this conference. </p>
