      <h2>Stupid Cupid Awards are made to portrayals that exemplify any of the 
        12 Myths from Dr. FUN!'s Mass Media Love Quiz&copy;.</h2>
      <p><strong>Myth #1. Your perfect partner is cosmically predestined, so nothing/nobody 
        can ultimately separate you.</strong><br>
        Stupid Cupid Awardee: Serendipity<br>
        . . . because there's nothing decent or attractive in the relationship 
        of this couple, who know nothing about each other but nevertheless without 
        a thought or apology dump their decent and attractive fianc&eacute;es 
        for someone magically "meant to be."</p>
      <p><strong>Myth #2. There's such a thing as "love at first sight."</strong><br>
        Stupid Cupid Awardee: Romeo &amp; Juliet (any version)<br>
        . . . because Romeo's already in love with love (and pining Rosaline) 
        when he goes to ball. But the minute he sees Juliet he completely forgets 
        his former love, unleashing a series of tragedies on behalf of mere physical 
        attraction.</p>
      <p><strong>Myth #3. Your true soul mate should KNOW what you're thinking 
        or feeling (without your having to tell).</strong><br>
        Stupid Cupid Awardee: The Princess Bride<br>
        . . . because the eyes have it - and narrator Peter Falk actually tells 
        us what the lovers just "know" is the meaning behind their looks and laconic 
        dialogue.</p>
      <p><strong>Myth #4. If your partner is truly meant for you, sex is easy 
        and wonderful.</strong><br>
        Stupid Cupid Awardee: Television soap operas<br>
        . . . because too often, these daily dramas depict sex as the fundamental 
        and most important element of coupleship that are also too often devoid 
        of friendship or commitment.</p>
      <p><strong>Myth #5. To attract and keep a man, a woman should look like 
        a model or a centerfold.</strong><br>
        Stupid Cupid Awardee: Playboy, Maxim, Cosmo, Seventeen, and other similar 
        magazines<br>
        . . . because the photos and headlines alone on covers of these magazines 
        are enough to make women without surgical enhancements and digital dimensions 
        feel less than desirable and to make men expect something that doesn't 
        exist.</p>
      <p><strong>Myth #6. The man should NOT be shorter, weaker, younger, poorer, 
        or less successful than the woman.</strong><br>
        Stupid Cupid Awardee: Entrapment<br>
        . . . because Sean Connery is old enough not only to be the father of 
        his love interest, Catherine Zeta-Jones, but also her grandfather. While 
        May-December pairings happen in the real world, it's the cinematic norm.</p>
      <p><strong>Myth #7. The love of a good and faithful true woman can change 
        a man from a "beast" into a "prince."</strong><br>
        Stupid Cupid Awardee: As Good As It Gets<br>
        . . . because it erroneously demonstrates that all it takes is an understanding 
        woman (and a cute dog) to make a mean obsessive-compulsive man "want to 
        be a better man" - a loving adequate romantic partner for a harried single 
        mother who has completely different values from the man (Myth #9) who 
        is also twice her age and who rescues her financially (Myth #6). </p>
      <p><strong>Myth #8. Bickering and fighting a lot mean that a man and a woman 
        really love each other passionately.</strong><br>
        Stupid Cupid Awardee: The Mexican<br>
        . . . because the sudden "happy ending" of this movie makes no sense in 
        light of the non-stop bickering, blaming, name-calling, and even physical 
        violence exhibited by the mis-matched couple played by Julia Roberts and 
        Brad Pitt. "When do you get to that point of 'enough is enough'?" she 
        asks him at the end of the movie. His answer: "Never."</p>
      <p><strong>Myth #9. All you really need is love, so it doesn't matter if 
        you and your lover have very different values.</strong><br>
        (TIE)<br>
        Stupid Cupid Awardee: Pretty Woman<br>
        . . . because no genuine transformation takes place in either character 
        at the end of this movie, yet we're supposed to believe that these lovers' 
        vastly different lifestyles and goals - and their vastly different friends 
        - will seamlessly blend. Of course, we never see them living that life 
        together because the movie ends right after step one in the courtship.<br>
        Stupid Cupid Awardee: Maid in Manhattan<br>
        . . . because we're supposed to believe that a woman who genuinely cares 
        about social issues and her job and her coworkers will be happy with a 
        man who seems to care about nothing - not his job (to which he attends 
        only superficially and without the passion needed to run for public office), 
        not his staffers (whom he treats with rude disdain), not even his dog 
        (whom he sloughs off on his campaign manager and a professional dog-walker), 
        and not even the Cinderella who too quickly sleeps with him before he 
        knows her name - and who makes no effort thereafter to find her. (At least 
        the Prince immediately searched door-to-door with the glass slipper!)</p>
      <p><strong>Myth #10. The right mate "completes you" - filling your needs 
        and making your dreams come true.</strong><br>
        Stupid Cupid Awardee: Jerry McGuire<br>
        . . . because this exemplification of the codependency model's dysfunction 
        is pathetic in its suggestion that two incomplete individuals are "eligible" 
        for a romantic relationship. They cling to each other like two drunks 
        clinging to a lamppost. Renee Zellweger's desperation and easy availability 
        no matter how badly Tom Cruise's "Jerry" treats her is painful to watch 
        and useful only as a model of what not to do.</p>
      <p><strong>Myth #11. In real life, actors and actresses are often very much 
        like the romantic characters they portray.</strong><br>
        Stupid Cupid Awardee: Irrational fans of Meg Ryan and Hugh Grant who confuse 
        these stars' reel lives with their real lives.<br>
        . . . because many fans become disappointed when their superstar idols 
        resemble fallible human beings.</p>
      <p><strong>Myth #12. Since mass media portrayals of romance aren't "real," 
        they don't really affect you.</strong><br>
        Stupid Cupid Awardee: Media critics who describe mythic and stereotypic 
        portrayals as "completely harmless."<br>
        . . . because although we can still enjoy mythic portrayals of sex, love, 
        and romance, we shouldn't forget that many people (ourselves included, 
        if we're honest) develop harmful unrealistic expectations from their media 
        usage. To label all these portrayals as completely harmless simply because 
        they're fluffy and vacuous is irresponsible. Critics should know better. 
        (The latest "harmless fluff" is Just Married, a top-grosser in more way 
        than one that offers as an example of motivated honeymoon behavior the 
        bride's throwing an ashtray at her new husband's head - a potentially 
        deadly action that signifies anything but passion and love.</p>
