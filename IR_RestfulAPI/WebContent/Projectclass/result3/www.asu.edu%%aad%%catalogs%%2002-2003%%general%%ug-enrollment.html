Its purpose is the exchange of knowledge and the pursuit of wisdom. ASU is committed to providing a setting where faculty and students are challenged to exchange ideas and information within an atmosphere of intellectual honesty.</p><p>The university offers its students unique opportunities to enjoy both a rich cultural heritage and a diverse student population. Anyone giving evidence of suitable preparation, by way of acceptable academic credentials, is welcome to the university without regard to race, religious creed, or national origin.</p><p>Under the constitution and the laws of the State of Arizona, jurisdiction over ASU has been vested in the Arizona Board of Regents. The regents, in turn, grant broad legal authority to the president, the administration, and the faculty to regulate student life within reasonable limits.</p><p>By enrolling, a student voluntarily assumes certain obligations of conduct and performance. These obligations include acting with honesty, integrity, and fairness in all campus and community activities. They also include avoiding certain behaviors, such as: the irresponsible use of alcohol; the use, possession, or distribution of illegal drugs; and verbal or physical assaults. Should a student intentionally or inadvertently become involved in questionable campus-related actions or activities, the university will investigate the circumstances and will enforce its standards of conduct through prescribed procedures contained in the  <i>Student Code of Conduct.</i></p><p>The primary purpose for the <i>Student Code of Conduct</i> is to set forth the standards of conduct expected of students who choose to join the university community. Students and student organizations are expected to become familiar with and adhere to this code. Violations of the <i>Student Code of Conduct</i> will result in university disciplinary action being taken and appropriate sanctions being imposed for the misconduct. Copies of the <i>Student Code of Conduct</i> are available in the Office of Student Life, SSV 263.</p><p>The university further reserves the right to take necessary and appropriate action to protect the safety and welfare of the campus community and will cooperate with appropriate law enforcement agencies in their efforts to ensure a safe and secure environment.</p><p><a name="student-services-at-asu"></a></p><h2>STUDENT SERVICES AT ASU - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h2><p>Arizona State University is a richly diverse academic setting with more than 49,000 students. The ASU student may be a traditional 18- to 24-year-old, a recent high school graduate, a community college transfer, someone returning to college to pursue a degree, or a professional studying for an advanced degree or career change. The ASU student may live in residence halls, in on-campus housing for sororities or fraternities, or in one of the many communities in the metropolitan Phoenix area. Each of the 50 states and more than 100 countries have students enrolled at ASU.</p><p>The university is organized into several distinct administrative areas. Student Affairs, one of these areas, is responsible for the delivery of a variety of services and developmental programs in support of students&#8217; educational pursuits. These programs and services are based upon human development research that advocates that a person develop culturally, emotionally, intellectually, morally, physically, psychologically, socially, and spiritually.</p><p>Special attention is given not only to the recruitment of a high-achieving, culturally diverse student body, but also to the creation of an energetic campus environment that both catalyzes the mature development and advances the academic endeavors of students.</p><p>Enrollment services to students begin with recruitment, admissions, student financial assistance, on-campus housing, and registration programs. Student Affairs encourages students to explore the facilities, services, and human resources available. ASU departments guiding students in their educational experience include Career Services, Counseling and Consultation, the Memorial Union, Recreational Sports, Residential Life, Student Development, the Student Health and Wellness Center, Student Life, and Student Media. Each of these areas provides specialized learning opportunities, contributing to an environment that fosters both personal and academic growth.</p><p><a name="undergraduate-admission"></a></p><h1>Undergraduate Admission - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h1><p>Arizona State University welcomes an application for admission from any individual seeking to benefit from the university&#8217;s broad spectrum of educational programs and services.</p><p>For information and application materials, prospective students may call 480/965-7788, access the Web site at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/admissions/">www.asu.edu/admissions</a>,  or write </p><p></p><div style="margin: 0em 2em"><font face="verdana, ms sans serif, helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="-1">UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS<br />ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY<br />PO BOX 870112<br />TEMPE AZ 85287-0112</font></div><p></p><p>Undergraduate Admissions offers tours of ASU, University Information Sessions, and admission appointments Monday through Friday (except days that are official university holidays).

As with other state-supported colleges and universities, ASU distinguishes between resident and nonresident students with regard to tuition. Residents of Arizona are required to provide residency information, which is part of the admission application. Any student who does not provide residency information is classified as a nonresident for tuition purposes. For more information, call the Residency Classification Office at 480/965-7712.</p><p>Students who are admitted for a specific semester and do not enroll must submit a new application (and application fee for nonresident applicants) if they wish to apply for a subsequent semester. All documents are destroyed one year after the semester for which the student has applied if the student is not enrolled in a degree program. Any misrepresentation or falsification on the admission application, including failure to report any college or university attendance, is cause for cancellation of enrollment and any credits earned.</p><p><a name="application-fee"></a></p><p><b>Application Fee.</b> All applicants applying as nonresidents or residing outside Arizona must submit a $50 nonrefundable application fee.</p><p><a name="official-transcripts"></a></p><p><b>Official Transcripts.</b> Applicants are responsible for requesting transcripts from each educational institution attended.

Admission is official when verification of high school graduation showing the final GPA and the date of graduation has been received in the mail by Undergraduate Admissions directly from the high school. Final transcripts must be received a minimum of 45 days in advance of the start of the semester. An admission may be canceled if the final verification shows that the applicant has not met the university requirements for admission or that more than two deficiencies remain.</p><p>Transfer applicants enrolled in other colleges and universities may be considered for admission on the basis of meeting all admissions requirements, except for a final transcript of work in progress. This final transcript must be sent to Undergraduate Admissions directly from the issuing institution immediately after the work in progress has been completed. Transcripts carried by hand are not accepted. <i>Admission is official only after the final transcript has been received showing that the applicant has met the university admission requirements.</i> In the event the applicant does not qualify or has falsified application documents, admission and registration are canceled, and any registration fees paid are returned.</p><p><a name="undergraduate-admission-standards"></a></p><h3>Undergraduate Admission Standards - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>The Arizona Board of Regents establishes undergraduate admission standards for the university in general. <i>Particular colleges, divisions, schools, or departments within the university may establish stricter standards, which are given in the respective sections of the catalog and should be noted by students planning to enroll in any of these programs.</i></p><p><a name="freshman-applicants"></a></p><h3>Freshman Applicants - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Undergraduate Admissions requires freshman applicants&#8217; official high school records.

Community college students who plan to transfer to ASU at the end of their first or second years are strongly advised to follow the ASU transfer guides when taking courses to meet the requirements of the curricula they select. ASU transfer guides are available at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/provost/articulation/">www.asu.edu/provost/articulation</a>. Provided college attendance has been continuous, students are permitted to follow the degree requirements specified in the ASU catalog in effect at the time they began community college work.

This curriculum provides students attending any Arizona public community college with the opportunity to build a general education program that is transferable to any other state institution without loss of credit. This common agreement is called the Arizona General Education Curriculum (AGEC).</p><p>The AGEC is composed of 35 semester hours of lower-division general education course work in which a student may prepare for transfer.</p><p>The AGEC has three forms: AGEC-A, AGEC-B, and AGEC-S. Refer to <a href="http://www.az.transfer.org/cas/atass/student/agec.html">www.az.transfer.org/cas/atass/student/agec.html</a> for a detailed description of each AGEC.</p><p>Community colleges are responsible for certifying completion of the AGEC on the official institutional transcripts.</p><p>Completion of the appropriate AGEC will fulfill university lower-division general education requirements of the baccalaureate degree with which the AGEC articulates but may not apply to degrees articulated with the Transfer Guide Pathway TG-XR. Students completing the AGEC will still be required to fulfill lower-division program requirements and prerequisites within their college and major/minor area of study. To complete a degree program most efficiently, students should select courses that concurrently satisfy AGEC and major requirements.</p><p>Completion of any AGEC guarantees admission to the university provided that a GPA of 2.00 (for Arizona residents) or 2.50 (for nonresidents) has been achieved. AGEC completion, however, does not guarantee admission to any specific university program. Majors in the professional fields (e.g., architecture, engineering, business, fine/creative arts, or health professions) and sciences have significant prerequisites and/or program requirements that must be completed before a student may be admitted to upper-division course work. Community college students who are undecided about which of the universities they plan to attend or what program of study they intend to pursue are advised to explore educational options while they complete the AGEC. In all cases, students have the responsibility for selecting general education course work that is relevant to the requirements of their intended major and degree.</p><p>Students who complete both the AGEC and an approved associate&#8217;s degree will be assigned junior-class standing by the state universities. Junior-class standing is based on the number of semester credits a student has earned and does not necessarily indicate the remaining number of semester credits needed to complete degree requirements. Course prerequisites, major requirements, and upper-division requirements continue to be specified by each university. Appropriate sequencing of courses and timely completion of course prerequisites are essential to ensure efficient progress toward a baccalaureate degree. Students who have identified the university they plan to attend and/or a major area of study are advised to fulfill requirements and prerequisites identified by these programs through transfer guides and/or curriculum check sheets provided by the state universities. The AGEC does not replace articulation agreements developed to enhance the transfer process between specific institutions, e.g., Associate Transfer Partnership Degrees (ATP). Nor does the AGEC eliminate the possibility that students who have identified the university they plan to attend and/or a major area of study will follow transfer guides provided by the state universities.</p><p><a name="appeal-procedure"></a></p><p><b>Appeal Procedure.</b> Transfer students who feel they have been unjustly denied credit for courses they have taken may appeal to the standards committee of the colleges in which they have enrolled. This procedure does not apply to community college transfer of credit greater than the 64-hour maximum. The decision of this committee is final.</p><p>An applicant for transfer admission whose academic record fails to meet ASU admission standards is denied admission. Such an applicant, however, may write a letter of appeal accompanied by three letters of recommendation to the Undergraduate Admissions Board for reconsideration of his or her application:</p><p></p><div style="margin: 0em 2em"><font face="verdana, ms sans serif, helvetica, arial, sans-serif" size="-1">UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS BOARD<br />ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY<br />PO BOX 870112<br />TEMPE AZ 85287-0112</font></div><p></p><p>To be considered, appeals must be received at least ten days in advance of the board&#8217;s meeting date.

Applications are given only for courses listed in the current catalog and only for courses in which a comprehensive examination can serve as a satisfactory measure of accomplishment.</p><p>A number of restrictions apply. The student must be enrolled at ASU with <i>no more than 100 semester hours of credit earned</i>. The examinations must be taken during the first two semesters in residence in a degree program at the university. <i>No more than 60 semester hours of credit may be established by comprehensive examinations</i> (including AP, IB, and CLEP credit) and independent learning courses.</p><p>Comprehensive examinations may not be taken in any course in which the student has been given admission credit or transfer credit from any educational institution. Examination credit may not be received for a lower-level or prerequisite course when credit has already been received in a higher-level course within the same field.</p><p>The decision on the suitability of course material for a comprehensive examination, the development of a comprehensive examination, and the administration of an examination are strictly departmental functions. An application is for one course only. The student should complete an application form with the number, title, and number of semester hours for the course. When completed, the application must be approved by the student&#8217;s advisor and the chair of the department responsible for offering the course.</p><p>The student must then pay the stated fee for such examinations at Cashiering Services. The receipt must be taken to the departmental office.</p><p>The examination is prepared by the instructor who normally conducts the course, and it is comprehensive in nature and scope. The instructor and other experts designated by the chair grade the examination, using letter grades &#8220;A,&#8221; &#8220;B,&#8221; &#8220;C,&#8221; &#8220;D,&#8221; or &#8220;E.&#8221; If the grade is &#8220;C&#8221; or higher, a mark of &#8220;Y&#8221; is entered on the student&#8217;s permanent record; otherwise, no entry is made. Credit by examination is indicated as such on the record. The student is notified by mail of the result of the examination. In cases of failure (&#8220;D&#8221; or &#8220;E&#8221;), the student is not given an opportunity to repeat the examination.</p><p>A student pursuing a second baccalaureate degree may not receive credit by comprehensive examination, but, with prior approval of the college, the student may use the examination to waive a course requirement if a grade of &#8220;C&#8221; or higher is earned.</p><p><a name="proficiency-examinations"></a></p><p><b>Proficiency Examinations.</b> Proficiency examinations and auditions are given</p><ol><li>to waive a course requirement;<br />&nbsp;</li><li>to validate certain transfer credits in professional programs; and<br />&nbsp;</li><li>to determine a student&#8217;s ability in a field where competence is an important consideration.<br />&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Detailed information may be obtained from the dean&#8217;s office of the college in which the student is registered.</p><p><a name="university-testing-requirements"></a></p><h2>UNIVERSITY TESTING REQUIREMENTS - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h2><p>All new, transfer, or readmitted undergraduate students who plan to enroll for seven or more semester hours must meet one of the following testing requirements. <i>Students who fail to meet at least one of these requirements will not be allowed to register for any course the following semester.</i></p><ol><li>Take the ACT English or SAT verbal examination and have scores submitted to ASU.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Receive a score of 4 or 5 for the advanced placement examination in English offered by the College Entrance Examination Board and have scores submitted to ASU.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Take the CLEP general examination in English, earning a score that qualifies for placement in ENG 105, and have scores submitted to ASU.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Have previously taken <a href="../../spring_2003/eng.html#eng101">ENG 101</a>, <a href="../../spring_2003/eng.html#eng102">102</a>, <a href="../../spring_2003/eng.html#eng105">105</a>, <a href="../../spring_2003/eng.html#eng107">107</a>, or <a href="../../spring_2003/eng.html#eng108">108</a> at ASU and received a grade of &#8220;D&#8221; or higher.

The university is committed to providing quality advising to continuing, first-time, and transfer students. To achieve the highest-quality advising, students, faculty, and staff must work to form a partnership. Each college has advisors to assist students in developing programs of study, assessing educational goals, and understanding rules, procedures, and curriculum requirements. In some colleges, these advisors are faculty members. In others, they are full-time, professional advisors. Students often may seek academic and career advice from both faculty members and full-time advisors. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the skill and knowledge of the advising professionals available to them. Most new students and many continuing students must meet with an advisor as a condition of registration. </p><p>An additional unit, Academic Advising Services, is a central advising, referral, and information facility whose staff is available to assist students in their academic careers at ASU. Emphasis is placed on advising services to first-time, prospective, transfer, and visiting students and students in transition, such as those changing majors and those without majors. Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies majors (B.I.S. or pre-B.I.S.) also receive academic advising in Academic Advising Services. In addition to guidance in the exploration or selection of a major, Academic Advising Services provides general academic information and referrals to all areas of student academic support. For more information, visit Academic Advising Services in UASB 129, or call 480/965-4464.</p><p>Students are strongly encouraged to seek academic advising at the earliest possible time and to do so regularly throughout their academic careers, whether or not advising is mandatory in their particular programs. Advisors may be contacted at the locations and times shown in the &#8220;<a href="#academic-advising-at-asu-main-table">Academic Advising at ASU Main</a>&#8221; table.

Nonresident applicants must submit a nonrefundable $40 application fee. If, meanwhile, the student has attended another accredited college or university, it is necessary for the student to have on file an official transcript of all academic work taken. Failure to report such attendance is considered misrepresentation and falsification of university records. In addition, it is considered cause for Records Hold action and withholding of further registration privileges. An applicant for readmission must meet the requirements for good standing. See &#8220;<a href="#retention-and-academic-standards">Retention and Academic Standards</a>&#8221; and the requirements of the college to which the application is being made. An applicant who has been denied readmission may appeal to the University Undergraduate Admissions Board. Nondegree applicants for readmission must have a minimum GPA of 2.00. If not, the applicant must apply to ASU through Undergraduate Admissions.</p><p><a name="conditional-readmission"></a></p><p><b>Conditional Readmission.</b> A student completing academic work in progress at another institution may be granted conditional readmission. This conditional status remains effective until a final official transcript is received. The student is subject to Records Hold action, and additional registration privileges are withheld if this condition for readmission is not cleared by midsemester.</p><p><a name="academic-renewal"></a></p><h1>Academic Renewal - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h1><p>Academic renewal is a university policy administered for the purpose of recalculating the ASU cumulative GPA of undergraduate students who have been readmitted to a degree program after an absence of at least five continuous calendar years including summer sessions and who have completed in good standing a minimum of 12 college-approved additional hours in residence within three semesters after reentry. Students may have the former academic record before the five-year absence (including transfer credits) accepted in the same manner as if the credits were transfer credits. That is, earned hours are carried forward for up to 60 hours of credit in which a grade of &#8220;C&#8221; or higher was earned. The cumulative GPA is based only on credits earned subsequent to the student&#8217;s reentry. All graduation residency, academic recognition residency, and GPA requirements must be fulfilled after academic renewal.</p><p>A request for academic renewal follows this procedure:</p><ol><li>Students interested in academic renewal must request the Application for Academic Renewal from the Readmission Section of the Office of the Registrar or the dean of the college offering the major.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>The Application for Academic Renewal may be submitted immediately upon readmission but not later than the start of the third semester after readmission.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>The Application for Academic Renewal is submitted by the student to the dean of the college offering the major.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>The dean specifies in advance a minimum of 12 semester hours.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>When the approved credits are completed with a cumulative GPA of 2.50 or higher, and no grade lower than &#8220;C&#8221; in each course, the dean forwards the Application for Academic Renewal to the Office of the Registrar for processing.<br />&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Only students working toward their first undergraduate degree are eligible to apply for academic renewal, which may be effected only once during a student&#8217;s academic career. Academic renewal is transferable among colleges. All students with ASU GPAs below 2.00 are eligible to petition for academic renewal. Individual colleges may elect to entertain petitions for academic renewal from students with ASU GPAs above 2.00. College standards committees have final authorization on academic renewal petitions. Eligibility for graduation is based on the ASU cumulative GPA after academic renewal. However, a student&#8217;s complete record--before and after academic renewal--remains on the transcript and may be taken into consideration when a student applies for undergraduate professional or graduate programs.</p><p><a name="registration"></a></p><h1>Registration - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h1><p>All persons attending a class at ASU must be registered for that class. A student is considered to be registered when all registration fees have been paid in full.</p><p><a name="eligibility"></a></p><p><b>Eligibility.</b> Only eligible students may register for courses at ASU.

The maximum course load for which a student may register is 18 semester hours (with the exception of a 19-hour maximum for students enrolled in the Colleges of Engineering and Applied Sciences or Architecture and Environmental Design). A student wishing to register for more than the maximum must petition the standards committee of the college in which the student is enrolled and must obtain an approved override before registration. See &#8220;<a href="#summer-session-semester-hour-load">Summer Session Semester Hour Load</a>,&#8221; in this section, for summer course load information.</p><p><a name="reserving-of-course-credit-by-undergraduates"></a></p><p><b>Reserving of Course Credit by Undergraduates.</b> Seniors at ASU within 12 semester hours of graduation may enroll in a 400-level or graduate course and reserve the credit for possible use in a future graduate program. The course cannot be used to meet a baccalaureate graduation requirement. Before registration in the course, the student must submit a Graduate College Petition form requesting credit reservation. The form must be signed by the student&#8217;s advisor, the head of the academic unit offering the class, and the dean of the Graduate College.</p><p>Permission to reserve a course does not guarantee admission to a graduate degree program or that the course may be used toward graduate degree requirements. A maximum of nine semester hours may be reserved, and only courses in which the student earned an &#8220;A&#8221; or &#8220;B&#8221; grade are applicable. Reserved credit earned before admission to a graduate degree program is classified as nondegree credit. The maximum course load for a student enrolled in a reserved course is 15 semester hours during a regular semester and six hours during a summer session.</p><p><a name="summer-session-semester-hour-load"></a></p><p><b>Summer Session Semester Hour Load.</b> The summer session semester hour load limit is seven semester hours for each five-week session and nine semester hours for the eight-week session.

A minimum of 45 hours of work by each student is required for each unit of credit. An hour of work represents a minimum of 50 minutes of class time &#8212; often called a &#8220;contact hour&#8221; &#8212; or 60 minutes of independent study work. For lecture-discussion courses, this requirement equates to at least 15 contact hours and a minimum of 30 hours of work outside the classroom for each unit of credit. Even though the values of 15 and 30 may vary for different modes of instruction, the minimum total of 45 hours of work for each unit of credit is a constant. Since the unit of credit as defined by the Arizona Board of Regents is the cornerstone of academic degree programs at ASU, degrees granted by other institutions that are recognized by ASU should be based on a similar unit of credit. </p><p><a name="grades-and-marks"></a></p><h3>Grades and Marks - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>All grades and marks appear on the permanent record and/or unofficial transcript.</p><p>They are indicated by the letters shown in the &#8220;<a href="#grades-table">Grades</a>&#8221; table.</p><p><a name="grades-table"></a></p><div style="text-align: center;"><font size="+1"><b>Grades</b></font><!--<br /><font size="-1">[<a href="grades-text-table.html">D</a> &#8212; Description of table]</font>--></div><hr /><div style="text-align: center;"><table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"><tr><th align="left" width="50">Grade<hr /></th><th align="left" width="150">Definition<hr /></th><th align="left" width="50">Value<hr /></th></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td valign="top">Excellent</td><td valign="top">4.00 </td></tr>  <tr><td valign="top">B</td><td valign="top">Good</td><td valign="top">3.00</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C</td><td valign="top">Average</td><td valign="top">2.00</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">D</td><td valign="top">Passing </td><td valign="top">1.00</td></tr> <tr><td valign="top">E</td><td valign="top">Failure</td><td valign="top">0.00</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">I</td><td valign="top">Incomplete </td><td> &#8212; </td></tr> <tr><td valign="top">NR</td><td valign="top">No report </td><td> &#8212; </td></tr> <tr><td valign="top">P</td><td valign="top">Pass </td><td> &#8212; </td></tr> <tr><td valign="top">RC*</td><td valign="top">Remedial credit</td><td> &#8212; </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">RN*</td><td valign="top">Remedial no credit</td><td> &#8212; </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">W</td><td valign="top">Withdrawal</td><td> &#8212; </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">X</td><td valign="top">Audit</td><td> &#8212; </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Y</td><td valign="top">Satisfactory</td><td> &#8212; </td></tr></table></div><hr /><table><tr><td valign="top">*</td><td valign="top">This grade appears on only unofficial copies of ASU transcripts. - <a href="#top"><font size="-1">Back to Top</font></a></td></tr></table><p><a name="end-of-grades-table"></a></p><p><a name="grading-options"></a></p><h3>Grading Options - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3> <p>Ordinarily a grade of &#8220;A,&#8221; &#8220;B,&#8221; &#8220;C,&#8221; &#8220;D,&#8221; or &#8220;E&#8221; is given upon completion of a course, unless a grading option of &#8220;audit&#8221; or &#8220;pass/fail&#8221; is indicated at the time of registration. <i>Grading options cannot be changed after the close of the drop/add period</i>. </p><p><a name="incomplete"></a></p><h3>Incomplete - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>A mark of &#8220;I&#8221; (incomplete) is given by the instructor only when a student who is otherwise doing acceptable work is unable to complete a course because of illness or other conditions beyond the student&#8217;s control.

The preceding does not apply to audit enrollment or zero-hour labs and recitations.</p><p><a name="procedure-for-restricted-withdrawal"></a></p><p><b>Procedure for Restricted Withdrawal.</b> A student seeking a restricted withdrawal needs to </p><ol><li>obtain a withdrawal form from any registrar site;<br />&nbsp;</li><li>obtain a signature and verification of grade from instructor(s); and<br />&nbsp;</li><li>have the form processed at any registrar site.<br />&nbsp;</li></ol><p><a name="instructor-initiated-withdrawal"></a></p><h3>Instructor-Initiated Withdrawal - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>An instructor may withdraw a student from a course with a mark of &#8220;W&#8221; or a grade of &#8220;E&#8221; only if the student&#8217;s continued presence in the course is disruptive to the instructor&#8217;s ability to conduct the course. A student may appeal an instructor-initiated withdrawal within 10 days of being withdrawn to the standards committee of the college in which the course is offered. The decision of the committee is final. Restricted withdrawal limits do not apply to withdrawals initiated by an instructor.</p><p><a name="withdrawal-from-the-university"></a></p><h3>Withdrawal from the University - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>To withdraw from <i>all</i> classes after having paid registration fees, a student must submit a request in person, withdraw using SunDial, or submit a signed request to the Office of the Registrar. The SunDial complete withdrawal option is only available through the first week of classes for a semester. During the unrestricted complete withdrawal period, a student may withdraw from all courses with marks of &#8220;W.&#8221; During the restricted complete withdrawal period, a student may withdraw with marks of &#8220;W&#8221; only from courses that the instructors certify the student was passing at the time of withdrawal. See the <i>Schedule of Classes</i> or the <i>Summer Sessions Bulletin</i> for dates of the complete withdrawal periods. No one is permitted to withdraw from the university or to conduct any registration transaction in the last two weeks of the semester. The date of the complete withdrawal is always the date the withdrawal form or letter is received in the Office of the Registrar.</p><p><a name="medical-compassionate-withdrawal"></a></p><h3>Medical/Compassionate Withdrawal - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>A medical/compassionate withdrawal request may be made in extraordinary cases where serious illness or injury (medical) or another significant personal situation (compassionate) prevents a student from continuing in his or her classes, and where incompletes or other arrangements with the instructor are not possible. Usually, consideration is for complete withdrawal. All applications for withdrawal require thorough and credible documentation. Application for less than a complete withdrawal must be especially well documented to justify the selective nature of the medical/compassionate withdrawal request. </p><p>A student may request and be considered for a <i>medical</i> withdrawal when extraordinary circumstances, such as a serious illness or injury, prevent the student from continuing in classes. This policy covers both physical-health and mental-health difficulties.</p><p>A student may request and be considered for a <i>compassionate</i> withdrawal when extraordinary personal reasons, not related to the student&#8217;s physical or mental health (for example, care of a seriously ill child or spouse, or a death in the student&#8217;s immediate family), prevent the student from continuing in classes.</p><p>Each college has a dean&#8217;s representative (medical/compassionate withdrawal designee) to review medical/compassionate withdrawal requests, according to that college&#8217;s procedures. A student requesting a medical/compassionate withdrawal is referred to the dean&#8217;s designee of the college of the major. A nondegree student is referred to the dean&#8217;s designee of the college with which he or she is primarily affiliated. The dean&#8217;s designee determines the appropriateness of the medical/compassionate withdrawal request and whether an administrative hold is indicated. Removal of the hold must be authorized by the designee before the student can register for a future semester or be readmitted to the university. </p><p>The medical/compassionate withdrawal procedure results in a special note line on the unofficial transcript. Refunds are not given beyond six months past the close of the semester. Only one Request for Documented Medical/Compassionate Withdrawal form needs to be filed with the college of the major, even if classes in more than one college are involved. Medical/compassionate withdrawal applications and supporting documents are retained and filed separately from the student&#8217;s other records.</p><p><a name="grade-points"></a></p><h2>GRADE POINTS - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h2><p>For the purpose of computing the grade point average (GPA), grade points are assigned to each of the grades for each semester hour as follows: &#8220;A,&#8221; four points; &#8220;B,&#8221; three points; &#8220;C,&#8221; two points; &#8220;D,&#8221; one point; &#8220;E,&#8221; zero points.

For example, receiving an &#8220;A,&#8221; which is assigned four grade points, in a three-semester-hour course would produce 12 honor points. The grade point average (GPA) is obtained by dividing the total number of honor points earned by the total number of semester hours graded &#8220;A,&#8221; &#8220;B,&#8221; &#8220;C,&#8221; &#8220;D,&#8221; or &#8220;E.&#8221; Other grades do not carry grade points. <i>Semester</i> GPA is based on <i>semester</i> net hours. <i>Cumulative</i> GPA is based on <i>total</i> net hours.</p><p><a name="change-of-grade"></a></p><h3>Change of Grade - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Ordinarily the instructor of a course has the sole and final responsibility for any grade reported. Once the grade has been reported to the registrar, it may be changed upon the signed authorization of the faculty member who issued the original grade. Approval for the change is also required by the department chair and the dean of the college concerned. This policy also applies to the grade of &#8220;I&#8221; (incomplete).</p><p><a name="university-policy-for-student-appeal-procedures-on-grades"></a></p><h3>University Policy for Student Appeal Procedures on Grades - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p><a name="informal"></a></p><p><b>Informal.</b> The steps outlined on this page, beginning with step A, must be followed by any student seeking to appeal a grade. Student grade appeals must be processed in the regular semester immediately following the issuance of the grade in dispute (by commencement for fall or spring), regardless of whether the student is enrolled at the university. It is university policy that students filing grievances and those who are witnesses are protected from retaliation. Students who believe they are victims of retaliation should immediately contact the dean of the college in which the course is offered.</p><ol type="A"><li>The aggrieved student must first undergo the informal procedure of conferring with the instructor, stating the evidence, if any, and reasons for questioning that the grade received was not given in good faith. The instructor is obliged to review the matter, explain the grading procedure used, and show how the grade in question was determined. If the instructor is a graduate assistant and this interview does not resolve the difficulty, the student may then go to the faculty member in charge of the course (regular faculty member or director of the course sequence) with the problem.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>If the grading dispute is not resolved in step A, the student may appeal to the department chair or other appropriate chair of the area within the department (if any). The department chair may confer with the instructor to handle the problem. Step B applies only in departmentalized colleges.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>If these discussions are not adequate to settle the matter to the complainant&#8217;s satisfaction, the student may then confer with the dean of the college concerned (or the dean-designate), who will review the case. If unresolved, the dean or designate may refer the case to the college academic grievance hearing committee to review the case formally. In most instances, however, the grievance procedure does not go beyond this level.</li></ol><p><a name="formal"></a></p><p><b>Formal.</b> The following procedure takes place after steps A, B, and C (or A and C) have been completed.</p><ol type="A" start="4"><li>Each college has on file in the office of the dean (and in each department of the college) the procedures and composition of the undergraduate or graduate academic grievance hearing committee for student grievances. Each college committee shall operate under grievance procedures as stated which satisfy due process requirements. The committee shall always meet with the student and the instructor in an attempt to resolve the differences. At the conclusion of the hearing, the committee shall send its recommendations to the dean.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Final action in each case will be taken by the dean after full consideration of the committee&#8217;s recommendation. Grade changes, if any are recommended, may be made by the dean. The dean shall inform the student, instructor, department chair (if any), the registrar, and the grievance committee of any action taken.<br />&nbsp;</li></ol><p><a name="repeating-courses"></a></p><h3>Repeating Courses - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>An undergraduate course taken at ASU may be repeated for credit if the grade of &#8220;D,&#8221; &#8220;E,&#8221; or &#8220;W&#8221; or a mark of &#8220;X&#8221; is received. An undergraduate student may not repeat for credit an undergraduate course in which a grade of &#8220;C&#8221; or better is earned. Undergraduate courses in which grades of &#8220;D&#8221; or &#8220;E&#8221; are received may be repeated only once. After an undergraduate student repeats 100- and 200-level courses, the student&#8217;s transcript shows both grades, but the student&#8217;s cumulative GPA reflects only the higher grade. After an undergraduate student repeats 300- or 400-level courses, the student&#8217;s cumulative GPA and the transcript reflect both grades.</p><p>After completing the course, the student must file a Deletion Form with the Office of the Registrar. To be eligible for the deletion of &#8220;D&#8221; or &#8220;E&#8221; grades, the course must be repeated at ASU. Independent Learning courses may not be used to repeat &#8220;D&#8221; or &#8220;E&#8221; grades. Students who have graduated are not eligible to delete the grade for a course taken before the award of the ASU bachelor&#8217;s degree.</p><p>Students wishing to repeat a class for the third time with grades of &#8220;D&#8221; or &#8220;E&#8221; must petition the standards committee of the college in which they are enrolled. This policy does not apply to seminar and independent study courses with different content each semester. This policy affects only undergraduate students and undergraduate courses.</p><p><a name="demonstration-of-mastery"></a></p><h3>Demonstration of Mastery - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>An undergraduate student who receives a &#8220;D&#8221; in a course in which a &#8220;C&#8221; or higher is required may use the grade from an equivalent course taken elsewhere to demonstrate mastery at the &#8220;C&#8221; or higher level.

Merely having remained in a suspended status for a period of time does not, in itself, constitute a basis for reinstatement.</p><p><a name="student-records"></a></p><h1>Student Records - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h1><p><a name="family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-of-1974"></a></p><h3>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, also known as the Buckley Amendment or FERPA, sets forth the requirements governing the protection of the privacy of educational records of students who are or have been in attendance at ASU.</p><p><a name="definitions"></a></p><h3>Definitions - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p><a name="eligible-student"></a></p><p><b>Eligible Student.</b> For the purpose of this act, an <i>eligible student</i> is defined as any individual formally admitted to and enrolled at ASU.</p><p><a name="record"></a></p><p><b>Record.</b> The term <i>record</i> includes any information or data recorded in any medium, including, but not limited to, handwriting, print, tapes, film, microfilm, microfiche, and electronic means.</p><p><a name="types-of-information"></a></p><h3>Types of Information - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p><a name="education-record"></a></p><p><b>Education Record.</b> The term <i>education record</i> refers to those records directly related to a student and maintained by an educational institution. Two types of education records are subject to the provisions of this act: (1) directory information and (2) personally identifiable information. The term does not include those records specifically excluded by Section 99.3 of the privacy act.</p><p><a name="directory-information"></a></p><p><b>Directory Information.</b> The term <i>directory information</i> includes the following student information: name, local, permanent and ASU e-mail addresses, local telephone number, date of birth, residency status, academic level, major field of study, college of enrollment, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student.</p><p><a name="personally-identifiable-information"></a></p><p><b>Personally Identifiable Information.</b> The term<i> personally identifiable information</i> includes all information not defined as directory information. This includes, but is not limited to, the name of a student&#8217;s parent or other family member(s), a personal identifier such as the student&#8217;s ASU ID number or Social Security number, a list of personal characteristics, or other information that would make the student&#8217;s identity easily traceable and any information, including directory information, that the student has indicated should not be released.</p><p><a name="access-to-records"></a></p><h3>Access to Records - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>An eligible student may inspect and review his or her own education records. Some form of photo identification must be displayed before access to education records is allowed.</p><p>Directory information may be released to anyone without consent of the student unless the student has indicated otherwise. Students may request that this information not be released by completing a form in the Office of the Registrar. A request to withhold this information excludes the student from being listed in the annual directory only if the request is submitted to the Office of the Registrar before the end of the third week of the fall semester.</p><p>All other education records that contain personally identifiable information may not be released without the written consent of the student. A parent of a dependent student may challenge denial of such access by producing the most current copy of Internal Revenue Form 1040. If that form lists the student in question as a dependent, the parent is required to sign an affidavit that affirms that the student is his or her dependent. The affidavit is retained by the Office of the Registrar. Upon receipt of the affidavit, the university may make student records available to the parent for the rest of that calendar year as specified under the Buckley Amendment.</p><p>Students may grant access to individuals or agencies by completing a form in the Office of the Registrar.</p><p><a name="location-of-policy-and-records"></a></p><h3>Location of Policy and Records - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>The custodian of education records at ASU is the Office of the Registrar. Copies of this policy are available in the following offices: Reserve sections of Hayden Library and the Noble Science and Engineering Library, the Office of the Registrar, Undergraduate and Graduate Admissions, and Student Life. The Office of the Registrar also maintains a directory that lists all education records maintained on students by ASU.</p><p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="#top"><font size="-1">Back to Top</font></a></div><p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="index.html"><font size="-1">2002 &#8211; 2003 <i>General Catalog</i> Table of Contents</font></a></div><p><img src="maroonhr.gif" width="100%" height="2" alt="maroon horizontal rule" /></p><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><font face="helvetica, arial, ms sans serif, sans-serif" size="-1">Page Last Updated:February 28, 2003 | Visits to this page: <img src="/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?pad=0|dd=E|ft=0|tr=T|trgb=ffffff|df=ickim-2002-2003general-ug-enrollment-html.dat" alt="page counter" /> | <a href="mailto:aad@asu.edu">Web Site Feedback</a> | <a href="http://www.asu.edu/copyright/">Copyright</a> &copy; Arizona Board of Regents</font></td></tr></table><table><tr><td align="center"><a href="http://validator.w3.org/check/referer"><img        src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10"        alt="Valid XHTML 1.0!" height="31" width="88" border="0"/></a> </td></tr></table></body></html>
