        will build from its already interdisciplinary basis to approach the education         of all students in all fields in a connected learning environment. In         this beautiful campus setting the watchwords for learning will be community         focus and group learning across fields. This will allow for new thinking         to be done, and new kinds of teachers, scientists, artists, and other         specialists to be produced. </p>      <p> A professional degree from the New College will mark its recipient as         broadly educated. Graduates entering the field of teaching, for example,         will be recognized as grounded in literature, aware of history, and excited         by politics and science. Because all of these are inextricably intertwined         in the world, they will be connected in our learning environment. <br>      </p>      &nbsp;<BR> </td>    <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
