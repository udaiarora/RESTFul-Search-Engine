	 <P>Will be processed as follows</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Department will send HPR to HR-Customer Service Center <B>immediately
		  after job</B> <B>acceptance </B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">(please process HPR with
		  employee's full name, as it appears on their social security card or passport).
		  </FONT>Please submit using new <A HREF="../forms/index.html">HPR form</A>.
		  </LI>
		<LI>If employee is new to campus (never attended ASU as a student), HR
		  <B>will </B>assign an ASU ID # for this employee (employee will be entered
		  under this id #, and not their social security #). Otherwise, HR will use the
		  id # already assigned to individual. </LI>
		<LI>HR will enter Screens 3 and 4 for newhire based on information from
		  the HPR. In addition, HR will enter a partial screen. 5 with HR's address and a
		  dummy date of birth = 1/1/1905. (This information is needed to allow HRMS to
		  interface with the other systems on campus.) </LI>
		<LI>Employee can
		  <A
			HREF="http://www.asu.edu/asuweb/jukebox/webpages/selfsub.html">self-subscribe
		  for as ASURITE user id</A> after 2 days (once other systems are updated).<B>
		  </B></LI>
		<LI>PLEASE NOTE, EMPLOYEE WILL NOT RECEIVE PAY UNLESS HR RECEIVES THE NEW
		  EMPLOYEE PAYROLL PACKET! Once packet is received, HR will update screen 5 with
		  corrected address and date of birth information. </LI> 
	 </UL>
	 <P>Grad students will be entered in HRMS when both HPR and completed new
		employee payroll packet are received in HR-Customer Service Center. (Please
		check screen 5 in HRMS for a complete screen setup - if employee is set up with
		HR address and date of birth = 1/1/1905, employee has NOT completed new
		employee payroll packet and will NOT get paid until they do so. Some grad
		students were entered as part of our testing of this new process, and do not
		have a complete HRMS record in order to receive pay.)</P> 
	 <P>So help us, help your employees - send your HPRs in as soon as the
		employee accepts the position. This will give HR time to set their record up in
		HRMS, and flow through the university's computer systems to allow them access
		to the services they need, on their first day of employment. Thank you!</P>
