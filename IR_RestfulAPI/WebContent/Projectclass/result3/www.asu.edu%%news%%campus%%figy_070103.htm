      <h2>Figy helps build mind, body through recreation therapy</h2>
      <p>        There are only two rules John Figy has for his clients. 1. You're important.
          2. If you don't believe you're important, refer back to rule number
        one. </p>
      <p>Figy, program coordinator in Adaptive Recreation, has worked at
            the Student Recreation Complex (SRC) at ASU for the last 28 years
        helping many people.
          He assists those with temporary or long-term disabilities in their
        athletic pursuits and eases their pain through relaxation exercises.</p>
      <p>"We show you
          how to use the application of movement and the application of exercise,"
          Figy said. </p>
      <p>Figy's interest in adaptive recreation stems
          from when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy as a medic. When he was given
          a physical on his birthday
          in 1969 he was declared "4-F," which meant he was disabled from military
          service. When Figy saw his friends coming back from the war with different
          disabilities he felt he was saved so he could help others. </p>
      <p>Figy went
          on to work for Recreational Sports at ASU and graduate with a degree
          in leisure studies with an emphasis in therapeutic and community
          recreation. He held a job in the Phoenix county hospital in physical
          therapy from 1972 to 74, where one of his patients was Diana Polaski,
          the director of Disability Resources at ASU. It was Polaski and Keith
          Jacobson, director of Intermurals, Club Sports and Recreation that
        hired Figy to start an adaptive recreation program at the SRC. </p>
      <p>Figy is in charge
          of many programs in the SRC including Exercise Therapy, Wheelchair
        Tennis instruction and Renewal Through Movement, where the
          levers of the body such as hips and shoulders are moved in such a way
          that endorphins are released. These programs are all offered at no
        cost to members of the ASU community.</p>
      <p>"We're an educational source, and a renewal
          source for students, faculty and staff," Figy said. "People need the
          recreational sports department;
          it gives them a binding to the university."</p>
      <p>One of the most important
          things to Figy is that students excel in their education, and he is
        always willing to help students reach their goal
          of graduating.</p>
      <p>"I believe we are a real benefit to a person reaching their
          goal of education," Figy said. </p>
      <p>Figy says his experiences with "a lot of wonderful people"
          are the most rewarding part of the job.</p>
      <p>"I wish everyone could have the experiences
          working with people that I've had," Figy said. "It doesn't matter how
          you get around in life,
          whether it's walking, whether it's limping or seated in a wheelchair,
          everyone has something to give. No matter what position we're in, in
        life, they have something to give."</p>
