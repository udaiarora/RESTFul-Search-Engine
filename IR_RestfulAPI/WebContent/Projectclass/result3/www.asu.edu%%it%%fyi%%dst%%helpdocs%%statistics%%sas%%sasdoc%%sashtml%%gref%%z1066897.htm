<P>This section outlines information you should know before you attempt
to run the examples in this book.

<P>Most sites have personnel available to help users learn to run SAS System
software. Record the name of the SAS Software Consultant, SAS Software Representative,
and system administrator at your site.  Also record the names of anyone else
you regularly turn to for help with running  SAS/GRAPH software.

<P>Most of
the chapters in this book provide examples that demonstrate some of the major
features of  SAS/GRAPH software. To
minimize the typing you must do to run the sample code yourself, the code
is delivered to you through the SAS Sample Library. Depending on your operating
environment, there are up to three ways that you can access the code that
is in the sample library: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>if you are viewing the sample code in SAS OnlineDoc, you can copy
the code out of the OnlineDoc and paste it into the Program Editor in your
SAS session. This alternative is not available if you do not have access to
a Web browser in the operating environment where you are running your SAS
session.<P>

<LI>in most operating environments (excluding mainframe environments),
you can access the sample code through the SAS Help facility. For example,
from a SAS window's Help menu, you can choose SAS System Help to enter the
help system. You can then choose the link for Sample SAS Programs and Applications,
which takes you to the help page for the SAS Sample Library.<P>

<LI>in most operating environments (excluding Windows), the SAS Sample
Library may have been installed in your file system. If the SAS Sample Library
has been installed at your site, ask your SAS Software Consultant where it
is located.<P>
</UL>

<P>To access the sample programs through SAS System Help or through your
file system, you must understand the naming convention used for the samples.
The naming convention for  SAS/GRAPH samples
is GR<B>cc</B>N<B>nn</B>,  where <B>cc</B> is the chapter
number and <B>nn</B> is the example number.  For example, the code to
create the first example output in Chapter 12 is stored in sample member GR12N01.
The sample-library member name is usually displayed as a footnote in the output's
lower-right corner.
<P>
<UL>

<LI>In SAS System Help, the sample programs are organized by product.
Within each product category, the samples are sorted alphabetically by title.
Thus, to access the code for the first example in Chapter 12, navigate in
the help system to the SAS Sample Library page, choose  SAS/GRAPH from
the list of products, and then scroll to the title "Reference Guide Chapter
12 Output 1."<P>

<LI>In your file system, the files that contain the sample code have
file names that match the sample member names. For example, in a directory-based
system, the code for sample member GR12N01 is located in a file named GR12N01.SAS.<P>
</UL>

<P> 
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the examples include LIBNAME and FILENAME
statements.
You must provide the name of the SAS data library or external file before
running the example.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>

<TR valign="bottom"><TD><HR></TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">Map Data Sets</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>To run
the examples that draw maps, you need to know where the map data sets are
stored on your system. Depending on your installation, the map data set may
automatically be assigned a libref. Ask your SAS Software Consultant or system
administrator where the map data sets are stored for your site.

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">Annotate Macros Data Set</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>To
run the examples using Annotate macros, you need to know where the Annotate
macro data set is stored on your system. Depending on your installation, the
Annotate macro data set may automatically be assigned a fileref. Ask your
SAS Software Consultant or system administrator where the Annotate macro data
set is stored for your site.
