      <h2>Faculty prove ASU's research prowess with continuing strength in Guggenheim
  Competition </h2>
      <p> For the third year in a row, Arizona State University faculty have won multiple
  John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowships - a prestigious academic
  award that ranks as one of the highest honors in the humanities, social sciences
  and natural sciences. </p>
<p>In 2003, ASU won three of the 184 Guggenheim Fellowships awarded, a number
  that generally only the elite, private universities surpassed - Princeton,
  University of Chicago, Yale (each winning five) and Columbia and Harvard (each
  winning four) and ASU's three-year total of eight fellowships is larger than
  similar totals for some of these. The university's strong track record in winning
  the award is evidence of a strong senior research faculty, since the Guggenheim
  Fellowship is generally given to established scholars and researchers "who
  have achieved prominence in their fields."</p>
<p>"Our recent record in winning these important awards is a testament to our
  past track record in recruiting strong researchers to the faculty," said David
  Young, dean of ASU's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. "As the university's
  research enterprise continues to move forward, I expect that we will see more
  and more of this kind of national recognition."</p>
<p> Winning 2002 Guggenheim Fellowships were Professor of History Monica Green,
  Professor of English, German and Theatre Gitta Honegger, and Professor of Microbiology
  Kenneth Mossman.</p>
<p> Previously, the Guggenheim Fellowship had been awarded 11 other members of
  the ASU faculty: Regents Professor of Chemistry Sheng H. Lin in 1971, Regents
  Professor of English Norman Dubie in 1977, Regents Professor of English Alberto
  Rios in 1988, Regents Professor of Geography William Graf in 1993, Professor
  of Geography Ronald Dorn in 1997 and Regents Professor of History Peter Iverson
  in 1999. Winning 2001 Guggenheim Fellowships were William Fagan, assistant
  professor of biology; Beverly McIver, assistant professor of painting and drawing
  and Asuncion Lavrin, professor of history. Winning 2002 Guggenheim Fellowships
  were Professor of Religious Studies Anne Feldhaus, and Professor of Biology
  Richard Satterlie.</p>
<p>The Guggenheim Fellowship is perhaps the best known national award given to
  support scholarship in the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences.
  The fellowship, which is awarded to scholars, artists and scientists, typically
  supports release time for work on a major project of importance in the field
  involved.</p>
<p>Green, a medieval historian who specializes in the history of medicine, won
  the fellowship to study "Medicine and Culture in 12th Century Salerno." </p>
<p>In the 11th and 12th Centuries, Salerno, a city in southern Italy in the Kingdom
  of Sicily, was home to the School of Salerno, Western Europe's first real medical
  school. Then ruled by the Normans, Sicily had recently been Muslim, Green explains.
  Europe's intellectual life had largely faded during the early Middle Ages,
  as Greek, the intellectual language of antiquity and of many of the great ancient
  texts, had disappeared from common usage. Across the Mediterranean, Muslim
  culture was far more sophisticated. Salerno was a multi-cultural place where
  superior Arab learning got a foothold in Western Europe. </p>
<p>In the late 11th Century, medical knowledge in particular got a big boost
  in Southern Italy with the arrival of Constantine the African, a scholar from
  North Africa with an interest in medical learning.</p>
<p>"He probably came from Tunisia," said Green. "The story is that he realized
  what a dearth of medical texts they had in Italy, and he started translating
  all these Arabic medical texts into Latin. This transformed Western medicine
  - there's a lot of new information about different kinds of drugs, but even
  more important is the philosophical structure behind the learning."</p>
<p>Green points out that the introduction of this sophisticated view of health
  and the human body was responsible for forging the fundamental institutions
  of Western learning. "When universities develop in the13th Century, what happens
  is that medicine, because of this influx of philosophical medicine, is able
  to take its place with theology and law in the higher faculties of the institutions,"
  she said. "It could claim this prestige because medical scholars could say
  'we're as philosophical as you are - we can do the same kinds of intellectual
  analysis.'"</p>
<p>Green's Guggenheim project will particularly focus on The School of Salerno,
  the European starting point for the new Arab-inspired medical science. "What
  they able to do was to establish a curriculum for medicine - a set of books
  to be studied, much of it from Arabic. This remained intact until the 16th
  Century. It became the curriculum at Paris and at Oxford and at Montpellier
  - at all the medical schools," she said.</p>
<p>Though Salerno was crucial for the development of Western medicine and learning,
  very little historical study has been devoted to it. "There's only a local
  history that was written in the middle of the19th Century," she said. "If you
  ask any medical historian they'll tell you that it was very important to the
  history of medicine, but that's all they can say. It's an important institution
  that needs to be better studied.</p>
<p>"What has always fascinated me both about Constantine and about Salerno is
  the way in which the Kingdom of Sicily has seemed so open to Arabic influences
  . What I'm really looking at is a multicultural society and the ways in which
  something very distinctive can happen in a multicultural society that won't
  happen elsewhere," she said.</p>
<p>Honegger is both a professor of theatre and a literary scholar and has interests
  in theater, performance, German and comparative literature, critical theory,
  and women's studies. Her fellowship project is entitled "A Biography of Helene
  Weigel."</p>
<p>Honegger's project will take her to Berlin to research and write the life
  story of Weigel, a prominent German actress and theatre director whose history
  has been somewhat eclipsed by the fact that she was the wife of the famous
  playwright Bertolt Brecht. </p>
<p>"She's one of the most fascinating people in 20th Century drama," said Honegger.
  "Weigel actually ran the theater - the famous Berlin Ensemble - from 1949 to
  1971. What began to interest me is how do you write the biography of someone
  who is mainly an actor -- because acting is so passing -- and how can I write
  her story from her viewpoint and not always make her just the wife of Brecht." </p>
<p>Honegger is also interested in the scope of 20th Century history that Weigel's
  life encompasses, and how, in turn, that history affected her as an artist.
  Weigel was born in 1900 in Vienna to Jewish parents, and spent her childhood
  in anti-Semitic pre-war Austria. Though she came from a bourgeois background,
  she became a fervent communist and ran away to become an actor. Her travels
  as an artist took her to the Weimar Republic, then to Hollywood, then back
  to East Germany, following the war. </p>
<p>"Weigel's was a fascinating life that spans almost a century -- almost until
  when the wall came down," she said. "I want to find out what was going on during
  those years. So this biography is politics, theatre, cultural studies and it's
  an ethical question - how do you run a theatre in very difficult times? Her
  life helps us understand the century - the whole spectacle of the tragedy of
  the 20th Century is basically there." </p>
<p>Mossman is a professor of health physics in ASU's department of microbiology
  and also director of ASU's office of radiation safety. He is a specialist in
  the area of radiological health and safety, with interests as well in risk
  management. </p>
<p>Mossman's fellowship is to study "Risk Dimensions and Precaution." His proposed
  project is to study "the substantial uncertainty that exists concerning the
  applicability and requirements of the precautionary principle to the management
  of technological risks." </p>
<p>Mossman will study what elements of risk are important for effective risk
  management decision-making by analyzing a variety of activities and products
  with different "risk profiles." His research has implications for a broad range
  of risk issues, including such diverse activities as biomedical research, use
  of cellular telephones, and genetically modified foods.</p>
