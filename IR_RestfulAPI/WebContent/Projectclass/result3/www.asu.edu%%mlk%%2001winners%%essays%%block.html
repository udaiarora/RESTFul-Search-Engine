<p>
Inspiring, unselfish, brave, and extraordinarily caring characterize Irene Opdyke, my hero. During the Holocaust this small, gentle, Polish, Catholic woman risked her life to save 12 Jews. Despite the Nazi warnings displayed on posters and broadcast throughout the streets stating &quot;Whoever helps a Jew shall be punished by death,&#148; Irene still served as the eyes and ears for Jews in a ghetto, passing on food and information to the prisoners.<p>
Today, this outstanding hero travels the country extensively, speaking before organizations, schools, clubs, and temples, recounting her struggles for survival, freedom, and faith, teaching children to fight hate crimes.<p>
Though I've never met Irene Opdyke, my world has changed for the better because of her. She inspires me to give people hope when they have none, to do the impossible. And finally, to dare to dream, dream big, and dream that I can make a difference, just like she did. Irene Opdyke never allowed herself to &quot;wallow in the valley of despair,&#148; as she improved the lives of others.<p>
I've realized through researching and studying about her that it's best to give help and hope to those who need it most, no matter what the risk. Most importantly, I've learned that being a superhero isn't just saving people's lives. It may simply be passing on a little food to somebody who could use it, or quietly helping people get out of danger. You're a hero even if you're never recognized a hero, because you know you did the right thing.
