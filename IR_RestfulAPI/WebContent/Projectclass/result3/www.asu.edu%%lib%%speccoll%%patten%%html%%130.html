<h2>
Laurence, John</h2>
1668-1732
<p><i><font size=+1>A New System of Agriculture: Being a Complete Body
of Husbandry and Gardening.</font></i>
<p>Printed for Tho. Woodward, 1726. References: Hunt 466.
<p>This clergyman/ horticulturist wrote several books on gardening and
specialized in fruit trees.&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurence tells his readers in his
preface that he has been encouraged by the reception which his earlier
small tracts concerning vegetables have received, and so now he is writing
a complete work, "to do my Part to extend and enlarge the Knowledge of
Agriculture in all its Parts."&nbsp; He goes on to say that he has the
"Honour of being the first and almost only Writer in this last Century,
who had revived the Spirit of Gardening, and pretended to give a rational
and intelligible account of the Laws of Nature, for the better and more
regular Govenment of Fruit-trees, hitherto but imperfectly understood,
and therefore very darkly explained."&nbsp; Laurence discusses generalities
such as the four elements, air earth, fire and water, as well as land preparation.&nbsp;
He then continues with a discussion of forest timber trees, fruit gardens,
kitchen gardens, and flower gardens, each in considerable detail.
