      <p><strong><font size="3">Nursing college loses associate dean</font></strong></p>
      <p><img src="facstudents_images/pamelakidd_011503.jpg" alt="Pamela Kidd" width="202" height="282" align="right">Pamela 
        Kidd, associate dean for graduate programs and research for the College 
        of Nursing, passed away Dec. 25, 2002. </p>
      <p>Prior to joining ASU in the fall semester of 2000, Kidd served as the 
        director of the Kentucky Injury Prevention &amp; Research Center at the 
        University of Kentucky. College of Nursing Dean Barbara Durand said Kidd 
        was instrumental in many of the college's programs.</p>
      <p>"I think she was the greatest gift to the College of Nursing, during 
        my tenure here," Durand said. "She brought an energy and an initiative 
        that we hadn't seen before. Her experience and view of the world were 
        exactly what we needed as we were going into the new millennium."</p>
      <p>Durand said Kidd's vision to expand people's perception of the nursing 
        field was often demonstrated in her work.</p>
      <p>"She was a seasoned and funded researcher," Durand said. "She was very 
        interested in interdisciplinary activities and had begun some collaborations 
        that we had not thought of before."</p>
      <p>Kidd's most recent collaborative research effort was shared with Howard 
        Bashford, associate professor in the Del E. Webb School of Construction, 
        examining the effectiveness of pre-assembled roof structural components 
        in reducing costs and lost work time related to injuries sustained in 
        building the roof assembly for single dwelling, detached, residential 
        homes. The project was funded through the National Institute for Occupational 
        Safety and Health (NIOSH).</p>
      <p>Kidd earned a post-masters degree in the Family Nurse Practitioner Program 
        at the University of Kentucky in 1996; a Ph.D in nursing from the University 
        of Arizona in 1989; an MSN from the University of Cincinnati in 1982; 
        and a BSN from the University of Kentucky in 1978.</p>
      <p>Despite her busy schedule, Durand said Kidd always made time for her 
        colleagues and students.</p>
      <p>"She always found time on a weekly basis to see patients at the clinic 
        that our college operates," Durand said, "and she became a mentor to a 
        number of our junior faculty.</p>
      <p>"She always was looking ahead and she always had ideas," Durand said. 
        "She was simply spectacular." </p>
      <p>Pamela Kidd is survived by her husband, Estol Lee Kidd Jr.; son, Elliott; 
        daughter, Elizabeth Leigh; and brother, Ronald Stinson. Funeral services 
        were held Dec. 27 in Kentucky. </p>
      <p>Memorials may be made to the American Cancer Society. The College of 
        Nursing is having a memorial service at 2 p.m., Jan. 24, in the Business 
        College C-wing, room 116. For information call the College of Nursing 
        at (480) 965-3244.\</p>
