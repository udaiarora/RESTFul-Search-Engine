<P>
This work is a later expanded edition of one of the first cookbooks printed in America
 (see PAT-15).  The new appendix contains recipes "adapted to the American mode of
 cooking," such as "dough nuts," and "pumpkin pie."  It also has advice on raising turkeys, including the suggestion that young turkeys should be plunged into ?a vessel of cold water, the very hour, if possible, but at least the very day it is hatched, forcing it to swallow one whole pepper corn; after which let it be returned to its mother.  From that time it will become hardy, and fear the cold no more than a hen?s chick.?  This advice has been translated from a Swedish book, entitled Rural ?conomy, demonstrating that the author has tried to provide practical information from a variety of sources.
