      <h2>Public research investments paying dividends, report shows</h2>
      <p>New university-based research efforts in biodesign, nanotechnology, embedded 
        systems and virtual manufacturing show that Arizona has stepped forward 
        to compete in the knowledge economy, according to a newly released study 
        by Morrison Institute for Public Policy, a unit of ASU.</p>
      <p>The institute&#146;s 44-page report, &#147;Seeds of Prosperity: Public 
        Investment in Science and Technology,&#148; uses the research projects 
        that ASU initiated with voter-approved Proposition 301 funds as a &#147;lens&#148; 
        for understanding the value of science and technology research to Arizona&#146;s 
        economy. It also introduces a novel measurement framework (&#147;CAT measures&#148; 
        &#150; the connections, attention and talent the investments produce for 
        the state) designed to assess the lasting economic value of such research 
        for the state and region. </p>
      <p>&quot;This report is meant to stimulate thinking about public investment 
        strategy and policy for economic growth,&#148; said Rob Melnick, director 
        of Morrison Institute. &#147;We are developing the CAT measures to help 
        state leaders get their arms around the many kinds of impacts from university 
        science and technology research so they can better assess the state&#146;s 
        return on investment.&#148;</p>
      <p>The authors of the report note that technological innovation often leads 
        to long-term economic development and competitive advantage for a region, 
        and that most knowledge businesses rely on universities to conduct cutting-edge 
        research that fuels innovation. Morrison Institute&#146;s CAT measures 
        provide a new model for assessing what have previously been viewed as 
        &#147;intangibles&#148; &#150; the important connections, attention and 
        talent created by high-tech research that provide the fertile ground from 
        which next generation technological innovation springs.</p>
      <p>The report shows that the potential payoff for public investments in 
        university research is huge. For example, &#147;Seeds of Prosperity&#148; 
        finds:</p>
      <p>&#149; Biotech research &#150; based primarily on molecular and genetic 
        research &#150; has already created a $39 billion industry, and recent 
        genomics discoveries are expected to accelerate further growth;</p>
      <p>&#149; Nanotechnology &#150; the science of manipulating matter at the 
        atomic level &#150; has been dubbed &#147;the next big thing&#148; in 
        technological innovation, and has been forecast by the National Science 
        Foundation to grow into a $1 trillion market by 2015; and</p>
      <p>&#149; The rapidly expanding information and communications technology 
        industry is estimated to employ at least 10 million high-wage U.S. workers, 
        and has accounted for nearly a third of recent U.S. economic growth. </p>
      <p>The report cautions that simply investing in science and technology research 
        is not enough to guarantee future economic growth. Nearly every other 
        state in the country has also committed big investments toward high-tech 
        science research in order to capitalize on the high-wage jobs and economic 
        stimulus it promises. Long-term public investments have been running into 
        the hundreds of millions, yet not every state can be a leader. </p>
      <p>&#147;The stakes are high,&#148; says Melnick, &#147;and the competition 
        is hot. But few people even have any idea what these endeavors are all 
        about.&#148;<br>
        &#147;Seeds of Prosperity&#148; helps demystify some of today&#146;s cutting-edge 
        science and technology fields by explaining their economic context. It 
        also describes the current consolidation phase of these projects in which 
        multiple independent research efforts are integrated into large, interdisciplinary 
        &#147;mega-projects.&#148;</p>
      <p>&#147;Proposition 301 funding is unquestionably enabling Arizona&#146;s 
        universities to significantly increase their competitiveness in scientific 
        research and innovation,&#148; said Dr. Jeffrey Trent, president and scientific 
        director of Phoenix-based TGen, the Translational Genomics Research Institute. 
        &#147;The Morrison Institute&#146;s report provides an important economic 
        context for the universities as well as public institutions to evaluate 
        how to best take advantage of this historic opportunity. The report also 
        recognizes the importance of public-private partnerships in conducting 
        science-technology research and the need to be accountable for the public&#146;s 
        investment.&#148;</p>
      <p>According to the report, ASU&#146;s projects have nearly doubled the 
        state&#146;s investment by attracting $14 million in outside grants. To 
        determine whether this investment will be a long-term economic development 
        success, Morrison Institute analysts recommend that such research initiatives 
        be regularly and systematically assessed not only on the products they 
        develop and the external funding they generate, but also on the CAT measures. 
      </p>
      <p>&#147;Collectively,&#148; says Melnick, &#147;these assessments will 
        provide a unique way to measure economic impacts so that public investments 
        can be held accountable.&#148;</p>
      <p>The Morrison Institute for Public Policy is an ASU resource for objective 
        public policy research and analysis. A part of the School of Public Affairs 
        in the College of Public Programs, Morrison Institute brings university 
        scholarship and public policy development together for the benefit of 
        Arizonans.</p>
