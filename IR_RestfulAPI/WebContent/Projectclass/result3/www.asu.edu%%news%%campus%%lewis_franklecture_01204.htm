      <h2>Anthony Lewis to Present 5th Annual John P. Frank Lecture </h2>
      <p>TEMPE, Az. - Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and author Anthony Lewis will speak on "Guarding our Freedoms" Thursday, February 5, 2004 at the 5th Annual John P. Frank Memorial Lecture. The free public lecture will be held at Palm Ballroom, Tempe Mission Palms at 5 p.m. and will be followed by an open reception. </p>
      <p>The Arizona State University School of Justice Studies in the College of Public Programs with support and assistance from Lewis &amp; Roca LLP, Shughart Thomson &amp; Kilroy P.C., <em>The New York Times Knowledge Network </em> and the Maricopa County Bar Association sponsors the talk. </p>
      <p>Lewis will discuss domestic security policies developed in the wake of 9/11 and the dangers they pose to traditional rights and liberties. A key question is the role that courts will play in the balancing of the nation's need for security and preservation of constitutional liberties </p>
      <p>Lewis was a columnist for <em>The New York Times </em> from 1969 to December 2001, appearing on the Op-Ed page with the column, " <em>Abroad at Home." </em>He also worked for <em>The New York Times </em> Washington bureau, covering the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Justice Department and legal matters including the government's handling of the civil rights movement. </p>
      <p>In 1955 he won his first Pulitzer Prize for national reporting, for a series of articles on the dismissal of a Navy employee as a security risk. The articles led to the employee's reinstatements. He also earned a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Supreme Court in 1963. He became Chief of the Times London Bureau in 1964 and began writing his column from London in 1969. His books include <em>Gideon's Trumpet </em> and <em>Make No Law: The Sullivan Case and the First Amendment </em>. </p>
      <p>Lewis is a former Nieman Fellow and lectured for fifteen years at the Harvard Law School, and has been a visiting lecturer at a number of other universities. He has held the James Madison Visiting Professorship at Columbia University since 1983. He has also received a number of honorary degrees. </p>
      <p>This annual lecture series honors the memory of the late John P. Frank, who was a leader in the legal community in Arizona and in the nation throughout his prestigious career. He worked tirelessly and vigilantly on behalf of justice through his work, service, and scholarship. The series features nationally recognized speakers on the most pressing issues facing the legal and justice communities. </p>
      <p>"The School of Justice Studies is delighted to sponsor this lecture. John Frank was a friend and a model of the kind of intellectual and social leadership we seek to inspire in our students," said Marie Provine, Director of the School of Justice Studies. "This lecture series, through its distinguished guests, helps keep the University and the Phoenix metropolitan area focused on important issues in social justice, just as John Frank did during his long, active career." </p>
