    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">Recommendation for Backing Up
    Data</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Are you adequately backing up
    your data? Performing a backup consists of more than merely making
    an extra copy of the important files. You should consider the
    number of copies, their storage locations, and the media on which
    the copies are written.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The importance of the data to
    you, including the cost in time and money it would take to replace
    the data (assuming it were replaceable), determines how elaborate
    your backup procedure should be. Your backup data is just as
    important as the original data, and is just as susceptible to
    loss.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Backing up your data is especially
    important if you are using a desktop workstation (PC, MAC, etc.),
    but it is no less important if you are using a service bureau
    (e.g., computer center) for your computing. Any backup performed
    by a service bureau or other third party is an adjunct, and does
    not lessen your responsibility for backing up your data.</FONT></P>

    <H4><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Multiple Copies</FONT></H4>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Therecommended number of backup
    copies is &quot;more than one&quot;. A general guideline is to
    have multiple copies of the data at each of several storage locations.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Multiple copies are needed of
    every important file. How many copies depends on the data's value,
    the cost of replacing the data, and your comfort level. Even
    inconsequential data may deserve backing up if it's more convenient
    for you to restore the data than to recreate it.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Backups should be made of any
    new file as soon as practical after creation. However, if the
    new file is built in stages over a period of time, interim backups
    should be made at each stage of creation.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Additional copies should be created
    of any modified file after the modification is complete. If the
    modification occurs over an extended period of time, interim
    backups should be made at convenient intervals.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Due to changing technologies
    and deterioration of media over time, even if a file has not
    been used or modified recently, you should make backups of the
    file on a regular basis.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As new backup copies are made,
    the older copies should be &quot;grandfathered&quot;, i.e., retained.
    The number of generations to keep depends on your needs. Some
    people like to keep, for example, three generations of backups.
    The following are two variations of grandfathering three generations:
    (1) keeping a set of three generations at each of several locations;
    (2) keeping the most recent generation at the primary location,
    the next most recent at a second location, and the oldest generation
    at a third location.</FONT></P>

    <H4><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Storage Locations</FONT></H4>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Having multiple backup copies
    at the same location as the original data is a great convenience
    if you need to restore quickly, but is inadequate as the sole
    location of your backup copies.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">An adequate backup requires copies
    of your data be stored in multiple geographically distinct locations.
    A minimum of two, preferably three (or even more if your need
    is great), locations are recommended. Multiple locations within
    the same room or building do not qualify as geographically distinct
    locations. A more realistic example of three locations would
    be, for example, your office, your home, and the computer center.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The environment of each location
    is also an important consideration. The media on which data is
    stored is sensitive to temperature, humidity, magnetism, and
    dust. If the environment of one or more storage locations is
    less than ideal or is not within your control, you should increase
    the number of storage locations or the frequency of backups or
    both.</FONT></P>

    <H4><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Media</FONT></H4>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">There are many different types
    of media. Some are more durable than others, more resistant to
    environmental changes, or more suitable for electronic processing.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Paper is a useful storage media,
    but is not generally useful as computer input medium. It is possible
    to scan printed matter and recreate the data, but special equipment
    and software are required and mistranslations are possible. Other
    media, such as disk, tape, CD-ROM, and optical devices, are better
    suited for storage of data.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The table at the end of this
    document lists several media types and their life expectancies.
    It is important to remember that these life expectancies are
    not guarantees. Data loss on the media can occur prior to life
    expectancy expiration.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The storage environment has a
    substantial impact of media preservation, as does the condition
    of the equipment used to read or write the media. A brand new
    tape in perfect condition can be damaged beyond repair during
    the first read attempt if the tape drive is in disrepair. Tape
    in particular is susceptible to wear because of the physical
    contact between the tape and the read/write mechanism. Proper
    maintenance both of equipment and the environment will help ensure
    the longevity of the backup storage media.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Also of importance, particularly
    for data that is to be used for a long time, is obsolesence of
    the hardware and software used to create the backups. You may
    have backups stored on 5.25&quot; double density floppies, but
    already the 5.25&quot; double density floppy drive is obsolete.
    To avoid problems associated with obsolescence, new backups should
    be created using the newer technologies as the technologies enter
    the mainstream of computing, i.e., are affordable, commonly used,
    and readily available.</FONT></P>
