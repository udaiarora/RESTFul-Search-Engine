Such a release shall be designated in the employee&#146;s personnel records as a &#147;release for reorganization.&#148;  If the reorganization plan under consideration requires the release of professional employees, the president shall review (as described below) the proposed reorganization plan and, if in concurrence, forward it to the Board of Regents for their approval.  If the Board of Regents approves the plan and professional employees are released due to reorganization, each one shall be accorded the following rights and privileges.<p><ol><li>The individual shall be notified in writing of the proposed course of action which will result in his or her release.

The committee&#146;s review shall include a public forum to provide an opportunity for all members of the university community to present their views on the impact of the proposed reorganization.</li><p><li>Each academic professional whose position may be affected by the proposed reorganization shall be notified promptly in writing of the proposed action and shall be given an early opportunity to present his or her views in person to the review committee and to the responsible administrator.  Any written statement submitted by the academic professional shall become part of the official record.</li><p><li>The review committee shall provide the president with a written evaluation of the proposed reorganization no later than 90 days following the president&#146;s request, unless the president specifically requests that the evaluation be provided in a shorter period.  This evaluation shall include an assessment of the impact of the proposed reorganization upon students, faculty, academic professionals, staff, the university as a whole, related activities outside the university, and the interest of higher education within the state.  The committee shall maintain a record of its proceedings, including all written documents and statements submitted to it.</li><p><li>The president shall decide whether or not to recommend the reorganization following receipt of the review committee&#146;s evaluation.  If the president rejects the committee&#146;s evaluation, the president shall furnish the committee a written statement of the reasons for doing so.</li><p><li>The president shall present his or her recommendation relating to the proposed reorganization to the Board of Regents for approval.</li><p><li>If the Board of Regents approves the reorganization, each academic professional whose position is to be eliminated shall receive written notice when the decision to eliminate his or her position is final.</li></ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Review of a Decision to Release</b></font><p>An academic professional with continuing appointment who is to be released, or a probationary academic professional who is to be released during an appointment term, shall be entitled to a review of this decision by filing a written request with the president within 15 days of receipt of notice of such release.<p>The review shall be conducted according to the following procedures:<p><ol><li>The president shall ask the Academic Senate, with advice from the chair of the Committee on Academic Professional Status, to designate a review committee to review the decision to release.</li><p><li>The review committee shall be convened no later than 20 days following the request by an academic professional to determine whether the release is consistent with the objectives to be served by the reorganization.</li><p><li>The review committee shall take into consideration the basis for the university&#146;s decision to release and shall provide the opportunity for the academic professional to respond.</li><p><li>The review committee may consolidate proceedings in order to expedite its reviews, but shall review each decision to release on its own merits and render its recommendations accordingly.</li><p><li>The review committee shall forward its written recommendation to the president no later than 45 days following receipt of an academic professional&#146;s request for review.  If the decision to release is deemed to be reasonable, the committee shall recommend that the decision to release be upheld.  If the decision to release is deemed not to be reasonable, the committee shall recommend that the decision to release be reversed.  This review committee shall make no recommendation as to the reorganization.</li><p><li>The university president shall consider the committee&#146;s recommendation and render a final decision to uphold or reverse the decision to release no later than 15 days from the receipt of the committee&#146;s recommendation.</li></ol><p>An academic professional with continuing appointment who is released shall be given a terminal year appointment unless the board&#146;s approval of the reorganization includes a specific determination that budgetary considerations do not permit such an appointment.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Grievance Hearing If Discrimination Is Alleged</b></font><p>According to Board Policy 6-301 (L), an academic professional who alleges that he or she was the victim of discrimination in the proceedings described above may be heard before the Academic Professional Grievance Committee.
