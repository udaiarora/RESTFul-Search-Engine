    <TD VALIGN=TOP>1.
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>Studies <i>must</i> be composed of subject matter that addresses 
      or leads to an understanding of the contemporary world outside the U.S. 
      <i>(Note: If course does not deal with contemporary subject matter, application 
      must make clear how the course topics and assignments make students deal 
      with contemporary issues. E.g., a course on the Constitution and the Federalist 
      period would have to have assignments which stipulated that students discuss 
      present day implications and interpretations of the 18th century documents.)</i>

    <TD VALIGN=TOP>Course must be <i>one or more</i> of the following types (check 
      all which may apply):
  <TR>
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>________
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>a. In-depth area studies which are concerned with an examination 
      of culture-specific elements of a region, country or culture group. The 
      area or culture studied must focus on non-U.S. and the study must contribute 
      to an understanding of the contemporary world. <i>(Note: Proposals should 
      clearly document both the non-U.S. and contemporary aspects of the course 
      topics and assignments.)</i>
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>___________ 
  <TR>
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>________
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>b. Contemporary non-English language courses that have a significant 
      cultural component. <i>(Note: Clear evidence must be given of the significant 
      cultural component in course topics and assignments. The cultural component 
      should be an integral and central part of the course, not an optional feature 
      or a focus for only part of the semester.)</i>
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>___________ 
  <TR>
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>________
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>c. Comparative cultural studies with an emphasis on non-U.S. 
      areas.<i> (Note: Proposal should demonstrate that the majority of course 
      topics and assignments deal with non-U.S. areas and that these areas are 
      an integral and central part of the course, not an optional feature or a 
      focus for only part of the semester.)</i><br>
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>___________ 
  <TR>
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>________
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD VALIGN=TOP>d. In-depth studies of non-U.S. centered cultural interrelationships 
      of global scope, such as the global interdependence produced by problems 
      of world ecology, multinational corporations, migration, and the threat 
      of nuclear war. <i>(Note: Proposal should clearly document that course topics 
      and assignments deal with relationships that are not U.S. centered.)</i>
