Clinical researchers, with or without a statistical background, will       find this book an invaluable aid in understanding the statistical
methods cited most frequently in clinical protocols, statistical           analysis plans, clinical and statistical reports, and medical journals.
Written in a manner which leads the nonstatistician through each test by   example, substantive details are presented which will benefit even the
experienced data analysts.  Introductory chapters provide elementary       statistical concepts as applied to clinical trials and an overview of
statistical inference, including discussions of power, sample size         calculations, p-values and the logic behind hypothesis testing. Numerous
examples from clinical research are worked through both manually and       using SAS. Methods presented include t-tests, analysis of variance,
repeated measures ANOVA, linear regression, analysis of covariance,        non-parametric tests, binomial tests, chi-square test, Fisher's exact
test, McNemar's test, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, logistic regression,   log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards model.
