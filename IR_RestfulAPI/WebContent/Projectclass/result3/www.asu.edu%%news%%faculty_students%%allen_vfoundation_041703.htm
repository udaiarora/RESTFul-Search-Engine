      <h2>V Foundation honors Allen with comeback award</h2>
      <p>        ASU junior and cancer survivor Justin Allen, a forward on the ASU men's
          basketball team, has been named the recipient of the 2003 V Foundation
          Comeback of the Year Award. The award, presented by the V Foundation
          for Cancer Research and ESPN, is given annually to a collegiate basketball
          student-athlete who embodies the spirit and courage represented by
        the late coach and broadcaster Jim Valvano.</p>
      <p>V Foundation CEO Nick Valvano
            presented the award to Allen at the ASU basketball banquet April
        8 in Scottsdale. Allen was selected from more
          than 30 nominees nationwide. </p>
      <p>Allen was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease
          in September 2000 following his freshman year at ASU. He returned to
          the court at ASU in 2001 - 02
          while still recovering from the effects of the disease, following chemotherapy
          and radiation treatments. He played in 19 games in 2002 - 03 and helped
          the team reach its first NCAA appearance since 1995. </p>
      <p>"Justin Allen is
          the perfect example of someone not giving up and is someone who will
          make the V Foundation and the Valvano family proud,"
          said ASU Head Coach Rob Evans. "He has been a champion in his commitment
          to fighting the disease and has been a leader in our program. Most
        importantly, Justin is someone we can all learn from on how to deal with
        adversity." </p>
      <p>Valvano coached North Carolina State University to the NCAA national
          championship in 1983. After leaving the school, he worked as a broadcaster
          for ESPN. In 1993, while dying from cancer, he gave an emotional speech
          telling people "don't give up. Don't ever give up." The words became
        the motto for the foundation, which was founded that same year.</p>
      <p>"I am
          honored to receive this award and to be associated with the V Foundation
          and the Valvano family," Allen said. "I was born in 1981, just two
        years before Coach Valvano's team won the national title, but I am an
        example
          of how his inspiration and name can help make a difference in the fight
          against cancer. Coach Valvano's words of never giving up were spoken
          by my family many times. I remembered those words both on the court
        and in the classroom, in the hospital and walking around campus." <br>
        Allen will graduate this spring with a degree in justice studies, but
          plans to return to the team for his senior year of athletic eligibility
        while pursuing an advanced degree. </p>
      <p>The V Foundation Comeback Award is
          presented annually and is open to men and women collegiate basketball
          student-athletes in all NCAA division
          levels.<br>
