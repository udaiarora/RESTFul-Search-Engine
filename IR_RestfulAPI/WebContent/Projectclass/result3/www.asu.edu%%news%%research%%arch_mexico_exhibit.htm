    <h2><strong>ASU-Sponsored Archaeology Research the Subject of Major Exhibition at&nbsp; Mexican National Museum of Anthropology </strong></h2>
    <p>An exhibition opening May 12 at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City will feature major findings from a six-year-long archaeological excavation at the Pyramid of the Moon in the ruins of Teotihuacan, the Western Hemisphere's first major metropolis and the seat of a mysterious 2000-year-old civilization. </p>
              <p>The research, sponsored by Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), Arizona State University, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the National Geographic Society and the National Science Foundation, was co-directed by Ruben Cabrera of INAH and Saburo Sugiyama, Professor at Aichi Prefectural University and Research Associate Professor at Arizona State University. Sugiyama and Cabrera organized and curated the current exhibition. </p>
              <p>The two-gallery exhibition, entitled "Voyage to the Center of the Moon Pyramid: Recent Discoveries in Teotihuacan," features maps, murals, displays reconstructing burials, a large-scale model of the pyramid, and a wide variety of&nbsp; recovered artifacts. An accompanying catalog details scientific findings that shed new light on the civilization that created the city and points to possible relationships to other ancient cultures in Mesoamerica. </p>
              <p>The Pyramid of the Moon is the oldest of two major pyramids at Teotihuacan <strong>, </strong>an ancient master-planned metropolis located 25 miles from current Mexico City, and it may prove to be the most archaeologically important structure on the vast site.&nbsp; Sugiyama and Cabrera's excavations have revealed that the current 151-foot-tall structure is only the last of seven historical stages of the pyramid, with the first dating back to near the founding of the city. </p>
              <p>However, the most revealing findings have come from the discovery of four ceremonial burials that appear to be connected to the construction of various stages of the pyramid. The burials, most of which appear to have involved sacrificial human offerings of prominent men, are highly ceremonial, including symbolic artifacts and animal offerings.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Sugiyama has argued that the nature and content of these burials may be key to understanding the still poorly understood social structure of the city. Details from many of the burials point to the existence of a ruling elite and a warrior class.&nbsp; The most recent discovery,&nbsp; a burial uncovered in early fall of 2002, contains evidence of a connection between the great city's rulers and the Mayan civilization, which was then flourishing in the Central American lowlands far to the southeast. </p>
              <p>In an introduction to the exhibition's catalog, Sugiyama and Cabrera say:&nbsp; " The quantity and quality of the offerings recovered during this project were exceptional and considerably different from the more than 1200 burials found in Teotihuacan to date. In addition to the characteristic form of interment, the great variety of offerings reflects the religious ideology of a Teotihuacan ruling class. </p>
              <p>"At least three of the four burials contained the skeletal remains of sacrificed individuals, and their subsequent burial in the interior of the buildings perhaps symbolizes their entry into the underworld or the 'world of the dead.' The burials also reveal implicit socio-political functions along with evidence of interaction with other distant ethnic groups such as Maya dynasties." </p>
              <p>Three of the four burials discovered by the team contained (in addition to skeletal remains) numerous artifacts, shells, and skeletons of animals that appear to represent sacred animals of the Teotihuacan pantheon. Other details give intriguing hints of the nature of the city's mysterious civilization and its perhaps critical connections to other parts of Mesoamerica. </p>
              <p>The first burial discovered appears to be connected with the construction of the fourth layer of the pyramid (constructed around 250 A.D.), and includes a single male in his 40's, who the researchers believe was "a sacrificial victim, possibly one of high social status," because he was found seated with his arms apparently tied behind his back, surrounded by impressive art objects and weapons. Among these is a greenstone statuette that the researchers tentatively conclude to be a war goddess. Also in the burial are a number of animals -- including two caged pumas, a caged wolf, nine eagles, an owl, and three rattlesnakes --&nbsp; which the researchers conclude "suggest warrior affiliations." An isotopic analysis of the skeleton indicate that the victim was a foreigner and may have come from the highlands of Guatemala. </p>
              <p>The second burial is connected to the fifth layer of the pyramid (constructed around 300 A.D.) and includes the skeletons of&nbsp; four bound men, also apparently sacrifices, with isotopic evidence pointing to two being foreigners (again perhaps from the highlands of Guatemala) and two being native Teotihuacanos. Again, there are figurines, artifacts and weapons in the burial, and animal remains suggesting a military connection. Cabrera and Sugiyama note: "Some offerings that we consider enigmatic are the 14 wolf skulls, 4 puma skulls, and the incomplete cranium of a young owl, that were found dispersed without any specific distribution pattern. Iconographic studies suggest that wolves and coyotes were symbols of sacrifice and militarism. Possibly the wolf skulls were used to identify individuals or a social group associated with military institutions." </p>
              <p>The third burial found (connected with the sixth layer) was distinctly different from the others in that it contains only skulls - 18 in all - of apparently decapitated soldier-age victims, since neck vertebrae were found with the skulls which all belong to male adolescents or young adults. Differing skull shapes (the result of a practice of deliberate cranial deformation practiced in some areas of ancient Mesoamerica), teeth filing and ornamental dental inlays, point to the victims being from a variety of locations, and to most of them being foreign to Teotihuacan. </p>
              <p>The last burial found in the excavation is especially significant because there are indications that the buried individuals may not have been sacrifices and may represent the ceremonial burial of people of high social status. The burial, which is also associated with the construction of&nbsp; the sixth layer (constructed around 350 A.D.), contains three skeletons which were buried unbound (indicating that they were dead before they were positioned) in a seated position that the researchers find to be significant. </p>
              <p>According to Cabrera and Sugiyama, the last burial " is the only case of interment in the 'lotus' position, leading us to believe that the individuals were foreigners or high Teotihuacan dignitaries of a status not previously discovered in the city. Similar positioning is known from other parts of Mesoamerica, however, most notably in Classic Maya sites. The frequent representation of the 'lotus' position in representations of elites from other parts of Mesoamerica suggests that the individuals were interred in this position to reinforce their divinely-sanctioned status and high social rank. Their identities as males between the ages 50-55, 45-50, and 40-45 is consistent with pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican elite status." </p>
              <p>The three skeletons in the last burial have isotopic readings consistent with people from the Mayan areas of Mesoamerica (two from the Guatemalan highlands, one from the lowlands) and were decorated with impressive Mayan-style jewelry. Two of&nbsp; the skeletons wore similar jewelry such that the researchers note "the size and quality of these ornaments are exceptional for Teotihuacan to date, and are only represented worn on the chests of Maya rulers or elites. Furthermore, it is clear that jade of this quality was available only in Guatemala and had a limited circulation only among Maya elite. Therefore, it is possible to interpret these two similarly adorned individuals as having been portrayed at death as possessing direct connections to Maya elite themselves, or else they may actually have been part of this elite." </p>
              <p>The third skeleton was somewhat different, though he also wore high-quality jewelry that indicated nobility. The researchers note "the style of the ornaments on his chest suggest that he might have been a Teotihuacano, although rarely have examples of this type been found in the city. In fact, the pectoral bears more of a resemblance to the necklaces worn by Maya representations of rulers or elite, which leads us to contend that the three individuals in the burial were Maya or had very direct connections with the Maya ruling classes." </p>
              <p>Overall, Sugiyama and Cabrera draw no firm conclusions from the burial evidence, but note that there is evidence of a strong military culture at Teotihuacan and that "t he burials also reveal implicit socio-political functions along with evidence of interaction with other distant ethnic groups such as Maya dynasties." </p>
