Students must provide required disability documentation to the DRC. The assigned DRC disability access consultant will evaluate the documentation, verify eligibility, and authorize the service.</p><p>The assistive technology available for checkout is provided on a first-come, first-served basis.</p><p>The DRC does not provide televisions, large screen monitors, computers, computer accommodations, screen readers, or alternative input or output devices for enrolled ASU students with disabilities who take ASU classes from their homes.</p><p>Students checking out equipment are responsible for battery replacement in battery-operated equipment and the care and security of equipment during the term of the loan.  Lost, stolen, or damaged equipment must be reported to the DRC supervisor, Mobility Services, immediately. Police reports must be filed for stolen equipment.</p><p>Before receiving equipment, students must sign an equipment loan form. The length of checkout varies according to the type of adaptive equipment, student need, and equipment demand. The equipment loan agreement specifies a return date. Failure to meet the return deadline will result in a complaint being filed with Student Judicial Affairs. Course registration, grade reports, and permission to graduate will be put on administrative hold until borrowed equipment is returned.</p><p>See the <a href="drs.html">DRC</a> Web site for detailed information and procedures for accessing services and accommodations available for qualified students at specific ASU campuses and sites.<p><img src="usihr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-Reference</b></font></center><img src="usihr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"></p><p>For related information, see <a href="usi701-02.html">USI 701&#150;02</a>, &#147;Eligibility for Accommodations&#151;Required Disability Documentation.&#148;<font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">USI</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | USI&#160;manual&#160;<a href="usi001.html">contact</a><br>&#160;<br><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center></body></html>
