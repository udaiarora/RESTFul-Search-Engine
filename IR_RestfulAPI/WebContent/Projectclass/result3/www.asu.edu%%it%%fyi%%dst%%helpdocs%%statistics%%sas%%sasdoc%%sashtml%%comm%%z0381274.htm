Beginning with Version
7, the SPX access method is not supported. However, information about SPX
is included here for Version 6 users.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"></DD></DL>

<P>Various errors may occur when you initially
try to establish a connection over a network with the Sequenced Packet Exchange
(SPX) access method. Many of these problems are related to the network. The
following messages are a few of the more common errors you may encounter:
 



<PRE>ERROR: Network partner xxxx not found.</PRE>
<P>The network name that you specified as the value for the REMOTE= option
is invalid. The partner application is not running, is on a different network,
or is using a different packet type. Ask your system administrator for valid
names at your site.  



<PRE>ERROR: Communication request rejected by partner: 
security verification failure</PRE>
<P>Permission to access the remote host was denied.  Verify that you specified
both a valid userid and password for the remote system.  



<PRE>ERROR: Supporting access method initialization failure.</PRE>
<P>There is a configuration problem. Contact your systems personnel.  



<PRE>ERROR: Target application partner could not be located.</PRE>
<P>The remote SAS session could not be started by the spawner program.
There is a configuration problem.  



<PRE>ERROR: File not found loading \sas\core\sasexe\sasvnspx.dll;
File contributing to error: SPXCALLS</PRE>
<P>The SPX access method was loaded but the supporting SPX software was
not found. Make sure that the directory that contains the SPXCALLS.DLL file
is in the LIBPATH. (This message applies only to the OS/2 environment.)  



<PRE>ERROR: File not found loading \sas\core\sasexe\sasvnspx.dll;
File contributing to error: IPXCALLS</PRE>
<P>The SPX access method was loaded but the supporting IPX software was
not found. Make sure that the directory that contains the IPXCALLS.DLL file
is in the LIBPATH.
<P>Besides network errors, you should also be aware of operating system-dependent
considerations, which are described in the next two sections. If you cannot
resolve a problem based on the information provided in the error message and
this document, contact SAS Technical Support for assistance.
<BR><H3>OS/2 Considerations</H3>


<P>For the SPX access method to work properly, it must be configured so
that it does not violate the buffer size limitations of the Novell Requestor.
The OS/2 requestor defaults to a buffer size of 1514 bytes, and the SPX access
method also defaults to a buffer size of 1514 bytes. Because the size of the
buffer is limited to 576 bytes when using a bridge, if using SPX over a bridge,
you must explicitly define a 576 buffer size for SPX and the Novell Requestor. 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>To inform SAS of the buffer size that you want, set the environment
variable SPXMSGSIZE to a value of 576.<P>

<LI>To indicate the buffer size to the Novell Requestor, put a 


<CODE><B>buffers</B></CODE> statement under the link support attribute
in the 


<CODE><B>net.cfg</B></CODE> file. For example:  



<PRE>link support buffers 30 576</PRE>
<P>In this statement, 


<CODE><B>30</B></CODE> is the number
of buffers and 


<CODE><B>576</B></CODE> is the size of the buffers.
The product of these numbers cannot exceed 64K.<P>
</UL>

<P>The maximum buffer size for Ethernet is 1514 bytes, and the maximum
buffer size for Token Ring is 4202 bytes. If you are using a Token Ring network,
you may want to change the 


<CODE><B>buffers</B></CODE> statement
in your 


<CODE><B>net.cfg</B></CODE> to use 4202 byte buffers and set SPXMSGSIZE to 4202.

<P>SAS/SHARE users and administrators can use the Novell Sequenced
Packet Exchange (SPX) access method to communicate with a server that is running
on the OS/2, the Windows NT, or the Windows 95 platform on the same network.
 You must have at least version 2.10 of the Novell Netware Requestor for OS/2.
Specify SPX as the value for the COMAMID=, the COMAUX1=, or the COMAUX2= system
option.
<P>The SPX access method used by SAS/SHARE sometimes issues generalized
messages to identify problems.  Some of the most frequently encountered messages
are described in this section.  



<PRE>Supporting access method initialization failure</PRE>
<P>There is a configuration problem.  The Netware Requestor is not installed,
or it is not installed properly. Contact your system administrator.  



<PRE>Network name <I>server-id</I> already in use</PRE>
<P>The server that is specified by the SERVERID= option is already being
used by another application on your network.  



<PRE>Network partner <I>server-id</I> not found</PRE>
<P>The server that is specified in the SERVERID= option was not found.
 The server was not started, or it is on a different network, or it is using
a different packet type.
