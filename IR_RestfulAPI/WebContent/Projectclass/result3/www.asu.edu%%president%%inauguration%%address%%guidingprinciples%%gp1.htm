First,         last, and always, those of us who are members of the faculty are teachers.         In whatever capacity we act, regardless of our professional obligations,         however we define ourselves, we are above all teachers. Whether in the         classroom or laboratory or studio, whether serving on an administrative         committee, delivering a lecture, or meeting with students during office         hours, we are teachers. We teach through our words, but also through our         actions, through the values we profess, through the decisions we make,         through the ways that we interact with society. When I meet someone on         a flight and they ask me what I do, I say I&#8217;m a teacher. Of the         titles that I have held, there is none of which I am more proud. If you         are a member of the faculty, I assume you are here because you also define         yourself as a teacher. I cannot think of any role more fundamental to         the purpose of a university.<br>      </p>      <h2>&nbsp; </h2>      <p><br>      </p></td>    <td align="center" valign="top"> &nbsp;<BR> </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="bottom"><a href="index.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="../images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="gp2.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="gp2.htm"><img src="../images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>    <td align="center" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
