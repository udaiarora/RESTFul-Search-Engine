      <h2>First Lady recruits ASU students to teach in low-income
        schools</h2>
      <p>        Surrounded by a crowd of 20 fifth-grade students from Maxine O. Bush
          Elementary School in a room at the ASU Carson Student-Athlete Center,
          First Lady Laura Bush was transported back to her days as a fifth-grade
          public school teacher in Texas.<br>
        But she may not have been prepared for their questions.</p>
      <p>"Do you play basketball
          with the president?"</p>
      <p>"Do you wash dishes at the
          White House?"</p>
      <p>The gracious, unflappable wife
          of U.S. President George W. Bush recovered quickly and assured them
        that she and her husband do lots of things together,
          but basketball is not one of them, and no, someone else washes the
        dishes.</p>
      <p>Her
          visit with the class on May 9 was part of a Teach For America (TFA)
        recruiting event, arranged by Phoenix fifth-grade teacher Beth Berselli,
          who met Mrs. Bush when Berselli was a Washington Post reporter, and
        Christine
          Wilkinson, senior vice president and secretary of the university who
          is on TFA's regional advisory board.<br>
        Her remarks to about a hundred ASU students who attended were aimed
          at opening their eyes to the benefits of teaching in an inner-city
          or rural
          school, where TFA teachers commit to teach for two years.</p>
      <p>"There are few
          professions where you can see the impact of your work so vividly,"
        she said. "And there are few careers that have such a lasting
          effect on an entire generation and an entire nation."</p>
      <p>The children filled
          the risers on the stage, squirming only slightly as they waited for
        her speech. ASU President Michael Crow, waiting to
          introduce her, grinned widely at their anticipation and the hush that
          preceded her appearance.</p>
      <p>More than two million new teachers will be needed
          in America's classrooms in the next decade, Bush said. Nationwide,
        two-thirds of fourth-graders
          in the poorest schools cannot read a simple children's book, and many
          struggle with the alphabet.</p>
      <p>"Teaching is the absolute profession, the
          one that makes all others possible," said Bush. "Teachers help students
          develop the skills they need for a
          lifetime of learning. I wish all the ASU students here the very best
          as you go out into the world, and as you go out, I hope you'll think
          about teaching. Arizona's children are depending on you."</p>
      <p>Berselli's students
          had been behind in their math and reading levels, but now are excelling
          at reading, fractions and science. She said teaching
          is the toughest thing she's ever done. She is one of 120 TFA teachers
          in the Phoenix area, and 9,000 throughout the country. </p>
      <p>TFA works closely
          with ASU and the College of Education to recruit students, said Jason
          Williams, executive director. The organization is expanding
          the partnership to the W. P. Carey School of Business and the College
          of Law. Now in its 13th year, TFA trains its teachers to become lifelong
          advocates for children.</p>
      <p>Berselli described taking her class on a field
          trip to ASU in January, where her students were amazed that there was
          a bowling alley and restaurants.
          They enjoyed a tour of the Mars Space Flight Facility and a presentation
          by the admissions staff. She said they were anxious to come back.</p>
      <p>"We're
          holding a place for all of you," President Crow told the children.</p>
