<p><em><strong>Educator&rsquo;s love of learning creates passion for teaching</strong></em></p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left;"><em>Editor&rsquo;s note:</em><em> This is one of a series of articles highlighting the recent President&rsquo;s Professors and Regents&rsquo; Professors at ASU.</em></p>
<p align="center">Ever since ASU professor Alice Christie was a young high school teacher, her willingness to innovate has come in handy as situations altered her notions about teaching and learning.</p>

        <p><strong>Regents' and President's Professors </strong></p>
        <p>This year ASU is honoring the first class of ASU President's Professors. This new prestigious award, is designed to reward enthusiasm and innovation in teaching, the ability to inspire original and creative work by students, mastery of subject matter and scholarly contributions.</p>
        <p> Inaugural awardees are <a href="../200603/20060309_cerveny.htm">Randall Cerveny</a>, professor of geography; <a href="20060420_presidents_christie.htm">Alice Christie</a>, associate professor of technology and education; <a href="20060414_presidents_gould.htm">Ian Gould</a>, professor of chemistry and biochemistry; and the late <a href="20060427_presidents_rothstein.htm">Paul Rothstein</a>, associate professor of industrial design.</p>

        <p>Six ASU faculty members have been awarded Regents Professor appointments for 2006. Regents&rsquo; Professors are marked by excellence in teaching, exceptional achievements in research or other creative activities, and national and international distinction in their fields. Named by the Arizona Board of Regents, they serve as advisers to the university president and take on a broader role as consultants and teachers throughout the university.</p>
        <p> The members of this year's Regents' Professor class are: <a href="../200602/20060209_regents_candelaria.htm">Cordelia Candelaria</a>, Chicana and Chicano Studies; <a href="../200603/20060323_regents_chavez.htm">Carlos Castillo-Chavez</a>, Mathematics and Statistics Department; <a href="../200602/20060202_regents_montgomery.htm">Douglas Montgomery</a>, Industrial Engineering Department; <a href="20060407_regents_poste.htm">George Poste</a>, Biodesign Institute and School of Life Sciences; <a href="../200602/20060216_regents_prescott.htm">Edward Prescott</a>, Economics Department, <a href="../200603/20060331__regents_windhorst.htm">Rogier Windhorst</a>, Physics and Astronomy Department. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:left;">When asked to teach physics to her high school students, Christie &ndash; an English major &ndash; traded her physics textbook for a General Motors manual: an in-depth handbook on the four-stroke engine. Using the manual as a teaching aid, she was able to engage her students &ndash; and create an educational environment that was meaningful and intentional. </p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left;">In the late 1970s, she taught a student diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The student was unable to communicate and was frustrated by his disability. Christie applied for, and received, a grant to buy the student a state-of-the-art computer: a single-chip 64K microprocessor with a black-and-green screen.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left;">The student quickly was able to express himself and to be understood for the first time. It was at that point in her career Christie realized the power of technology &ndash; and its impact on the needs of diverse learners.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left;">&ldquo;I had an instant love affair with technol-</p>
<p>ogy and its potential for teaching and learning,&rdquo; says Christie, a professor in the College of Teacher Education and Leadership at ASU&rsquo;s West campus. &ldquo;Technology can serve as a tool to remove barriers and offer solutions.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In many ways, Christie is ahead of her time. She was born and raised in rural Pennsylvania on the outskirts of Philadelphia, and she attended an all-girls Quaker school between the ages of 4 &ndash; 18. Christie&rsquo;s perspectives are firmly rooted in this nontraditional educational experience.</p>
<p>Christie received a bachelor&rsquo;s degree from Denison University, a master&rsquo;s degree from Boston University and a doctorate in elementary education from ASU. Since 1995, she has taught numerous courses in technology and language arts for undergraduate and graduate students. </p>
<p>For almost 40 years, Christie has devoted her professional life to education, searching for innovative, meaningful ways to inspire her students. Her dedication earned her the distinction of President&rsquo;s Professor, an honor that awards faculty for their outstanding contributions to undergraduate education. Christie is one of four ASU professors to be named a President&rsquo;s Professor. She was recognized for her remarkable contributions to teaching and the use of technology in education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The use of technology in the classroom helps to create a very student-centered learning environment in which students can take charge of their own learning,&rdquo; Christie says. &ldquo;It helps students produce professional quality work that engages them and others around them, not only in the classroom but also in the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie&rsquo;s research and teaching interests focus on using the Internet across all curricular areas, as well as the social and educational implications of such use. A sample of her studies includes:</p>
<p>&bull; Examining how technology and multimedia can shape classroom knowledge and instruction.</p>
<p>&bull; Exploring gender bias in teacher-student interactions.</p>
<p>&bull; Studying whether having students post their work assignments to the Internet affects their learning.</p>
<p>Her leadership in developing &ldquo;learning communities&rdquo; for the first two incoming freshman classes of ASU&rsquo;s West campus led to the creation of the Web site &ldquo;The ASU West Freshman Experience.&rdquo; Christie&rsquo;s own Web site (www.west.asu.edu/achristie) averages more than 98,000 visitors each month, and has had than 3 million visitors since its inception in 1997. The site provides sound uses of technology in teaching and learning, and offers a variety of tutorials, activities and projects. The <em>Chronicle of Higher Education </em>called Christie&rsquo;s site one of the best educational portals on the Internet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her students rely on her site as a valuable source of information,&rdquo; says Joseph Ryan, interim dean of the College of Teacher Education and Leadership. &ldquo;Yet her love of face-to-face teaching is readily apparent. She delights in learning, looks for opportunities to co-learn with her students and creates a great sense of community within her classroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie engages her students in the learning process, using a technology-rich, hands-on approach. She creates assignments that are relevant to students, and she structures her classes to motivate students to attend and participate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more you challenge students to reach new levels of understanding, the more they will take responsibility for their own learning,&rdquo; Christie says. &ldquo;And the more students and instructors are learning together and understanding the value of each individual&rsquo;s contribution, the more self-worth students will feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Arizona Technology in Education Alliance (AzTEA) recently awarded Christie its prestigious Innovation Leadership Award. She was honored for influencing faculty, university students, and K-12 teachers and students. AzTEA described Christie as a &ldquo;true agent of change, encouraging every educator to incorporate the most appropriate technology to enrich their classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie is convinced that no teacher becomes a good teacher on his or her own. She credits her colleagues and students for offering many of the ideas that have made her a more effective teacher. As she nears the end of her fourth decade as an educator, she says she is grateful to have worked with so many educators, and she&rsquo;s thrilled to see her students excelling in classrooms around the state.</p>
<p>And if they ever need some advice on how to coordinate a lesson plan on physics, they know just where to turn. </p>
