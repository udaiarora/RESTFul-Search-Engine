Many of the forms referenced in the RSP manual can be found on ResearchNet at <a href="researchnet.html">http://researchnet.asu.edu/resources/forms.html</a>.<p>In the event of an inconsistency or conflict, applicable law and Board of Regents&#146; policies supersede university policies and university policies supersede college, department or lower unit bylaws, policies, or guidelines.<p>The university reserves the right to add, amend, or revoke any of the contained rules, policies, regulations, and instructions or incorporate additional ones, with or without notice, as circumstances or the good of the university community may require.<p>The online manual replaces earlier printed versions, which are no longer provided nor distributed.  A printout of this manual and each change to this manual, created from the original text source for the online version, is retained permanently as an official record at University Archives and is available for inspection.  Printouts of all revisions to online manuals will be similarly available.<p>&#160;<font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">RSP</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ORSPA&#160;Web&#160;<a href="orspa.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
