<br>ACADEMIC SENATE

<br>SPRING 2001 SESSION

<p><b>&nbsp;Senate Motion #&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp; (2000?01)</b>

<p>Motion Introduced by: Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee

<br>Michael Mayer, Chair

<p>Date of Introduction

<br>for First Reading: January 22, 2001

<p>Date of Second Reading: February 26, 2001

<p>Title of Motion: Request from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

to Change the Name of a Department

<p>1 The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic

Senate approval

<br>2 of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

to change the name of a

<br>3 department from Department of Family Resources and Human Development

to

<br>4 the Department&nbsp; of Family and Human Development

<p>Rationale:

<p>This request is due to the recent changes in the department, effective

July 1, 2000.&nbsp; The Nutrition program in the department transferred

to ASU East and became an independent department.&nbsp; As a result of

this transfer, the department is requesting a name change for the constituted

department on the main campus.&nbsp; The name change to the Department

of Family and Human Development more accurately and clearly reflects the

work of the faculty, students, and programs that will remain in the department.

<p>Because the faculty and programs that will remain in the department

focus on the study of families and individuals across the life span, the

name Family and Human Development is appropriate and accurate. Thus, it

is requested that the name of the department be changed to: Department

of Family and Human Development.&nbsp; This change involves dropping the

word ?Resources? from the current title (this term was used to include

nutrition).

<br>SPRING 2001 SESSION

<p><b>Senate Motion #&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp; (2000?01)</b>

<p>Motion Introduced by: Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee

<br>Michael Mayer, Chair

<p>Date of Introduction

<br>for First Reading: January 22, 2001

<p>Date of Second Reading: February 26, 2001

<p>Title of Motion: Request from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

to Change the Name of Degree Program

<p>Rationale:

<p>As a result of the name change of this department, the Department of

Family and Human Development is requesting that all degree titles that

include the name ?Department of Family Resources and Human Development?

be changed to ?Department of Family and Human Development.?&nbsp; This

includes: (1) the BS degree, (2) the minor, (3) the B.A.E. Secondary Education

degree, and (4) the MS degree.

<br>SPRING 2001 SESSION

<p><b>&nbsp;Senate Motion #&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp; (2000?01)</b>

<p>Motion Introduced by: Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee

<br>Michael Mayer, Chair

<p>Date of Introduction

<br>for First Reading: February 26, 2001

<p>Date of Second Reading: April 2, 2001

<p>Title of Motion: Request from the College of Business to Change the

Name of Degree Program

<p>1 The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic

Senate approval

<br>2 of a proposal submitted by the College of Business to change the

name of a

<br>3 degree program from MS in Information Management to MS in E-Business

and

<br>4 Information Systems

<p>Rationale:

<p>The reasons for the name change are that advances in technology have

changed and continue to markedly change the global business landscape.&nbsp;

Terms such as E-Commerce and E-Business are now very much part of the vocabulary.&nbsp;

In response, to market their programs, universities have increasingly responded

by re-branding their technology rich programs with names such as Master

of E-Commerce or Master of E-Business.&nbsp; Prospective employers and

prospective students, in their search processes, now look for these names.

<p>Date of Second Reading: April 2, 2001

<p>Title of Motion: Request from the College of Fine Arts for the Disestablishment

<p>1 The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic

Senate approval

<br>2 of a proposal submitted by the College of Fine Arts for the disestablishment

of a

<br>3 Degree Program BFA Theatre

<p>Rationale:

<p>Previously, the request to disestablish the Theatre Education concentration

was sent forward and approved.&nbsp; As a follow-up, it is now requested

that the BFA degree in the Theatre Department be eliminated, as well.&nbsp;

The BFA degree in Theatre no longer is associated with any major or concentration

areas.

<p><b>Senate Motion #&nbsp; 11&nbsp;&nbsp; (2000?01)</b>

<p>Motion Introduced by: Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee

<br>Michael Mayer, Chair

<p>Date of Introduction

<br>for First Reading: February 26, 2001

<p>Date of Second Reading: April 2, 2001

<p>Title of Motion: Request from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

for the Establishment of an Undergraduate Certificate in Classical Studies

<p>1 The Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic

Senate approval

<br>2 of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

for the establishment

<br>3 of an Undergraduate Certificate in Classical Studies

<p>Rationale:

<p>The certificate program in Classical Studies will benefit both the students

and the university in a number of ways.&nbsp; By means of the certificate

program in Classical Studies, students will be able to augment and enrich

their degree programs in related fields with an organized and consistent

curriculum which will expose them to many aspects of ancient language and

culture, and they will also be prepared to pursue advanced studies in Classical

Studies or in related fields in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Ancient

History, English, Art History, or Philosophy with the strength of an approved

program behind them.
