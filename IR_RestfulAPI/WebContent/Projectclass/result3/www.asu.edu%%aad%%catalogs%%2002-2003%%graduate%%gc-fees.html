For more decal sales information, call 480/965-6124, or visit the Web site at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/dps/pts">www.asu.edu/dps/pts</a>.</p><p>Each vehicle registered at ASU Parking and Transit Services must comply with Arizona emission standards (A.R.S. &#167; 15-1627G) during the entire registration period. The fee for this emission inspection is $25 per vehicle.</p><p>Everyone is encouraged to support travel reduction measures by carpooling, bicycling, walking, using mass transit, or the university shuttle bus, whenever possible.</p><p><a name="parking-violations"></a></p><p><b>Parking Violations.</b> Due to a high demand for parking, regulations are strictly enforced. Fines range from $10 to $100. Appeals to parking citations may be filed within 14 calendar days to Parking and Transit Services and, after payment, may be further appealed to the Parking Citation Appeals Board. Unpaid parking citations are delinquent financial obligations subject to the provisions of the &#8220;<a href="#delinquent-financial-obligations">Delinquent Financial Obligations</a>.&#8221; The vehicle of any person owing three or more unpaid parking citations or $100 in unpaid parking citations is subject to impoundment.

For more information, call 480/965-4527.</p><p><a name="returned-checks"></a></p><p><b>Returned Checks.</b> Checks returned by a bank are assessed a $15 service charge with repayment needed within five business days of notification. A second $12 service charge is made if the returned check is not repaid within this five-day period. Repayment of a returned check must typically be in cash.</p><p>The university may have arrangements with its bank to redeposit automatically for a second time checks for which there are insufficient funds. No service charge is assessed by ASU until a check is returned to ASU; however, the payer may be assessed a service charge by the payer&#8217;s financial institution.</p><p>Students paying fees with a check that is subsequently not honored by a financial institution are subject to involuntary withdrawal from the university if repayment is not made. All students involuntarily withdrawn are charged according to the standard refund schedule as of the involuntary withdrawal date, as determined by the university.</p><p><a name="on-campus-housing"></a></p><p><b>On-Campus Housing.</b> The cost of ASU Main housing varies. In 2000&#8211;2001 the typical cost was $3,100 per academic year. Meal plans are purchased separately.</p><p><a name="transportation"></a></p><h2>TRANSPORTATION - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h2><p>To reduce air pollution and traffic congestion, students are encouraged to travel to and from campus by means other than automobile and to reduce transportation needs through careful class scheduling. Nearby on-campus parking is limited and tightly controlled.</p><p>Alternative transportation modes are used by thousands of ASU students. ASU is served by a regional transit service; monthly and reduced-fare semester passes are available on campus. In addition, an inexpensive express shuttle runs between ASU Main in Tempe and ASU West in northwest Phoenix; another shuttle runs among ASU Main, Mesa Community College, and ASU East in Mesa; and a Free Local Area Shuttle (FLASH) is available around the periphery of ASU Main. A free Neighborhood Flash also is available for the ASU community connecting the Escalante and University Heights neighborhoods with the Riverside/Sunset and Lindon Park neighborhoods through downtown Tempe and ASU Main.</p><p>Bicycle ridership at ASU is estimated to be more than 15,000 students daily. Ample racks in many locations enable the parking and securing of bicycles. Bicycle use is restricted only in those areas of campus where pedestrian traffic is sufficiently heavy to make such use a hazard. The Bike Co-op Repair Service provides assistance with bicycle maintenance.</p><p>For more information on commute alternatives, call 480/965-1072.</p><p><a name="payment-methods-and-deadlines"></a></p><h2>PAYMENT METHODS AND DEADLINES - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h2><p><a name="sundial"></a></p><p><b>SunDial.</b> The SunDial system, at 480/350-1500, allows students to register for classes, to drop and add classes, and to make fee payment from any touch-tone phone.

All of the evidence is weighed under the presumption that a nonresident student&#8217;s presence in Arizona is primarily for the purpose of education and not to establish domicile and that decisions of an individual about the intent to establish domicile are generally made after the completion of an education and not before.</p><p>To obtain resident status for tuition purposes, independent students must establish their residence in Arizona at least one year before the last day of regular registration for the semester in which they propose to attend ASU. Arizona residence is generally established when individuals are physically present in the state with the intention of making Arizona their permanent home.</p><p>Mere physical presence in Arizona for one year does not automatically establish residency for tuition purposes. Adult students and emancipated minors must combine physical presence in Arizona for one year with objective evidence of their intent to make Arizona their permanent home. If these steps are delayed, the one-year period is extended until both presence and intent have been demonstrated for one full year. In addition to physical presence and intent, the student must demonstrate financial independence for the two tax years immediately preceding the request for resident classification. The student must demonstrate objective evidence of self-support and that he or she was not claimed as an income tax deduction by his or her parents or any other individual for two years. An adult student is defined as being at least 18 years of age at the beginning of the domicile year. For a complete definition of an emancipated minor, refer to the Arizona Board of Regents&#8217; residency classification policies, available in the Residency Classification Section, SSV 146.</p><p>No person is considered to have gained or lost resident status merely by attending an out-of-state educational institution.</p><p><a name="aliens"></a></p><p><b>Aliens.</b> Students who are aliens are subject to the same requirements for resident status as are U.S. citizens. In establishing domicile, aliens must not hold a visa that prohibits establishing domicile in Arizona.</p><p><a name="refugees"></a></p><p><b>Refugees.</b> Refugees may qualify as resident students by virtue of having been granted refugee status in accordance with all applicable laws of the United States and having met all other requirements for residence in Arizona.</p><p><a name="exceptions-to-the-general-residency-rule"></a></p><h3>Exceptions to the General Residency Rule - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>Students may be eligible for resident status for tuition purposes if they can meet one of the following criteria on or before the last day of regular registration.</p><p><a name="legal-dependents"></a></p><p><b>Legal Dependents.</b> If a student and his or her parents are domiciled in Arizona and have not met the one-year residency requirement but the parents are entitled to claim the student as a dependent for federal and state tax purposes, the student may be eligible for resident status for tuition purposes.</p><p><a name="transferred-employees"></a></p><p><b>Transferred Employees.</b> If students are domiciled in Arizona and have not met the one-year residency requirement but are employees or spouses of employees who have been transferred to Arizona by their employers for employment purposes, the students may be eligible for resident status for tuition purposes.</p><p><a name="members-of-the-military"></a></p><p><b>Members of the Military.</b> If students are not domiciled in Arizona but are members of the U.S. Armed Forces stationed in Arizona or are the spouses or dependent children of a member (as defined in A.R.S. &#167; 43-1001), the students may be eligible for resident status for tuition purposes. If military service is concluded while they are enrolled, students do not lose resident status while they are continuously enrolled in a degree program. If individuals are domiciled in Arizona immediately before becoming members of the U.S. Armed Forces, they do not lose resident status because of their absence while on active duty with the military as long as they maintain Arizona affiliations and file Arizona state tax.</p><p>A student who is a member of an Arizona National Guard or Arizona Reserve unit may be eligible for resident status for tuition purposes. A student may also be eligible if he or she has been honorably discharged from the armed forces of the United States, has declared Arizona as his or her legal residence one year before discharge, and has taken the other appropriate actions, including filing an Arizona income tax return. A student who is the spouse or dependent of a member of the armed forces who has claimed Arizona as his or her legal residence and filed Arizona income tax for one year before enrollment may be eligible for resident status for tuition purposes.</p><p><a name="teachers-and-classroom-aides"></a></p><p><b>Teachers and Classroom Aides.</b> If a student is under contract to teach on a full-time basis or is employed as a full-time non-certified classroom aide at a school within a school district, the student is eligible to pay resident tuition only for courses necessary to complete the requirements for certification by the State Board of Education.</p><p><a name="native-americans"></a></p><p><b>Native Americans.</b> Students who are members of a Native American tribe whose reservation lies both in Arizona and an adjacent state and who are residents of that reservation may be eligible for resident status for tuition purposes.</p><p><a name="procedures-for-establishing-resident-status"></a></p><h3>Procedures for Establishing Resident Status - <font size="-1"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></h3><p>All students are responsible for obtaining residency classification for tuition purposes before registering and paying their fees. This procedure requires students to complete and file an Arizona residency information form. This form is required of all new and returning students as part of the admission or readmission process. Students classified as nonresidents who believe they may qualify for resident status must file a petition with the Residency Classification Section. This petition must be filed by the last day of regular registration. A student seeking resident status must also file supporting documentation necessary to provide a basis for residency classification (source[s] of support, driver&#8217;s license, voter&#8217;s registration, vehicle registration, etc.). Students whose residency petitions are in process at the fee payment deadline are responsible for paying nonresident tuition. However, an appropriate refund is issued if resident status is later granted for that semester.</p><p>Any student found to have made a false or misleading statement concerning resident status is subject to dismissal from the university.</p><p>Failure to file a timely written petition for reclassification of resident status for tuition purposes constitutes a waiver of the student&#8217;s right to apply for the given semester. Petition deadlines are published each semester in the <i>Schedule of Classes.</i> Extensions to the deadlines are not permitted.</p><p>Residency classification is an extremely complex issue. The information presented here is a summary and does not address each individual&#8217;s situation; therefore, students are encouraged to make a personal visit to the Residency Classification Section to discuss their individual circumstances as soon as possible. Guidelines for determination of residency for tuition purposes are subject to review and change without notice.
