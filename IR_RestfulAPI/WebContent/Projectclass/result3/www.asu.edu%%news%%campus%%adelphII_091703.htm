      <h2>University to build fraternity complex</h2>
      <p>        The last time ASU built new housing for campus fraternities, John F.
          Kennedy was president of the United States. Times have changed, and
        so will fraternity housing at ASU.</p>
      <p>Adelphi II is a public/private partnership
            project that will create new, small group housing for six ASU fraternities
            on a site south and east
          of the existing Adelphi Commons on Apache Boulevard. Adelphi Commons
          is home of ASU's 10 sorority chapters.</p>
      <p>Adelphi II, a $13.4-million project,
          will be built on Sunset Drive, south of Apache Blvd. The Sunset and
        Desert Vista apartments as well as the
          Pigg residence, three properties recently acquired by the university
          for the project, currently occupy the site. Demolition and site preparation
          work began Sept. 8 and the formal ground breaking for the project is
          expected in October.</p>
      <p>Sally Ramage, associate dean of student development,
          says Adelphi II is based on the success of the Adelphi Commons Project.</p>
      <p>"Our sororities
          tell us that Adelphi Commons has worked out exceptionally well," she
          says. "The new group housing is organized into distinct clusters
          for each organization or group. Each cluster consists of 44 bed spaces,
          a community room, a study/dining room, a common kitchen, and a private
          courtyard. The new project also includes a larger community space for
          use by any of the groups housed there. Students and alumni worked with
          the architects to help create a design that reflects the identity of
          the groups and the importance of the area to the Greek community."</p>
      <p>The
          advantages of the new group housing cited by Ramage include professional
          management, better maintenance of facilities, nearby location of the
          sorority housing and being part of the evolving south campus residential
          development.</p>
      <p>"Our goal is to create community spirit for the students
          involved in the Greek system," she says. "Having the two projects in
          close proximity
          will help that sense of community develop and make it easier for the
          fraternities and sororities to develop joint programming."</p>
      <p>The current
          design will house only six of ASU's 16 national fraternities. However,
          Ramage says there could be a second phase of development that
          would accommodate additional fraternities.</p>
      <p>"Adelphi II has been designed
          with the idea of some future expansion," she says. "Any expansion will
          be determined by the demand for group housing
          in the future. The continuing interest in ASU by national fraternities
          in this type of housing, as well as the interest of the unhoused ASU
          fraternities to move on campus, will be the indicator for future development."</p>
      <p>Most
          of the fraternities that will be housed in the project are currently
          located on Adelphi Drive south of Apache and east of McAllister Ave.
          They occupy university owned houses that were constructed during the
          1950s. Once the groups move into the new housing in the fall of 2004,
          the old houses will be demolished.</p>
      <p>The developer of the project is Century
          Development, one of the largest developers of university housing in
        the nation. Century Management, a
          subsidiary of Century Development, will manage the project in partnership
          with ASU once construction is complete. Century Development helped
        ASU build the neighboring Adelphi Commons project and Century Management
          currently works with ASU in managing that building as well.</p>
      <p>The contractor
          for the project is the Kitchell Corporation and the project is being
          designed by Gould/Evans Architects.</p>
      <p>Funding for Adelphi II will
          come from bonds issued by the Arizona Capital Facilities Group, a 623
          corporation, which has helped provide funds for
        the construction of several university projects.</p>
