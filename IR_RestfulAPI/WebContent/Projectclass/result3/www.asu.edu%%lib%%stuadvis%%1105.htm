                        <p ><strong>LSAC Student Members</strong> <strong>Attendees</strong>: Shannon Holland, Yen Yeh, Bradley Butterfield, John Cole, Cathryn Meegan, Jon 
                        Grindell, Natalie Hyde, Leigh Hesey</p>

                        <h3>Sherrie Schmidt, Dean of the University Libraries </h3>
                        <p> Dean Schmidt welcomed the students and highlighted several areas where student tuition dollars have been spent to support the libraries:: </p>                        <ul>
                          <li>                          Extending the Hayden Library hours to 24/5</li>
                          <li> Last year Additional $1 million purchase of journals/books</li>
                          <li> This year $420,000 increase in journals and books</li>
                        </ul>                        <p>&nbsp;                        </p>
                        <h3>Vicki Coleman, Associate Dean for Public Services</h3>
                        <p>Associate Dean Coleman addressed several issues that had been brought up at the previous LSAC meeting in <a href="0405.htm">April 2005</a>: </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li> <strong>Comments that Hayden Library is difficult to navigate</strong>: The library created a new position, the Coordinator of Instruction, Outreach and Marketing. This coordinator is currently overseeing improvements in signage and directories.</li>
                          <li> <strong>Need for more computers and software in the libraries</strong>: MS Office suite installed on most library computers. The library has responded to the increase in demand for computers in the Hayden Library by opening up the C41 instruction room as a &quot;Computer Overflow Area&quot;.</li>
                          <li> <strong>Need for vending/food in Noble Library</strong>: The library is currently working on determining the feasibility of adding vending machines to the Noble Library; trying to determine location for vending machines for the Noble Library perhaps in the &ldquo;covered patio&rdquo; area.</li>
                          <li><strong>Need to increase efforts to &ldquo;Getting the Word Out&rdquo; about library services</strong>: The library has taken to heart the comments that we need to get out of the library and be where the students are. The fall semester saw Lost/Welcome tables, and a promotion with Cereality on mall area promoting our new services. More events are planned. </li>
                          <li> <strong>Expansion of the caf&eacute; area to both sides of the courtyard </strong></li>
                          <li> <strong>Exhibits being more prominent</strong>: Exhibits now being set up in Hayden Entrance and Exhibit Committee submitted request to purchase new exhibit cases to be placed in the Hayden Library lobby area.</li>
                          <li> <strong>Book Retrieval Service</strong>: Access Services staff is trying to pilot the project to determine what the work flow is, costs, etc. </li>
                          <li> <strong>Opening other Hayden Library Entrance</strong>s: Currently difficult because of there are no services on that floor. The library is concerned about customers not knowing where to go from that location. But it is still being considered as part of long term plans.<br>
                        </li>
                        </ul>                        
                        <h3> Communication to Students</h3>
                        <p>Jennie Duvernay the Coordinator of Instruction, Outreach and Marketing led a discussion of what types of communication with students work. LSAC members were asked what kinds of communication do they respond to. Comments included:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>  Some students find emails to be effective</li>
                          <li> Emma announcments are more visible than myASU announcements</li>
                          <li> Signs need to catch attention: Make writing big</li>
                          <li> Within departments &ndash; going up stairwells &ndash; if you have to be focusing</li>
                          <li> Poster by testing center &ndash; </li>
                          <li> RA Briefings &ndash; residential life</li>
                          <li> Welcome week</li>
                          <li>Emphasize &ldquo;free&rdquo; / &ldquo;food&rdquo;</li>
                          <li>Go through  Specific colleges and tailor message</li>
                          <li>Tell people about 24/7</li>
                          <li> Visuals can get attention &ndash; pictures/testimonials; why is it there, what can I do with this</li>
                          <li>Increase work with  English Composition classes</li>
                          <li> Grad student orientation &ndash; testimony from someone similar</li>
                          <li> RefWorks &ndash; upgrade online tutorials: send short email out pointing to email</li>
                        </ol>                        
                        <h3><br>
                          <br>
                          Student issues</h3>                        <p><strong>Recall</strong><br>
                          LSAC member reported that a colleague was disturbed by a recent recall of a library item, both by the language in the notice and by the concept of the recall because they still needed to use the material. They wondered if there would be a way a way to compromise or negotiate with the person who recalls?</p>
                          <p>Some responses to this included:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>                            There is a major issue of patron/custoemr privacy. The library is not able to divulge what individual has a particular item checked out so we are not able to offer the type of negotiations desired</li>
                            <li>It was commented that some recalls could be prevented.
                              <ul>
                                <li> By using <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/db/worldcat.htm"><strong>Worldcat</strong></a>, you can see if any other libraries in the area or UofA or NAU have the item you need</li>
                                <li>If UofA or NAU has the item, you can request through <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/ill/"><strong>Interlibrary Loan</strong></a> an item that is checked out at ASU </li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>
                          </ul>                          <p>&nbsp;</p>                        <p><strong>Book Retrieval</strong></p>
                          <p><strong>Suggestion from an LSAC student member:<br>
                            </strong>&quot;<em>Can a subscription book retrieval service be started (that is for a small fee can we pay to have someone pull our books so they await us at the front desk &ndash; we could use the on-line catalogue and just hit request &ndash; if it is at our &ldquo;home&rdquo; library then it asks if we&rsquo;re willing to pay $.15 for the book or whatever &ndash; money maker for the library &ndash; also employees more student workers ? preferably during the night increasing library staff presence at night </em>&quot; <br>
                          </p>
                          <p>A major discussion of this occurred. The LSAC students were asked specifically if students would be willing to pay for such a service, and there was no consensus reached. A question arose about how long items would be on hold, as they would then be unavailable for other students. Also asked was how they would be willing/able to pay (such as with SunDollars?) </p>
                          <p><br>
                            There was no resolution reached to this issue.  It remains a possibility for the library to institute such a service, and a study of it is ongoing. Stay tuned for more details!<br>
                          </p>
                          <p><strong>Space in the Library </strong><br>
                          Students observed that seating is at a premium much of the day, but while chairs and tables full, individual study carrels in louder areas tend more unused. In addition students commented that the graffiti in the fabric covered carrels in Hayden is distracting. The 
                        Quiet Study Room is a valued space, but it was suggested to  look at furniture selection and placement to encourage quiet behavior (for example, move group tables out and move more individual carrels and seating in). The large group tables could be moved to the upper concourse area which has been designated for group study.</p>
                          <p><br> 
                            Students also commented that it was frustrating to see so many of the                             Graduate student carrel unused when they needed to find quiet places to work on the upper levels of the library. The library is going to study this issue immediately to see if there is a way to open up some of the carrels for individuals to use, instead of having them be locked.<br>
                          </p>                          
                          <p><strong>Cell phones</strong><br>
                        Students commented that cell phone use in the libraries continues to be disruptive. But it was also observed that any signage asking people to not use their cell phones has been ineffective. The concept of students providing feedback on this disruption to each other was explored. Again, no consensus was reached on how to address this problem.</p>
                          <p>&nbsp;</p>
                          <h3>Follow Up Comments:</h3>
                          <p>After the LSAC meeting was over, two students emailed comments and suggestions to the library:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Only one enterance into Hayden instead of the 'exit side' and the 'enter side'. Cut off one of them and it would make more space for the cafe and even
                              more tables on the other side of the cafe.</li>
                            <li>Display more art. I think it would be great if the libraries had something 
                              that was appealing in memorable inside. More display cases would be great but 
                              I was thinking bigger, something that catches the eye. I like the big
                              photographs they put in the windows of the ASU foundation building. I just
                              think the libraries need a little more color.</li>
                            <li>A cafe over at Noble would make such a difference. It would generate more
                              people and would attract a lot of attention. The cafe at Hayden has been a
                            success, right? It could also add to more places to study outside.</li>
                            <li> A very good way of reaching the freshman class with information would be to run 
a short 20-30 sec commercial on SDTV.&nbsp; this is a tv channel run by the 
university that is only seen on campus- mainly in the dorms.&nbsp; my brain was kind 
of off and running during the meeting and I already have a rough draft for a 
script idea for the spot.&nbsp; I could line up a production team in no time at all. 
I am sure with your resources something of this nature is do-able.&nbsp; SDTV is run 
by the school of journalism on campus. <br>
                              <br>
                                                                                                        </li>
                          </ul>                          <blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
