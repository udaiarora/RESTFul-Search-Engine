				<h1>ASU Announces New Financial Aid Program for Arizona Families</h1>
				<p>In keeping with ASU President Michael Crow's vision of the New American University, a university of the highest academic rank that is also accessible, ASU is launching a series of new initiatives called &quot;Access ASU.&quot; To enhance support for Arizona students and families pursuing higher education, the cornerstone of the first initiative is a new financial aid program for low-income Arizona high school seniors. Upon enrolling at ASU, all <a href="../glossary.html#direct_costs">costs directly</a> related to obtaining an undergraduate degree will be covered for these students. </p>
				<p> The program, &quot;ASU Advantage,&quot; is targeted to Arizona families whose total annual family income is $18,850 or less. Through a combination of financial aid resources that do not require repayment, ASU will cover the annual cost of tuition, fees, books, room and board for eight semesters of full-time enrollment. ASU officials believe this program is the only one of its kind in the West.</p>
				<p> &quot;ASU is committed to reducing and removing barriers students may encounter when pursuing their educational goals. This program is one of several strategies we are advancing to do just that,&quot; says Jim Rund, vice president for University Undergraduate Initiatives. </p>
				<p> Arizona freshmen are automatically considered for the program once the student has been admitted to ASU and submitted their financial aid application (FAFSA). No other application is required for consideration.</p>
				<p> While ASU Advantage is targeted for students who have significant financial need, ASU is committed to supporting Arizona families from a wide range of income levels. </p>
				<p> &quot;Many people assume that they either do not qualify for financial aid or that financial aid is just about loans,&quot; says Craig Fennell, executive director of Student Financial Assistance. &quot;The ASU Advantage is one of several ways we are able to help Arizona families.&quot;</p>
				<p>ASU's gift aid program, which includes both merit and need based aid, is substantial. ASU has increased institutional grant aid by 157 percent since 2002. This additional aid, combined with ASU's tradition of generous scholarship support, resulted in the highest amount of gift aid ASU has ever offered to Arizona residents. In 2003-04, nearly 11,600 Arizona undergraduates received more than $34 million in ASU grant and scholarship aid; nearly $24 million was awarded to students who demonstrated financial need.</p>
				<p> This year, eligible Arizona undergraduate students with an annual family income of $20,000-$50,000 received on average $2,200 in ASU grant support. Those of the same group eligible for ASU scholarships were awarded on average $4,200. For eligible Arizona students from families with an annual income of $50,000-$80,000, students received on average $1,400 in ASU grant aid and those qualified earned ASU scholarship support averaging $4,300.</p>
				<p>&quot;Every family's financial circumstance is unique. We encourage families to complete a FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) every year so that they can learn about what types of aid are available to them,&quot; says Fennell. </p>
