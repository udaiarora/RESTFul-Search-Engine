      <h2><strong>Beauty not a factor in teaching evaluation, study says</strong></h2>
      <p> Looks don&rsquo;t have much at all to do with how an instructor is rated by his or her students, according to a new research study by faculty at ASU&rsquo;s College of Public Programs. </p>
      <p> The results challenge a recent University of Texas at Austin study (Hammermesh &amp; Parker, 2003) that caused quite a stir in academia and the press, when it suggested that attractive instructors received significantly better student evaluations of their teaching than their plainer counterparts. </p>
      <p> The ASU research concludes that the UT findings omitted many independent variables that other studies show are important. By including them, the ASU study sheds more light on the continuing debate over how much value institutions of higher education should place on student evaluations of teaching (SETs). The Association of American University Professors takes the policy position that SETs should not be used as the primary measure of teaching effectiveness. </p>
      <p> In their study, ASU researchers Heather Campbell (School of Public Affairs), Karen Gerdes (School of Social Work) and Susan Steiner (School of Social Work) collected data on 53 instructors teaching 78 classes in five departments and controlled for most factors considered to affect student evaluations of college faculty. They found that attractiveness was the least important factor of professor personal attributes, such as age, gender, race/ethnicity and others. </p>
      <p> The results suggest either that looks have no effect, or else exactly the opposite effect of the Hammermesh and Parker study, implying that plainer instructors receive better student evaluations of their teaching, if all other factors are equal. Another interesting comparison possible from the number of factors in the ASU data suggests that attractiveness is less important than gender, minority status and age in determining how teachers will be rated. </p>
      <p> The research team also ran the Hammermesh and Parker model on their data to make sure that the difference in results was not caused by ASU&rsquo;s smaller sample size or the possibility that Texas students care more about instructor looks than do ASU students. They came very close to replicating the Texas model on the ASU data, and those results misleadingly indicated that attractiveness matters. This exercise supports the inference that Hammermesh and Parker&rsquo;s conclusion of the importance of instructor beauty is caused by omitted variable bias. </p>
      <p> While the researchers at ASU acknowledge that prior evidence of gender and age bias is validated by their work, they have not found evidence of bias caused by the factor of instructor beauty. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;The debate will continue on this issue, but the facts are, at least at ASU, that SET procedures are in place, students like them, and there is no clear research indicating what measure of teaching quality is better,&rdquo; Campbell says. &ldquo;The question of how one&rsquo;s appearance contributes to professional success and performance is broad, but our team concluded that at least students aren&rsquo;t shallow enough to judge teaching quality based on superficial physical attributes.&rdquo; </p>
