This book describes the capabilities of the Analyst Application, a         point-and-click interface to basic statistical analysis in the SAS
System. The Analyst Application provides easy access to both               statistical analyzes and associated graphical tasks. The book includes
step-by-step instructions for using Analyst to perform tasks such as       hypothesis tests, table analysis, ANOVA, regression, survival analysis,
repeated measurements, mixed models, and basic power computations. In      addition, the book describes how you can import data from a variety of
sources, edit value, compute new variables, rearrange your data table,     and manage your results with the results tree.
