      <h2>Sater builds ties to village through housing project</h2>
      <p>        For one ASU employee, global engagement has taken on a personal meaning
          after spending two weeks in Romania helping to build homes for low-income
      families.</p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/gini_sater_100303.jpg" width="288" height="199" align="right">Gini Sater, assistant to the vice president for University
            Undergraduate Initiatives, spent two weeks this August in Beius,
        Romania, leading a
          team of 11 volunteers in a housing project for Habitat for Humanity.
          The trip, through the organization's Global Village program, was designed
          to help the local Habitat affiliate complete a four-plex for several
        Romanian families.</p>
      <p>"People talk about trips like this as life-changing
          experiences," she says. "I like to think of it more as a life-affirming
          experience. It
          is rewarding to know you have contributed in some way to the quality
          of life for a family, and it also reminds you of all of the good things
        you have in your own life."</p>
      <p>As the team leader, Sater was charged with
          planning the trip, selecting her team of volunteers and coordinating
          with the Habitat affiliate while
          the group was in Romania. The construction was led by Romanian builders
        and a professional foreman.</p>
      <p>It was Sater's second trip to the town of
          10,000 people near the Hungarian border. In 2001, Sater worked with
        a team that renovated an old, communist-era
          apartment building. It was such a rewarding effort that Sater wanted
          to lead a return trip. <br>
        Sater says the team performed mostly exterior work - installing siding
        and stuccoing the second floor of the building. </p>
      <p>"We also tiled the roof,
          which meant moving at least 2,000 pieces of tile from the delivery
        truck, to the house and then onto the roof," says
          Sater. "We finished the roof on our last day, and everyone cheered
        loudly when that last piece of tile was put on."</p>
      <p>The team, which stayed at a
          family home, also got to learn about life in a small town in Romania
          and the challenges that Romanians face as
        their country develops.</p>
      <p>"Habitat's philosophy is that families work together
          to build their homes and those of their neighbors," says Sater. "We
        got to work with the future
          homeowners and learn what their lives have been like before and after
          the fall of communism. We also worked with orphans who are in a job
        training program, so we were able to learn more about their life experiences
        as
        well."</p>
      <p>Sater encourages people to consider volunteering with Habitat,
          noting that global engagement can mean anything from spending a Saturday
          volunteering
          in south Phoenix to spending a week in South America. She says volunteers
        don't need construction experience, just a desire to help others. </p>
