      <h2 align="left">Leading American Indian scholar, policy analyst joins ASU</h2>
      <p>Eddie F. Brown, noted researcher and administrator who has helped create American Indian policy at the highest levels, became director of American Indian Studies at ASU on Aug. 2. Brown is a former assistant secretary for Indian Affairs at the U.S. Department of Interior.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Brown's appointment is part of President Michael Crow's efforts to gather a critical mass of scholars of American Indian culture at ASU to encourage teaching and research across disciplines. </p>
      <p>For the past eight years, Brown has been director of the Kathryn M. Buder Center for American Indian Studies, George Warren Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo. An Arizona native, he also has held positions as executive director of the department of human services for the Tohono O'odham Nation and director of the Arizona Department of Economic Security. </p>
      <p>"We were elated when Ed Brown applied for the position," says James Riding In, justice studies professor who has moved to American Indian Studies. "He had a great post in St. Louis, but much of his research and service has been in Arizona. He is extremely well qualified to take our program to national prominence." </p>
      <p>Brown's research has included the only longitudinal study on the impact of the 1996 welfare reform on American Indian families and children. Having worked with the Salt River Pima-Maricopa, San Carlos Apache and Navajo tribes, he testified before the U.S. Senate on the need for economic development on reservations, in addition to education and training opportunities, transportation and child care. </p>
      <p>"I have a close connection with ASU. I was an associate professor in the ASU graduate school of social work in the late 1970s," says Brown, "and all my research has been there with Arizona tribes. </p>
      <p>"I'm really excited because President Crow has set an aggressive agenda on the need to become more involved with tribes on a partnership basis. In talking with the president and the provost, I was very impressed. I wasn't planning to leave St. Louis, but I couldn't have found a better opportunity." </p>
      <p>The youngest of eight children and the first in his family to go to college, Brown grew up in Ajo and is an enrolled member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, while his mother was a Tohono O'odham. Brown received his bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University and his master's and doctorate in social work from the University of Utah. He currently serves on the U.S. President's Board of Advisors on Tribal Colleges and Universities. </p>
      <p>The fledgling ASU American Indian Studies program already enrolls 70 majors, exceeding expectations when it was approved by the Arizona Board of Regents in the Spring of 2001. Twenty students have graduated. The program also is home to Wicazo Sa Review, a respected journal of American Indian Studies. </p>
      <p>On July 1, the program moved from the College of Public Programs to the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. </p>
      <p>Program director Carol Lujan will resume her faculty responsibilities in Fall 2005, after completing a one-year sabbatical in New Mexico to work on several research projects. </p>
      <p><em>Auffret, with Media Relations &amp; Public Information, can be reached at (480) 965-6991 or (sauffret@asu.edu). </em></p>
