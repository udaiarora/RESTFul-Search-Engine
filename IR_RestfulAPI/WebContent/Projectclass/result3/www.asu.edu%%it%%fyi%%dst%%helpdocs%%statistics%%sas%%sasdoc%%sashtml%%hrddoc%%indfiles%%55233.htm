Biomedical and social science researchers who want to analyze survival     data with the SAS System will find just what they need with this
easy-to-read and comprehensive guide. Written for the person with a        modest statistical background and minimal knowledge of SAS software,
this book teaches many aspects of data input and manipulation. Numerous    examples of SAS code and output make this an eminently practical book
ensuring that even the uninitiated becomes a sophisticated user of         survival analysis. The main topics presented include censoring,
survival curves, Kaplan-Meier estimation, accelerated failure time         models, Cox regression models, and discrete-time analysis. Also
included are topics not usually covered such as time-dependent             covariates, competing risks, and repeated events.
