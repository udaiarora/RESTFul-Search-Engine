      <h2>Summer program targets childhood reading</h2>
      <p>        For one ASU researcher, an important key to helping children with their
          future reading skills rests with a simple language building block -
      words.</p>
      <p>Shelley Gray, an assistant professor in Speech &amp; Hearing
          Sciences, says that in a developing child, vocabulary size is an important
          predictor
        for language growth and reading acquisition. Children with poor vocabularies
        have difficulty understanding and expressing their thoughts and are less
      successful predicting what printed words might say. </p>
      <p>"Vocabulary forms
          an important basis for learning," says Gray, who is in the middle of
          a three-year grant from the National Institutes of Health.
          "If you don't have the right words, you will have trouble talking to
          your family, teachers and friends. If you can't get your thoughts across,
          you will have trouble socially. Reading and writing are based on oral
        vocabulary and language development."</p>
      <p>With the help of a second grant,
          this one from the ASU/Motorola Great Communities program, Gray is putting
          her research into action to help
          children who may be at risk for reading deficiencies. The program,
        Literary Leaps, is being offered through Tempe Elementary School District's
        (TSD)
          summer program from 8 a.m. - noon, Monday - Friday, throughout the
        month of June. It is open to children from all school districts. The
        project
          is a partnership between TSD, ASU and the Arizona Literacy and Learning
        Center. </p>
      <p>While the program would be helpful to any child, it is specifically
          targeted at children who are at risk for reading problems. Gray says
          by the time
          students finish kindergarten, they should know their alphabet and be
        able break a word into parts phonetically. </p>
      <p>"Most children will pick these
          things up normally," she says. "We are concerned about the children
        who may need more attention and direct teaching
          in these areas." <br>
        At the beginning of the program, the children's early literacy skills
        will be screened.</p>
      <p>The instructors will then customize the lesson plans
          for each child, providing an extra emphasis for children that may be
          deficient in a given area. Gray says the class sizes will be limited,
          while the number of teachers and speech pathologists will be high to
        allow one-on-one attention for the students.</p>
      <p>While the teachers are helping
          the students learn, they will have an opportunity to learn themselves.
          Gray says a second important part of
          the program will help train teachers and speech-language pathologists
          to screen early literacy skills and to help children "catch up." She
          says without trained professionals looking for potential learning problems,
          a child may be able to slip through without the skills that are necessary
        for future reading and writing success.</p>
      <p>"If you can't read in this society
          you will be at risk academically, socially and economically," she says.
          "Hopefully we can give the children
          a boost in their vocabulary and early literacy skills that will carry
        them into the future."</p>
      <p>Tuition for the program is $212 and the registration
          deadline is May 16. Gray says the Kiwanis Club and Tempe Impact Fund
          are providing scholarships
          for low-income children. For information on the summer program call
        (480) 730-7287.</p>
