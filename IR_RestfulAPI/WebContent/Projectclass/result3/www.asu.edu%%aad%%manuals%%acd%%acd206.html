<font size=+1><b>Degree Programs</b></font>

<p>
<a href="acd002.html#tenure" target="New">Tenure-track</a> faculty members cannot be degree <a href="acd002.html#student" target="New">students</a> at ASU.  However, with the approval of the faculty member&#146;s chair and dean, a tenured faculty member may apply for admittance to a graduate degree program to pursue another graduate degree at ASU.  The faculty member should present a program plan and rationale to the chair and dean, who will review the request considering:

<p>
<ol>
<li>the degree to which the program will enhance the faculty member&#146;s scholarly endeavors</li>

<p>
<li>potential conflicts of interest that could compromise the academic integrity of the institution</li>

<p>
<li>the faculty member&#146;s present teaching, research, and service responsibilities

<p>
and</li>

<p>
<li>the benefits to the <a href="acd002.html#department" target="New">department</a>, college, and university.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If an adjustment in work load is required, there will be a proportional adjustment in salary.  During regular semesters, full-time faculty members should not normally register for more than three semester hours (roughly equivalent to the time allowed for outside consulting), and under no circumstances should they register for more than six semester hours.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Nondegree Courses</b></font>

<p>
Faculty members are also permitted to enroll in graduate courses on a nondegree basis, as long as such activity does not interfere with their primary responsibilities.  They should comply with the same limits on semester hours as faculty enrolled in degree courses.
