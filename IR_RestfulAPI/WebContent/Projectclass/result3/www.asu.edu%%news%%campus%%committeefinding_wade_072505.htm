          <h2 align="left"><b>Committee Finds Wade Shooting Was Not Foreseeable; No Policies Violated; </b><b>But Procedural Changes Recommended And Are Being Implemented</b></h2>
          <p>The committee that investigated how ASU staff and faculty responded to issues involving former ASU football player Loren Wade found that no ASU faculty or staff member had reasonable cause to suspect that Loren Wade might be capable of shooting another person. Guns are prohibited on the ASU campus, and members of the football team are prohibited from owning guns. Wade had been questioned and had denied owning a gun.</p>
              <p>They found no evidence that any university or Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) policies or procedures had been violated but reported that some university and ABOR policies need to be clarified or strengthened to better advise faculty and staff about how to handle allegations of violent student behavior off-campus.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>The committee did find, however, that the former athletics director and the head football coach made errors in judgment with respect to the handling of allegations of improper conduct by Wade.&nbsp; &ldquo;We did not find that coaches and staff in the university's athletics department failed to try and help Loren Wade or other student athletes,&rdquo; said ASU Law Professor Myles Lynk, who chaired the committee. &ldquo;Rather, we found that they tried to do too much, taking it upon themselves to provide services that can be better provided by other university components.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Wade was arrested following the shooting death of Brandon Falkner, another former ASU football player, on March 26, 2005 outside a nightclub in Scottsdale.&nbsp; While Scottsdale Police investigated the homicide, ASU President Michael M. Crow impaneled a committee to investigate how the university had responded to prior issues and allegations concerning Wade.&nbsp; That committee included the Honorable Cecil Patterson, judge on the Arizona Court of Appeals (retired), and J. Steven Whisler, chairman and CEO, Phelps Dodge Corporation as well as ASU faculty, staff and student representation.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I wish to thank Professor Lynk and his committee for an excellent and very thorough report,&rdquo; said Crow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Although the report found that no university or Regent policies had been violated or ignored, it did point out the need for clearer policies and guidelines in certain areas, especially in how off-campus incidents involving ASU students should be handled and the need for greater communication between the university and the police departments neighboring our campuses.&nbsp; Both those issues are being addressed.&nbsp; I also moved months ago to make certain that ICA avails itself more completely of support services provided across the university.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Some aspects of the committee report that address personal information regarding students are protected by the federal Family Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and by federal law cannot be publicly disclosed.&nbsp; However, all recommended institutional changes can be disclosed. Among the issues found by the committee was that ASU's Office of Student Life, which is responsible for student disciplinary procedures, does not always receive information about student misconduct from other departments at ASU.&nbsp; In&nbsp;addition, police reports from local law enforcement agencies involving ASU students are not routinely shared with ASU. </p>
              <p>The committee also found that students are reluctant to report violations to university authorities of the Student and Student-Athlete Codes of Conduct regulations involving weapons possession, and that the university needs better data on the extent to which students and others possess handguns and experience the threat or use of violence on campus.</p>
              <p>The committee made a number of recommendations to President Crow, including: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>That the Arizona Board of Regents&rsquo; Student Code of Conduct be revised to cover off-campus conduct by students involving weapons, the sale or distribution of illegal drugs or controlled substances, or violence or potential violence;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Changes to ASU policies and procedures that will assist the university and others in identifying and addressing concerns involving violence or the threat of violence by a student;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Establishing a hotline to ASU&rsquo;s police department for anonymous reporting of threats or incidents involving violence, as well as use or possession of a handgun or other prohibited weapon;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>That ASU&rsquo;s chief of police investigate the possibility of receiving notification from municipal police departments when ASU students are being investigated or charged with criminal conduct, particularly conduct involving the threat or use of violence; and</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Establishing a central university database for reporting and tracking issues involving violence, and implementing mandatory reporting by faculty and staff of all acts or threats of violence and disruptive behavior.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Lastly, the committee recommended a series of steps be taken to better integrate Intercollegiate Athletics with the rest of university and provide guidance, training and assistance to coaches and staff in identifying and responding to student behavioral and emotional problems.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Many of the procedural improvements outlined in the Lynk committee report came to light after the Wade incident and have already been addressed,&rdquo; said Crow. &ldquo;And we will begin immediately to act upon the other recommendations of the Lynk committee.&nbsp; Even as we do, we, as a community, still feel the pain of this tragedy, and once again extend our sympathies to the families and friends of Brandon Falkner and Loren Wade.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Professor Myles Lynk is the Peter Kiewit Foundation Professor of Law and the Legal Profession at the Arizona State University and a faculty associate of ASU&rsquo;s Center for the Study of Law, Science and Technology. He is a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School. He has an extensive background in investigations, including service in 1983-1984 on the legal staff of the Special Counsel to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct of the U.S. House of Representatives, investigating allegations of improper conduct involving Congressmen, staff and teenagers serving as House pages.</p>
              <p>Other members of the Lynk Commission were Professor Norma Hubele, director of strategic initiatives, Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, ASU; Clare Rose Kirlin, 2005 graduate of the Barrett Honors College, ASU; Dr. James Rund, vice president, University Undergraduate Initiatives, ASU; Professor Thomas Schildgen, chair, Department of Information and Management Technology,&nbsp; ASU; and Anne (Dinky) Snell, citizen and member of the board of directors of the ASU Foundation. The committee was assisted by an outside law firm, Perkins Coie Brown &amp; Bain P.A. The outside counsel team was led by:&nbsp; Charles A. Blanchard, Esq.&nbsp; (Former Arizona State Senator and a former General Counsel&nbsp;of the United States Army&nbsp;), and included Paul F. Eckstein, Esq.; Joel W. Nomkin, Esq.; Michael T. Liburdi, Esq.; and M. Bridget McMullen, Esq.</p>
