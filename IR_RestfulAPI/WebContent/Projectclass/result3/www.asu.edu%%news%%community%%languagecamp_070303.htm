      <h2>Expression through technology: ASU camp helps special needs kids communicate</h2>
      <p>        The Speech and Hearing Drama Camp at ASU is combining fun and
        fantasy to teach special needs children one of the most important skills
        of all
        - communication.</p>
      <p>The camp, which is in the Speech &amp; Hearing Clinic
        of the ASU speech &amp; hearing
        sciences department, is hosting six children, ages 5 - 10, most of whom
        have cerebral palsy, a developmental disability that can hinder motor
        skills and limit speech.</p>
      <p>Children attending the camp have special augmentative
          communication devices and are gaining new skills to help them use the
          devices more effectively.
          The main goal of the five-week camp is to create a fun way for the
        children to practice using their communication devices, and what's more
        fun than
          putting on a play? The children learn their lines and rehearse the
        play, which will be performed for friends and family June 25.</p>
      <p>"There are all
          kinds of summer camps for kids, but it's not very likely that kids
        with communication disorders or cerebral palsy could participate,"
          says Pamela Mathy, director of clinical services for the speech and
        hearing clinic. "Our camp offers a fun and motivating experience that
        is more
          like playtime, than therapy time."</p>
      <p>The augmentative communication devices
          are computer-based and allow the children to construct messages and
        communicate using combinations of
          pre-programmed words and spelling. Once the message is created, the
        device will "speak" using either a digitally pre-recorded phrase or a
        synthesized
          voice. </p>
      <p>Depending on their physical ability, the children can use a touch
          screen display or use a method called "scanning" where the device presents
          a
          series of options and the child touches a micro switch to select a
        message. To become proficient, practice is essential.</p>
      <p>Kim Daswick, mother of 10-year-old
          Sidney, who has participated in the camp since it began three years
        ago, says special needs children generally
          go from school to therapy, and are constantly working. The camp provides
          activities similar to any basic summer camp with music, arts and crafts
          and drama, presented by ASU clinical faculty and student therapists
        in both music and speech. </p>
      <p>"It's therapy, but in a totally different format,"
          says Daswick, who brings Sidney to individual speech therapy at the
        clinic year-round.
          "They get the opportunity to learn so much, but in the format of what
          typical kids do. This way they get all the good stuff."</p>
      <p>For some of the
          campers, who are just beginning to learn to use the devices, it allows
          them to see other children communicating. </p>
      <p>"Just in the last
          few weeks he has made great strides," says mother Tammy Otto of her
        5-year-old son Aaron. "It is very motivational for him to
          see how everyone else communicates. He can see the benefits of using
          it."</p>
      <p>Another group benefiting from the camp is the team of five adult
        volunteers who are recovering from severe strokes. These individuals
        are in the
        process of regaining their language abilities and attend therapy sessions
        at ASU each week. The camp lets them help the children and work on their
        own communication skills in a fun setting.<br>
        Also lending a hand are the families of the campers. Sydney Daswick is
        a triplet, and her brother and sister, Tyler and Alexis, also have parts
        in the play "Eagle Boy," which was written by Nelson Suarez, a graduate
        teaching associate in languages &amp; literature, whose son has participated
        in past camps.</p>
      <p>Daswick says of all the benefits of the camp, one of the
          biggest may be the sense of pride in the campers.</p>
      <p>"The one thing we can't underestimate
          is for the parents to be able to see them on stage and doing something
          fun for themselves," says Daswick.
          "To see the kids in that role. parents of special needs children don't
        often get to see them like that. It's an amazing, fun experience."</p>
