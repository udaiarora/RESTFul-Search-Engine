        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Surface development is increasingly used in the field of air pollution to understand the variation of pollutants over space. Primary reason of creating surfaces for pollutants is lack of continuous data of pollutants over space. The objective of my paper is to determine spatial variation of
        CO2 over Phoenix Metropolitan Area. As concentration of CO2 over space is affected by several factors such as wind speed, wind direction, temperature, point of emission, altitude; the selection of appropriate interpolation techniques is the crucial part of the analysis. Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Ordinary Kriging (OK) are chosen over several other techniques, because of their suitability for the analysis. For this study, the data were collected by Department of Geography at Arizona State University. In order to verify the integrity of the CO2 data, data were closely observed before running the models. The data contains a total of 300 points with CO2 average concentration varying from 376 ppm to 499 ppm. The results show that there is a higher average concentration of CO2 in central part of the metropolitan area. The average concentration of CO2 reduces gradually as we move away from the central zone. One of the reasons for higher average concentration of CO2 in central zone could be heavy vehicular traffic. Also population density is higher in the central zone, leading to higher human activities, and thus higher pollution levels. The study shows that both the models (RBF and OK) performed well; but ordinary kriging outperformed RBF Model. This paper would be a very helpful resource for governmental agencies to understand the spatial variation of average concentration of CO2 over Phoenix Metropolitan Area in order to implement measures to prevent excessive pollution for public welfare.</font></p>
