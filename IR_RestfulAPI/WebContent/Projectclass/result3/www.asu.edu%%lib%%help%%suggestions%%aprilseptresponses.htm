  Topic: Electronic Journal Access </b></p>
					    <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Suggestion/Comment</h3>
				      <p>I was browsing the library catalog for &quot;America's best graduate schools / U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and found the title was available online and in hard copy at law treatises reserve collection. I wanted to access the title through online and when i clicked on the link it give me the following error.&quot;Lost Your Way?&quot;. I referred this to the staff peersonnel at the hayden Lower level during the summer session and till now it havent been rectified. I would like to browse the online content as it will be easy for filtering and i wanted it so desperately as i am planning to apply for some schools for my doctoral program.</p>
				      <p>Can you please let me know whether the online version is still subscribed by the librray or we have subscribed only for the hard copy. if the library is subscribed to hardcopy only is it possible to have a copy of it in the hayden or noble reserve collection also.why there is a online link in the catalog?.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>Thanks for checking back in on this. We have been trying to track down information on this. It looks like the &quot;America's Best Graduate Schools&quot; issue isn't part of our print subscription. According to the Law Library, they buy each issue on their own and put it on reserve (which is reflected in the online catalog). The online catalog information also links to the US News ranking web site, which only includes partial information. We will forward this to our electronic journals department to see if we can somehow subscribe to this resource. <br>

				      <p>We think this is a great idea. It is, unfortunately, a logistical challenge. The <a href="http://www.phoenixpubliclibrary.org/">Phoenix Public Library</a> does that, as do many other library systems. However, all their branch libraries have the same exact hours. At ASU, our web site serves as a gateway to eight total libraries, each with its own set of hours. If we put them all on the front page, there wouldn't be room for anything else. We are always, however, working on  improving the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/hours/">hours information</a> that is linked from the front library page. </p></td>

				      <p>Dear Librarian at Polytechnic campus,</p>
				      <p>Thanks for the video &quot;Getting Started doing library research (3 mins.)&quot; </p>
				      <p>It is great basic information, the audio is very clear. The video is hard to see for the details as small screen appears on windows media player. If I increase the screen for 200%, the video appears blur.</p>
				      <p>This is a great improvement! I think the upload for video might be recheck. <br>

				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>We are so glad peopel are finding this video! After receiving your suggestion, we did go and re-record this video to address the quality issues you identified. You should find the <a href="mms://msmedia.asu.edu/Asup_Library_Services/dcarlock/final_getting_started_research.wmv">new and improved video</a> available online featured on the <a href="http://eastlib.east.asu.edu/">Polytechnic Library's web page</a>. </p></td>

				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Suggestion/Comment</h3>
				      <p>Thanks for giving a wonderful oppurtuniy to explore the wealth of resources available at the libraries.<br>
				        I have the following suggestions to make. This is regarding ensuring the fair availability of recommended class texts for all the students.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <blockquote>
				        <p>1.Prior to the start of a semester, obtain the recommendation on books from the faculty on the course that they will be offering.<br>
				          2. Ensure that atleast two copies of all these books are available in the library (if not please buy them).<br>
				          3. One can be allowed to be borrowed by a student while other needs to be marked as the &quot;reference &quot; which must be used by the patrons only in the library and cannot be borrweod.</p>
				        <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      </blockquote>				      <p>This will ensure that the patrons will not suffer in their courses just for the reason that they couldnot afford to buy the class text.
				        I hope you have understood my idea and will try to implement it.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>We absolutely empathize with the students' stress relating to the ever rising costs of textbooks. Unfortunately, if the library spent our materials budget buying textbooks for each class each semester, we would not have funds to add other items to our collection that would have more lasting value. We can, however, place professor's personal copies on <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/access/reserves/">course reserve</a> for individual classes, so please ask your instructor if they have a personal copy they can spare. </p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <p>We are aware that the Associated Students of ASU are championing this cause this year, so please be sure to become active with them as they try to find a better solution for textbooks. <br>

				      <h3>Suggestion/Comment</h3>
				      <p> I have noticed that many of the questions on this suggestion box are really mean spirited in nature. I also think that it is unfair to post &quot;suggestions&quot; that aren't really suggestions but just complaints against certain departments. I am refering specifically to the complaint made about the staff in the lower level. There was really no suggestion there, was there, just a gripe about the people down there being rude. That's unfair to those people down there to post allegations like that. SO now anyone with a chip on their shoulder can just write a nasty &quot;suggestion&quot; and then have the satisfaction of seeing it posted on the library website. </p>

				      <p>Many students require a typewriter for filling out official applications and other school neccesities. Please make sure that we have easy access to typewriters, they have a minimal cost and would be greatly used.<br>
				      </p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>It is true that the Libraries no longer have public typewriters available. Due to their aging technology, it simply was no longer cost effective for us to maintain them, especially considering their extremely low use. The sad reality is that they were not minimally expensive because they were so old. We do know that it can be frustrating occasionally, because there still are times when official forms and applications require typing. We have found out that the Tempe Public Library, located at Southern and Rural, does have typewriters available to the public.</p>

				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>There's no reason to be worried! Just like the old &quot;telephone game&quot; the grapevine has gotten this slightly wrong. The library is absolutely, positvely not cancelling the Academic Search Premier/Ebscohost resource that so many students (and librarians) rely on. What is being cancelled is another product by the company, Ebsco EJS, which is a service we have used to manage our electronic subscriptions. That management is being replaced by other services, and you should actually see no real changes in your access to electronic information resources. </p></td>

				      <p>In the old format I could easily find research databases by subject... now I can only find them if I know what they are named. I would like to find them by subject considering that what is available to us changes all the time. For example, Reference USA is not available anymore, and since I do not know what other databases that contain similar information are named, I am left barehanded...</p>

				      <p> We understand how frustrating it can be when web sites you are familar with rearrange items. We do have good news, however. The finding research databases by subject option is still available on the &quot;Find Articles&quot; web site, but it is in a slightly different area than our old web site. Look for it underneath the &quot;Find By Name&quot; portion of the page.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <p>We have information that Reference USA is provided by 


 Chandler, Mesa, Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Tempe&nbsp;public libraries  for their customers with library cards.&nbsp; If any of these libraries is your local public library, you will be able to access Referenece USA through them. <br>

				      <h3>Suggestion/Comment</h3>
				      <p>I am in my first semester and first week at ASU. My experiences have been positive, with the exception of using the computer terminals at the Hayden Library. All the terminals and work areas are covered in dust and dirt. This not only poses a potential health threat to me (I am an allergy sufferer), but it also serves as an &quot;eye sore&quot; for a top notch university to allow it's students to be subjected to work areas that are unsanitary, unprofessional and unacceptable for a learning environment. </p>
				      <p>The short term solution to this problem is that I dust and clean the workstation of my choice prior to use; but the long term solution is that routine cleaning maintenance be performed on the computer terminals by either the contracted maintenance assigned to the library, or by work study students.<br>
				        </p>				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>Welcome to ASU. We're so pleased to hear that you have generally had a positive experience here, and the Libraries truly want to contribute to your success and happiness here at ASU. Thank you for pointing out the state of the computer work areas. We do have the computer workstations cleaned on a schedule throughout the semester, but the areas surrounding the computers should be cleaned by our custodial crew on a regular basis. We've talked with them, and expect that situation to improve. If it does not, please let us know.</p>

					    <p>The policy of not allowing people to stay in the study rooms overnight is terrible. I am a student, I pay full tuition, why can't I use those rooms at night?? The guy at the desk says &quot;Oh, it's policy...&quot; that's not fair. Please change this policy as soon as possible.</p>
					    <p>&nbsp;</p>
					    <h3>Library Response</h3>
					    <p>We are so glad to know that students continue to value the individual study rooms.
Unfortunately, we must at this time continue our policy to close the individual rooms at midnight. That policy exists purely for security and safety reasons. We feel that it would be difficult for our overnight staff to ensure the security of the areas. Our security staff has a major task to monitor the various nooks and crannies that are found throughout Hayden Library. We are strongly committed to providing the ASU community a safe place to work overnight. </p>
					    <p>&nbsp;</p>
					    <p>It's understandable that you may find it inconvenient to have to relocate if you are studying in an individual room prior to midnight, or would like to have a secure place to leave your belongings if you need a break in the middle of the night.
                          But we are confident that there are other areas for quiet study in the rest of Hayden Library. If you would like some assistance identifying an alternative work space, please let us know. <br>

				      <h3>Suggestion/Comment</h3>
				      <p> In kind and gentle tones: Today I am leaving the library because the level of talking is bothering my ability to study effectively. Having been a student at this university for the last three years, and during this past summer session as well, this library has become my favorite place to study. As we are creatures of habit, I, too, have come to enjoy my favorite haunts in this library in which to do my best studying.</p>
				      <p>During the summer, a lot of books were moved from different floors to the first floor to expedite needed maintenace on the library. Those books are now in the process of being moved back to their original floors, I assume. Two people, a young man and a young woman, are moving those books, on this day, 24 Aug 06 at the hour of noon to 2:00 p.m. The young man is talking incessantly, which, of course, carries up to the second floor, where I am studying. I think the young woman feels cornered by this person and is not doing any talking, it seems. </p>
				      <p>It is not my desire to only point out staff, but it is also my observation that students have some expectancy that they can form group studies AND talk loudly. I paid for the priviledge to use the library at a university for the express purpose of doing research and difficult studying/thinking and it is hard to do so with such talking that reverberates through the first and second floors. The main entrance floor is absolutely not acceptable for studying due to the high level of human bodies present and talking.</p>
				      <p>A simple kind reminder posted to keep voices down may do the trick. A helpless student can then at least point to it to the offending party as a first line of defense. It is sad to not be able to have any personnel available to expressly deal with offenders immediately, and that the student is left to fend for themselves with such classic library rudeness.</p>
				      <p>It is not my desire to be hurtful to others,to upset others, or to prevent others from using these resources. But there is a time-honored expectancy that a library is supposed to be a place where one can obtain the quiet atmosphere needed to think. Perhaps that is my problem. I am still linked to a past library definition of what is 'supposed to be' and I am the one with the unrealistic expectation of seeking quietude, and that quiet libraries no longer exist anymore. </p>
				      <p>Thank you for the time you have graciously given to read my thoughts and feelings. Sincerely...a devoted library patron and 48-year old female senior student from the School of Life Sciences. I am heading to the Noble Library. Maybe there is quiet there. I have a difficult test Monday on Immune systems.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>We are very sorry that we are starting out the semester on such a difficult note together. It is true that some of our more reliably quiet areas have been temporarily disrupted. On Level 1 we are finishing  moving books back in place after a summer construction project, and expect to have that completed very soon. We will remind our workers that now that classes are back in session we need to be mindful to use our &quot;library voices&quot; when working in public areas. We sincerely expect that when project is completed, and the study tables are back in place, that Level 1 and Level 2 will return to the quiet and peaceful study areas we intend for them to be. </p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>
				      <p>You may not be aware of these options, but both the Hayden and Noble Libraries do offer both open Quiet Study Rooms, where staff do maintain the traditional hushed library environments, and individual study rooms where you can work in a small area by yourself and shut out the rest of the world. The individual study rooms are available until midnight, and many students have let us know they appreciate having them available. For more information, please see the Circulation/Check Out desks near the library entrance.</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>				      <p>Finally, we'd like to wish you well on your exam next Tuesday. <br>

			          <p>Thanks for providing us feedback on the Find Journals section of the library web site. When you browse for a journal title, the listings are configured to show 100 files per page.  The pages are configured so people don't have to scroll too long on any one page, which has been our customers' preference overall in the past. I will forward your suggestion on to our electronic resources management team. There may be a good middle ground between configuring this resource to show only 100 entries, and having it show all 3265 entries. Even the best scrollers might get tired sorting through all of those in one page. </p>
			          <p>&nbsp;</p>
			          <p>In the meantime, it may be more expedient  to use the Search box on the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/find/journals/">Find Journals</a> page  if you know exactly which journal you are looking for. For example, you would enter : &quot;Journal of Infectious Disease&quot; in the search box on this page and be taken directly to the entries for that title. For even more expedient searching, you can enter in as little of the title as possible to get you good results: &quot;Journal of Infec&quot; will take you to three listings: Journal of infection, Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy, and Journal of infectious diseases.<br>

					    <p> I used to be able to view online the books I had checked out. I am a community borrower and let my privileges lapse for 10 months. Now that I am borrowing from the ASU library again, I find that can't renew my books online nor can I even see online when they are due (that means when I call the phone number to have them renewed, I can't double check to see that the transaction went through). Since I am a community borrower, I can't use my ASU ID to look up the information. </p>
				        <p>If I had never been able to see the information over the Internet nor renew online, I would probably never know to ask for that privilege. But I do know because the library's system used to allow it. Can't we just go back to the way things were for community borrowers? The library has made things increasingly more difficult for community borrowers by increasing the price for two consecutive years (not that I am complaining--I moved here from New York and back in 1992 NYU charged $400 a year for their community borrowing card), I assume to discourage the community from using the service. But I am a professor at another university in the valley and having access to a research library is crucial to my writing. </p>
				        <p><br>

				        <h3>Library Response</h3>
			            <p>We understand that it is frustrating to our community borrowers to not be able to manage you accounts online. It is a very useful  feature of our library system, and we regret that we are not currently able to offer this to our community borrowers. </p>
			            <p>&nbsp;</p>
			            <p>We recently changed from the old &quot;PIN&quot; system of accessing library accounts to using the university ASURITE authentication system. Every enrolled student and employee uses this authentication system every day for all of their online activities, so it was vitally important that the library became consistent with the rest of the campus. By changing to ASURITE, our primary customer base (the over 60,000 students, faculty and staff) now no longer have to remember a different ID and password. Unfortunately we've hit some challenges in trying to manage it so our community borrowers who don't have ASURITE IDs and passwords can also access their accounts online. It is something we are aware of and are trying to resolve, but at this time there is no resolution visible in the immediate future.</p>
			            <p>&nbsp;</p>
			            <p>While we know this isn't a perfect solution, we are able to offer 24/5 (Sunday mornings - Friday midnight; 9am-midnight Saturday) assistance during the school year. If you call 480-965-3605 instead of the automated phone system, you will be connected to a staff member who can help you review your account, and should also be able to email you the details of the materials you have checked out. </p>
			            <p>&nbsp;</p>
			            <p>We truly appreciate your position, and hope that we are able to offer a better solution for you in the future. Keep checking our web site (www.asu.edu/lib) under &quot;News&quot; for updates. <br>

				      <p>We are so pleased that you are enjoying the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/podcasts/">Library Channel</a> programming. Our Digital Production Manager tells us that there are some storage issues with redundant file types, so they had decided to select one format to produce each program. Many are indeed MP3s, but some need to be MP4 to be fully functional. So far these are presentations that also included Powerpoint files. One option for you is to download <a href="At%20a%20minimum%20if%20listeners%20download%20iTunes%20they%20can%20listen%20and%20watch%20all%20of%20our%20content%20and%20even%20burn%20the%20MP4%20to%20CD%20or%20convert%20them%20to%20another%20format%20if%20they%20wish.%20%20We%20want%20to%20avoid%20redundancy%20and%20yet%20provide%20the%20most%20functionality">iTunes</a> they can listen and watch all of our Library Channel programs, and then burn the MP4 to CD or convert them to another format if they wish.  We want to avoid redundancy and yet provide the most functionality.</p>

				      <p> I wrote the complaint about the computers being taken up by people playing games for hours. You state there is a computer use policy against that. Could you publicly display a sign or something by these computers clearly stating that you are not allowed to play online games on the public terminals? That would go a long way to making the policy clear. </p>

				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>Thank you for your follow up feedback. We have been working on a solution to make our computer workstation policies more clear to the users. Soon there will be a notification on the desktop of each computer stating what the restrictions are, with a link to the full text of the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/policies/workstation.htm">computer use policy</a>. We believe this will help make it clearer to our customers what the guidelines are for the computers. In addition we will soon be converting several of the public computers to &quot;Express Computers&quot; which will time people out after 15 minutes. Thank you again for your feedback.</p></td>

					    <p>We recognize that obtaining copyright permission can be  a complicated and frustrating process. Unfortunately, the library is not currently staffed at a level that we can obtain copyright permissions for the number of faculty/instructors we have at ASU. We are aware that this service is one that would be appreciated, and are always looking for ways we can assist in this process.</p>
					    <p>We have noted that 


 generally when a faculty member writes for permission, it is granted and there is no charge. We do have examples of copyright request letters that you can use as a template at the libraries, and one is also <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/access/crperm.html"><b>available online</b></a> . Please also note that 


 we do not require copyright permission the first time someone uses material for class reserve, as this is covered by Fair Use.&nbsp;  Written permission applies only  if you want to use an article for additional semesters. </p>

Also, many of the full shelves have books laying horizontally on top of other books! And there is a massive &quot;overflow area&quot; on the journals floor because there's no room to put the journals and an &quot;overflow cart&quot; on the books level. Plus, I heard that the storage building for the library is full! Are there library employees whose job is to periodically examine all the books and discard those that are old and/or never or rarely checked out? Such a process seems to be needed in the Noble Library, and doing so would really help people find books by making the shelves less packed and getting rid of the various &quot;overflow areas.&quot; </p>

				      <p>I have read numerous times about &quot;signage&quot; being posted to alert patrons of quiet areas. However, this is quite ineffective. Is it possible that when patrons are too loud, a library staff member can verbally TELL them to be quiet? I've seen groups playing Monopoly on the 3rd floor and there's a desk with someone there, but they never said anything to the students. When I go to a public library and someone is too loud, I see a staff member ask them to be quiet. Is it unreasonable to ask that patrons are TOLD to be quiet, rather than excpected to read signs?</p>
				      <p>&nbsp;</p>				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>We are very sorry that you have not had positive experiences studying/working in the libraries. We struggle with keeping a balance in our environment, between customers who need to use the library as a gathering space, and others who need to have a more traditional quiet, contemplative study space. We also really try to toe the line between maintaining order without becoming the sterotypical &quot;shhhhhhhh-ing&quot; librarians. In areas that we have designated quiet, our staff may approach groups who are speaking loudly or disruptively without first receiving a complaint from others. In other areas we don't usually approach customers and ask them to be quiet, unless we know they are disturbing others around them. Please in the future, let library staff know if you are disturbed. We will be more than happy to advocate for you. </p>
				      <p>That being said, there will always be areas of the library that will be louder than others. In addition to the entrance levels, the 3rd Floor of Hayden has a major service desk has a major service desk (Government Documents) and there is a lot of traffic and conversation in that area. <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/level1/">Level 1</a> (during the school year) and <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/level2/">Level 2</a> tend to be quieter without any staff intervention, as does the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/lowlevel/">Lower Level</a>. <br>

We do have plans to replace the house phone in that area. We do not, however, plan on replacing the pay phones. Thanks again for taking the time to submit your question. </p></td>

				      <p> I wish there were some weekend hours at the Polytechnic library during the summer session. I'm a nursing student in a year-round program. We don't have an abbreviate program for the summer. Our program meets on campus on Mon and Tues, then we have clinicals at off-campus sites on WThF. This leaves the weekend for any research I might need to do. It doesn't help to have the library closed. </p>

				      <h3>Library Response</h3>
				      <p>We also wish we could offer weekend hours at the Polytechnic library during the summers. The truth is that we currently don't have the budget to support it, although that may change in the future. In the meantime, we have some options for you: all of our electronic resources are available 24/7, as is the Ask a Librarian online help service. For specific assistance I would recommend you contact Danielle Carlock (<a href="mailto:danielle.carlock@asu.edu">danielle.carlock@asu.edu</a>; (480) 727-1278), the nursing librarian at Polytechnic. She has been working extensively with the nursing students at the Polytechnic campus, and has worked on incorporating library resources into several nursing Blackboard sites. You may be able to work out individual assistance with her via email, phone or even in person during weekends. <br>

				      <p>Thank you for taking the time to submit this feedback. The library for years did not offer the service to hold a book at the circulation desk, and required our customers to retrieve books themselves.

We have responded to these requests by piloting such a service, which your colleague utilized. We are evaluating this service, and will take your feedback into consideration as we decide how to proceed. </p></td>

				      <p> I recently requested a search for a book I need right away when I could not find it on the shelf (likely due to moving of books on the first floor). The circulation request card was promptly returned to me via campus mail with the box indicating that the book is missing was checked. Instructions state the card should be presented at Interlibrary Loan for prompt service. Upon doing so, I was informed by Interlibrary Loan staff that I had to submit the request electronically. Because I was unable to get to IL the day I received the card, and was heading off campus after stopping at IL the next day, I experienced unnecessary delay in my attempt to obtain the book because I followed the instructions on the card. Please cross that line off before you use these cards in the future. If you have a huge stack of these outdated cards to use, perhaps you could just have a stamp made that indicates IL requests should be submitted electronically. It will save others a lot of time and hassle. Thank you. <br>

				        <p>Why is Arizona State University so oblivious to the needs of disabled people? I am a disabled Ph. D. student and T. A. in the English department, and this time of year is so difficult for me because I have to find a way to get all of my books (which usually ranges from 40-60) back to the library. There is no handicapped parking near the library, and the only book drop on campus is right by the library at the top of the stairs. Hayden library employees told me that there is another drive-up book drop at the law library, but when I asked there, they said that does not exist.</p>
				        <p>&nbsp;</p>
				        <p>Last night I had to take about fifty books back to the library, and I had to recruit a friend to help me. However, I injured myself carrying all of those books for such a long distance. Why is this acceptable to ASU?</p>
				        <p>&nbsp;</p>
				        <p>My suggestion is that the library put a drop box, or a drive up drop box near the Disabled Student Services building and the LL building, which are very close to each other. The best location would be a drive up drop box in the disabled parking lot between the Anthropology building and the Lycium theater building. This way, English majors who always have a massive amount of books checked out, and disabled people who use the resources at the Disabled Student Services building and cannot park near Hayden library, would be able to return books without making multiple trips or injuring themselves in the process.</p>

				      <p>We hate to be vague, but  the answer is &quot;it depends on the library&quot;. In the Noble Library, there is now no general food restrictions. However, for food that is thought to be on the &quot;smelly&quot; side, we may ask you  we may ask you to relocate to a different area (generally the lounge area adjacent to the circulation desk), or to eat outside. In the Hayden Library food is welcome in the main levels (lower and upper concourse), although again, if the food is too smelly and disturbs other people, we may ask you to relocate to the &quot;Brown Bag&quot; study room, or by the cafe. We will try to ensure all of the library staff are aware of what the policy is so that things are more consistent. </p></td>

				      <h3>Library Response:</h3>
				      <p>You are very smart to be careful with your ASURITE login information! Too often students wander away from computers that are left logged in, and who knows what mischief the next person could make with your information! </p>
				      <p>Here's the deal about the overnight identification:  If you forget your SunCard, then the next thing we do is compare a different photo ID (like a driver's license) with the library account, to ensure that you really are an ASU student. If you aren't near the entrance (where we can use our library system at the Circulation desk) we may ask you to log into  Emma with your ASURITE ID and password so we can verify the photo associated with your account with you. That's because there isn't another way for us to verify your student status with your ID number. This is done so we don't have to make you go home to get an ID. And we promise that we would never let the next person use your account to access anything. But just to be sure I would encourage you to witness you are logged out of the system, just to be safe. </p>				      <p>Again, we really do this as an extra measure of customer service so we aren't asking students to go home to get their ID if they forget it. </p></td>

				      <p>It would be helpful to many students if there could be signs or even a librarian to ask people to quiet down, on the main floor of Hayden, back where the study cubicles are. This past semester it seems that it's gotten much louder, and people think that since there's a &quot;quiet room&quot;, it's ok to be as loud as you want everywhere else.</p>
				      <p>I don't mind at all if people take a quick call quietly or groups meeting and talking among themselves, but this isn't a club or a bar even though it's starting to seem like it.</p>
				      <p>Currently that's where I'm sitting in the library, and there are 3 people around me talking loudly on cell phones about their sex lives and making multiple new phone calls on speaker phone and playing some gard game and being loud, and some more folks who haven't bothered to use headphones when listening to music on their computers. It's tooo noisy! I don't need silence by any means, but this is absurd. And this is college, when students are old enough to know to use their &quot;inside voices&quot;. It's still a library and one should still expect a modicum of library etiquette</p>
				      <h3>Library Response:</h3>
				      <p>We have also noticed that it gets very noisy in the main levels of the library, especially leading up to finals. We're not sure how or why that happens, but honestly we have struggled with the most effective way to respond. Signage in the areas have not been effective, nor has it been effective for our staff to patrol the areas. </p>
				      <p>We have for now, identified quieter areas of the library that may be more conducive to studying, without it being completely silent. There is an open area on <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/level1/">Level 1</a>, between the main stairwells, that tends to be quiet and has lots of tables and individual seating. Immediately above this area on <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/level2/">Level 2</a> is another optimal study location. Another location that is even quieter is on the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/about/maps/hayden/lowlevel/">Lower Level</a> (where the journals are) in the back corner by the video collection.</p>

				      <p>We have also noticed that the temperature in all the libraries varies widely. The reason for this is that the campus sets a single temperature for the building.
