<H2>Program of Study</H2>

<H3>Credit & Course Requirements</H3><p>

The SEM program is multidisciplinary and is structured around a comprehensive set of courses contained

in the participating disciplines. The goal of the core curriculum is to provide an interdisciplinary education to students in the field of materials science and engineering.

A balance is sought between engineering and science objectives.<p>

<H3> M.S. Degree in Materials Science</H3><p>

The Master of Science degree in Materials Science consists of a minimum 33 credits beyond the Bachelors degree

(Table 1), of which 6 credits are Research and Thesis.There is a minimum of 24 classroom credit hours, which are split evenly between four core and four elective courses(Table 2).

Students must also take 3 credits of Seminar as part of their program of study. Students who enter the MS program typically come from Engineering or Science backgrounds. The minimum

GPA requirement to enter the MS program is 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. Exceptions can be made if evidence is shown that the student is an excellent candidate for

graduate study. The SEM Program curriculum has a strong science component because of its interdisciplinary nature. Both the M.S. and Ph.D. curriculum are more

rigorous than the Materials Engineering program in the Chemical and Materials Engineering Department. The strength of the curriculum makes graduates highly marketable.<p>

<hr>

<b><a NAME="phd"></a>Ph.D. Degree in Science and Engineering of Materials</b><p>

The Ph.D degree in Science and Engineering of Materials consists of a minimum of 84 semester hours beyond the Bachelor's degree, atleast 24 of which is research and dissertation credits(Table 4).A minimum of 30 classroom credit hours(core and technical electives),exclusive of research and dissertation mustbe completed at ASU upon entrance to the Ph.D. Program.

This translates to approximately 10 graduate level courses. Most students take approximately 10 to 12 classroom courses with the balance of credits dedicated to research and dissertation. The required core(Table 5) consists of the seven courses(21 credit hours) with options for courses 4,5 and 6. Students must also take 3 credits of Graduate Student Seminar as part of their 

program of study. Following completion of the core, students cantake technical elective courses from the "SEM General Course List". Students entering the 

program may have already taken some courses equivalent to the core courses as part of their undergraduate or master's degrees. Students can petition to waive such requirement duplications by demonstrating that they have attended a similar course elsewhere and achieved satisfactory performnce(B or above). The 

Co-directors must approve waivers or substitutions of core courses. Courses from the SEM General CourseList or courses recommended by the advisor

and/or the Co-directors can replace waived core courses.<P>

<H3>Program of Study</H3><p>

The Program of Study form outlines the specific course the student has taken and will take to complete the required 84 credits for the 

Ph.D. degree. The student also selects a faculty supervisory commitee of 3 to 5 faculty members.

The chair of the commitee is the primary faculty advisor. A Doctoral Program of Study must have been completed and approved by the Graduate College before the students can take any examinations.

<P>



<H3><a NAME="exams"></a>The Comprehensive Exams</H3><p>

Doctoral students do not hae to take a qualifying or entering exam. However, they are required to take comprehensive examinations at the time they complete their coursework and ready to conduct research and dissertation only.

The SEM comprehensive examination has two components--the written examination and the oral presentation. These

written and oral exams are designed to test the student's mastery in the core subjects and in the student's research area.

The written component is the test that examines the student's knowledge in core courses. The oral presentation consists of 

the selection of a research problem of current relevance to materials science field and the student makes an oral presentationto his/her faculty supervisory committee. The subject

may be from any area of materials research except that it may not be part of the dissertation proposal. NO actual research 

is expected to be done by the student. The topic chosen should be based on studies of literature, discussions with researchers in the field, and consultation with faculty commitee

members. The subject may deal with experimental or theoretical research, or a combination of the two.<P>



<H3>Candidacy</H3><p>

Upon successful completion of the comprehensive examinations, the Graduate College will advance

the student to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree.

<P>



<H3>The Dissertation Final Examination</H3><p>

The Ph.D. dissertation should demonstrate the candidate's ability to address a major intellectual materials problem and to propose

meaningful questions and hypothesis. The dissertation should be a contribution to knowledge that is worthy of publication by an established press as a book or one or more articles

in a reputable journal. The final oral exam in defense of the dissertation is mandatory and is scheduled by the faculty supervisory committee with the approval

of the Graduate College. Bound copies of both thesis and dissertations are placed in the ASU Library and Archives.
