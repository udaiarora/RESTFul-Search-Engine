        Seed<br>
        An 11-foot-high luminous red pomegranate pushes against the ceiling of 
        the Harry Wood Gallery, driven by the energy of the seed within, in this 
        exhibition by MFA candidate in intermedia, Andrea Hull.</p>
      <p>Feb. 3-5, 2003<br>
        Ganyomilin<br>
        In her MFA thesis show, Yuriko Nishimura explores eroticism from unique 
        perspectives. The exhibition features stone carvings and bronze sculptures 
        that are both ambiguous and explicit in nature. The marble Nishimura carves 
        is from Arizona, mined in the Haquahala mountains approximately 100 miles 
        west of Phoenix.</p>
      <p>Feb. 10- 21, 2003<br>
        Hind Sight<br>
        Hind Sight is a retrospective exhibition of photographs, mixed media installation 
        and video work by Tamarra Kaida, retiring photography professor in the 
        Herberger College School of Art.</p>
      <p>Feb. 24-28, 2003<br>
        An exhibition by Jane Elizabeth Almirall<br>
        Free opening reception: 7-9 p.m., Feb. 24<br>
        Jane Elizabeth Almirall, MFA candidate in painting and drawing, presents 
        her thesis exhibition. Almirall says her work stems largely from my inability 
        to settle down in a particular place. She uses imagery of birds, eggs 
        and nests to reference her own migratory tendencies as well as her desire 
        to seek out a place that is secure. Almirall says she paints landscapes 
        from memory and photos that she has taken on her cross-country expeditions. 
        She also employs decorative patterns in her paintings to create a foundation 
        that can be built up and layered upon. "I also enjoy the dual meaning 
        of the word pattern - as in routine, repetition and habit - and how it 
        pertains to my interest in seeking stability without becoming stagnant," 
        Almirall says.</p>
      <p>March 3-7, 2003<br>
        Construction of Intimate<br>
        Jennifer Kiraly presents her MFA thesis exhibition in painting. Kiraly 
        works from a composite of imagery to create and maintain interesting and 
        thought-provoking dialogue and discovery. She says she has adapted her 
        sensibilities to recognize the feminine as it pertains to her daily life, 
        letting it become her guide to judge images and interpret her own. Modes 
        of inspiration include fabric, music, memory and pattern. She describes 
        her works as reflections of fantasy, with themes of attraction and femininity, 
        but not perfection.</p>
      <p>March 10-14, 2003<br>
        Meat<br>
        Don Kauss presents his MFA thesis exhibition, comprised of sculptural 
        work made mostly from found object assemblage. The exhibition explores 
        the energy of living things and the chaos of the world.</p>
      <p>March 17-28, 2003<br>
        Nathan Cummings Travel Fellowship Award Exhibition<br>
        The idea that travel is integral to artistic development is at the heart 
        of this annual exhibition and competition. Graduate students from ASU's 
        Herberger College School of Art may enter a single work in this annual 
        event, which is judged by faculty members. The grand prize is a significant 
        cash award to be used by the student artist for summer travel. The exhibition 
        and competition is based on the long-established educational and artistic 
        tradition of "The Grand Tour." The fellowship is awarded to the student 
        whose work and written statement best exemplify the intent of "The Grand 
        Tour."</p>
      <p>March 31 - April 4, 2003<br>
        An exhibition by Eric Burris<br>
        Eric Burris, an MFA candidate in jewelry/metals, presents his thesis exhibition.</p>
      <p>April 7-11, 2003<br>
        Miniature Camera Obscuras<br>
        Nissa Kubly, an MFA candidate in jewelry/metals, presents her thesis exhibition. 
        Kubly's work consists of small-scale, fully functional pinhole cameras. 
        Historically, the pinhole camera or camera obscura has been used by scientists 
        as a tool to explore the mechanics of such things as optics, movement 
        and measurement, and by artists to explore a two dimensional depiction 
        of the three dimensional world. Kubly's creative work attempts to incorporate 
        aspects of both the scientific and artistic historical use of the pinhole 
        camera. </p>
      <p>April 14-18, 2003<br>
        ephemera<br>
        Using architectural structures as symbols of permanence, Andrew Behrle 
        creates situations in which water erodes these symbols to illustrate the 
        temporality of physicality in all forms. While dealing with physical impermanence 
        through the cycles of nature, Behrle explores ideas of spiritual permanence.</p>
      <p>April 21-25, 2003<br>
        The Scattered Furniture of Nature and History <br>
        Mathew Coon, an MFA candidate in sculpture, presents his thesis exhibition, 
        which he says will tell a story in the form of vignettes and installations. 
        These vignettes will take the form of Victorian architecture and furniture, 
        incorporated with modern gadgetry. "The story is of our evolution with 
        information technologies and the difference between knowledge and wisdom," 
        Coon says.</p>
      <p>April 28 - May 2, 2003<br>
        Beauty, Terror and Time<br>
        Michael Lundgren, photography major, presents his thesis exhibition: a 
        group of photographs dealing with a direct experience of land. Lundgren 
        describes the works as "An attempt to photograph the meeting of my own 
        awareness with a larger entity, the desert. In this, they are an exploration 
        into the sublime and a search for the relationship between photography, 
        time and consciousness."</p>
      <p>May 5 - Sept. 5, 2003<br>
        Annual MFA Summer Exhibition<br>

        At Home in America<br>
        This body of work by photography student Lindsey Palmer consists of approximately 
        twenty 11 x 14 black-and-white, silver gelatin prints. At Home in America 
        documents Palmer's inquiry into what an "American family" is today. Palmer 
        photographed a large range of people, (groups, couples and individuals) 
        who cohabitate and consider themselves to be a "family." Each portrait 
        is taken in the family's home. She describes the portraits as formal in 
        nature, yet taken in a relaxed environment.</p>
      <p>February 3-7, 2003 <br>
        Awkward Symmetry<br>
        Alexander Duffy presents an exhibition in various painting media, including 
        acrylic, spray and pigment powder, that reveals abstraction through the 
        use of almost, but not quite, symmetrical designs.</p>
      <p>February 10-14, 2003 <br>
        Copy Right<br>
        The task of this undergraduate painting class was to faithfully duplicate 
        the work of old and modern masters, with the added twist of incorporating 
        the student's self portraits into their reproductions. Through direct 
        experience with the paint, each student had to reckon with the tools and 
        techniques of their chosen masters far more deeply than would be possible 
        by simple observation of the masterworks. The students chose pieces that 
        allowed them to explore techniques and subject matter that amplified, 
        challenged, or violently opposed those in their own personal work. The 
        class found this exercise so beneficial that they decided to extend the 
        concept - to create a completely personal painting using the techniques 
        of the chosen master. This exhibition consists of each student's master 
        reproduction; photographs of the original masterpiece, the personal painting 
        done using the master's techniques and an artist statement. </p>
      <p>February 17-21, 2003 <br>
        An exhibition by Nathan Redwood<br>
        Nathan Redwood, a painting major who also works in other media, including

        Journeying: "Land and Space"<br>

        energy movements in space and present vibrational shapes of the earth's 
        surface.</p>
      <p>March 24-28, 2003<br>
        Desiring Machines<br>
        Desiring Machines is an exhibition of kinetic sculptures produced in the 
        context of the Spring 2003 Experimental Systems in Sculpture class.</p>

        figurative work with her geometric work. The exhibition will also contain 
        a number of welded relief cubist "paintings" of musicians.</p>

        Juried Undergraduate Photography Exhibition<br>
        This juried undergraduate photography exhibition includes digital, non-silver, 
        color and traditional black-and-white photographic work produced by ASU 
        photo majors.</p>
      <p>April 21-25, 2003<br>
        Common Denominator<br>
        This exhibition examines the fragility of the human body as its common 
        theme and portrays two separate aspects of this human condition through 
        two different media. The loss of mental acuity and physical agility serve 
        as the Common Denominator in the work of Bill Wetherill, a senior painting 
        major, and Susan Davis George, a senior fibers major. Wetherill's oversized 
        paintings depict the body's physical frailty with such images as leg braces, 
        oxygen tanks, and wheelchairs. Preservation of childhood memory coupled 
        with memory loss that comes with aging form the foundation of George's 
        work through various fibers techniques such as weaving, printing and knitting. 
        In addition to the common theme in their work, George and Wetherill have 
        something else in common: they are not the typical young art majors, but 
        rather older students. Wetherill is a first-time college student while 
        George returned as a post-baccalaureate student.</p>
      <p>April 28 - May 2, 2003<br>
        Faces, New Paintings by Laura Spaulding<br>
        This exhibit will be the artist's Undergraduate Honors Thesis Show, a 
        culmination of the past four years of work in the School of Art. This 
        exhibition will examine the portrait in art, the influence of the old 
        and modern master, and the artist's own interpretation of color, space 
        and line.</p>
      <p>May 5-9, 2003 <br>
        David E. Lukens<br>
        BFA candidate in photography David E. Lukens presents work two independent 
        studies in photography, in addition to some personal projects. Lukens' 
        first independent study is a portrait series of the homeless in central 
        Phoenix, completed in spring 2002. The second study, undertaken in fall 
        2002, is a documentary-style project of the Van Buren corridor. His personal 
        work presents agrarian landscapes and religious themes. The exhibition
