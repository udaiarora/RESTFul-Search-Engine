Recognition is offered and supported based upon the special and historically significant relationship between Greek-letter social organizations and the university.  Fraternity/sorority chapters enhance the quality of student life through cocurricular programs, contributing significantly to the educational, social, and personal growth of their members.</p><p> The university recognizes the authority of the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations, Inc., the Multicultural Greek Council, the Interfraternity Council, the National Pan-Hellenic Council, and the Panhellenic Council to regulate all matters of fraternity/sorority interest, subject to university policy. When appropriate, the fraternity/sorority councils are encouraged to make recommendations regarding university policy. University recognition requires student organization registration and membership in the appropriate governing/coordinating council.</p><p>Fraternities and sororities are expected to recognize and to embrace the educational purposes of the university and the individual educational goals of their members. Chapters are encouraged to assist members in their academic pursuits and to endorse a set of academic standards and expectations. Activities of fraternities and sororities should not interfere with academic responsibilities.  Chapters must also acknowledge the university&#146;s mission to serve a diverse student population and should function in ways that support this mission.</p><p> In addition to supporting the educational goals of their members, fraternities and sororities should promote programs that develop social and leadership skills in both individuals and groups.</p><p>The university may withdraw recognition from chapters that are not in good academic, disciplinary, or financial standing or whose officers or members have violated the <a href="usi104-01.html"><i>Student Code of Conduct.</i></a> Chapters placed on disciplinary probationary status by the university for violation or alleged violation of the <i>Student Code of Conduct,</i> the <a href="studacint.html"><i>Student Academic Integrity Policy</i></a>, and/or the ASU Computer, Internet, and Electronic Communications Policy (<a href="../acd/acd125.html" target="NEW">ACD 125</a>) may face additional sanctions imposed by the Greek Life office. <p>Chapters should not be under investigation for a breach of a lease or contract with the university, housing corporation, or housing management company, or in violation of state or federal laws.<p>The appropriate campus office may assign fees to incentivize compliance for various administrative tasks.</p> <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Membership in the Fraternity/Sorority Community</b></font><p>The fraternity/sorority community at ASU is composed of private, voluntary-association student organizations that are registered as ASU student organizations and may be members of one or more of the following:<p><ol><p><li>North-American Interfraternity Conference</li><p><li>National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations, Inc.</li><p><li>National Pan-Hellenic Council, Inc.</li><p><li>National Panhellenic Conference</li><p><li>Interfraternity Council</li><p><li>Panhellenic Council<p>and/or</li><p><li>Multicultural Greek Council.</li></ol> <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Expectations Regarding Fraternity and Sorority Recognition</b></font><p>Because of the special relationship that exists between ASU and its fraternity and sorority community, a summary of expectations of chapters is provided:<p><ol><li>All organizations must register each year as student organizations.
