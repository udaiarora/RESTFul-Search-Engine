<h3>ASU Libraries Annual General Meeting - May 4, 2006</h3>

<p><span class="embold">Bob Taskey: LCSTF Chair-Elect</span>
<ul>
 <li>Opening remarks.</li>
 <li>LSA and LCSTF have a <a href="index.html">website</a> and a <a href="http://lsablog.blogspot.com">blog</a>.</li>
 <li>The Spring Tea will be held May 24.</li>
 <li>Elections for all LSA and LCSTF positions will be held soon.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><span class="embold">Sherrie Schmidt: University Dean &amp; Dean of Libraries</span> 
<ul>
 <li>Communication:  Be sure to use Sound Off to announce information about your department.</li>
 <li>Parking
  <ul><li>There are 19,600 spaces on this campus and 35,000 people paying for parking spaces.  New buildings are being built on parking spaces.  There are more students than ever before.</li>
     <li>Parking and Transit Services receives no state funding, and we don't pay enough for our parking spaces to pay for the maintenance of the spaces.</li>
     <li>Parking and Transit Services encourages us to use alternate methods to get to ASU.</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>Downtown Library
  <ul><li>The library will be in the lower lever of the former APS building.  It is in very good condition and is being renovated.</li>
    <li>The library will be known as the "Information Commons," a library/computing site.</li>
    <li>Journalism, Public Programs, Nursing, and the University College collections will be housed in the Downtown Library.  The collections are being developed by the subject specialists of the areas to support the academic work at the Downtown Campus.  </li>
    <li>There will be a fair amount of document delivery.</li>
    <li>Nursing is the only collection that will move from the Tempe campus libraries.</li>  
    <li>Our staff has done the ordering of the collections, and all items are being held at the Storage facility.</li>
    <li>Hopefully the budget for Downtown 2006-2007 will be approved soon so the new positions can be advertised.</li>
    <li>The selection advisory committee for the new library director has forwarded its recommendation to the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs at the Downtown Phoenix Campus.</li>
    <li>The staff recommendation for the Downtown Library is:  3 librarians, 5 classified staff, and a number of student workers.  How many actually are hired will depend on the number of hours the library will be open.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><span class="embold">Kurt Murphy: Associate Dean, Personnel</span>
 <ul>
  <li>Salary increases
	 <ul><li>The May 15 paycheck will include, retroactive to March 11, a $1650 across-the-board pay increase and applicable merit.</li>
     <li>Some non-University state employees have received their raises already.</li>
     <li>No definite criteria for "meritorious" has been given other that "top / outstanding performance."</li>
     <li>An overall score on the annual evaluation of 3.0 or above will be eligible for some merit, 3.1% to 3.9% of base salary.</li>
     <li>Associate Vice President David Butler is on special assignment to research and make recommendations on a university-wide evaluation instrument by December 2007.</li>
   </ul></li>
 <li>Career progressions:  There has been no funding for the past few years, as these funds come from permanent salary savings.</li>
 <li>Are health premiums going up?  Murphy has not heard that they are.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><span class="embold">Dr. John Howard: Associate Dean</span>
<ul>
 <li>How can we use new technologies to increase communication?
  <ul><li>Phil Konomos has been looking into creating an Intranet, a staff web presence that can provide internal forms, manuals, and other information.  Tammy Allwood is chairing a group looking at the whole range of questions that may comprise a staff Intranet.</li>
     <li>ASU is using wikis and blogging functions.  We'll hear more about how University Libraries can get involved.</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>Training to support staff professional development:  We are implementing new ways of doing things, so we need to provide opportunities to train current staff.</li>
 <li>Will community card holders be getting ASURite IDs?  The University Technology Office manages the infrastructure and has been working with the school of Business to enable self-registration, a web services transaction that will allow an ASURite ID to be created for someone who has been registered with one of ASU's systems of records.  This became available to us two weeks ago, and we are looking at a July 1-August 15 implementation.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><span class="embold">Vicki Coleman: Associate Dean, Library Services</span>
 <ul>
 <li>Why aren't we using new technologies for increased communication?
   <ul><li>Coleman would really love to see us doing this.  Blogs and wikis are too informal for serious topics.</li>
     <li>Coleman has a personal goal to increase communication by being more visible to the staff.</li>
    </ul></li>
 <li>Flexible schedules
   <ul><li>A discussion between Coleman and staff revolved around the idea that although staff enjoy having flexible schedules, perhaps in some cases a standard schedule would better meet the needs of our customers, both internal and external.</li>
     <li><a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/spp306.html">SPP 306: Work Schedules defines and discusses flexible scheduling</a>.</li>
     <li><a href="http://www.asu.edu/hr/hr_advisor/ee_pay_work_hours/work_schedules_guidelines.html">HR Advisor discussion on Work Schedule Guidelines</a>.</li>
     <li><a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/library/lc/handbook/H3_1.html">Library policy for Professional Development Time</a>.</li>
   </ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><span class="embold">Rob Spindler: Head, Special Collections and Archives</span>
 <ul>
 <li>Can there be access to Special Collections on Saturdays?  There is: materials are pulled from Labriola and Special Collections on Saturdays from 1:00-5:00.</li>
 <li>Spindler is unaware of any plans for an archive at any of the other campuses. </li>
 <li>What is the difference between records management and archives?
    <ul><li>Records management:  decide how long to retain records, and develop procedures for retention and destruction.</li>
     <li>Archives:  identify what to keep indefinitely in order to preserve historical documents.</li>
    </ul></li>
 <li>Spindler expresses his appreciation and admiration for Dean Schmidt, to whom he has directly reported for 9 years, and he looks forward to working with Dean Howard, to whom Archives and Special Collections now reports.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><span class="embold">Vicki Coleman</span>
 <ul>
 <li>Facilities
   <ul><li>Hayden is changing the entrance/exit area and expanding the café seating area in the foyer.  The turnstiles will be removed, creating one entrance and exit area.</li>
     <li>Will Hayden get a second entrance on the first level?  This is being explored in response to a library student advisory group.</li>
     <li>Will Hayden be 24/5 during the summer?  No.</li>
     <li>Could there be a video drop box outside?  This will be looked into.</li>
		</ul></li>
 <li>What can you tell us about the "Noble Learning Center"?  A committee has conducted focus groups with users to determine how they use the library and if it meets their current needs.  There will be many recommendations, including merging service points.</li>
 <li>How does the reorganizational structuring affect us? 
  <ul><li>There will be new reporting lines, new priorities, and new processes.</li>  
     <li>There will be new customers and new expectations of customers.</li>
	</ul></li>
 <li>How can we prepare for the reorganization?  Ask questions.</li>
 <li>Can individual study rooms be checked out overnight?  The personnel in charge of these rooms will be asked what their views are.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><span class="embold">Sherrie Schmidt</span>
<ul> 
 <li>Wrap up and questions from the group.</li>
 <li>What is the difference between permanent and temporary salary savings?  Within the personnel budget, temporary salary savings come from open lines, and permanent salary savings come from lines not in use.</li>
 <li>In the current management environment, what role does the administration see for LSA/LCSTF and Librarians Council?  
   <ul><li>Librarians Council is necessary for developing criteria for promoting and continuing status for librarians.</li>
     <li>It might be good for the LSA/LCSTF to sponsor departmental showcases.</li>
		</ul></li>
 <li>Suggestion from group:  online showcasing as a function of Library Outreach.</li>
 <li>Suggestion from group:  Instruction, Marketing, and Outreach needs its own web page.</li>
 <li>Are reference APs going to be relocated?  We don't know at the moment.</li>
 <li>Schmidt acknowledges Spindler's earlier statement of appreciation and expresses her appreciation for all she has learned regarding archives and special collections.</li>
 <li>Are the administrators aware of the departmental theft that occurs within the library, specifically the theft of items from the LSA closet?  Report all theft to building security and exit staff to make them aware of any patterns, etc.</li>
 <li>Do the Libraries plan to conduct fundraising?  The ASU Foundation will work with Schmidt to hire a development officer for this purpose.</li>
 <li>Why are there positions that have not been filled for a long time?  Howard:  Some positions are being looked at in light of the changes occurring in the Library.  This is not a reduction in personnel.</li>
 <li>Schmidt closes the meeting by thanking the staff for their great interest in the Library.</li>
</ul>
