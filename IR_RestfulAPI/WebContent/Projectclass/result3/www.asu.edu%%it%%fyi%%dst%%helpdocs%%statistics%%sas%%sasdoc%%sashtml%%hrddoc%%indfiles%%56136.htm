SAS/OR Software: Project Management Examples, Version 6, First Edition
</H1><P>
Learn from this series of examples how easy it is to use SAS/OR software   to manage projects! Each chapter contains a complete project management
scenario and describes how to use the three procedures GANTT, CPM, and     NETDRAW to perform the necessary project management tasks as well as
other procedures in the SAS System that are commonly used for managing     project resources. This book was written for users who are familiar with
project management although it does review many of the concepts. Some      of the project management tasks illustrated include defining complex
project calendars, scheduling with resources, prioritizing activities      and resources, monitoring project progress, and handling multiple
projects. Complete SAS code is provided for each example.
