<img src="purhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2">

<p>
University officers designated by the president, as certified to the executive director of the Board of Regents, are authorized to execute contracts and other written instruments on behalf of the Board of Regents.  In addition, the president may delegate signature authority to other university officials for limited purposes, where the value of the university&#146;s obligation is &#036;10,000 or less and the delegation is warranted to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of university operations and does not unduly expose the Board of Regents or the university to financial loss.

<p>
All signature authority must be delegated in writing with specific limitations delineated by the president.

<p>
In general, the following officers have been delegated signature authority, subject to the scope of authority defined for each position by the president. Persons in an interim position shall have the signature authority of that position. Persons in an acting position shall have the signature authority of that position only if the delegation has specified such authority. All delegations of authority described in previous versions of PUR 202 are superseded.
