<h1>Coeus<br> Technical Information</h1>
<p>
Coeus  was developed at MIT and is used at many universities throughout the country. "Coeus" is not an acronym. It is the name of the ancient Greek titan of knowledge.</p>
<h2>Client/Server</h2>
<p>Coeus is a three-tier client/server application, meaning it runs as a program on a PC that connects to Java Web Application server, that connects to a database; all through the network. </p>
<h3>Client </h3>
<p>The client is built in Java and is a web application, but it does not run in your browser.  It is installed on your computer and uses Java WebStart to run and connect to the Java Application Server.</p>
<h3>Application Server</h3>
<p>The Coeus server handles all the communication between the Coeus client and the Database Server.  This includes negoatiting firewall and database user privileges.  The client never talks directly to the Database Server.
<h3>Server </h3>
<p>The data is kept on an Oracle database server. To use Coeus, you don't need to have Oracle Net8 software, because the Coeus Application Server handles all this communication. </p>
<h2>Firewall </h2>
<p>ASU has firewalls to protect the secure systems of the University. The Coeus databases are secured behind firewalls. </p>

<h3>VPN software </h3>
<p>The PC must have <strong>VPN SecuRemote </strong> installed to negotiate the firewall connection from off campus.  Your Coeus client will negotiate the firewalls within ASU, you just need to get into the ASU Border Firewall from off-campus. VPN must be configured with the ASUFW site. </p>
<h3>Firewall Permission </h3>
<p>You request firewall permission from the Computer Accounts Office.  The Production Coeus database and the Training Coeus database are in the production firewall zone known as "Admin Computing Accesses".  The QA database is in the develop firewall zone known as "VPN access  to dev ports in DMZ". See the  <a href="http://researchadmin.asu.edu/coeus/trouble_shooting.cfm">trouble  shooting guide</a> for more details on firewall access.</p>

<h2>Coeus Client Installation </h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul style="margin-top:0;">
  <li>installs and configures the Java Coeus client</li>
  <li>places a Coeus icon on your desktop </li>
</ul>
<p>You can run the installer by visiting the <a href="https://sec.was.asu.edu/coeus4/CoeusWebStart.asp" style="background-color: #FFFF99; padding:4px;"><strong>Coeus 4.0 Installer</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The installer will place the Coeus client on your local hard disk in your user space.  You should not need to have local administrator privileges on your PC to install Coeus using Java WebStart.  You will have the option to place a Coeus icon on the desktop.  The Coeus 4.0 Installer will not create a Coeus program group on your Start Menu.</p>
<h3>Uninstallation </h3>
<p>Coeus can be uninstalled by reviewing your Coeus WebStart configuration. </p>
<h3>Upgrades </h3>
<p>Because Coeus runs as a web application, any updates to the application will be applied as you load the application.  Sometimes the Coeus application will load slower from your desktop; this probably means it is retrieving updates to the application. </p>
