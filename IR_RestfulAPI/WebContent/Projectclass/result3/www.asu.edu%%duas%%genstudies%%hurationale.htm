<U>Rationale and Objectives</U><P>

The humanities are concerned with questions of human existence and meaning, of the nature of thinking and knowing, and of moral, aesthetic, and other values.  The humanities investigate these questions in both the present and the past, making use of philo
sophy, foreign languages, linguistics and communication studies, religious studies, literature and fine arts.<P>

The fine arts have as their primary purpose the creation of objects and actions which, while they might serve as vehicles for the delivery of other ideas, possess intrinsic properties meant to be perceived and contemplated.  They employ modes of thought a
nd communication which are often nonverbal and which occupy a realm in some measure distinct from discourse and activity directed to nonartistic purposes.  Study of artistic accomplishment helps the individual acquire the perceptive skills and sensitivity
 necessary to gain access to the unique aesthetic qualities of the art work.<P>

The humanities and fine arts form a central part of the General Studies Program since they allow students to search out how these questions and purposes have been probed in the past and how they are dealt with across cultures today.  Students should be en
couraged to relate their findings to their own evolving personal philosophy or set of ideas and beliefs, and to issues of our time.  The humanities and fine arts core area enables students to broaden and deepen their consideration of basic values and thei
r interpretation of human experience.<P>
