The promotion and tenure decision is critical for it affects most significantly the future excellence and standing of the university.<p>The excellence of a faculty member can be measured not only by individual achievement but also by his or her contributions to his or her unit&#146;s current and future mission and objectives, and place within the unit.  Thus, the promotion and/or tenure review process of necessity takes into account the mission and objectives of each unit as it reviews the professional accomplishments of each faculty member under review.<p>The guidelines of each academic unit provide its mission statement and objectives as well as its disciplinary criteria.<p>The unit guidelines articulate two parameters for promotion and/or tenure review.  The first parameter is the set of criteria by which a faculty member is evaluated.  These criteria are benchmarks by which quality of contributions can be measured; they are not goals, which if achieved, guarantee tenure and/or promotion.  The second set of parameters is the unit&#146;s mission statement and objectives, the context within which the individual contributions of the faculty member can be measured.<p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>For information on terminology, see:<p><ol><li><a href="acd505-02.html">ACD 505&#150;02</a>, &#147;Faculty Membership, Ranks, Titles, Appointment Categories, and Honored Positions&#148;<p>and</li><p><li><a href="acd506-02.html">ACD 506&#150;02</a>, &#147;Key Terms.&#148;</li></ol><p>&#160;<font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
