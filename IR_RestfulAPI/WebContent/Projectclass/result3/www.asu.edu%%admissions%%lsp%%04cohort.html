            Determined not to have peaked in high school, I'm looking forward 
            to my time at ASU. I will be majoring in Secondary Ed with an emphasis 
            in PE and minoring in Political Science. That possibly encapsulates 
            my talents and outlook on life. I always come to play ball and compete 
            but I equally enjoy the schmoozing that goes along with the game. 
            After college I plan to teach and coach at my alma mater of Westwood 
            High School! In the meantime, I am very active in my church. I love 
            to play sports. But more specifically, my PASSION is badminton! Besides 
            that, I just enjoy life and live by my motto: &quot;There aren't any 
          strangers, just friends I haven't met yet!&quot;</font></td>

            Westview High School in Avondale AZ. During my high school career 
            I was really involved not only at Westview but also at the various 
            outreach programs at Saint John Vianney Church. I thank God for giving 
            me the opportunity to be the first person in my family to graduate 
            from high school and attend college. I am very excited about becoming 
            an ASU sundevil. My main goals are to stay active in my school and 
            community, to travel and learn another language, and to stay focused 
            in my academics so that I can continue to succeed. In addition, I 
            want to keep having fun with my friends and family while in college. 
            I really enjoy dancing, reading, and working out. I also want to meet 
            many people and continue sharing my positive, optimistic, and happy 
          attitude with everyone.</font></td>

            activities around campus. The activity that most defines me and that 
            I enjoyed the most, was the school video announcements in which I 
            participated for the last three years. That is what I want to study 
            at ASU. I have chosen a Journalism/Broadcasting major with a minor 
            in French. By attending the Walter Cronkite school I wish to start 
            my career and serve as a news anchor and reporter to major news stations 
            in the country and abroad. I would like one day to study and work 
            in Paris, France and live each day working in what I really love. 
            While at ASU I hope to never lose touch with my family and friends 
          and instead share my experiences with those I love.</font></td>

            On a more serious note, I enjoy meeting new people and participating 
            in new things. I was involved in Student Council, NHS, Key Club, Interact, 
            Theatre Club, Track and Field and a plethora of other activities. 
            I was born in America and moved over to Taiwan to study for four years 
            (4th-7th grade). I plan on living in the Hayden Hall and majoring 
            in Biosciences. Recently, I have been named a Flinn Scholar, so hopefully 
            this will further assist me in the pursuit of my ultimate goal of

            I&#8217;ll most likely change my major a few times), and I am seriously 
            thinking of double majoring in either business or political science. 
            For my career goals, I alternate between an ambassador for the US 
            to a Spanish speaking country or diplomat of some sort&#8230;hence 
            my prior statement of changing majors/minors. I suppose that just 
            like anyone else, I LOVE to laugh, and that is done easily. Also, 
            games are imperative to maintaining a balanced life. Plus, every one 
            of us needs to keep that inner child; it is good to act child-like, 
            but not childish. Another thing I love is bubble gum. It is the key

            at least one semester abroad and eventually graduate with a degree 
            in International Business. More importantly, though, I want ASU to
