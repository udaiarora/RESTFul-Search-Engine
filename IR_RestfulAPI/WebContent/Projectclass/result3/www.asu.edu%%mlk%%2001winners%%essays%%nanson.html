<div align="center"><B>My Cousin
</B></div><blockquote><blockquote>
He was young, only of ten, <br>
When tragedy suddenly hit.<br>
He didn't anticipate what would happen next<br>
And it wouldn't be fun one bit.
<p>
He was playing with a little girl,<br>
She was only four.<br>
When there was a shot right from his hand<br>
And then a thud on the floor.
<p>
A gun that wasn't well hidden<br>
Was found by mistake, <br>
Went off in his hand,<br>
And because of this, her life he did take.
<p>
Her burial was beautiful<br>
His heart was in the right place<br>
But the worst thing was yet to come, <br>
To meet the parents face to face.
