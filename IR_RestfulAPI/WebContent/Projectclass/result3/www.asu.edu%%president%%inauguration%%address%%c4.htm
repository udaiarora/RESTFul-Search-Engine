Pasteur devoted his late         career to the development of vaccines that have protected millions from         disease. This approach to scholarship has been termed <em>use-inspired</em>.       </p>      <p> Disinterested inquiry&#8212;research free from vested interest&#8212;has         always been a hallmark of the academy, and many of the advances in research         that are the touchstones of scientific and technological accomplishment         are the result of serendipity. But I envision a community of scholars         also guided by a focus on <em>purpose</em>. Prestige attaches to the creation         of new knowledge, but is it knowledge that can be harnessed to a purpose?       </p>      <p> The social outcome of research is not always considered in an academic         culture that regards knowledge as an end in itself. Our concern is to         contribute to our disciplines, but rarely do we consider what larger contribution         we may be making to society. As one of the founders of the Center for         Science, Policy, and Outcomes in Washington, D.C., one of my particular         academic interests is the purposes of our research. </p>		      <p> A <a href="http://researchnet.asu.edu/">research</a> university is inherently         committed to the principle that teaching is most effectively carried out         in a context that encourages the creation of new knowledge&#8212;teaching         and research are intrinsically aligned. But our scientific, technical,         artistic, theoretical, and philosophical sophistication far outstrips         our knowledge of the relationship between research and its outcomes. What         we must begin to do&#8212;and what our current academic culture sometimes         fails to consider&#8212;is the purpose behind our work. </p>      <p> It is not the role of university administrators to inquire whether or         not research serves some purpose. I am simply saying that academic culture         must broaden its view to consider the social implications of research,         and I am saying that at ASU we might begin to set an example.</p>      <p><img src="images/tomato.jpg" alt="Tomatos on the vine" width="200" height="274" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left">I         could cite many examples of use-inspired scholarship taking place at ASU,         but since I have alluded to Louis Pasteur and his work on vaccination,         I will single out research currently underway in our department of <a href="http://lsvl.la.asu.edu/plantbiology/faculty/arntzen.htm">plant         biology</a>. The leaders of this project realized that poverty and the         limits of distribution technologies prevent the vaccination of much of         the world&#8217;s population. As a consequence, the team is developing         mechanisms for the delivery of vaccines for hepatitis B, smallpox, and         other large-scale killers through genetically-altered tomatoes. Basic         science that will lead to high social impact in a few short years. I call         this approach to scholarship <em>use-inspired</em>.</p></td>    <td width="20%" valign="top" class="indent"> &nbsp;<BR>      <!-- begin table containing example urls and image -->      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="145" align="right">        <tr>           <td colspan="4" valign="bottom" width="145"><img src="images/examples_top.jpg" alt="Examples" width="145" height="21" border="0"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td background="images/examples_left.gif" width="1"><img src="images/i.gif" width="2" height="1" alt=""></td>          <td><img src="images/i.gif" width="2" height="1" alt=""></td>          <td valign="top" width="130"> <table width="120" border="0" align="left" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">              <tr>                 <td> <p class="examples"><a href="c4ex1.htm" class="nodecor">Center                     on Religious-Based Conflict</a><a href="c4ex2.htm" class="nodecor"></a></p>                                  </td>              </tr>            </table></td>          <td background="images/examples_right.jpg" width="12" align="left"><img src="images/i.gif" width="13" height="1" alt=""></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="4" valign="top" width="145"><img src="images/examples_bottom.jpg" alt="" width="145" height="21" border="0"></td>        </tr>      </table>      <!-- end table containing example urls and image -->    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="61%" align="left" valign="bottom"><a href="c3.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom" class="indent"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="c5.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="c5.htm"><img src="images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
