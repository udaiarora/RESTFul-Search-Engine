      <h2>Paul Kirchgraber to lead ASU annual fund-raising teams, program </h2>
      <p><img src="campus_images/Kirchgraber.jpg" alt="Paul Kirchgraber" width="144" height="170" align="right">Paul Kirchgraber will join the ASU Foundation senior management team as vice president, annual constituent programs, beginning Feb. 9. A highly successful fund-raising manager, Kirchgraber was most recently vice president for programs and regional development for Special Olympics of Southern California. He was previously executive director of university advancement for the University of Southern California where he played <br>
  an integral role in the success of USC's recent $2 billion campaign. </p>
      <p>Kirchgraber will be responsible for leading and managing annual fund-raising efforts, including Annual Fund, Parents Association, President's Club, Faculty/Staff campaign, and KAET-TV. Additionally, he will focus on improving alumni giving to ASU. </p>
      <p>"The Foundation is establishing ambitious goals for increased annual giving in support of President Crow's goals for ASU as a new American university," says Jeff Schemmel, Foundation senior vice president and executive director of development for ASU. "Paul's experience in leading multiple fund-raising units that successfully increased both annual participation and donor yield for USC will be extremely valuable to us. His proven management expertise and knowledge in all elements of fund-raising will significantly enhance the ASU Foundation's senior management team." </p>
      <p>At USC, Kirchgraber guided departmental directors to plan and execute tailored direct mail, telemarketing and personal solicitation strategies that resulted in a 30 percent increase in annual giving within the USC Annual Fund, Parent Fund and USC Associates programs during a five-year period. Under his direction, USC increased alumni participation from 13 percent to 30 percent in five years. He also directed a three-year prospect identification project, which resulted in 500 new major gifts prospects, and led a team of fundraisers and technology specialists in the selection and implementation of an integrated fund development software system. </p>
      <p>During his eight years at USC, Kirchgraber was invited to design and teach UCLA's first-ever Internet-based, online course on Grant Writing for Foundations and Corporations. He was subsequently asked to develop and teach a second course on Fundraising Technology, the first course of its kind at UCLA devoted to exploring the use of emerging technologies for the non-profit sector. </p>
      <p>As a vice president with Special Olympics of Southern California, Kirchgraber directs a $1 million comprehensive fund-raising initiative, supervising regional development directors in Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties. He also directs the business and program activities of more than 30 Southern California offices serving more than 11,000 constituents. </p>
      <p>"I am thrilled to be joining the ASU Foundation team at such an exciting and important stage in its development," says Kirchgraber. "What first attracted me to ASU was the school's emerging role as a leader in the world of higher education and the important role it plays in the greater Phoenix community. I am looking forward to sharing my fund-raising management experience with the university, its graduates and the business community to the benefit of current and future generations of ASU faculty and students." </p>
      <p>Kirchgraber has an M.S. in social work with specialization in administration and community organization, and a B.S. in social work. </p>
      <p>Bruce, with the ASU Foundation, can be reached at (480) 965-4429 or (maggie.bruce@asu.edu). </p>
