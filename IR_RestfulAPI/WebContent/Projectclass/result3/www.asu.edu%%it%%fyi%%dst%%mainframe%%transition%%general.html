    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">Executive Summary</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This document provides you with
    the basics of transitioning (moving) your computing work from
    one computing system to another. You would normally do a transition
    because better resources for doing your work are available on
    another system or because the system you're currently using is
    being phased out.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Only two systems are being phased
    out at ASU: the VM/CMS system and the Academic VAX/VMS system.
    The other systems (UNIX, IBM MVS/TSO, and the PC and Mac sites)
    will remain.</FONT></P>

    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">Limitations of UNIX Systems</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At the time of writing of this
    document, an effective means on the UNIX systems to handle large
    amounts of data on tape is not available. If you use tape, you
    should move to or remain on the IBM MVS system (or another system)
    which has tape facilities.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If the amount of data on tape
    is small, you may want to copy the files to disk and then eliminate
    tape usage. If the volume of data you need to move (including
    tape and disk files) is less than 200 megabytes you should be
    able to successfully transition to another computing platform
    without complications.</FONT></P>

    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">What is a &quot;Transition&quot;</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The term &quot;Transition&quot;
    is defined as moving your computing activities from one computing
    system to another, such as to a UNIX server (Research , Stats,
    General, AI), to the IBM MVS mainframe, or to your own personal
    workstation.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A transition is required for
    only two systems. ASU's VM/CMS system and Academic VAX/VMS system
    are being phased out. All computing activities on these systems
    must be moved elsewhere. At this point in time, the transition
    does not include moving e-mail use from VM/CMS because a suitable
    alternative has not yet been located, although an IMAP based
    e-mail package is available for use <A HREF="emchoice.html">(see
    section on E-mail Choices)</A>.</FONT></P>

    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">What do I need to transition?</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As you create your personal transition
    plan, you should consider in what order you might want to transition
    programs and data. For example, work in progress that must be
    completed by a certain date is probably not a good choice. Whereas
    a new project or research, which depend very little on existing
    programs, would most likely be a good choice.</FONT></P>

    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">Caution! - Protect your data!</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As you move from one computing
    system to another, you should be careful to keep backup copies
    of files until you have verified the integrity of the data on
    the new system(s).</FONT></P>

    <H3><FONT SIZE="+0" FACE="Arial">When should you start?</FONT></H3>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Once you've identified a need
    to transition, there is no time like the present to start. The
    most frustrating part of a transition is the learning curve associated
    with a new environment. By waiting until the last moment to do
    a transition, your ability to meet deadlines, to be productive,
    will be hampered by the time required to learn the new environment.
    Beginning early allows you to become familiar with the new environment
    without unnecessary pressures and to do so with minimum interruption
    to your other ongoing activities.</FONT></TD>
