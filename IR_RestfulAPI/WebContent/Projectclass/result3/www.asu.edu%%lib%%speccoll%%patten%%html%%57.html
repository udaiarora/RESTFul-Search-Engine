<P>Whereunto is newly added a treatise of the arte of graffing and planting
of trees. London: Imprinted at London by Henrie Bynneman, anno 1574. The
treatise on bees has separate t.p. 3rd enl. ed., 2nd to include the Arte
of Graffing and Planting--Cf. Hunt 117. A much enlarged version of the
author's <I>A Most Briefe and Pleasaunte Treatise, Teachyng How to Dresse,
Sowe, and Set a Garden</I> (ca. 1557- 1559), the first book on gardening
printed in England--Cf. Hunt 102. References: Hunt 117; STC13493.
<P>This work is divided into two books, with the first dealing with the
making and tending of the garden and the second with the sewing, setting,
and caring for specific herbs, flowers, and vegetables.&nbsp; These two
books are followed by three treatises.&nbsp; The first discusses bees,
including the gathering of honey and its many uses; the second treats the
changes in weather, especially the extremes, as well as rules for the preservation
of health.&nbsp; The last treatise included in this work deals with&nbsp;
the art of planting and grafting fruit trees, so that they will bear more
fruit of differing varieties.
