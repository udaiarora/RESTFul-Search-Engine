SAS/SHARE User's Guide, Version 8
</H1><P>
Use this documentation to learn how to use and manage SAS/SHARE software.  Along with exploiting the Multiple Engine Architecture to provide remote
access to data that is stored in various SAS file formats as well as in    database management systems, you can use SAS/SHARE software for combining
and filtering data to obtain the most efficient use of network and         computing resources.  SAS/SHARE software also includes management tools
for controlling and analyzing server use. This documentation is designed   primarily for developers of SAS applications and third-party applications
that exploit remote or concurrent access to data.  End-users of those      applications, administrators of resources that are used by those
applications, will also find this documentation useful.
