      <h2>Arizona legislature introduces bill to stimulate economy through $400
        million in university research infrastructure construction</h2>
      <p>Despite budget woes, a group of Arizona legislators are leading a bipartisan
        effort to stimulate the state economy by funding more than $400 million
        in high tech research infrastructure construction at Arizona State University
        (ASU) and the two other state universities: the University of Arizona
        and Northern Arizona University.</p>
      <p>An 11th hour bill introduced in the Arizona House of Representatives
        April 16 by Speaker of the House Jake Flake, and Speaker Pro Tempore
        Bob Robson, and co-sponsored by more than half of the legislature, proposes
        to build these new research facilities during the next three years.</p>
      <p>ASU President Michael Crow, who led the infrastructure initiative, said
        the project, if funded, would result in a significant return on investment
        for ASU and, ultimately, the state of Arizona.</p>
      <p>The announcement came at a press conference at the Capitol where legislators
        and university presidents presented the plan. </p>
      <p>For ASU, the bill will provide $185 million to build Phase 2, 3 and
        4 of the Arizona BioDesign Institute, the School of Life Sciences building,
        and research facilities to house burgeoning biotech fields such as nanotechnology,
        materials science, information technology and bioinformatics. The university
        also plans to create a research center and integrated learning environment
        at ASU West, and an ASU East applied biological sciences research complex.</p>
      <p>Crow believes these scientific fields will be the catalysts for economic
        expansion and opportunity. <br>
        "Arizona has to get in the game, and the most effective route for creating
        new and high value economic opportunity for its citizens is through increasing
        the research infrastructure and innovative capacity of its universities,"
        said Crow. "This bipartisan effort is the right move at the right time
        to stimulate economic development throughout the state," Crow said. </p>
      <p>Under the plan, ASU and UA would each receive $14.5 million and NAU
        would receive $5.9 million for lease purchase financing on the facilities
        beginning in 2004. No money from the state's general fund would be used
        to finance the projects until 2008. The proposed financing mechanism
        allows the universities' projects to be exempt from construction sales
        tax to bridge payments on lease purchase financing.</p>
      <p>In addition to substantial long-term economic benefits, Robson said
        there are immediate economic benefits too. It is estimated that construction
        spending will produce 6,000 new jobs and create $630 million in total
        immediate economic impact. Additionally, the projects will generate about
        $28 million in state, county and city revenues. </p>
      <p>"This bill promises to supercharge the economy and the state education
        system as well," Robson said. <br>
        House Speaker Jake Flake said economic stimulus generated from the construction
        of the buildings would help Arizona grow itself out of its current slump. </p>
      <p>"Just because you are in hard times, is a farmer not going to plant
        corn?" asked Flake. "We can do it and we must, for the future of Arizona."</p>
      <p>The bill has received wide legislative and gubernatorial support, as
        well as being embraced by the industry and business community and local
        city officials. The National Association of Industrial and Office Properties
        (NAIOP) provided substantial support for the measure, including hiring
        a lobbyist on behalf of the universities. NAIOP chapter President Craig
        Coppola said Arizona's two major universities currently are perceived
        as second-tier research institutions because they lack needed facilities.
        If they want to be on the first tier and attract more grants, especially
        from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health,
        Arizona's universities need more lab space, Coppola said. </p>
      <p>District 17 Rep. Mark Thompson of Tempe said the bill could change the
        landscape of the Arizona economy by supercharging it with research performed
        by students under the direction of professors. </p>
      <p>"Arizona's current economy is based on technology and tourism. Both
        sectors have been hit economically hard recently. When we looked at this
        plan it made sense to us to fuel a new sector that can add to the state's
        job base. We have all the essential ingredients right now to make this
        work except the infrastructure. This bill will provide the buildings.
        This is an important first step in enabling the universities to move
        closer to an entrepreneurial model," said Thompson.</p>
