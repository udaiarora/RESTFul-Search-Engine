      <h2>Fulton gives $50 million to endow School of Engineering at ASU</h2>
      <p>        Ira A. Fulton, chief executive officer of Fulton Homes, Inc., one of
          Arizona's and the nation's preeminent residential builders, announced
          June 26 a $50 million gift to the ASU Foundation for the benefit of
        the College of Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences.</p>
      <p>The gift, which will
          endow the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering at ASU, will provide
          funding for scholarships, fellowships, research programs
        and investments in faculty to enable the school of engineering to move
        from its position as a highly ranked U.S. program into the ranks of world-class
        institutions. According to U.S. News &amp; World Report, the Ira A. Fulton
        School of Engineering begins its history ranked 37th in the United States
        for its undergraduate programs and 56th for its graduate programs in
        engineering.</p>
      <p>"I have an enduring passion for technology, for education
          and for the people of Arizona," said Fulton. "And I strongly believe
          you can't have
          a great city without a great school of engineering. I am pleased to
        make this gift, knowing it will enable ASU to grow into one of the highest
          ranked, most visible schools of engineering in the world.</p>
      <p>"At Fulton Homes
          we build communities that will stand the test of time. With this endowment,
          we are building an engine of educational and economic
          growth that will endure for generations. It is a gift of opportunity,
          prosperity, social equality and hope," Fulton said.</p>
      <p>"We are grateful to
          Mr. Fulton for his vision, commitment and trust in our ability to turn
          his investment into use-inspired engineering research
          and education that will transform the future," said ASU President Michael
          Crow. "This is not only a gift to ASU, but a gift to the people of
        Arizona and this nation.</p>
      <p>"Ira Fulton is a man of principle and vision, who has
          spent his life as an entrepreneur," said Crow. "For the last 28 years,
          he has focused
          his creative energy on building communities for the people of Arizona.
          More importantly, Fulton Homes donates 50 percent of its profits to
        worthy causes, primarily toward enhancing the education of young people."</p>
      <p>Ira
          A. Fulton School of Engineering Dean Peter Crouch said, "This gift
        will be used to attract and retain preeminent scholars and exceptional
          students in engineering and the applied sciences. With this gift, we
          will distinguish ourselves internationally at the transformational
        edge
          of a number of research and education fields. We will expand and enhance
          important existing programs, such as enabling the paralyzed to walk
        and the blind to see, developing new materials to make highways quieter
        and
          safer, modeling chemical agents and airborne particles to block terrorist
          attacks, and providing clean, fresh water to meet the world's needs."</p>
      <p>Fulton
          was born in Tempe. He started working at age 6, and by age 11 became
          a newspaper courier for the Arizona Republic. He eventually became
          the paper's number one carrier, serving a route that included ASU's
        main campus. </p>
      <p>After attending ASU on a football scholarship, he went to work
          for NCR, where he rose to the position of National Salesman of the
        Year. Subsequently,
          he formed his own companies, serving the computer needs of other businesses. </p>
      <p>In 1974, he began consulting for Eagleson's Big and Tall men's clothiers,
          a company that was on the edge of bankruptcy. Within two years, he
        purchased the company, turned it around, and expanded it from two retail
        outlets
        to 33, with millions of dollars in sales.</p>
      <p>He used the cash flow from his
          clothing business to start Fulton Homes, which he grew from building
          several homes a year to its present annual
          volume of around 1,500 residential units. Along the way, he built an
          organizational culture of quality, customer satisfaction and service,
          both to the company's customers and to the communities in which they
        operate.</p>
      <p>The Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering provides a transformative
          educational experience for engineering, computer science and construction
          students,
          giving them the knowledge and skills they need for success in a technically
          oriented career. The school also engages in use-inspired research in
          a multidisciplinary setting, creating knowledge for the benefit of
        individuals, society and the environment. Through the creation of a highly
        educated,
          innovative workforce and the advancement of technical knowledge, the
          Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering drives sustainable growth and improved
        quality of life for the communities it serves.</p>
