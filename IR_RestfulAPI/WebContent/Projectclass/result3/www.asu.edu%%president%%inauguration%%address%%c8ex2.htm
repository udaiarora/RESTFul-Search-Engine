Increased trade         with Asia and the desire to promote economic development in Arizona through         globalization suggests the need for the proposed Center on Asian and Pacific         Rim Trade and Economic Development. Given the growing importance of these         economies, it is essential to develop a sophisticated understanding in         economic terms as well as socially and culturally. </p>      <p> When one considers Arizona&#8217;s global connections, its proximity         to Latin America suggests an economic orientation southward, and we are         indeed advancing teaching and research in this direction through our Pan-American         Initiative. Metropolitan Phoenix, however, is one of the largest American         cities located near the Pacific Rim. As metropolitan Phoenix diversifies         its economy, and in particular its high-tech base, increased trade with         Asia is both inevitable and desirable. Through the center we can broaden         opportunities in technology transfer and promote industrial research collaborations.         The economic prosperity of our region may be tied to Asia and the Pacific         Rim as well as Latin America.<br>      </p></td>    <td align="center" valign="top"> &nbsp;<BR> </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
