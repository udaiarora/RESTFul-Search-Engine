Future Not Found reports will not include assets previously reported as missing. Departments may access our Web Reports online to view their missing assets.<p>If missing assets are subsequently discovered, the department notifies Property Control. <p>Property Control continues the inventory bar-code scanning cycle. If missing assets are discovered during the inventory bar-code scanning cycle, Property Control reports missing assets to department personnel. <p>If missing assets are not discovered after two years of bar-code scanning, Property Control reviews the missing assets for disposition. <p>Property Control officially retires the missing assets from the university&#146;s property control system. <p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>Prior to retiring missing sponsored-owned assets, review the retirement with the sponsored property coordinator.</td></tr></table></LI><p>Return to <a href="pcs601-04.html#endtable">PCS 601-04</a><p>&#160;</body></html>
