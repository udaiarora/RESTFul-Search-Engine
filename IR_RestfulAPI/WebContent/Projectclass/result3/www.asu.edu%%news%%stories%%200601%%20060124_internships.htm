<h1 class="storyhead">ASU for Arizona internships gives back to communities </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>Spring break is a time when many college students head for the beach - or the lake - to soak up some sun. </p>
<p>But Alex Delgadillo won't be at the beach during ASU's upcoming spring break. Instead, he'll be at the National Audubon Society Research Center in Elgin, Ariz., assisting with research and such "cowboy" chores as mending fences. </p>
<p>Delgadillo, a sophomore history major, is the driving force behind ASU's "alternative spring break," a project of the ASU for Arizona Internship Program. </p>
<p>ASU for Arizona, under Community Development in the Office of Public Affairs, has been hiring students to work on various projects for several years. The organization has formalized the program and will begin offering four internships per year. </p>
<p>Students also will be hired to work on short-term projects, says Barbara Shaw-Snyder, program director. </p>
<p>Building Great Communities was established to create goodwill between cities in Arizona and ASU, and it has evolved into a student-driven program, Shaw-Snyder says. </p>
<p>"The ASU for Arizona Internship program emerged from feedback that we received from communities," she says. "Community members told us that their children leave for the universities and don't come back, partly because they don't have an investment in their home towns, and partly because they leave for job opportunities. </p>
<p>"We wanted to put together an internship that brings ASU's student knowledge capital back to these communities across the state and connects these students to the leaders and problem-solvers of the communities. </p>
<p>"Hopefully, we can help facilitate student interest, commitment and passion for all regions across the state of Arizona. We want to help build future leaders for Arizona." </p>
<p>Students chosen for internships will earn $8 to $9 per hour, plus have the opportunity to earn academic credit for graduation to work in on of five outreach areas: </p>
<p>. Native American Efforts. </p>
<p>. Arizona Cities and Towns. </p>
<p>. African-American Efforts. </p>
<p>. Asian-Pacific American Efforts. </p>
<p>. Arizona/Mexico Border Efforts. </p>
<p>They must commit to work for a year, participate in a five-week orientation and training course, work a minimum of 15 hours per week and find a faculty or community mentor in his or her project field. </p>
<p>In addition to offering students an unparalleled opportunity to learn leadership skills, such as how to conduct meetings, communicate by e-mail and make formal presentations, Shaw-Snyder hopes the program will help stop the "brain drain" of talented students who graduate from ASU and then leave the state. </p>
<p>Shaw-Snyder says ASU's internship program is the only one of its kind in the United States. It is set apart from other universities because "the projects are complex and multi-disciplinary. To be successful, the students need to work with university leadership, the regional leadership, and often state leadership to understand how to define the project and get the work done." </p>
<p>One of the first ASU for Arizona projects was a proposed master plan for the Navajo Nation, coordinated by Kimberly Silentmen, who received a master's degree in planning from ASU in May. </p>
<p>Thirty students from ASU and the University of New Mexico participated, and 20 architecture and planning professionals and professors came to Window Rock to see the final presentation, or "charette," Silentmen says. </p>
<p>The project offered Silentmen, who is a member of the Navajo Nation, a chance to learn about "the politics of working with a sovereign nation," she says. </p>
<p>Silentmen is coordinator for American Indian Initiatives in the Del E. Webb School of Construction at ASU, where her responsibilities include planning a major conference on construction in Indian country. </p>
<p>"Working with ASU for Arizona opened up opportunities for me," Silentmen says. "It gave me valuable contacts - and a job." </p>
<p>Another Native American ASU student, Tonya Yellowhair, is coordinating a project to take 10 students to Chinle High School over spring break to help with the school's traditional senior class pow wow. </p>
<p>ASU for Arizona "encourages students to be successful," Yellowhair says. "The staff creates a professional environment, yet at the same time they help me to grow with my projects." </p>
<p>Yellowhair, who is married and has two young daughters, is an architecture major who hopes to work in housing development in the Navajo Nation when she graduates. </p>
<p>David Lukens, a senior majoring in art and photography, is nearly three months into a project to document the health of Arizona's forests, primarily in Payson and the Rim Country, including photos of controlled and uncontrolled burns and capturing the impact of fires on surrounding communities. </p>
<p>Lukens, who has photographed in Iraq, Haiti and West Africa, says the forest project has been his most difficult to undertake. </p>
<p>"When you go to Iraq or Haiti, you know what's going on when you get off the plane," he says. "In the forests, there is a lot more research to do." </p>
<p>Being able to tell the story of the forests to people who haven't seen the trees will test his mettle, Lukens says, adding: "This will define whether I'm a good photographer." </p>
