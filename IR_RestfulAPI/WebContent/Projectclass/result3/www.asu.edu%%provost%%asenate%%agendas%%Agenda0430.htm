<p><b>6.A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive Committee (Doug Johnson).</b>

<p><b>6.A.1&nbsp;&nbsp; First reading of Senate Motion #13 (2000-2001).

</b>Request

to add the Bachelor of Independent Studies Program (BIS)

<br>as a member of the Academic Senate (Motion/BIS letter attached).

<p><b>6.A.2&nbsp;&nbsp; First reading of Senate Resolution #2 (2000-2001).

</b>Resolution

on Athletics. We will focus our Senate?s resolution on the first item of

the

document, which states: <u>We urge the presidents of our ten universites

to begin serious discussions aimed at moderating the exponential growth

of athletic programs and budgets in the PaC-10. We urge them to put this

topic on the agenda of their June meeting.</u>

<p><b>6.B Committee on Committees (Brent Brown).</b>

<p>The elections are completed and we had a 32% return on the 1725 mailed

ballots. In the fall, we look forward to the capable leadership of Betsy

Burns from Geography, and continued arm twisting. As an aside, it cost

the Senate Office 62 cents per vote this year for materials and supplies

in the Assembly election process and we hope to implement online voting

next year. (It may cost more than 62 cents per vote, but it will be certainly

be easier on the Senate Office Staff.)

<p><b>6.C Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee (Mike Mayer).</b>

<p><b>6.C.1 Information Items </b>(do not require Senate action).

<p>1) A curricular proposal from the College of Education, Division of

Curriculum &amp; Instruction to <u>change the name of a concentration</u>,

MEd in Special Education from Severely/Multiply Handicapped to <u>Severely/Multiply

Disabled.</u>

<p>2) A proposal from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Department

of Mathematics, to <u>establish a concentration in the BS Degree Mathematics:

Statistics.</u>

<p><b>6.C.2 Action Item (First Reading).</b>

<p><b>Senate Motion #12 (2000-2001): </b>"The Curriculum and Academic Programs

Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted by

the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences <u>to change the name of a degree

program</u> from BS in Computer Science to <u>BS in Computational Mathematical

Sciences</u>."

<p>Rationale: The proposed CMS degree is the natural evolution of Computer

Science for students interested in C.S. within the framework of a rich

curriculum provided by a Liberal Arts and Sciences training. Under the

reformulation of the degree, students are able to combine strong quantitative

and computational training with the development of fundamental skills in

one or more areas of the life<font face="Times"><font size=-1> </font></font>existing

facility resources and expertise in CLAS; specifically in the Department

of Mathematics. or physical sciences. In particular, the ability to combine

these skills with the life sciences responds to the national need for scientists

qualified for professions in the new technologies and developments emerging

in computational molecular biology, genetics, protemics and biomaterials.

Moreover, this refocus of the degree to Computational Mathematical Sciences

is accomplished by utilizing.

<p><b>6.D Personnel Committee</b> (Joes Cobas).

<p>The promotion and tenure process will be a major focus next year in

the Senate. The Committee will consider the draft document prior to fall,

and make their recommendations to the Senate at its first fall meeting.

<p>There are a number of recommendations that have been made by the task

force on Promotion and Tenure that do attempt to provide more recognition

for a broader view of scholarship, including teaching. The question is

how to implement this in a way that will be scholarly and includes peer

review<b>.</b>

<p><b>6.E Student-Faculty Policy Committee</b> (Craig Allen).

<p>At the last committee meeting, Dean Anne Schneider who chaired the Task

Force on Promotion and Tenure laid out her report that she will present

to the Senate in the fall.

<p>There was a good deal of interest expressed about the opening up of

scholarship as well as about raising the bar, in terms of how that will

be judged. It will require official documenting of what we do; that is

the challenge, how do we make things public and get peer reviews.

<p>The committee also heard from Alex Bainbridge on the new proposal for

online evaluation. The materials that Alex provided updated the committee

on national interest in this issue. The new student president, Jeremy Helper

is committed to the program and in addition, Tom Murray and Lanton Lee,

the Offices of Student Development and Student Life will help with the

transition of this program.

<p><b>6.F University Affairs Committee</b> (Renu Sharma).

<p>At the last meeting, Ginnie Sylvester from University Libraries spoke

to the committee about the changes in the Interlibrary Loan program. Copyright

issues were also discussed. Ginny also made her presentation to the Senate

on April 2. Faculty need to become aware of the services that are available

now through Interlibrary Loan, especially with the current cuts to serials.

<p>FYI: P.E. West Annex will soon be demolished beginning in mid-May. The

contents of your lockers need to be removed by May 11. Those lockers will

be then be relocated to the P.E. Building and the planned M.U. expansion

will take up the land that the West Annex now occupies.

<p>Deadlines for course packet copyright clearances need to be reviewed

by our faculty. ASU Purchasing used to perform this service but they can

no longer do it without additional funding for their operating budget.

It will become an increasingly important issue for the university as we

begin to develop more online courses, and as we rely more heavily on electronic

media, as well as course packs of articles. Obtaining copyright clearance

becomes more critical. The university needs to support faculty in the process

of doing this, therefore, the Committee has requested that the Provost?s

Office find funding for this, as they move it out of the Purchasing budget.

It does appear that more people will be using the service and the process

may actually take longer, so, the deadline for next fall has been moved

forward to July 1. That is a date earlier than some faculty would have

anticipated.

Letter from Chris Stage, Director of Bachelor of Independent Studies Program</font></font>

<p>To:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Doug Johnson, President, Academic Senate

<br>From:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christina Stage, Bachelor

of Interdisciplinary Studies Program - Director

<br>Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April 5, 2001

<br>Re:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Representation in the Academic Senate

<p>On behalf of the faculty of the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies

Program, I would like to request representation in the Academic Senate

at Arizona State University effective AY 01-02.

<p>As a faculty comprised entirely of lecturers, we were pleased to see

the amendment granting full-time lecturers membership in the Academic Assembly

pass and we look forward to participating in the April election.&nbsp;

In addition to Assembly membership, we would like to seek full representation

by gaining a seat in the Senate.

<p>We believe the faculty of the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies

Program (BIS) is eligible for representation in the Senate because BIS

is an academic unit that, is involved in the hiring of faculty, academic

professionals, and/or graduate assistantslassociates (e.g., colleges, departments,

centers, and programs). The BIS is a degree-granting program with a faculty

of nine (soon to be ten) lecturers. All our lecturers have full-time multi-year

contract positions and are not represented in the Academic Senate through

other departments or colleges on campus.

<p>We appreciate your consideration of our request and hope the Executive

Committee will allow the Senate to vote on our status.&nbsp; If you have

any questions or need further information to consider this request, please

do not hesitate to contact me at 727-7090 or chris.stage@asu.edu. Thank

you.
