<p>not gotten over the cold she had on the trip and is having a 
hard time recovering. The journey was almost too much for her. 
Arthur is being adored and talks all the time. He says his 
father is far, far away across the ocean, in Phoenix. He 
found an old pipe and said it was grandfather Luhrs' pipe. 
Everyone says Arthur is clever for his age and tall and strong. 
The neighbor Dohne does not like children, but says Arthur is 
terrific. He is always eating baked dumplings with him. 
Everyone in Neuhaus seems to know him and he speaks to them in 
High German or English. I wish you could see and hear him. 
Have received all your letters and the one from Chicago.</p>
<br>
<p>Letter 30, July 15, 1887: Thinks she will leave the end of 
August, with the moon decreasing. Ella is always sick with a 
cold. She cannot stand the cold weather. She can stand alone 
now. Soon will be running. How do you like her new name of 
Ella? Her mother did not like the name Louise because everyone 
pronounced it differently. She will be baptized August 11th, 
on her birthday. Thanks for the 1000 marks. Gave half to 
Christine, for we owed it to her. She does not want to go back 
and it is just as well for she does not treat Gretchen very nice. 
Went to the Schutzenfest twice, once with her father and once 
with Arthur. Tell Mrs. Andre she will not be going to Berlin. 
Her mother suggested that Arthur stay over in Neuhaus with them.</p>
<br>
<p>Letter 31, July 2th, 1887: Sorry she has not written more often, 
but there is always something preventing her from writing. 
Have had a lot of disagreeable talks with Christine. Neither 
she nor Elise are going back with her to Phoenix. Elise is 
going to get married. Bringing the girl who was at the Kahrs 
when George and Gretchen got married. There are no homeless 
girls in Neuhaus. She has had to face many problems. She sees 
things differently now than when she got married. Paid Christine, 
after receiving the 1000 marks. Plan to leave August 28th or 
September 4th. You have done me no wrongs. Stay just as you 
are. She has her faults too. Ella will be baptized August 11th. 
She is not walking yet. Arthur likes it there, but asks why his 
papa did not come with his mother. She is not going to Berlin.</p>
<br>
<p>Letter 32, August 7th: Ella is going to be baptized today. 
Leaving Hamburg August 28th on the Lessing. Did not like the 
Hammonia. Received the plans for the railroad. Will buy tickets 
in New York. George need not come to New York. Bush Hotel is 
too expensive, so will leave as soon as get to New York. Not 
bringing the girl from the Kahrs, but one from Odenburg. Can 
find none for Mrs. Thalheimer. When went to Hamburg to register 
for the tickets, was told the girl could not use Christine's 
ticket, so had to buy one. Will get a refund in America. To 
have enough money, got the money back from Christine and will send 
it to her from Phoenix. Received Mrs. Herrick's letter. Can 
read English, but not write it.
