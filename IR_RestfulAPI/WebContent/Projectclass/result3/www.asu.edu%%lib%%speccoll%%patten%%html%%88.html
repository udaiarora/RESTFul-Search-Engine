several other arts: illustrated with four hundred copper cutts curiously
done from the life; and an explanation of their different names, places
of growth, and countries from whence they are brought; the way to know
the true from the false, their virtues &amp;c. A work of very great use
and curiosity. First ed. of the first English translation--Cf. Johnston,

ed. but reproduced 4 to a leaf. Publishers' advertisements on b<sup>4</sup>
verso and 2F<sup>2</sup>. References: Hunt 428; Johnston, S. H. Cleveland

<p>The preface notes that the translators have felt free to omit any repetitions
occuring in the original work, as well as making additions and corrections
of their own.&nbsp; The work lists the drugs which may be made from seeds,
followed by those from roots, woods, barks, leaves, flowers, fruits, gums,
and juices.&nbsp; Volume two begins with an account of the names of all
the authors who are quoted in this text, listed alphabetically.&nbsp; Following
this the author has included a catalog of seeds.&nbsp; Then drugs which
may be made from animals are discussed, including those involving the five
different types of unicorns.&nbsp; The author concludes with a discussion
of drugs from metals, minerals, bitumens, stones, and earths.&nbsp; There
is a complete index at the end, as well as 400 engravings on 86 plates
from the French.
