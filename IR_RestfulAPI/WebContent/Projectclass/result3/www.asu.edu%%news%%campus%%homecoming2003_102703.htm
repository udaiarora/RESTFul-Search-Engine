        Activities begin Oct. 27 and continue throughout the week.</p>
      <p>The Second
            City Comedy Troupe, a group that gave Bill Murray his start, will
        kick off the celebration with hilarious scenes and improvisation
          in "Night of a Thousand Laughs" at 7 p.m., Oct. 27 at the Tempe Improv,
          930 E. University. Tickets are $5 for students, $10 for faculty and

      <p>It's all a ramp-up for the big day that's
          expected to rock Tempe, Nov. 1. After a 10 a.m. parade, the ASU Homecoming
          FestDevil Block Party,
          presented by Saturn, will take over University Drive at College Avenue
          with live music, food from favorite local restaurants and more than
        150 tents representing all the ASU colleges and every major club and
        alumni
          chapter. The free Block Party continues until just before the ASU-California
          football game at 1:30 p.m. </p>
      <p>The party will have an extreme sports area
          with everything from a rock climbing wall, fast speed pitch and touchdown
          dive to golf, slap shot
          and a skateboard demonstration. For younger children there's a fun
        slide, bouncing tents, obstacle course and face-painting clowns.</p>
      <p>The Rising,
          an alternative rock band with a current Top-40 hit, will spearhead
        the entertainment. A second stage will feature the local classic
          and contemporary rock band Cruz and the Boomers, three of whom are
        ASU alumni. Mariachi Corazon de Phoenix will perform throughout the block
          party.</p>
      <p>A variety of food will be available from Tempe restaurants, including
          Ducks Restaurant/Holiday Inn, Brooklyn Italian Ices, Ruby Tuesday,
        Macayo's Depot Cantina, Monti's La Casa Vieja, Rinaldi's on Third, Mama's
        Pizzeria
          and Kinder's Custom Meats.</p>
      <p>The Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine
          Arts also will stage its inaugural Art Walk, bringing 35 alumni and
        graduate student artists together to
          show and sell their work. The juried show begins at 10 a.m. and continues
          until sunset along the sidewalk in front of Old Main. Media categories
          include painting, furniture and lamps, ceramics, watercolor, photography,
          jewelry, fiber, digital art, printing and mixed media. ASU dancers,
        musicians and singers also are scheduled to provide entertainment on
        stage.</p>
      <p>The
          first-ever ASU Homecoming Scholarship Dash for Cash 5K begins at 8:30
          a.m. Nov. 1, giving ASU supporters the chance to get some early
          morning exercise and raise money for a worthy cause. Proceeds will
        fund scholarships through the ASU Alumni Association. The 5K course begins
          at the Student Services lawn and winds through campus. Participants
        may
          register up until the day of the race, at a cost of $20.</p>

        the Homecoming experience for returning alumni, Saturn has stepped forward
        as the presenting sponsor. Additional sponsors include
