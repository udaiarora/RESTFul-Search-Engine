    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You must supply your own blank
    mailing labels. Be sure to supply enough label stock for all
    labels to be printed, plus additional stock for dummy alignment
    labels (used for aligning the forms on the printer). Labels are
    usually printed on &quot;1-up&quot; label stock with 3.5 x 1-inch
    labels. These are available at ASU General Stores, and will be
    referred to as &quot;standard label stock&quot; in this write-up.
    Although PROC FORMS can print labels in other formats,the examples
    in this write-up are designed for use with standard label stock.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The box of blank labels must
    be delivered to the tape library before submitting a label printing
    job. Mark the box with your IBM userid, name, and phone number.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A trial run on regular computer
    paper is strongly recommended before using your label stock.
    Both the paper and the labels are printed 8 lines per inch so
    the output is comparable. Labels are printed in upper case only.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Special forms are printed at
    night on a time-available basis. Jobs submitted by 10 p.m. should
    be done by the next morning. The finished labels can then be
    picked up at the tape library.</FONT></P>

    <H4><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">JCL Considerations</FONT></H4>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mailing labels are printed using
    SYSOUT class M, at eight lines per inch with a 48-line printer
    control loop. This SYSOUT class is available only on the LOCAL
    printer. The DD statement that defines the printed mailing label
    data set must include the correct SYSOUT class and DEST Parameter,
    e.g.:</FONT></P>

    <PRE>     //LABELS  DD  SYSOUT=M,DEST=LOCAL,FCB=M</PRE>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mailing label jobs may be submitted
    from TSO.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">For the proper alignment when
    printing labels, you must include the JES2 statement</FONT></P>

    <PRE>     /*JOBPARM  LINECT=0</PRE>

    <H4><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Standard Input and Output Formats</FONT></H4>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The LABELS program that SAS PROC
    FORMS replaces used a standard input format for the label data.
    This format assumed that a four-line label would be produced
    for each name and address in the data set. The data for each
    label is stored in &quot;card-image&quot; format (80 byte records),
    with two records per label. This standard format is as follows:</FONT></P>

    <PRE>     RECORD 1: COL 1-30  = Line 1  (i.e. Name)
               COL 31-60 = Line 2  (i.e. Title or Address)
     RECORD 2: COL 1-30  = Line 3  (i.e. Address or City-State)
               COL 31-54 = Line 4  (i.e. City-State or Blank)
               COL 56-60 = Zip Code (also printed on Line 4)</PRE>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Note that this format is appropriate
    for most U.S. addresses, but is probably not well-suited for
    foreign addresses which often have different Zip Code formats
    and other special requirements.</FONT></P>
