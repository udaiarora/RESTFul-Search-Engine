      <h2><strong>Public invited to nominate media portrayals for 2004 &quot;Stupid Cupid &amp; Realistic Romance </strong>(TM) <strong> Awards"<br>
      </strong><strong><em>- Winners To Be Announced Valentine's Day Week</em></strong></h2>
      <p>Have you seen a "Stupid Cupid" or have you been watching "Realistic Romance"? </p>
      <p>Just in time for Valentine's Day 2004, America's favorite celebration of love and romance, Arizona State University researcher and media literacy advocate Mary-Lou Galician will confer her annual <strong>"Stupid Cupid &amp; Realistic RomanceT Awards for Mass Media Portrayals of Sex, Love, &amp; Romance </strong>." </p>
      <p>This year, there's a new feature: </p>
      <p>The public is invited to participate by making nominations at <a href="http://www.RealisticRomance.com/">www.RealisticRomance.com </a> , where an online nomination ballot is available. The link is at the bottom of the web page. Nominations can be made until January 23, 2004. Award winners will be selected by a panel of judges and announced on February 8, 2004. </p>
      <p>The "Stupid Cupid &amp; Realistic Romance Awards" were established by Galician, as part of her media literacy mission to help people &quot;get real about romance.&quot; The creator of <em>Realistic Romance </em>T, she is an expert on the influence of mass media portrayals on real-life relationships. Galician also is head of the media analysis and criticism program in the Walter Cronkite School at ASU. </p>
      <p>Galician insists that her work "is <em>not </em> about censorship or avoiding media. It's all about being a wise media consumer, about using the media instead of the letting media use you, and about 'getting real about romance' so you can be more successful and happier." </p>
      <p>"People in my studies with unrealistic expectations are less satisfied in their own romantic relationships," says Galician, "and many of these unrealistic expectations come from media we enjoy without fully considering how they influence us at a subconscious level." </p>
      <p>She is also the author of <em>Sex, Love, &amp; Romance in the Mass Media: Analysis &amp; Criticism of Unrealistic Portrayals &amp; Their Influence, </em>and she is completing a new book, <em>Dr. Galician's Prescriptions for Getting Real About Romance: How Mass Media Myths About Love Can Hurt You. </em></p>
      <p><strong>The 12 Stupid Cupid Awards </strong> are given to draw attention to mass media portrayals of sex, love, and romance that illustrate the 12 myths and stereotypes from Galician's <strong><em>Dr. FUN's Mass Media Love Quiz&copy; </em></strong><em></em>(also online at <a href="http://www.RealisticRomance.com/">www.RealisticRomance.com </a>). <strong></strong>The 12-item questionnaire assesses unrealistic expectations and forms the core of her book. </p>
      <p>A Stupid Cupid Award is made for each of the 12 Quiz items - portrayals that make poor models for real-life relationships. A 13th Award - the Stupidest Cupid Award - is given to the portrayal that serves as the most glaring example of an unhealthy media model. </p>
      <p><strong>The 12 Realistic Romance Awards </strong> are given to honor the much rarer and harder-to-find mass media portrayals of sex, love, &amp; romance that illustrate the 12 Prescriptions from <strong><em>Dr. Galician's Prescriptions for Getting Real About Romance </em></strong> - corresponding "antidotes" to the 12 myths and stereotypes of the Quiz. A Realistic Romance Award is made for each of the 12 Prescriptions - portrayals that show healthy relationships that make good models for real-life relationships. A 13th Award - the Realistic Romance Grand Prize - is given to the portrayal that serves as the best example of a healthy media model. </p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, Stupid Cupid nominees abound in the media," Galician explains, "but it's much more difficult to find examples of healthy models of sex, love, and romance that are entertaining and appealing." </p>
      <p>Galician's research of what she calls "The Romanticization of Love in the Mass Media" examines how mass media portrayals of sex, love, and romance affect nearly everyone - men and women, young children and seniors, singles and couples - even though we might not realize it. </p>
      <p>She notes, "It's important to take time to consider how mass media portrayals at the least reinforce - if not create - unrealistic expectations that most of us can't dismiss completely. First we have to understand where they come from. Then we must learn how to analyze and critique them and, most important, how to reframe them more constructively." </p>
      <p>"We can still enjoy the 'escape' that unrealistic romantic media portrayals offer us," Galician says, "but it's not wise to use them - or media celebrities - as models in our real lives." </p>
      <p>Her ultimate advice: "Get real!" </p>
