I said that these         universities represent the gold standard, but a gold standard of the past.         The new gold standard will be represented by the university that is inclusive,         rather than exclusive, the university that is fully committed to its community,         the university that directly engages the challenges of its cultural, socioeconomic,         and physical setting, and shapes its research initiatives with regard         to their social outcomes.</p>      <p> As we look ahead in this still new century, the world is more complex,         and we can speak with less certainty than was possible in the past. Fifty         years ago those involved in the academic enterprise enjoyed a buoyant         optimism, and the possibilities that science and technology and art were         seen to offer appeared limitless. Today we have come to suspect that the         outcome of our enterprise is not without unexpected consequences. We are         no longer unequivocal in our praise of science and technology, nor of         our own cultural paradigm&#8212;even the hegemony of reason is suspect.       </p>      <p> Yet where else but in the university is it possible to engage in such         self-reflection, even when self-assessment leads to no facile conclusion?         Where else are doubt and skepticism and uncertainty given the respect         they are owed? In this sense, little has changed since Cardinal Henry         Newman wrote in 1872: A true university is &#8220;a place where inquiry         is pushed forward, and discoveries verified and perfected, and rashness         rendered innocuous, and error exposed, by the collision of mind with mind,         and knowledge with knowledge.&#8221; </p>      <p> I believe we should strive to become a true university, not a place         for a few, but a force for many. There is much at stake. Our success affects         the fortunes of the region, but, if we are successful, if we are able         to create a true academic community in the fullest sense of the idea,         then we may prove to have more influence than we suspected. </p>      <p>But I cannot do it alone. I ask you to join me in the task of redefining         the American research university. I ask you to join me in the task of         building the premier new American university&#8212;the university that         sets the new gold standard. I ask you to join me in the task of building         Arizona State University. </p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      &nbsp;<BR> </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="61%" align="left" valign="bottom"><a href="c8.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom" class="indent"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="index.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Index</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="index.htm"><img src="images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
