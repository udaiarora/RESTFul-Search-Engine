This period usually begins on the first day and ends on the last day of the academic year and includes semester breaks and nonclass periods occurring during this employment period.<p>Regular academic-year employees are encouraged to use accumulated vacation leave during semester breaks and nonclass periods.

After six months of continuous service, a cash payment for accrued vacation is made at the classified employee&#146;s current rate of pay upon termination or change in status to a position that does not accrue vacation. Payment for vacation leave will not exceed the amount earned for one year of service, depending on length of service and FTE.<p>Probationary staff terminated during probation period are compensated for accrued vacation as part of their notice period.<p>A cash payment for accrued vacation leave is made at the service professional&#146;s or administrative employee&#146;s current rate of pay upon termination.

Employees who change status to positions that do not accrue vacation, e.g., less than 50% FTE or academic-year faculty, and who later return to positions that do accrue vacation leave, shall retain the same rate of accrual that they otherwise would have received, provided there is no break in continuous university service.<p>If the FTE status of an employee is reduced, the employee has the option of exhausting or being paid out for any hours accumulated in excess of the accrual rate for his or her new FTE status (the maximum accumulation is 1 1/2 times the annual accrual at the new FTE status) in the pay period following the change in FTE.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Staff on Paid Leave</b></font><p>Vacation leave continues to accrue for regular staff while on paid leave of not less than 50 percent time.
