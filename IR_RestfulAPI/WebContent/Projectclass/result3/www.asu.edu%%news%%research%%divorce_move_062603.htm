      <h2>          Study shows negative impact from parental move after divorce, finding
          contradicts court assumptions</h2>
      <p>A parent's move to another city after divorce may have
        a negative impact on a child, according to a new study by a team of ASU
        researchers. The findings contrast with assumptions made by some courts
        that a child's interests are best served by allowing a custodial parent
        to move and improve his or her circumstances.</p>
      <p>The findings of the study,
          by ASU Psychology Professors Sanford Braver and Bill Fabricius and
        Law Professor Ira Ellman, appear in the June issue
          of the Journal of Family Psychology, published by the American Psychological
          Association.</p>
      <p>Courts throughout the country have struggled with conflicts
          between divorced parents when the custodial parent seeks to move with
          the child to a distant
          city. While each state deals with the issue differently, the researchers
          say a recent trend, beginning with cases such as the 1996 "Burgess"
        decision by the California Supreme Court, has favored the custodial parent
        seeking
          to move. The decision said the custodial mother was entitled to move
          for whatever reason she wished, as long as the move was not expressly
          to limit the father's access.</p>
      <p>The legal conclusion was based in part on
          the assumption that the child was usually better off if the custodial
          parent was allowed to live where
          he or she wished, even if the move reduced the child's contact with
        the other parent.</p>
      <p>"There is an assumption that essentially what is good for
          the custodial parent is good for the child," says Braver. "The assumption
          in part says
          that if something improves the parent's life then it will trickle down
          to the child. Based on our results, that doesn't appear to be the case."</p>
      <p>"Relocation
          cases are difficult" Ellman says, "because often both parents have
        valid but conflicting concerns. In such cases especially, the child's
          interests are paramount, and it is therefore a particular problem if
          courts make unsupported and possibly erroneous assumptions about the
          child's interests." </p>
      <p>The researchers surveyed students in an introductory
          psychology class at ASU, asking if their parents had been divorced,
        if there had been
          any moves and a series of questions regarding the respondents' emotional
          response to the move, general life satisfaction, current health status,
          relationship to parents and perceptions of having had "a hard life."</p>
      <p>Of
          the students surveyed, 602 had divorced parents. That group was then
          broken into two subgroups - students who had either parent move after
          a divorce and those whose parents had not relocated.</p>
      <p>The results showed
          the group who had experienced a move had significantly higher negative
          impacts in general health, greater concern over parental
          financial support and more distress over the divorce. The results also
          showed the parental move group also thought their parent's had a worse
          relationship and perceived their parents to be less of a source of
        emotional support than those who had not moved. Similar negative results
        appeared
          regardless of which parent had moved.</p>
      <p>Fabricius says that while the study
          is correlational and does not claim to prove a direct connection between
          moves and the negative consequences,
          "It definitely appears to be associated with these problems." </p>
      <p>The issue
          is again before the California Supreme Court, which recently accepted
          a new case in which the father asked to court to reconsider
          the Burgess precedent.</p>
      <p>The ASU study has been cited in briefs filed with
          the court. Dates have not been set for oral arguments, but a decision
          should come sometime in the fall. </p>
      <p>"We will certainly be interested to
          see what the court does with these new findings," says Ellman.<br>
