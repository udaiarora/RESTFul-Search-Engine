        <p>Quotes re: Preservation</p>
        <p>?gI?fd like to believe that everything that we have that is important we have in paper files.?h</p>
        <p>(On storing important messages) ?gProbably save it in five places, put it in folder in email, print and put in folder, and give to [name deleted] to save. If I have it in paper it is visible to me, when they go into folders they frequently are invisible.?h</p>
        <p>(On back-up) ?gNo, I?fd kind of like it if I lost it all.?h</p>
        <p>[click again] This first sentiment is expressed rather hesitantly: "I'd like to believe that everything that we have that is important we have in paper files." Or, as another person put it, "Things that are important typically have a hard copy somewhere that gets routed through records retention." This is what I can only call wishful thinking, but I have also heard myself express those same sentiments, especially when someone calls me up and tells me they've uncovered a box full of 5 쩌" floppies and they wonder if we have any hardware that will still read them.</p>
        <p>[click] This second quote reminds me of me. I "probably save it in five places, put it in folder in email, print and put in folder, and give to someone to save. If I have it in paper it is visible to me, when they go into folders they frequently are invisible."</p>
        <p>And this last quote [click] probably reflects the wishes of more than one person who is stretched too thin and doesn't want to deal with managing their email and other electronic files. When asked, "Do you explicitly back up your messages?" this person just said "No, I'd kind of like it if I lost it all."</p>
