<i>Abstract: </i>  The incorporation of nitrogen in oxide glasses can lead to improved physical properties such as hardness and refractive index<sup>1-4</sup>; one might accordingly expect to see a further improvement in glasses containing nitrogen as the only anion. But while there are now many examples of non-oxide glasses in the halide and chalcogenide families<sup>5-8</sup>, the formation of pure nitride glasses has not hitherto been demonstrated. Here we report the formation of glasses in the system Li<sub>3</sub>N-Ca<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub>, by the rapid quenching of fused mixtures of the nitrides at high pressures. The use of high-pressure conditions prevents thermal decomposition of the nitride mixtures to gaseous nitrogen. The new nitride glasses are stable in air, have remarkably high refractive indices (1.97-2.0), hardness exceeding that of silica glass, and high glass transition temperatures ( <i>T</i><sub>g</sub> &gt; 700°C).<p>
