                  <h1>Exhibits Policy
                  </h1>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h2>Introduction and Purpose </h2>
                  <p>Exhibits reflect the scholarly, historical, social and cultural concerns of Arizona State University and its community. Their purpose is to promote interest in and use of the collections and services of the ASU Libraries and closely related organizations. Exhibits focus on topics consistent with the overall scholarly and cultural concerns of the University.</p>
                  <p>This policy applies to the common areas, such as lobbies, foyers, corridors, general traffic and study areas. Individual library departments or units are responsible for any exhibits in their own areas and will follow these general guidelines.</p>
                  <h3>I. Exhibit Goals </h3>
                  <p>In general, the ASU Libraries' exhibits program's goals are: </p>
                  <p>A. To educate, enlighten and enrich; to broaden the Libraries' appeal to the public and increase awareness and access to the collections through their display; </p>
                  <p>B. To draw users to the collections and to draw the community closer to the University; </p>
                  <p>C. To stimulate or to demonstrate pride in the collections that could lead to support.</p>
                  <p>Attainment of these goals is not easily measured. The constant flow of viewers may remain reason enough to continue this program.</p>
                  <h3>II. Library Exhibits Committee </h3>
                  <p>The Exhibits Committee is designated to work with exhibitors and will review all exhibit proposals. Exhibit proposals will be juried and the Committee may request that changes be made in the interest of aesthetics, content, preservation of materials, and general appropriateness to the Libraries and the University.</p>
                  <p>Questions or problems concerning exhibits in the common areas of Hayden and Noble Libraries should be directed to the Exhibits Committee. Should the policy need further definition or should exceptions be requested, the Dean of the University Libraries will exercise final authority regarding interpretation and/or implementation.</p>
                  <h3>III. Exhibit Guidelines </h3>
                  <p>A. <b>Focus of Exhibits</b></p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>1. Exhibits will focus on topics consistent with the overall scholarly and cultural concerns of the University and should, as a rule, be drawn from the collections of the Libraries and supplemented, as appropriate, with materials from other sources.</p>
                    <p>2. Exhibits shall not be used to promote personal, commercial or organizational positions, though topics subject to controversy may be presented, provided that they are handled in an objective manner.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>B. <b>Application and Presentation</b> </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>1. Proposal forms may be obtained from members of the Exhibits Committee and found on the web site <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/admin/forms/exhibitform.doc">http://www.asu.edu/lib/admin/forms/exhibitform.doc</a>.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>2. The proposal should try to encompass the best aesthetic and intellectual presentation possible consistent with the guidelines.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>C. <b>Preservation Guidelines</b> </p>
                  <p>The ASU Libraries has a responsibility to exhibit a broad range of library and related materials, including rare and valuable items from its special collections, for the education and pleasure of the University community. At the same time, the ASU Libraries is responsible to protect and preserve these materials. The following guidelines are intended to allow the Libraries to fulfill both responsibilities.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>1. Condition of Materials to be exhibited: a) The condition of exhibited materials directly reflects upon ASU Libraries and its curatorial responsibilities. Consequently, exhibited materials should be in good condition as ascertained by a representative of the Preservation Dept. Condition Review should be requested as soon as possible to allow the exhibitor to choose alternate materials in better condition, if necessary, or to arrange for conservation treatment prior to the exhibit. The Preservation Dept. Representative will compile a priority list for treatment based on condition, usually in consultation with the curator(s). b) Very fragile, rare, unique, or otherwise extremely vulnerable materials should not be exhibited unless special arrangements are made in consultation with the Exhibits Committee, the appropriate collections curator, and the Preservation Department. In general, original photographs should not be exhibited unless special arrangements can be made. </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>2. Environmental Standards a) Light: In general, UV radiation and intensity of visible light should be kept as low as possible. Ideally, lower limits would be a maximum of 50-75 microwatts per lumen of UV radiation and 300 lux. Light levels in exhibit areas should be determined and adjusted by filtering or a reduction in light sources if possible. If materials are to be displayed in an area where light is too intense, the exhibit should be of a proportionately shorter duration. Library materials should never be displayed in cases with internal lighting of any kind. In general, photographs should be evaluated by a representative of the Preservation Dept. for exhibit suitability as relates to lighting. b) Heat and relative humidity: Environmental conditions in exhibit areas should be monitored regularly. Temperatures should range from 65-75F and relative humidity (RH) should not fluctuate widely. Extremely hot, dry or humid conditions should be avoided and valuable materials should be removed from exhibits where dangerous levels of heat and humidity cannot be controlled. c) Air pollution: Materials should not be placed within exhibit cases that will have the effect of polluting the case micro-environment and/or that might endanger the condition of any of the materials on exhibit within the case.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>3. Manner of Exhibit a) Handling and Physical Support: Materials should be handled as little as is necessary in preparation and dismantling of exhibits. Only those trained in handling fragile or valuable materials should be allowed to assist in preparation. Physical supports should be designed and used to avoid damage and stress to fragile materials. These supports should be of acid-free materials and sufficiently strong to provide support for the duration of the exhibit. Book pages should be held open with polyester ribbons. Books should never be forced open or unnaturally restrained and positioned for display. All supports should be as visually and physically unobtrusive as possible and should be clean, well-crafted, and of uniform materials and appearance. b) Security: Materials should be protected from vandalism or accidental harm. Display cases must have secure locks and exhibits must be located in areas where they can be monitored by library staff. Use of keys for the display cases is regulated by the Exhibits Committee or designated location librarians. 4. Length of Exhibit Exhibits will usually be scheduled to run from four to six weeks, depending on the nature of the exhibit and the demands of the schedule. Materials may be continuously exhibited for longer periods with the approval of the Preservation Dept. and Exhibits Committee.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h3>Exhibitor Responsibility </h3>
                  <p>The committee representative who is assigned to an exhibit will assume full responsibility to plan and arrange for installing and dismounting the exhibit in compliance within an agreed upon time period. The originator, if outside the University Libraries system, will cover special costs incurred in mounting the exhibit, including the repair of any damage to the building or library property caused in installation or removal of the exhibit. The originator will provide suitable descriptive annotations (as per exhibit procedures).</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Exhibits should be mounted within two days of specified start dates. Failure to do so may result in forfeiture of the time and space allocated for the exhibit. Exhibits may run four to six weeks or longer with the approval of the Conservator and the Committee. Materials must be removed promptly at the close of the exhibit period. If the exhibitor cannot meet the schedule agreed upon, the Exhibits Committee should be notified immediately.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h3>Special Arrangement and Requirements</h3>
                  <p><b>Security and Insurance</b>: Loaned objects and materials are afforded the same security protection as that of all library materials, but it is recommended that the exhibit originator make arrangements to secure insurance coverage for rare or extremely valuable items. Additional security cannot be provided by the Libraries. If a specific valuation is placed on exhibited items, that dollar amount should be reported to the committee.</p>
                  <p><b>Physical Arrangements</b>:</p>
                  <p>Reasonable efforts should be made to make all exhibits accessible to everyone, with special provisions, when possible, to accommodate the disabled. An exhibit must not constitute a physical hazard or impede research or regular library use.</p>
