      <h2>Tuition increase to provide improved access, service </h2>
      <p>A tuition increase set by the Arizona Board of Regents for the 2004-05 academic year will enable ASU to continue investing in priority areas to improve undergraduate and graduate education, as well as meet critical financial aid needs. </p>
      <p>The increase is being met with mixed reaction, with some students expressing concern about being strained financially, many asking for assurance the increased revenue will benefit students, and still others taking the increase in stride. </p>
      <p>Some students responding to an e-mail message about the tuition increase from ASU President Michael Crow questioned the rationale that higher tuition translates into greater accessibility. </p>
      <p>"It's natural to think you make the university more accessible by making it cheaper," said Crow. "In reality, it is the lack of resources that affects our ability to offer financial aid." </p>
      <p>Last year's tuition increase of almost 40 percent enabled the university to increase financial aid by 140 percent, translating to full tuition or almost full tuition for nearly 10,000 students, in a state where there is virtually no state-funded financial aid for students to go to the university. Next year, the university again will hold unharmed or improve the financial situation of all resident undergraduate Pell Grant recipients with unmet need. </p>
      <p>Like this year, revenue from next year's tuition increase will be invested to improve the student experience at ASU and to increase student success. Such improvements include expanded library hours, upgraded classroom facilities, additional and more up-to-date classroom technology, better access to advising and increased availability of classes, as well as improved compensation for teaching assistants. </p>
      <p>In addition, there will be a significant investment in undergraduate student success by reducing first-year English and math class sizes and hiring additional faculty to teach those classes. An evaluation of student success factors showed students who struggle with, or fail, these first-year courses have a higher probability of dropping out, while those who do well are more likely to go on and earn a degree. </p>
      <p>Since arriving at ASU, Crow has been vocal about the need for increased investment from all revenue sources, including tuition, the state, federal grants and private donations. </p>
      <p>"The university is significantly under- funded, and will not rise to the level of world-class status without adequate funding," Crow said. "There is not a single revenue source that we can ignore, including the investment students make in their portion of the cost of higher education. </p>
      <p>"It is not our intent to price anyone out of the institution - in fact, it's quite the opposite," Crow added. "Even with our tuition increases, ASU is one of the lowest cost institutions in the nation. Still, I realize there are students who are struggling to make ends meet." </p>
      <p>Crow encourages students who may be considering dropping out for financial reasons to make an appointment with the Student Financial Assistance office. </p>
      <p>With the announced tuition increase, next year resident undergraduate students will pay $4,062 ($456 increase); non-resident undergraduate students will pay $12,917 ($804 increase); resident graduate students will pay $5,127 ($1,334 increase); and non-resident graduate students will pay $13,647 ($1,334 increase). </p>
      <p>For resident undergraduates, the tuition increase is $130 higher than the university requested. In making its decision for ASU's increase, the Regents looked at the needs of the institution, the capacity of the university to meet those needs, as well as what the other universities were doing. The Regents did not consider a proposed $80 ASU student health fee, however, some tuition revenue will be used to enhance student health services and reduce co-pay prices. </p>
      <p>The larger tuition increase for graduate students is a reflection of the higher cost of graduate education, where students often are in specialized programs, and have the highest interaction with professors. Increased revenue from tuition will help fund several initiatives of particular importance for graduate students, including increasing the number of tuition fellowships for needy and meritorious graduate students (as well as funds that may be used for medical expenses, rent, and other emergency assistance for financially needy graduate students); hiring exceptional faculty to help move ASU doctoral programs into the top quartile in National Research Council rankings; <br>
  reducing TA workload by reducing class sizes in English and mathematics classes; and increasing graduate and faculty research space. </p>
      <p>In addition, if the governor's budget recommendation for higher education holds up, ASU will implement full tuition remission for half-time teaching and research assistants. </p>
