      <h2>Lohr receives Gertrude M. Cox award for survey research</h2>
      <p>        Professor Sharon Lohr, with ASU's mathematics and statistics
        department, has been chosen as the first recipient of the newly inaugurated
        Gertrude
        M. Cox Award.</p>
      <p>Funded by the RTI (Research Triangle Institute), the award
          acknowledges mid-career statisticians who are making significant contributions
          to
          statistical practice. Lohr accepted the award at the annual dinner
        of the Washington Statistical Society June 10. </p>
      <p>Lohr says she was surprised
          and deeply honored to learn she had been selected for the award.</p>
      <p>"I am really thrilled that the awards committee
          and RTI consider my work to be having an impact on statistical practice,"
          Lohr says. "Gertrude
          Cox really was one of the greatest statisticians of the last century,
          and was equally well known for her encouragement of students to go
        into the mathematical sciences. She was one of my heroes when I was a
        student,
          and she remains so today."</p>
      <p>Lohr joined ASU in 1990 as an assistant professor,
          and since then her primary research area has been survey sampling.</p>
      <p>"I develop statistical
          methods for analyzing data from large sample surveys with complex structure,"
          she says. "I like the freedom I've had at ASU
          to work on research projects that I think are important, and feel fortunate
        that my students and I can contribute to studying these new problems."</p>
      <p>She
          says while at ASU she has had the opportunity to teach a wide variety
        of statistics courses, both applied and theoretical. </p>
      <p>"Because of the
          flexibility at ASU, and the encouragement to try new ideas, I've been
          able to develop five new courses here, including graduate
          courses in statistical consulting and sample surveys as well as an
        undergraduate course in bioinformatics." <br>
        Lohr will be on sabbatical next year, visiting Carleton University
          and Statistics Canada in the fall to work on problems of how to combine
          information
          from different surveys to obtain more accurate estimates without having
          to increase the cost of collecting data. She will also be collaborating
          with Associate Professor Doug Sylvester in the ASU College of Law on
          research about legal, ethical and statistical issues involved in maintaining
        the confidentiality of survey data. </p>
      <p>She is a member of the U.S. Census
          Advisory Committee of Professional Associations, which gives advice
        to the Census Bureau on issues such
        as whether to adjust the census. </p>
      <p>In 2004, she will chair the Survey Research
          Methods Section of the American Statistical Association and is looking
          forward to coordinating national
          activities and proposing new programs for improving research in survey
        methodology and encouraging students to enter the discipline.</p>
      <p>Gertrude
          M. Cox was born in Iowa in 1900 and enjoyed a long, productive and
        influential career as a statistician. In 1940, she began working
          as a statistics professor at North Carolina State University at Raleigh,
          founded the department of experimental statistics at North Carolina
        State University, the Institute of Statistics of the Consolidated University
          of North Carolina, and ultimately the Statistics Research Division
        of
        the Research Triangle Institute.</p>
      <p>In 1949, she became the first female
          elected into the International Statistical Institute, and served as
        president of the American Statistical Association
          in 1956. Cox remained active even after retirement, and was elected
        to the National Academy of Sciences in 1975. She died in 1978.</p>
