<h1 class="storyhead">Domestic violence study presents police officers' views</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>Law enforcement officers view domestic violence as a major issue in their communities that generates other crime and violence, according to &ldquo;Layers of Meaning: Domestic Violence and Law Enforcement Attitudes in Arizona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For most law enforcement agencies, domestic violence is one of the most common calls &ndash;and often the most common violence-related call. Based on this new statewide research, domestic violence also might be called the most frustrating call.</p>
<p>This new research from ASU&rsquo;s Morrison Institute for Public Policy presents the views and voices of more than 800 Arizona street-level officers and their supervisors from throughout the state. The study is one of the largest ever undertaken in Arizona, and even across the United States.<img src="images/MI-Cover-Icon.jpg" width="250" height="311" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right"></p>
<p>The research was done on behalf of the Governor&rsquo;s Commission to Prevent Violence Against Women, Arizona Department of Public Safety, and the Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board (Arizona POST). The 66-page report, available on the Web site (<a href="http://www.morrisoninstitute.org">www.morrisoninstitute.org</a>), combines survey data with dozens of comments from officers and supervisors.</p>
<p>Arizona, like most states, has laws and policies that bolster law enforcement officers&rsquo; arrest powers in domestic violence cases and require them to arrest suspects under certain circumstances. &ldquo;Layers of Meaning&rdquo; shows how officers feel about the &ldquo;criminalization&rdquo; of domestic violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morrison Institute&rsquo;s Layers of Meaning is a significant contribution to understanding domestic violence in Arizona,&rdquo; says Gov. Janet Napolitano. &ldquo;The report is a tool for continued dialogue on how to improve our state&rsquo;s response and efforts to prevent domestic violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s major findings include:</p>
<p>&bull; The vast majority of Arizona officers consider domestic violence to be a serious, underreported problem that generates other crime and violence and contributes to a variety of costly issues affecting families, children, neighborhoods, schools and employers.</p>
<p>&bull; Nearly all officers accept the view of domestic violence as a &ldquo;real crime&rdquo; that warrants police intervention &ndash; having shed past &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; views that considered domestic violence to be a private family matter.</p>
<p>&bull; Officers are split in the support for Arizona&rsquo;s &ldquo;pro-arrest&rdquo; policy, with many not believing that it reduces domestic violence.</p>
<p>&bull; Many officers struggle to understand domestic violence victims&rsquo; actions and attitudes, sympathizing with their plight but questioning some of their behaviors and outlooks.</p>
<p>&bull; Officers recognize the burdens faced by overworked prosecutors, yet voice frustration with what they perceive to be a lack of follow-up by prosecutors. They fear that too little prosecution lessens the impact of arrest, discourages victims, emboldens batterers and spreads cynicism among officers themselves.</p>
<p>&bull; Officers are split over whether more training is needed, although the study&rsquo;s findings suggest that needs do exist in several areas.</p>
<p>&bull; Frustration for officers comes from a variety of factors, including the high number of repeat calls; the infrequency with which victims prosecute or leave the abusive relationship; and the perceived lack of effective follow-up by the entire criminal justice system.</p>
<p>These findings show that the years of effort to promote recognition of domestic violence as a serious criminal matter have paid off. At the same time, however, officers&rsquo; frustration leaves many resigned to the conclusion that intervening at a domestic violence scene will at best protect the victim for simply that one night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arizona POST participated in the &lsquo;Layers of Meaning&rsquo; project in the hope of gaining a more complete understanding of this important area of police response,&rdquo; says Tom Hammarstrom, executive director of Arizona POST. &ldquo;The information contained in this report is a valuable asset we will use in designing law enforcement training programs, which in turn will enable Arizona peace officers to provide the best possible response in domestic violence situations. We are very pleased with the quality of the survey and thank all of the &lsquo;Layers of Meaning&rsquo; partners, particularly the Morrison Institute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s law enforcement officers take domestic violence seriously and are witnesses to its devastating effects on families and neighborhoods. They recognize that domestic violence is a problem that makes other community issues worse, and they want to do their part. But officers also feel themselves caught between a number of conflicting forces and isolated in their efforts.</p>
<p>As one detective put it: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do it alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As domestic violence incidents continue to increase in Arizona, it is important to understand the dynamics involved for not only the domestic violence victim, but for the law enforcement officer responding to what can be a very dangerous call,&rdquo; says Arizona Department of Public Safety Director Roger Vanderpool. &ldquo;The results of Morrison Institute&rsquo;s &lsquo;Layers of Meaning&rsquo; report are enlightening and will help with training the criminal justice community, and other interested parties, to ensure that victims of domestic violence can achieve healing, justice and safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Layers of Meaning&rsquo;s&rdquo; findings suggest some vital next steps in Arizona&rsquo;s efforts to reduce and prevent domestic violence, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Promote domestic violence training for officers.</p>
<p>&bull; Strengthen community efforts to prevent domestic violence.</p>
<p>&bull; Strengthen Arizona&rsquo;s criminal justice response to domestic violence.</p>
<p>&bull; Map key domestic violence decision points.</p>
<p>&bull; Review how prosecution functions as part of the overall system.</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s police officers and sheriff&rsquo;s deputies form the state&rsquo;s front line in responding to and reducing domestic violence. But community institutions, criminal justice institutions, residents and policy makers have important parts to play, too. All Arizonans can help ensure that &ldquo;first responder&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;only responder.&rdquo;</p>
