Crow<br>                        </strong><strong>A comprehensive metropolitan research university </strong></p>                        <p>Consistent with the &ldquo;Changing Directions&rdquo; policy                          directive of the Arizona Board of Regents, ASU has                          embarked on a path of building an institution that                          I would term a &ldquo;comprehensive metropolitan research                          university.&rdquo; &nbsp; The                          concept designates a particular institutional form&ndash;other                          types of universities include land grant universities,                          state colleges, and, in a narrower sense, polytechnics.                          Here at ASU we are building a comprehensive metropolitan                          research university, hopefully with some of the intellectual                          and spiritual dimension that I have outlined in the                          New American University policy paper.  Such an                          institution has the potential, I think, to encompass                          the aspirations of our academic community.  But                          at the end of the day, what does that make us? </p>                        <p>The term &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; refers to the fact                          that we are free to engage all subjects that we deem                          appropriate&ndash;meaning                          we are not a narrowly focused institution.  &ldquo;Comprehensive&rdquo;                          means we build from a core in the liberal arts and                          sciences, a core of traditional linkages with traditional                          academic programs.  We cover a broad spectrum                          of human knowledge, and we, the members of the faculty,                          determine what we deem &ldquo;comprehensive.&rdquo; </p>                        <p>&ldquo;Metropolitan&rdquo; refers to the fact that we are                          focused in the heart of an emerging city.  As                          a function of being located at the heart of that emerging                          city, the success of the metropolitan area and, subsequently,                          the entire region is tied to our success.  It                          means that we have a metropolitan focus, and that as                          great cities around the world have great universities,                          let this university be the great university for this                          city as it emerges. </p>                        <p>&ldquo;Research&rdquo; refers to just that&ndash;we are a band                          of teachers who are also discoverers and creators.  We                          distinguish ourselves from the thousands and thousands                          of academic institutions that do not have the capacity                          or the privilege to do research and scholarship.  As                          it happens, just last week ASU appeared in a study                          coming out of China ranking the top 500 institutions                          of higher education worldwide, and we ended up ranking                          150th on that list of 500.  Now, we do not know                          what criteria were used to determine their ranking,                          but if someone had asked me where we would be on a                          list of the 500 leading universities in the world,                          I would have placed us somewhere around 200.  But                          in any case we are one of the very limited number of                          institutions on the planet with the capacity not just                          to teach, but to create and to discover, and that research                          component of our institutional design is absolutely                          essential. </p>                        <p>Lastly, the final term in the concept &ldquo;comprehensive                          metropolitan research university&rdquo; is &ldquo;university&rdquo;                          itself.  At                          the end of the day, in spite of the forces that surround                          us&ndash;some of whom believe that ASU should be little more                          than a college&ndash;we are a university, and a university                          has a comprehensive mission.  We will teach at                          all levels, and we will teach at the levels that <em>we </em> deem                          to be important.  And we will produce graduates                          at all levels of academic accomplishment. </p>                        <p>From a practical perspective, I believe we can fill                          an important niche as a comprehensive metropolitan                          research university.  The University of Arizona                          occupies the niche of traditional land grant research                          university, with all that is implied in that tradition.  And                          NAU is an institution with a focus on undergraduate                          programs, with limited graduate programs.  The                          articulation, then, of these three distinct pathways                          within the system gives us immense opportunity.  We                          have an opportunity, I think, for the first time in                          this university's history to break free of the perception                          that the system still comprises one university and                          two state colleges.  It will now emerge as three                          universities&ndash;each distinct, and each on a different                          trajectory. </p>                        <p>Why are we building this comprehensive metropolitan                          research university? &nbsp; There are already peer                          institutions, such as UCLA, the University of London,                          and others that embrace their metropolitan areas.  Then                          why are we building this? &nbsp; Whether we like it                          or not, metropolitan Phoenix is continuing to grow,                          and it will continue to grow by every outside indication.  Phoenix                          itself is now the fifth largest city in the United                          States, having surpassed Philadelphia.  In the                          next eight to ten years it will surpass Houston to                          become the fourth largest city in the United States.  And                          this metropolitan area is already among the 20 largest                          metropolitan areas in the nation, and will soon be                          among the eight largest.  That will make this                          place one of the largest cities in North America, and                          one of the key cities on the planet. </p>                        <p>I cannot imagine a major metropolitan region without                          a competitive, world-class, comprehensive university                          focused on teaching and research.  I can name                          cities that have such an institution and others that                          do not, and there is a vast difference between them.  So                          it is our responsibility to build this university as                          this city emerges, and to use this university to help                          the city emerge as successfully as possible.  I                          consider the emergence of the university on the correct                          path&ndash;subject to definition, subject to interpretation,                          subject to engagement&ndash;an essential ingredient to the                          ultimate success of this region.  If you look                          around the planet you will see that urban success is                          seldom achieved.  There are very few large cities                          that one would call successful at the moment.  So                          there is much to be done and much to be learned, and                          we have an important role. </p>                        <p><strong>A school-centric model </strong></p>                        <p>How are we going to move from here to there? &nbsp; You                          may have heard me use the phrase &ldquo;one university in                          many places.&rdquo;&nbsp; This has become something                          of a mantra for me, but what do I mean by it? &nbsp; At                          the end of the day, if at all possible, we must structure                          the university without hierarchy&ndash;that is, we must have                          overall excellence in our academic units regardless                          of campus.  In order to achieve our objectives                          we must have a university that is structured around                          outstanding schools.  And we need a university                          in which each school stands on its own.  I am                          using the term &ldquo;schools&rdquo; to designate academic                          units&ndash;there can be colleges with schools, schools with                          schools, schools on their own. A school is a unit of                          intellectual connectivity between faculty and students                          organized around a theme or objective.  And I                          am proposing a <em>school-centric </em> model for the                          university.  </p>                        <p>Our schools will be spread out on a range of campuses                          and each school will compete for status, not with other                          schools within the university, but with other schools                          like it around the country and around the world.  Each                          school will have an opportunity to gain its own competitive                          status within its own sphere.  And schools within                          the university will have the opportunity to complement                          each other, and work with each other, and leverage                          from each other, and build from each other.  The                          School of Technology at Arizona State University on                          the East Campus, for example, will be a great school                          of technology, linked to a great school of engineering                          on the main campus, and will have programs with students                          appropriately placed ensuring mechanisms for maximum                          success. </p>                        <p>The key here is devolving intellectual authority and                          entrepreneurialism to the level of the school.  You                          cannot drive the university from where I sit.  What                          I can do is help create the environment, help acquire                          the resources, help to protect and defend the university                          from its most strategic empowered enemies or ally with                          our most strategic empowered friends.  But the                          university really has to advance through small groups                          of faculty working with students to advance their intellectual                          agenda and to become competitive in those areas that                          they feel is the right intellectual space for them                          to move in.  And so each school in this school-centric                          model for the university becomes driven by its own                          intrinsic requirements, and each school is uniquely                          designed, with the caveat that it must cooperate and                          link with other elements within the university.  </p>                        <p>Another thing we need to do at this university is                          move past the campus-based model.  This is not                          a university where the main campus is the flagship                          and the other campuses are marginal set-asides or castoffs,                          or whatever the pathway has been in the past.  At                          the end of the day, we must build one university where                          academic quality is uniformly high, and faculty, staff,                          and students are all treated fairly, equally, and justly.  And                          people are free to advance their creativity, and the                          merit associated with their work is recognized.  We                          need to get over this notion of campuses and focus                          on schools.  </p>                        <p>Where are we on this path of building a school-centric                          model for the university? &nbsp; We are making progress                          but there is still much to do.  I think we have                          a very solid organizational and academic foundation,                          an excellent faculty and staff becoming stronger each                          year, and I think we have good students.  I also                          think we have the capacity to attract and retain even                          better students.  But we have to focus on the                          design of our schools.  If the schools become                          the fighting units by which the university advances,                          each school advancing on its own, we need the dreams                          and aspirations and hopes of each of those schools                          to be articulated.  We need those designs and                          conceptualizations.  Each of those schools, and                          each of those deans, and each of those faculties, need                          to embrace the enterprise model.  </p>                        <p><strong>We are responsible for our own destiny </strong></p>                        <p>It is essential that we embrace the enterprise model                          in order for this university to be successful.  We                          are responsible for our own destiny.  I will                          say this over and over again until the day they drag                          me out of here.  No legislature, no body, no                          external group can make this university successful.  That                          fundamental fact, in my opinion, is what separates                          good universities from great universities.  The                          great universities are in charge of their own destinies                          and they know it.  And they advance their ideas                          to everyone who will listen to them to acquire the                          resources necessary to implement their ideas.  </p>                        <p>And that, by the way, is not the corporate model of                          the university.  The enterprise model means that                          each school, each department, each program asserts,                          &ldquo;This is what we want to be, this is our aspiration,                          and this is what we need to do to get there.&rdquo;&nbsp; The                          trajectory for success may require more students, it                          may mean charging more tuition, writing more proposals,                          bringing in more donors, building alliances with other                          universities.  Any school that is stuck in the                          mud is stuck in the mud because it got itself stuck                          in the mud.  But if one focuses on the enterprise                          conceptualization, there is always opportunity to move                          past that status.  </p>                        <p>We need to understand that, as a university, our work                          is far from accomplished.  For whatever set of                          reasons, there is a high level of comfort at this institution.  I                          think one can only feel comfortable after one has achieved                          immense amounts of greatness&ndash;for periods not to exceed                          two or three days.  We have not yet achieved                          those periods of greatness that give us those two or                          three days of rest.  We have much to do, and                          much ground to cover.  And then, upon realizing                          our achievements, we have much responsibility.  This                          notion of feeling comfortable, or feeling relaxed,                          or feeling good about where we are&ndash;I can explain this                          to you in terms of the laws of social inertia: &nbsp; everything                          returns to a state of things that is not very good                          without as much forward momentum as possible.  We                          need more forward momentum.  But more than anything                          we need to understand that we are still building a                          university from the ground up.  </p>                        <p>I do not deny that we are making significant progress.  Through                          an expansion of the commitment of our primary investor,                          the state of Arizona, we have expanded our budget,                          albeit on a limited basis.  That is to say, we                          are not being cut at the moment; we are receiving slight                          additional investment from the state.  We are                          expanding our private investment, and student investment                          through tuition.  And, while our appetite for                          additional resources for new accomplishments is considerable,                          we have secured sufficient new resources to be able                          to offer salary adjustments for meritorious employees                          this year.  That did not happen at NAU, the University                          of Arizona, the University of California, or Cal State                          or Stanford or MIT.  But it happened here because                          we have been navigating this period in the university's                          history by acquiring resources to help us advance our                          agenda.  Now, it is still tight and it is still                          complicated, but we have good academic and financial                          leadership in place, and we are working our way through                          this process to help the university acquire the resources                          that it needs. </p>                        <p>We have initiated a dramatic expansion of our planning.  We                          are expanding the ability to run the university as                          a university, rather than as an amalgamation of fiefdoms                          with separate rules and procedures, all of which consume                          immense amounts of unnecessary time and energy.  We                          have expanded our research enterprise, and it is continuing                          to grow quite well.  We are reaffirming the conception                          that this is a national public university, and making                          certain that our promotion and tenure requirements                          match those of peer institutions. There is no change                          in our standards, only the effort to ensure that they                          are implemented according to our objectives.  </p>                        <p>Unlike our peer institutions, we remain overly dependent                          on the people of the state of Arizona for our funding.  Of                          the highest performing public universities in the United                          States, there is not one of them that receives more                          than 20 percent of its funding from their state.  We                          remain in excess of 30 percent.  Now, that does                          not mean we are not going to be fighting for more money                          from the state&ndash;we have been and will continue to do                          so.  I believe that we are underfunded from the                          state by approximately $150 million per year, and we                          are working on strategies to bring about a correction                          of that underinvestment.  But even with an additional                          $150 million in core support, it would be insufficient                          to project the university to the scale and scope and                          level of performance necessary to impact this metropolitan                          area.  That level of additional support would                          help us to make appropriate faculty salary adjustments,                          to expand the faculty, and to improve the front line                          activities related to teaching.  </p>                        <p>But our mission goes beyond that.  One of the                          things we all need to do&ndash;faculty, chairs, deans, provosts,                          everyone associated with ASU&ndash;is think through how we're                          going to empower and incentivize the faculty and staff                          and others to work at these high levels of performance.  That                          is not to suggest that people are not already working                          at 110 percent of maximum effort.  But our objective                          is to find a way to continue to advance the university                          from its successful attainment of the status of &ldquo;good&rdquo;                          to the yet to be attained status of &ldquo;great.&rdquo; &nbsp; And                          you will see me focus as much energy as I can bring                          to bear&ndash;my time, my energy, my spirit, and my intellect&ndash;to                          that task.  What drives me is the notion that                          metropolitan Phoenix and, ultimately, Arizona can,                          as a result of what we do, end up being better than                          Cleveland or Pittsburgh or Chicago, or other cities,                          all of which are great cities in their own right, but                          none of which have really achieved a linkage with the                          intellectual heart that the university represents. </p>                        <p><strong>Investing in the future </strong></p>                        <p>Before I close, let me say something about a few more                          practical matters.  As we discussed at our meeting                          in the fall, we are in the thick of Campaign '05.                           Unlike universities in Texas, California, Oregon, Washington,                          Utah, Colorado&ndash;all the states west of the Mississippi&ndash;we                          secured no budget cuts from the governor.  In                          fact, we secured two very important commitments from                          the governor in her budget recommendation: &nbsp; a                          $23 million increase to our base funding, and a commitment                          to fully fund our enrollment growth each subsequent                          fiscal year following the current year.  This                          is disappointing in some ways, because it is slightly                          less than half of what we had requested.  But                          we are developing a strong base of support for this                          institution.  We are making progress at getting                          people to understand that this university is a meritorious                          investment, and that investing in it will net returns                          for the economy and social infrastructure of Arizona. </p>                        <p>Last year, as you may recall, the Board of Regents                          passed a policy to raise tuition and fees for in-state                          undergraduates to a level that places us 33rd among                          state universities.  Prior to this increase our                          tuition level was close to 50th nationally.  Our                          tuition was increased 40 percent last year and that                          took us from close to 50th to 42nd.  We need                          the resources to accomplish our mission, and our mission                          includes open, accessible, university schools with                          financial aid for as many students as we can possibly                          put on the table.  With revenue from last year's                          tuition increase, we increased our share of financial                          aid by 140 percent in a single year.  And we                          will continue to increase financial aid.  We                          will continue to advance the institution by securing                          the resources we need to be able to make the kinds                          of investments that we need to maintain access to the                          university and to maintain its quality. </p>                        <p>We are in the early stages of launching a development                          campaign with the objective of raising more than $1                          billion for the university.  We have launched                          six or seven experimental proposals within the last                          18 months, and several of these have already been funded.  Several                          more are presently under consideration by donors.  And,                          in the last few weeks, we have been organizing approximately                          thirty additional proposals, and some of you have been                          invited to an upcoming meeting to launch those proposals.  But                          these do not comprise the entire campaign.  Those                          thirty proposals are mechanisms to learn how to write                          idea-driven proposals for major private sector investment                          in the university.  And following that process,                          we will launch the campaign from the bottom up with                          the deans and chairs, according to the needs and interests                          and desires and ideas of the faculty themselves.  So,                          we are undertaking a three-stage process: &nbsp; learning                          through experiments, launching prototype proposals,                          and, ultimately, launching the overall campaign.  Launching                          the campaign is not easy because the university is                          not organized to fund a campaign.  If you want                          to raise a billion or a billion and a half dollars,                          it costs between $160 and $200 million to raise that                          much money.  And we do not happen to have that                          $160 to $200 million.  So we have to think seriously                          about how to raise that money. </p>                        <p>All in all, we start this semester, I believe, moving                          forward.  Our resources are expanding and our                          political support is expanding.  Good faculty                          and good students are joining us.  I think the                          university is moving in a positive direction, and I                          believe that this semester has every likelihood of                          being one in which continuing good things will happen                          for the university. </p>                        <p>&nbsp;</p></td>                      <td width="10" align="center" valign="top">&nbsp;                       </td>                    </tr>                  </table>                                 </TD>              </TR>                                      <TR align="right" valign="middle">                 <TD colspan="3" align="center">                                 [an error occurred while processing this directive]                                </TD></TR>                          </TABLE>                      </TD></TR>        </TABLE>  </BODY></HTML>
