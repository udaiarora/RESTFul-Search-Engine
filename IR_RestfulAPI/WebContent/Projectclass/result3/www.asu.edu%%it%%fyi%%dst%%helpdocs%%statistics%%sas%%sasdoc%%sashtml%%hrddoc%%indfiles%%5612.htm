This book shows how the SAS System performs multivariate time series       analysis and features the advanced SAS procedures STATESPACE, ARIMA, and
SPECTRA. The interrelationship of SAS/ETS procedures is demonstrated with  an accompanying discussion of how the choice of a procedure depends on the
data to be analyzed and results desired. Using this book you will learn to model and forecast simple autoregressive (AR) processes using PROC ARIMA
and use the STATESPACE procedure and the AR model to do state space        modeling. Other topics covered include detecting sinusoidal components in
time series models and performing bivariate cross-spectral analysis and    comparing the results with the standard transfer function methodology.
