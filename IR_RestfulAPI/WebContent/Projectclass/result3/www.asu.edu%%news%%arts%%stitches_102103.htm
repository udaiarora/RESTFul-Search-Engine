      <h2>'Stitches' help express feelings, experiences</h2>
      <p>        Women across the globe express their feelings about violence and war
          through their domestic arts. A new exhibit at ASU's Museum of Anthropology,
          "Stitches of War," highlights their work depicting bombings, invasions
        and assaults using various textiles. </p>
      <p>"For millennia, women have spun,
            woven, beaded and sewn - all activities compatible with child-rearing
            and food preparation - while men devoted
          their efforts to hunting and warfare," says Deborah Boyer. "But women,
          too, are impacted by violence and war, and they often express their
        feelings through their handiwork."</p>
      <p>Boyer, a doctoral student in art history, curated
          the exhibit, with art graduate student Boyue Yau Tipp, based on a paper
          that she wrote in 2001
          for a seminar titled "Art as Evidence."</p>
      <p>"I've read a lot about war and
          art," Boyer says, "but usually what was written was about men and war,
          such as in the paintings of Picasso and
          Goya."<br>
        In her own home, of all places, she discovered a linkage between women's
          art and war. </p>
      <p>"We own some Afghan war rugs and Hmong textiles," Boyer
          says, "and I began to think. The majority of women throughout the world
          use textiles,
          so I started looking for textiles that express violence, and found
        more examples. It became a quest."</p>
      <p>Boyer searched for new and old examples
          - and found some in such unlikely places as a quilt show at ASU West,
          where she found quilts by Nelly Ricard-Lopez
          and Evelyn Link. Many pieces came from ASU faculty, and one MFA student
          loaned a skirt she had printed with green toy soldiers on a camouflage
          background. </p>
      <p>The 57 pieces in the exhibit include embroidered Hmong storycloths,
          American quilts, a sweater and vest, Afghan war rugs, Navajo beadwork,
          contemporary
          textiles, Latin American dolls, Wounaan/Emberra baskets and South American
          aprilleras.</p>
      <p>Hmong women created the storycloths to document their way
          of life in Southeast Asia, the impact of the Vietnam War on them and
          their search
          for recognition as refugees.</p>
      <p>The Afghan rugs that feature the weapons
          of war - AK-347 assault rifles, Hind helicopters, tanks and grenades
          - were woven during the Soviet occupation
          of Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>The sweater and vest, which were knitted during World
          War I and World War II, are displayed with pattern books that urged
        women to "knit for
          victory."</p>
      <p>Women in Chiapas, Mexico, made the soldier dolls and dressed
          them in black to look like the Zapista Army of National Liberation
        and sold them
          to tourists to raise awareness of their cause and support themselves.</p>
      <p>And
        appliqu&eacute;d wall hangings by women in Chile and Peru - called
        arpilleras - depict the arrest and disappearance of loved ones during
        the unrest of the 1980s.</p>
      <p>Textiles by ASU fine arts graduate Susan Davis
          George make a statement about the Vietnam war. In one piece, George
        combined remnants of her
          husband's fatigues from Vietnam with pieces of a flag-themed fabric,
          which she aged by burying it in her yard for several years. </p>
      <p>Navajo weavers
          responded to Sept. 11, 2001, by making beaded necklaces and bracelets
          with red, white and blue themes and tiny American flags.</p>
      <p>"Women
          are impacted by war," Boyer said. "These textiles have enabled women
          to organize chaotic events into manageable segments, and to survive,
          both economically and emotionally, the ordeals they have endured as
        the result of warfare.</p>
      <p>"Many of these textiles have become public symbols
          of resilience, resistance and survival, providing economic assistance
          to women striving to have
          their stories told."</p>
      <p>The exhibit runs through May 28. The Anthropology
          Museum, in the Anthropology Building, is open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
          Monday through Friday.</p>
