      <h2>Flake carries lessons learned at ASU through life, state politics</h2>
      <p><img src="campus_images/flake_091903.jpg" alt="Jake Flake and ASU President Michael Crow" width="288" height="387" align="right">        Arizona Speaker of the House Franklin "Jake" Flake has been a determined
          advocate for ASU for nearly 50 years. </p>
      <p>Flake first realized political
            success when, as a young college student, he joined an effort that,
            literally, made ASU the university it is today. </p>
      <p>While attending what was then the Arizona State College in the late
        1950s, the young, fourth generation cattle rancher from Snowflake, Ariz.,
        rallied
          fellow students and worked to get university status for his college.</p>
      <p>"It
          was my first political endeavor," Flake says. "We went out, had people
          sign petitions and spoke in front of the Board of Regents for our cause.
          It was exciting to see we were bringing about change. We worked hard
          and were finally able to get university status."</p>
      <p>When Flake graduated
          with a bachelor's degree in agriculture in 1960, he took pride when
        receiving his degree, which read Arizona State "University."</p>
      <p>After graduation,
          Flake returned to his family's ranch in Snowflake, which left some
        wondering "what was the point of college?"</p>
      <p>Flake says
          the answer to that question has always been easy.</p>
      <p>"My time
          at ASU may have been the best four years of my life," he says. </p>
      <p>"While there, I opened my mind to all of the possibilities. I was introduced
          to new cutting edge ideas in genetics and nutrition, that I could bring
          back to the ranch."<br>
        Flake also carried the lessons he learned while at ASU as he entered
          the world of state politics.</p>
      <p>"No matter what the issue, it is good to
          remember that there are always new and better ways of doing what you
          want to do," he says. "My time
          at ASU is what instilled this in me."</p>
      <p>Flake admits state lawmakers still
          have some challenging budgetary decisions ahead, but says he is confident
          the outlook is bright for the state and
          for ASU. </p>
      <p>This past spring Flake was instrumental in the passage of House
          Bill 2529, a bipartisan effort to stimulate the state economy by funding
          more
          than $400 million in high-tech research infrastructure construction
        at ASU, the University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University.</p>
      <p>"I am
          a strong advocate for investing in our universities," he says. "I strongly
          believe in the infrastructure bill, and feel it is already
          bearing fruit."</p>
      <p>Flake says he will support legislation calling for additional
          state funding for university enrollment growth.</p>
      <p>"I think we have to find a way to get
          the enrollment growth money back to universities," Flake says. "Especially
          for ASU where there is so much
          growth. I really want to work with President Crow and the other university
          presidents to work out this issue."</p>
      <p>Flake says he is looking forward to
          working with Crow on a variety of university endeavors.</p>
      <p>"I have known ASU presidents all the way back to
          Grady Gammage," Flake says. "And I am very taken with Michael Crow.
        He is dynamic and exciting,
          and he has a wonderful vision for the future - a vision I'd like to
        help with."</p>
      <p>Through the years, Flake and his wife Mary Louise have encouraged
          their 13 children to enrich their lives by attending college. Several
          have
          attended ASU, including their youngest child, Kayla Flake who is currently
          an ASU student studying nursing.<br>
        Flake says he is proud of his children, grateful for the role ASU is
          playing in the state's future and very pleased to call himself an ASU
          graduate.</p>
      <p>"I believe it is important to make a success of whatever you
          do," Flake says. "I am so thankful for what I learned at ASU."</p>
