    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">I. Why plan your transition</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Any move to a new environment
    can seem overwhelming without a roadmap to guide you. It is important
    to identify where you will be computing and how you will get
    there. The goal of creating this plan is to clarify what steps
    are needed and reduce your anxiety about the move. It also offers
    a means to chart your progress.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">II. What to consider in planning your
    personal transition plan</FONT></B></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Inventory your computing needs.</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You need to determine what platform(s)
    to which you will transition your computing work. The choice
    of platform(s) is dependent on what software you are using and
    the type of computing you do.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Create a list of the software
    applications that you use. <A HREF="appendixiv.html">Appendix
    IV</A> is a software cross reference which lists where various
    applications can be found. The table below contains the available
    hardware options and a brief description of each environment.
    With this information, you can determine what your replacement
    system choices are.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Transition Platform Options
    (list)</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Research cluster<BR>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Your own personal UNIX workstation,

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Departmental computers and servers</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-2" FACE="Arial">(*) This option will require
    independent funding.</FONT></B></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Choosing the system to transition
    to</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You may find that your software
    can be found on more than one platform. The choice usually will
    be between PC/Mac sites, personal workstations (PC, Mac, or UNIX
    workstations) and IT central servers (MVS and UNIX). The following
    considerations can be used to choose a platform.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">One consideration is easy. If
    you do not have the funding to either purchase a personal workstation
    or, if necessary, upgrade your current machine, then either the
    PC/Mac sites or IT central servers will be the choice.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Do you use large datasets? Do
    you have large memory requirements? The IT central servers will
    be the best choice if either (1) your datasets will not fit on
    the hard drive associated with a PC/Mac in a site or your personal
    workstation or (ii) your programs will not fit in the available
    local memory of a PC/Mac in a site or your personal workstation.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Do you have long running jobs
    or a large number of small jobs? If so, you may need a system
    with greater performance capabilities than a PC/Mac.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Keep in mind that if you choose
    to acquire your own system to transition your work to, you will
    be responsible for the administration of the machine. This can
    be a formidable task f or the inexperienced user, especially
    for a UNIX workstation.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">III. How to create your own personal
    transition plan document</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Now that you have considered
    your options, and selected the platform(s) you will transition
    to, it is time to prepare your own personal plan, formalizing
    the major steps required for your transition. This section outlines
    the steps needed for most transitions.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">These are some of the essential
    steps required to move to a new computer system regardless of
    the level of computer experience. The following is a generic
    list of steps you may want to consider and include in your personal
    transition plan. You may find some of the steps are more involved
    than others. You may have additional requirements that have not
    been listed.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Locating where to find (topic
    specific) help</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A crucial step, yet one which
    is often ignored, is establishing a list computing assistance
    resources. Knowing who to contact or where to go for specialized
    help could same you valuable time and minimize your frustration
    caused by system problems.</FONT></P>

    <P><U><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Locating existing information
    sources</FONT></U></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Another important step is identifying
    what information resources exist for your specific needs. The
    previous step answers the question &quot;who do you contact if
    your computer hangs up?&quot; compared to this step which answers
    questions like &quot;how do I get my application to do XYZ?&quot;.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Acquiring system access</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Acquiring system access may be
    as simple as requesting a computer account on one or more of
    the IT central servers, or may be as complex as purchasing a
    system of your own and setting it up to run your specific applications.
    For example, if you select to purchase your own computer system
    it is very likely you will need to have an ethernet connection
    installed in order for your machine to communicate with other
    machines.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Logging in and out</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On some systems logging on/off
    may be as simple as turning a machine on/off. Others have specific
    &quot;commands&quot; for logging off the system. To logoff UNIX
    systems, you must type &quot;exit&quot;; for MVS systems, you
    must type &quot;logoff&quot;. It is important to know the specific
    requirements for getting on and off of a new system. Terminal
    and windowing environments can also add to the complexity of
    making a new computer system usable.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Transferring files</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Your files exist on one of the
    legacy systems, you will need to transfer them to the platform
    that you will continue your work on. The ftp command is the way
    to transfer these files but these files need to be in a transferable
    format. See the appendices for system dependent file types and,
    if necessary, how to convert these files to a transferable format.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Editing files</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">To make full use of a new computer
    system, you will have to use an editor. You will need to know
    how to edit an existing file and how to create new files.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Manipulating files</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In addition to editing files,
    you will need to become familiar with the file naming conventions
    and filesystem structure on the new system. You will need to
    know how to copy, rename and delete files.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Executing programs and applications</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The software that you will be
    using on the new platform will probably be invoked differently
    than what you are used to doing on the legacy system. Documentation
    and consulting concerning how to execute your applications on
    the new system are available.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Printing and plotting</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">How will you obtain your hardcopy
    results in the new environment? You will need to explore your
    options on how to obtain hardcopy output.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Once you have identified the
    steps necessary to complete your transition, you can begin creating
    your personal transition plan.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mapping Progress</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">On a separate piece of paper,
    create a list of the steps required to complete the transition.
    List each step (task) in a concise descriptive manner and estimate
    the number of weeks it will take to complete the step. When all
    the steps are identified, number the steps in the sequence in
    which they will be carried out, and then include a starting date
    for each step.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You now have a map of your transition.
    For every week of your transition you can easily find what step
    or steps you are involved in and for every step you will know
    at what week of your transition you will be doing this task.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We hope this guide will assist
    you by making your transition a smooth one.</FONT></TD>
