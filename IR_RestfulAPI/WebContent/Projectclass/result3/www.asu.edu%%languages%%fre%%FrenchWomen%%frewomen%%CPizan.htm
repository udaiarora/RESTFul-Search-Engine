<h1>CHRISTINE DE PIZAN</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Christine de Pisan was born in Venice ca. 1364. Her father,
Tomasso de Pizzano, a famous physician and astrologer, was invited to the court
of King Charles V of France when Christine was five years old. She remained in France
all her life. She received an excellent education. She spoke French and
Italian, and possibly Latin as well. In 1380, when she was about fifteen,
Christine married Etienne du Castel, a court secretary. The marriage was
exceptionally happy. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, King Charles V died that same year, and Tomasso's favorite
status at the court, as well as much of his income, was reduced by the new
king. Etienne's income was reduced at the same time, and the family found
itself in more difficult circumstances. Soon Tomasso died after a prolonged
illness and in 1390, Etienne, too, died suddenly. Christine was left a widow at
the age of twenty-five with three small children, her mother and a niece to
support. The small amount of money left to her by Etienne was the subject of
dispute, and Christine was involved in a series of lawsuits in an attempt to
recover it. </p>

<p>She decided to earn her income as a writer. Her poems, songs and ballads
were well-received and soon she was able to support her family. Christine de
Pisan became popular and her work was later supported by many lords and ladies
of medieval Europe, including Berry, Brabant and Limburg,the Dukes of Burgundy,
King Charles VI, and his wife Queen Isabella of Bavaria. Much of her work
contains a great deal of autobiographical information, which was unusual for
writers of that time. Some of her works are: <i>The Changes of Fortune</i>, a
long poem containing examples from her life and of other famous people, <i>The
Epistles of Othea</i>, a collection of ninety-nine allegorical tales, and <i>The
Road of Long Study</i>. In 1404, she was commissioned by the duke of Burgundy,
Philip the Bold, to write a biography of his deceased brother, King Charles V.
She wrote a very flattering first-hand account of the king and his court in <i>The
Book of the Deeds and Good Manners of the Wise King Charles V</i>. </p>

<p>An autobiographical <i>Vision of Christine</i> was written in 1405. This
volume was written partly to silence her critics in a somewhat heated literary
debate on the subject of women. She followed this up with <i>The Book of the
City of the Ladies</i> in 1405, a collection of stories about heroines of the
past, and <i>The Treasure of the City of Ladies : Or the Book of the Three
Virtues</i> in 1406. </p>

<p>Christine de Pisan was very devoted to France and was horrified by the civil
strife that erupted after the assassination of Louis of Orleans. In 1410, she
wrote <i>Lamentations on the Civil War</i>, and then <i>The Book of Feats of
Arms and Chivalry</i>, which was one of the first books to be translated later
into English. She was devastated by the hostilities with England and the
Hundred Years' War and, in 1418, she retired to live in a convent. Encouraged
by the early successes of Joan of Arc, she dedicated her last known poem <i>Hymn
to Joan of Arc</i> to Joan in 1429. Christine de Pisan died ca.1430. </p>
