      <h2>Construction projects building toward university's future </h2>
      <p>As the university builds its national and local reputation as a destination for quality education, research, science and culture, its building infrastructure is growing rapidly to meet the needs of its faculty and students. </p>
      <p>There are currently several major construction projects under way, and even more that are in the planning stages. </p>
      <p>Here is a look at the progress of some of the more notable construction projects. </p>
      <p><strong>. The Biodesign Institute at ASU, Building A </strong> - Located at McAllister Avenue and Terrace Roads, the research intensive facility funded by ASU and by funds from the voter-approved proposition 301, should be completed in September. Crews are putting the finishing touches on the interior, with painting, casework and laboratory equipment installation. The 170,000 gross-square-foot building will provide lab and office space for cutting-edge research in areas such as neural rehabilitation, genomics, molecular biophysics, neutraceuticals and edible vaccines, and nano-scale bio-optics and bioscience. </p>
      <p>Construction on Biodesign Institute Building B, a twin of Building A, which will include a vivarium in the lower level, is underway and is slated for August 2005 completion. Building B is funded by the 2003 Infrastructure Bill. </p>
      <p><strong>. ASU Foundation Building </strong> - Located at College Avenue and University on the north end of campus, the project includes a six-story office building, a 1,200-space parking structure and a two-story retail component. The building will house the ASU Foundation, university administrators and the Dean's Office for the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and is slated to be completed in late fall 2004. Crews are currently installing exterior windows and interior partitions and should have the power on in the facility by the end of July. </p>
      <p><strong>. Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building 1 </strong> - Preliminary construction and infrastructure work is underway on the Infrastructure Bill-funded facility scheduled for completion in January 2006. The multi-disciplinary research building will include state of the art laboratory space and graduate education space. An official groundbreaking ceremony will be held this fall. </p>
      <p><strong>. Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building 2 </strong>- Construction is beginning on the facility located between the Goldwater Research Center and McAllister. The high-bay research facility, funded by the Infrastructure Bill, will house laboratories, offices and support functions, and is scheduled to be complete in August 2005. </p>
      <p><strong>. Central Heating Plant </strong> - Located west of Parking Structure 4, this co-generation facility will provide infrastructure for chilled water, steam, and power for the far east side of campus. Construction will begin in August and will be complete in May 2006. </p>
      <p><strong>. McAllister Academic Village Phase 1 </strong>- This new residential facility will focus on creating an integrated, self-contained academic and residential community with classrooms, computer labs, tutorial spaces, residential dining and retail venues. Construction on the 1,928 bed complex, located in the current Lot 40, will begin in early fall and be complete by August 2006. </p>
      <p><strong>. Parking Structure 7 </strong>- Located west of Packard Stadium in Lot 59, this new parking structure will include 1500 stalls, two elevators, public art and video surveillance. It is slated to open in August. </p>
