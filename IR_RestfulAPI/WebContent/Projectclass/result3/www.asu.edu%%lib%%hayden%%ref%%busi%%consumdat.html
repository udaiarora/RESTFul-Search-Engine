    Excellent indexes to published rankings of all sorts, useful for identifying target markets. Listings include, for example, "Top 10 business schools," "Top hotels and resorts," "Top hospital management companies," "Top employment agencies," "Top ten markets for tequila," "Nation's biggest apparel markets," and so on. Subjects are often subdivided by states or countries: e.g., "Public Companies--Arizona." The 1999 edition of the Business Rankings has a cumulative index for all the previous editions.<BR>

This section includes the total market by type of products with brand usage or shares. Lists of major consumer goods companies and wholesalers and distributors are included.

    The largest section of the index is arranged by topic, country, and then date of the survey. The statistics are included along with the question asked and the polling agency for the survey. The multinational surveys are grouped by region first, then by the survey question. In the world survey section, questions are the only arrangement. Using the Table of Contents and the indexes in the back is more efficient than using only one of these aids.<BR>

    An extremely valuable tool that has a concise summary of the demographic profiles of each of the 209 markets, known as ADIs (Areas of Dominant Influence), included. The introductory section includes an explanation of ADIs, an index of ADIs ranked by ADI TV households, population information, a glossary of terms, and definition/explanations of the terms used for the lifestyles. Arranged by major city, the tables provide the demographics (occupation, income, education level, age, type of household, etc.) on one page and the lifestyle/recreational activities on the facing page. All criteria are given with total number, percentage and U.S. index figure. There is a national section arranged by demographic/consumer segments and one by lifestyle. Each of these has an alphabetic list of the ADIs. The last section of the book is list of consumer magazines and direct mail lists for each of the lifestyles.<BR>
