        project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and led by personnel from 
        the Pittsburgh Public Schools, Harvard College's Project Zero and the 
        Educational Testing Service. Levy helped to develop the curriculum for 
        the playwriting program for junior and senior high school students while 
        he was a Visiting Scholar at Harvard working with Project Zero. 
      <p>Levy has worked with the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO)

        and evaluates student work and teacher practices and regularly participates 
        in symposia sponsored by IBO on international issues in education. Part 
        of Levy's theatre for youth research included creating a bibliography 
        of early printed children's plays written in English from 1780-1919. A 
        Preliminary Checklist from 1780-1855 created by Levy and Martha Mahard, 
        Assistant Curator of the Harvard Theatre Collection, was published in 
        1987 by the Theatre Library Association. Both Levy and Mahard received 
        the AATE Research Award in 1986 for this publication. The sequel with 
        plays to 1919 created in collaboration with Floraine Kay is available 
        for searching on the Jonathan Levy Collection website. Other publications 
        include: a chapter titled The Dramatic Dialogues of Charles Stearns in 
        Spotlight on the Child: Studies in the History of American Children's 
        Theatre; Practical Education for the Unimaginable: Essays on Theatre and 
        the Liberal Arts; A Theatre of the Imagination: Reflections on Children 
        and the Theatre; and The Gymnasium of the Imagination: A Collection of 
        Children's Plays in English, 1780-1860.

        and meets with graduate students and faculty in the Department of Theatre 
        on these visits.</p>
