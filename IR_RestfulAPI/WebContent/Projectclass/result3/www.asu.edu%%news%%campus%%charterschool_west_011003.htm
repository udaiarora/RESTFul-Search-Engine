      <h2>Federal funds increase for charter school program</h2>
      <p> An ASU West graduate program for charter school administrators, the 
        first such program in the nation, has received second-year funding from 
        the U.S. Department of Education. </p>
      <p>The $412,000 in funding, an increase from the first-year appropriation 
        of $348,000, ensures that the first cohort of students will be able to 
        complete ASU West's Leadership for Educational Entrepreneurs (LEE) program.</p>
      <p>Twenty-four charter school operators from 11 states gathered at ASU West 
        last June to begin their studies through the LEE program, which bridges 
        the College of Education's master's degree in educational administration 
        and the School of Management's MBA degree. Federal funding is covering 
        80 percent of the students' tuition expenses.</p>
      <p>The students have continued their studies through online instruction 
        and now are finishing their fourth class. They met in person again in 
        late December to begin work on applied research projects.</p>
      <p>All 24 students have remained in the program, with graduation expected 
        in spring 2004. </p>
      <p>"It is gratifying to see the students already applying their learning 
        to increase student achievement," says Eleanor Perry, graduate studies 
        department chairperson in the ASU West College of Education. "One example 
        is Mario Ybarra, founder of Harvest Academy in Yuma, who is using LEE's 
        action research course to shape long-term literacy goals for his students 
        - many of whom are from migrant worker families. Mario is working with 
        parents to identify issues, collect and analyze data, and make program 
        changes."</p>
      <p>LEE is the first structured university program aimed at the growing charter 
        school industry.</p>
      <p>"Many charter school leaders are either business people turned educators 
        or educators turned business people," Perry says. "This program is designed 
        to give participants both the business and education skills required to 
        successfully operate a charter school."</p>
      <p>Recent statistics compiled by the Center for Education Reform show continuing 
        growth in the number of charter schools operating in Arizona and around 
        the United States. Arizona now has 468 charter schools - the most of any 
        state. The number of charter schools has increased 12 percent in Arizona 
        and 14 percent nationally in one year. </p>
      <p>"As the number of charter schools continue to increase, the essential 
        elements of successful charter schools are being recognized," says Dean 
        Kern, director of public charter school programs for the U.S. Department 
        of Education. "The LEE program has examined the research and responded 
        to the need for entrepreneurial leadership to further advance school reform 
        and choice."</p>
      <p>Pending availability of funding, a second LEE cohort will begin working 
        toward their master's degrees in the summer of 2003. For information visit 
        the Web at (www.west.asu.edu/coe/graduate/LEE.htm). </p>
