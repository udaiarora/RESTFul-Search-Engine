<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Final Examinations</B></FONT>

<P>
Final examinations are required in all classes during the period scheduled.  A final examination may be defined as a final presentation, a final paper, a final project, etc.  An examination does not necessarily have to be given in the form of a final &#147;test.&#148;

<P>
It is important that <A HREF="acd002.html#facultymember" TARGET="New">faculty</A> convene class during the final examination schedule.  Final exam week is included in the contact hour calculation that defines the unit of credit.  The examination schedule is printed in the <I>Schedule of Classes.</I>

<P>
After grades have been reported, final examination papers should be retained for one year.

<P>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Periodic Tests</B></FONT>

<P>
It is recommended that <A HREF="acd002.html#student" TARGET="New">students</A> be evaluated on the basis of more than just midsemester and final examinations.  Tests of such length and frequency as the instructor deems wise should be given, and other appropriate evaluative procedures should be used.  Research papers, book reviews, and independent written work are encouraged and expected of all students.

<P>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Early Examination Requests</B></FONT>

<P>
Requests for early final examinations may not be granted by instructors. Requests which seem to have merit may be referred to the dean of the college in which the student is enrolled.  If the dean finds that a student must leave early because of circumstances beyond the student&#146;s control, the dean may authorize arrangements whereby the student can complete the course work and take the final examination before leaving. Ordinarily, however, it will be necessary for the dean to advise the student to clear with each instructor and arrange for an &#147;incomplete&#148; grade in each course.  Under the policy covering &#147;incompletes,&#148; the student must arrange to complete the course work and take the final examination within one calendar year.  If the student is unable to return to the university to take a final examination for the removal of the &#147;incomplete,&#148; the dean may make arrangements for the student to take the final elsewhere, under reliable supervision.
