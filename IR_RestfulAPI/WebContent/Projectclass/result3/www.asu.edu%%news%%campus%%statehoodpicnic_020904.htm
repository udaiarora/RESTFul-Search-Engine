      <h2><strong>Advocates for ASU attend Statehood Picnic Feb. 16 </strong></h2>
      <p align="center"><img src="campus_images/statehood_picnic_020904.jpg" width="288" height="188" align="right">For many in the Valley and the state, ASU always has been more than just a place. It has been a part of their families and communities for generations. </p>
      <p>During the Alumni Association Statehood Picnic Feb. 16, many of those ASU supporters will come forward to help express their thanks to the legislators for their past and continuing support of the university and to share key ASU messages. </p>
      <p>Alumnus Darrell Sawyer is one such person whose life, along with others in his family, has been touched by ASU and who gladly comes out in support of his alma mater. </p>
      <p>"I've been attending the ASU Statehood Picnic for years," says Sawyer. "I believe the more people who show up to support ASU, the more our legislators will know that there are a lot of citizens out there that want the best for our school." </p>
      <p>The Statehood Picnic committee is adding special touches to help celebrate the state's 92nd birthday, as well as make sure that ASU's key messages are heard. </p>
      <p>"We have more than 30 interactive displays, representing all of the campuses and showcasing a number of programs that ASU offers," says Marla Giarratano, director of constituent relations and statehood picnic committee member. </p>
      <p>Also, the Herberger Singers, under the direction of Professor Craig Peterson from the Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts School of Music, will open the House and Senate morning sessions on Feb. 16, singing the "National Anthem." </p>
      <p>"If we really want to show off all the different and unique sides of ASU, it only seems appropriate to have the singers open the sessions," says graduate student and statehood picnic committee member Tracy Chavis. "Sometimes the arts do not get the attention they deserve at these functions, so having the singers perform for the legislators is our way of making sure that the arts are represented." A jazz ensemble also will perform during the picnic. </p>
      <p>In addition, volunteers are being asked to meet with legislators from their districts one-on-one to help spread ASU's messages. Chavis has been busy setting up meetings with legislators and coordinating groups of volunteers. </p>
      <p>When Sawyer recently received the letter asking for volunteers to participate in one of these meetings, he did not hesitate to answer yes. </p>
      <p>"ASU was there for me when it was Arizona State College and it has been there for my wife and both my daughters," says Sawyer, who is a former Alumni Board Member. "I would not miss it." </p>
      <p>Volunteers are still needed to attend the meetings with legislators. If you are or you know a student or parent who is interested in volunteering, contact Chavis at (480) 965-7781. </p>
      <p>ASU Alumni Association, in conjunction with corporate partners, is sponsoring the picnic held from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Wesley Bolin Plaza. </p>
      <p>Employees interested in attending, should ask for their supervisor's approval and use their lunch hour or vacation time. Those who plan to attend, call (480) 965-5041 to R.S.V.P. For information on the picnic visit (www.sundeviladvocates.org). Free parking is available. </p>
      <p>Lambrakis, with Media Relations &amp; Public Information, can be reached at (480) 965-9689. </p>
