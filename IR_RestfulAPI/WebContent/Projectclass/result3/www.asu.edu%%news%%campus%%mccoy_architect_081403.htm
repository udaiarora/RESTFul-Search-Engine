      <h2>McCoy accepts role as university architect</h2>
      <p>        Ron McCoy, professor and director of the School of Architecture, has
        added yet another title to his door: University Architect.</p>
      <p>He won't
            be designing all the new campus buildings, but will try to manifest
          in physical form the "New American University," as envisioned by President
          Michael Crow.</p>
      <p>"The president has big plans for the university in all its
          settings," McCoy says. "He has written a lot about what he wants ASU
          to be, and
          implicit in that is a different kind of physical setting for the university.
          We're trying to figure out what that means."</p>
      <p>Universities usually grow
          much like cities, through incremental decisions, McCoy says. <br>
        "I will try to bring some coherence to those decisions so they will
          reinforce and express the ambitions of the university," he said. "The
          mental picture
          of ASU should be different in the future. The University Architect
          will not design buildings, but will try to communicate and give a strategic
          coherence to the university."</p>
      <p>Though builders usually follow architectural
          drawings, there are no existing plans for the physical manifestation
          of the New American University,
          McCoy says. </p>
      <p>"We don't have examples of that next-generation of architecture,
          so this university could become unique," he says. </p>
      <p>In a "large way," McCoy says,
          he will be responsible for seeing that the university "is designed
        for the community of people who populate
          it."</p>
      <p>Often, when expansion is planned the first questions are the "most
          innocent," such as what to build, McCoy said. In the past, the answer
          would have
          been classrooms, academic buildings or perhaps laboratories, McCoy
        said. But in the New American University, the plan might call for a building
          that mixes retail, housing and academic uses, for example.</p>
      <p>McCoy has served
          as interim dean of the College of Architecture and Environmental Design
          for the past year, but in his role as professor he will once again
          be more involved with students, who, most surely, will be part of the
          university design process.</p>
      <p>"They will participate in all sorts of ways,"
          McCoy says, "from serving on committees to offering input on housing."</p>
      <p>Without a visionary leader
          such as President Crow, ASU would not be able to imagine a new type
        of infrastructure for the university of tomorrow,
        McCoy says.</p>
      <p>"It happens when, in the Office of President, there is someone
          who understands the importance of the quality of physical place, in
        all its aspects.
          And, supporting that leader, there must be an entire organization of
        people trying to make that happen. But you must have a leader who understands."</p>
