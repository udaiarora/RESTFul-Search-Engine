How to Execute EQS on the ASU Research/Statistics UNIX Server 
</center></h2>
<p> 
EQS release 6.1 is the current production release on the ASU 
Research/Statistics UNIX servers.  Its command for invocation is "eqs". 
<p>
EQS can be executed in three ways. The details of each are as follows:     
<pre> 
      Method 1:	Simply type the following,
 
		EQS               

      and you will be prompted for input. 
 
      Method 2:  EQS -i <model_file> 
                     -d <data_file> 
                     -o <output_file> 
                     -l <n_words> 
                     -m <[b]atch, [i]nteractive, or [a]bort> 
 
      Method 3:  Uses method #2 commands to execute EQS   
                 in batch mode via a batch queue.       
 </pre>
 
<h3>Method 1: 
</h3>
   When using method #1, the EQS command will interactively prompt 
   you for various EQS model information, and you will need to respond 
   with appropriate inputs. 
<p>    
   Step by step illustrations are as follows: 
<pre> 
              ########################################### 
              #  EQS -- A Structural Equations Program  # 
              #    Command Procedure for Unix System    # 
              ########################################### 
      
  (1)*-Enter MODEL file name: 
  (2)*-Enter DATA file name (hit <RETURN> if none): 
  (3)*-Enter OUTPUT file name (hit <RETURN> if 'eqs.log'): 
  (4)*-Enter program working memory (hit <RETURN> for default 	 
	      [25000]):  
  (5) {Here, the screen will echo your EQS input information} 
  (6)*-Do you want to run the job batch, interactive, or abort 
	the program? [b/i/a] -- default is [b]: </ol>
</pre>
An explanation of each of these prompts follows: 
<p> 
   (1)  The first prompt will ask you to enter your EQS model file name. 
   If the model file resides in the current directory, there is no need 
   to specify the directory name.  However, if the model file resides in 
   another directory, the full directory will have to be specified with 
   the file name. 
<p>
   (2)  Secondly, you will be prompted for the EQS data file name.   
   Again, you must specify the full path with your file name, if the  
   file does not reside in your current directory.  Simply press the  
   <RETURN> key if there is no external data input in the model, or if  
   you have specified the data file name in the DATA statement of  
   /SPECIFICATION section. 
<p> 
   (3)  Next, you will be asked to enter a desirable output file name. 
   The default output file name is "eqs.log".  For convenience, it is 
   helpful to choose the same file name as your model file name, but 
   with a different file extension. 
<p> 
   (4)  You will then be prompted to enter the number of integer words  
   of working memory.  The default size of the working array is 25000  
   words.  It will cover a model with 10 variables and 3 factors of  
   confirmatory factor model.  The size of the working array must be  
   adjusted accordingly as the number of variables, number of factors,   
   and the complexity of the model increases.  The maximum size of the  
   array allowed is approximately 63 million words in DQS batch mode  
   and 7 million in interactive mode. 
<p> 
   (5)  After all the information is entered for prompts (1) to (4), the 
   screen will display all of your EQS input information thus far. 
<p> 
   (6)  You will then be asked to run the job in batch or interactive  
   mode, or to abort the job altogether.  The default is set to batch  
   mode.  It is recommended to select the batch mode (instead of  
   interactive) by pressing the "return" or "enter" key on your  
   keyboard.  
<p> 
   After the batch job is submitted, you will see the following  
   message:  
<pre>
                  *** running the job as batch....... 
</pre>
   When the job completes, you can then use the "more" (UNIX command)  
   or a text editor to retrieve your EQS output file (default is  
   "eqs.log"). 
<p>    
<h3> 
Method 2: 
</h3>  
      Method #2 has the format of: 
<pre>
             EQS -i <model_file> 
                 -d <data_file> 
                 -o <output_file> 
                 -l <n_words> 
                 -m <[b]atch, [i]nteractive, or [a]bort> 
</pre>
   In this command line input, the only information required is 
   the "-i &lt;model_file&gt;" field, which is the EQS input model file 
   name.  If other parameters are not specified on the command line, 
   the default options will be used. 
<p>
   Again, it is recommended to select the batch mode (instead of  
   interactive).  For example, the following command executes the  
   EQS model file called "manul1.eqs" in the batch mode and places  
   the output in the file called "manul1.lst". 
<pre>
         eqs -i manul1.eqs -o manul1.lst    
</pre>
   After the batch job is submitted, you will see the following  
   message:  
 <pre>
                  *** running the job as batch....... 
 </pre>
   When the job completes, you can then use the "more" (UNIX command)  
   or a text editor to retrieve your EQS output file.  In the above  
   example, the output file is "manul1.lst".
