                    <ul>
                      <li>The Committee met at the end of October and looked at the ARL Salary Survey. They compared the salaries of librarians at ASU Libraries with those of our peer institutions.</li>
                      <li>The Committee will meet with Kurt Murphy in December to discuss merit pay, professional issues, and salaries. <br>

                      <li>At the October 24 meeting of the Academic Senate, Adrian Sannier, the University Technology Officer, addressed the Senate. He gave an overview of the new IT Strategic Plan. He encourages the ASU Community to engage with him through his blog and wiki.<br><br>

                      </li>
                      <li>Deborah asked if Mr. Sannier could address the Librarians&rsquo; Council to talk about the Strategic Plan and his goals. The Executive Committee will discuss this at their next meeting in December.</li>
                      <li>The Faculty Promotion and Tenure proposal was withdrawn for complete reconsideration. There was a comment at the Senate meeting that a considerable amount of time was spent on this issue, when it really did not matter in the end. Vice Provost Zatz stated that while the President has the final say in faculty promotion and tenure decisions, the recommendations of the faculty are very important.</li>
                      <li>ACD 507 had its first reading. Very few questions were asked about the proposed changes. No big issues were raised.</li>
                      <li>At the November 14 meeting of the Academic Senate, Provost Glick addressed the Senate. He discussed the recent comments made by President Crow in the East Valley Tribune in response to the Goldwater Institute&rsquo;s Report. The report stated that ASU should be similar to the University of Michigan (UM) in its funding and financial support. Currently, UM provides $2000 more per student per year than ASU. ASU can learn from what UM has done.</li>
                      <li>Myles Link discussed the recent decision by the NCAA to place ASU on a two-year probation for athletics. He stated that the underlying issues that led to this probation have been addressed. How ASU has handled monitoring of athletic scholarship allocations will be a model for other NCAA schools. This probation does not reduce the number of games or the number of athletes that may participate.</li>
                      <li>Section 507 of the ACD manual passed unanimously without any objections.</li>
                      <li>Doug Johnson reminded everyone of the deadline for enrollment in Flexible Spending accounts. A &ldquo;debit card&rdquo; will soon be available for prescriptions. In January, there will be an increase in the options for retirement accounts.</li>
                      <li>There has also been an aggregation/disaggregation of Departments
                        <ul>
                          <li>Department of Theater is now the School of Theater and Film</li>
                          <li> School of Design of the College of Design will now be comprised of the Departments of Industrial Design, Interior Design, and Visual Communication Design.<br>
                          </li>
                        </ul>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>f.&nbsp;Committee on Academic Professional Status &ndash; Dan Stanton</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>In their last meeting there was a discussion of the ACD 507 changes. Thanks to Kurt Murphy for his work with CAPS on the ACD 507 revision. Although ACD 507 passed, it will need work in the future.</li>
                      <li>The CAPS Fall Spotlight will feature Marjorie Zatz, who will discuss the changes to ACD 507 and the role of Post-Docs. She will also entertain questions about ACD 507. The Spotlight will be held on November 29 from 10:30-Noon in MU-Cochise. Collection Development Council has been rescheduled to allow all AP&rsquo;s to attend. <br>

                      <ul>
                        <li>The Personnel Committee has continued the work that last year&rsquo;s Committee did to revise Section K1 of the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook. One major change to this mentoring document is that more emphasis is placed on the mentor assisting the probationary librarian with annual evaluations and probationary review packets. The previous K1 lacked rigorousness; now it is worded to facilitate a true mentoring relationship. The PE for the probationary librarian will still be a mentor, yet this allows for a stronger 2nd person to advise the probationary librarian. It was asked if a mentor is required &ndash; Mentors are optional. </li>
                        <li>This mentoring document will be provided to all new AP&rsquo;s and Karie Pifer will include it in the new AP checklist. </li>
                        <li>JoAnn Mulvihill asked for a motion to suspend the voting rules in order to get this approved by the Council quickly. </li>
                        <li>The revisions to Section K1 of the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook (mentoring document) were unanimously approved. </li>
                        <li>It was asked if probationary librarians who have not had mentors could now get a mentor. Those who would like a mentor should be referred to Kurt Murphy. <br>
