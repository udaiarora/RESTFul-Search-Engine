                          <p>The Committee continued the work begun to convert the <I>Librarians' Handbook</I> to a Web-based manual with the introduction of a Web page for Librarians' Council that provides access to the handbook as well as other council-related information, including the bylaws, officers and committee members, the schedule of Council meetings, one year of Council minutes, and the <I>ACD Manual</I>. A few sections of the handbook were converted to HTML and were also available. Through the generosity of the Dean of Libraries, a student was provided as time permitted to finish converting the rest of the handbook sections to HTML code. The coding was completed by June 1999 and returned to the Executive Committee for final formatting, proofing, and link verification. Completion and loading of these sections was carried over into the next committee term.
  
                        <p>Changing the format of the handbook brought up new records retention questions. These concerns were directed to Rob Spindler, head of University Archives, who prepared a file management plan for all Council documents in order to assist the Secretary and the Chair-Elect in handling their respective record-keeping responsibilities and ensure that the appropriate records are forwarded to University Archives for permanent retention.
  
                        <p>The attention focused on the handbook also highlighted numerous areas needing revision. These were forwarded to the appropriate committee to draft changes for Council approval. Additional discrepancies found in completing the handbook conversion will be brought to the Executive Committee's attention for future action.
  
                        <p>Over the course of the year, the Executive Committee reviewed three document revisions proposed by the Personnel Committee. These were "Section G: Personnel Actions" and "Section F.1: Position Descriptions" of the <I>Librarians' Handbook</I> and the personnel action cover sheets for probationary evaluation and continuing status and promotion review. The documents were accepted by the Executive Committee and presented at Council where they were voted on and approved.
  
                        <p>Thanks are due to all the officers and committee chairs whose assistance was instrumental in the progress made this year. Special thanks to Marilyn Wurzburger, Chair-elect, who assisted with proofing the converted handbook section; Debbie Abston who agreed to serve as parliamentarian; Diane Rhodes who filled in for the vacant past-chair position by chairing the Nomination and Elections Committee; and Julie Tharp who stepped into the vacancy caused on the Review Committee when a fellowship prevented the probationary librarian from serving. Everyone's combined efforts have made this a year of many accomplishments and have hopefully laid the groundwork for even more progress in the future.<BR>

                        <p>The Personnel Committee for 1998 - 1999 had an engaging and productive year. The majority of the Committee's time was spent "cleaning up" policies and procedures of the Librarian's Handbook. In addition we reviewed and transmitted significant and substantive recommendations to CAPS concerning their Post Continuing Review Status document. The Committee also met several times with Kurt Murphy, AD for Personnel, and found the meetings to be very helpful. The following are the highlights of the Personnel Committee's actions for the stated reporting year:

Re: Research and Professional Development Committee Annual Report <BR>
<BR>
<p>The Research and Professional Development Committee received an allocatioin of $56,000 in travel funds and $3,000 in research funds for the 1998-1999 fiscal year. We received 104 travel requests totaling $87,990.13. We initially allocated $55,844.91, and when funds were returned, the Committee reallocated $3,100. No research funds were requested; therefore, the $3,000 Research fund was not used. We do not have a complete report on travel budget expenditures for the year.<BR>

<p>Members: Katsuko Hotelling, Kathy Krzys, Jeanne Richardson, Sandy Webber, Marilyn Wurzburger. <BR>
    <BR>
<p>Marilyn Wurzburger was re-elected Chair and Kathy Krzys, Secretary. <BR>
    <BR>
<p>The Committee met in February, with Kurt Murphy as guest, to discuss salary issues. Kurt presented several issues to the Committee for discussion and feedback before presenting such issues to the Council. It was determined that ASU salaries have nearly closed the gap formerly existing between us and many of our peer institutions. <BR>
  <BR>
<p>There was no response to the &ldquo;Employee Recognition/Rewards&rdquo; document which had been submitted to the Council Chair in the spring of 1998. The revisions to the Librarians&rsquo; Handbook regarding the Committee structure were formally approved by the Dean and Provost&rsquo;s office. <BR>
  <BR>
<p>Sandra Webber tendered her resignation from the Committee in January. The decision was made not to replace her at that time. <BR>
    <BR>
<p>Katsuko Hotelling and Marilyn Wurzburger studied the budgets of UA, ASUWest and ASUMain to answer the question which was posed to the Committee: &ldquo;Since starting salaries for librarians have been higher at UA and ASUWest than at ASUMain, are average faculty salaries also higher?&rdquo; It was determined that the results of their search were not definitive, since in many instances it was difficult to find comparable data. Differences in terminology, course titles and departmental structure made comparisons more difficult than one might expect. A copy of this report is attached. <BR>

    <BR>
<p>COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT <BR>
    <BR>
<p>Council&rsquo;s request to the Committee was to see if there is a relationship between librarian salaries and faculty salaries at ASUMain, UA, and ASUWest. Since starting salaries for librarians has been higher at UA and ASUWest than at ASUMain, are average faculty salaries also higher? <BR>
  <BR>
<p>After researching the budget books for the three institutions, several problems were encountered. There are differences in department size and organization; some have Deans/Chairs, while some do not. It is difficult to know if comparisons are being made between similar quantities &ndash; i.e. does Geoscience = Geology for comparative purposes? <BR>
  <BR>
<p>The results of our search were not definitive. There were several major departments for which we could <B>not</B> find comparable data, including Business, Education, English, and Nursing. <BR>
  <BR>
<p>There were <B>four </B>departments where ASU Main average faculty salaries are higher: Psychology, History, Political Science, Geology. <BR>
  <BR>
<p>There were <B>five </B>departments where ASUMain average faculty salaries are lower: Mathematics, Communications, Women&rsquo;s Studies, Anthropology, Sociology. <BR>
  <BR>
<p>In 8 of 9 departments, ASU Deans/Chairs were the highest paid ($100,000+) One contributing factor may be that many ASU Main departments are nearly twice the size of UA programs: e.g.
    <CENTER>
      ...................No. of ASU faculty........No. of UA faculty
    </CENTER>
    <CENTER>
      Mathematics...82..........................57
    </CENTER>
    <CENTER>
      Psychology.....48..........................18
    </CENTER>
    <CENTER>
      Anthropology.34.......................... 17
    </CENTER>
    <BR>
    <BR>
<p>One interesting sidenote: ASUWest tops all three schools in Women&rsquo;s Studies:
    <CENTER>
      ASU West av. salary: ..$55,400 (5 FTE)...
    </CENTER>
    <CENTER>
      ASU Main av. salary......43,600 (6 FTE)...
    </CENTER>
    <CENTER>
      UA av. salary.................50,000 (1.5 FTE)

  Annual Report to Librarians' Council from the
</center>
<center>
  Committee on Academic Professional Status
</center>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<OL>
  <LI>The Committee on Academic Professional Status spent much of the year drafting and forwarding a document to the Provost's office on Post Continuing Status Review. The document was finalized in February.<BR>
    <BR>
  <LI>The Committee contacted the Sun Card (photo ID) manager to request they add the classification Academic Professional Emeritus. That request was honored.<BR>
    <BR>
  <LI>At the end of the year, the Committee turned to the issue of how members of AP College peer review committees are designated, i.e., elected or appointed. The goal is to have committee members elected. (This issue does not directly concern the University Libraries because our Review Committee is elected.)
