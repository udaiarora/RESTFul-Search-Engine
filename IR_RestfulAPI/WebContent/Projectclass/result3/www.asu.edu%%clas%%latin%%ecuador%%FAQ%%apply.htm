  <h2>ECUADOR: The Amazon and the Andes Field School</h2>
  <h3>FAQ: Applying to the program & other administrative details.</h3>
	<a name="eligible" id="eligible"></a>
	<p><strong>Who is eligible to join the program?</strong></p>
	
	  <p>This program is open to adventurous students willing to take on the challenge posed  by the difference of indigenous life. Prerequisites: Winter Session - None, 1st Summer Session - None, and for 2nd Summer Session: Must have a B.A. or be a veteran of Session 1 with the permission of the Director, <a href="mailto:tod.swanson@asu.edu">Professor Tod Swanson</a>. Teachers and mid-career adults wishing to continue their education are encouraged to enroll. Students or alumni from any university are welcome.</p>
	<hr>
		<a name="physical" id="physical"></a>
	<p><strong>Do I need to be in good physical condition?</strong></p>

	<p>You should be able to hike over rough terrain for four hours at a time. You will need to climb up steep jungle hills. On the way down, you will have to place your feet in toe holds and climb down holding onto roots and vines. There will be opportunities to swing on vines and to climb them. Although horseback riding is optional, the majority of the class will ride on horseback through the mountains, sometimes trotting or galloping. Because the program not only is an experience of cultural immersion, but also requires living in close quarters with other students, the program is very emotionally demanding; students undergoing high levels of personal stress should consult their doctors before attending. You also need to be able to abstain from drinking alcoholic beverages for at least a week at a time.</p>
	<hr>
		<a name="financial" id="financial"></a>
	<p><strong>Is Financial Aid available?</strong></p>

	  <p>The program does not provide financial aid; please inquire at your school's <a href="http://www.asu.edu/fa">Financial Aid Office</a>. A cost sheet for financial aid is available from the <a href="mailto:arap@asu.edu">ASU Summer Sessions Office</a> at (480) 965-0101.</p>
	<p>Other sources of financial aid may be available to you, if you are willing to take the time to seek them out. According to the Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE): "Numerous funding opportunities are available for international study, but students must be resourceful in pursuit of these funds. Local organizations, such as community groups or émigré associations, may have small awards for overseas study and large companies sometimes have scholarship programs open to children of employees. Students should consult any one of the directories listed below for additional information:
	<ul>
    	<li>Encyclopedia of Associations. Detroit: Gale Research. Annual.</li>
		<li>Financial Aid for Research and Creative Activities Abroad. San Carlos, CA: Reference Service Press. Bi-annual.</li>
		<li>Financial Aid for Study and Training Aboard. San Carlos, CA: Reference Service Press.  Bi-annual.</li>    
		<li>Fellowships, Scholarships, and Related Opportunities in International Education. University of Tennessee-Knoxville: Center for International Education.</li>
		<li>Foundation Grants to Individuals. New York: The Foundation Center.</li>
		<li>Free Money for Foreign Study. New York: Facts on File.</li>
		<li>The International Scholarship Book. 2nd edition. Prentice-Hall.</li>
	</ul>  </p>  
	<p>We hope that you will find these sources to be useful and encourage you to seek them out at your university library; if they do not own them outright, you can usually request these items via Inter-Library Loan. The reference librarians may also be able to suggest additional titles/resources at your home university.</p>
	  <p>You should also make a point of visiting your university's Scholarship Office to learn about potential funding opportunities. Here at ASU, the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/vpsa/fa/scholarships">Scholarship Office</a> (480-965-4845) has a bulletin board on the 2nd floor of the Student Services Building as well as a web page where they post scholarship announcements. The ASU Scholarship Office strongly encourages students to check this board/page on a regular basis for new postings. (To access this web site, click above on the link for the Scholarship Office. Under the Table of Contents section of their page, select "Non-University Affiliated Bulletin Board Scholarships." You will also find many other helpful resources linked to this web site.)</p>
	<p>In addition to contacting your university's Scholarship Office, you should also contact your academic department and college for possible scholarship opportunities. These awards are usually restricted to students majoring in a particular academic discipline. For more information, contact your academic department directly.</p>
	  <p>Finally, you might try searching the Internet for scholarship opportunities. 
        <a href="http://www.fastweb.com"><img src="images/fastweb.gif" alt="Fast web logo and link" width="150" height="65" border="0" class="imagefloatleft" /></a>One resource that you will find is <a href="http://www.fastweb.com/"><strong>FastWEB (Financial Aid Search Through the WEB)</strong></a> which bills itself as &quot;the largest and most complete scholarship search on  the Internet.&quot; It provides access to a searchable database of more than  400,000 private sector scholarships, fellowships, grants, and student loans  available to students.</p>
<hr>
<a name="cancellation" id="cancellation"></a>
<p><strong>What is the cancellation policy?</strong></p>

      <p>All students withdrawing from a program must provide a written statement to 
        the Program Director, <a href="mailto:Tod.Swanson@asu.edu">Dr. Tod Swanson</a>. 
      <ol>
    <li>$100.00 of the $350.00 Program deposit is non-refundable.</li>
	<li>Refunds on payments made plus the refundable portion of the deposit will be issued for the Winter Program until December 1st, 2004 and for the Summer Program until April 4, 2005.</li>
	<li>Students whose written withdrawal statement is received after December 1st, 2004 for the Winter Program or after April 4, 2005 for the Summer Program but prior to 30 days before the beginning of their program may be granted a partial refund.</li>    
	<li>No refund will be granted for students whose written withdrawal statement is received within 30 days of the beginning of their program except in cases of medical or family emergencies.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<a name="flight" id="flight"></a>
<p><strong>How do I make my flight arrangements?</strong></p>

<p>You may make arrangements on your own or book a flight with the group. The cost of a round trip ticket from Phoenix to Quito via Houston for a group booking is approximately $775.00. If you make your own arrangements and arrive earlier or later than the group, you will be responsible for arranging ground transportation in Ecuador and meeting up with the group.</p>

      <p>If you are interested in the group flight deal, please inform <a href="mailto:Cesar.cordova@asu.edu">Cesar Cordova</a> at (480) 965-4191 or via e-mail as soon as possible. Students are responsible for making their airfare payments directly with our travel agent. Tickets are non-refundable and there is usually a fee for changing flight dates after your initial ticket has been purchased.</p>
<hr>
<a name="extend" id="extend"></a>
<p><strong>May I stay in Ecuador longer or arrive earlier than the program dates?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. If you arrive earlier, please arrange to meet the rest of the group at the airport on the evening of beginning of the particular session in which you have enrolled. The class will officially begin at that point and the instructors cannot pick you up at the airport at other times. If you stay in Ecuador after the program ends, you must sign a release form acknowledging that you understand that you are on your own after the program officially ends and that Arizona State University is no longer responsible for you from that time forward. </p>
