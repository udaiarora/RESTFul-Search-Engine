      <h2>Herberger College School of Music announces fall band concert season</h2>
      <p>They're
          shaking things up at the Herberger College School of Music with this
          fall's band concert season. Gary Hill, director of
          bands, promises a groundbreaking season of "uncommon adventures in
        music" that are designed to inform, entertain and even provoke.</p>
      <p> The unique nature of this year's band season flows from Hill's goal
        of making his concerts interactive. No longer will band audiences sit
        passively, watching the performers on a stage at the front of the room.</p>
      <p> "We are challenging the whole notion of attending a concert and sitting
        sedately in one's seat, by insisting on participation," Hills says. </p>
      <p>In the first event of the season, Music History 101, questions and comments
        will be welcomed as the audience is engaged in a two-way conversation
        about the history of music and the pieces that are part of the program.
        The gap between audience and musician will be further narrowed as band
        members use the entire hall to perform, inviting the audience even further
        into the experience.</p>
      <p> "This sort of format, where the audience does not simply sit and listen
        to musicians on stage, continues throughout the season," Hill says.</p>
      <p> This season is also distinguished by the diversity it offers from concert
        to concert. Hill has deliberately packaged each concert to feature a
        particular type of music. From the self-explanatory Liturgical Music,
        to New, Old, Borrowed and Blue, featuring band classics of the past,
        present and future, including Scottsdale composer Ron Nelson's piece,
        "Passacaglia (Homage on B-A-C-H)," there really is something for everyone
        in this fall's season.</p>
      <p>In Gone to the Dogs!, fans of Broadway and comic strips can enjoy a
        sneak preview from the new musical based on the beloved European comic
        strip Tintin. The musical is now touring Europe and a Broadway version
        is planned for 2005. The adventures of Tintin's Snowy and an unknown
        Black Dog are but a small part of this evening's entertaining music.</p>
      <p>The fall season closes with the always popular Pass-in-Review, a spectacular
        two-hour production showcasing the hundreds of talented students who
        make up the ASU Bands and featuring the Sun Devil Marching Band.</p>
      <p>The complete Herberger College School of Music band season for fall
        is below. For more information on the band season, the public should
        call (480) 965-TUNE or visit the Herberger College Web Site at <a href="http://www.herbergercollege.asu.edu/">http://www.herbergercollege.asu.edu/</a>        and click on the events calendar tab.</p>
