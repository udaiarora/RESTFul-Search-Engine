A date due slip is placed in each book, and borrowers are responsible for meeting the due date or paying associated fines.  Failure to receive an overdue notice, for whatever reasons, does not remove this responsibility.<P>Books not returned within 30 days of the due date are billable.  For each billable book, the borrower is assessed a &#036;10 overdue fee and a replacement charge.  (For most items, this charge is &#036;45.)  The replacement charge will be cancelled if a book is returned or renewed after it has become billable.  Only the overdue fee will be assessed.<P>All borrowers with outstanding library charges may be denied borrowing privileges.  Certain other university privileges may also be denied.<P>Regardless of assigned due date, books requested by other borrowers may be recalled 14 days from checkout.  One recall notice will be sent.<P><TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>Note:</TD><TD>You are responsible for the books checked out on your ID and for any fines incurred; this responsibility cannot be transferred.  For your protection, do not loan your ID or your borrowed books to others.  Also, do not depend on others to return books for you.<P>Library notices may be sent to your campus mail code.<P>Certain library departments and branch libraries have individual loan and fine policies for various types of material.  Ask for this information when you use other departments.</TD></TR></TABLE><P>&#160;<P><HR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">ACD</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="acd001.html">contact</A> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="provost.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
