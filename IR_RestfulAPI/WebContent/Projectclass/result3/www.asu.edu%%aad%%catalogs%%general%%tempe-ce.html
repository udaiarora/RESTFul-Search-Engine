Additionally, undergraduate students must complete 70 semester hours by the start of the program. The program schedule conforms to the public school calendar rather than the ASU calendar, thereby extending the academic year by eight weeks. The program is intense but efficient. Students are actively engaged in classroom experiences or ASU course work for at least seven hours every day (Monday&#8211;Friday) for 46 weeks.
