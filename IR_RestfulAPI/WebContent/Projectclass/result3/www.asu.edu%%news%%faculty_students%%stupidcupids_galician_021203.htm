      <h2>Inaugural &quot;Stupid Cupids&quot; awarded for Valentine's Day</h2>
      <p>Valentine's Day, America's favorite celebration of love and romance, 
        is at hand and Arizona State University media researcher Mary-Lou Galician 
        has conferred the Stupid Cupid &amp; Realistic Romance&reg; Awards for 
        Mass Media Portrayals of Sex, Love, &amp; Romance.</p>
      <p>Galician, an associate professor and head of the Media Analysis and Criticism 
        concentration in the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication 
        at ASU, is a media literacy advocate. She also is an expert on the influence 
        of mass media portrayals on real-life relationships as well as the author 
        of Sex, Love, &amp; Romance in the Mass Media: Analysis &amp; Criticism 
        of Unrealistic Portrayals &amp; Their Influence.</p>
      <p>The Stupid Cupid Awards are intended to draw attention to media examples 
        that Galician says people should never use as models for their own lives. 
        Each Stupid Cupid "winner" reinforces one or more of the 12 mass media 
        myths and stereotypes of sex, love, and romance in Galician's Dr. FUN!'s 
        Mass Media Love Quiz (online at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/cronkite/faculty/galician/drfun/">www.asu.edu/cronkite/faculty/galician/drfun/</a>), 
        a 12-item questionnaire that assesses unrealistic expectations. Each item 
        in the quiz relates to one of the dozen myths that Galician's research 
        has identified as affecting American's perceptions of romance.</p>
      <p>The Realistic Romance Awards honor the rarer portrayals that embody one 
        or more of Dr. Galician's Prescriptions for Getting Real About Romance 
        - corresponding "antidotes" to the 12 myths and stereotypes in the quiz.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ironically, two vastly different Reese Witherspoon vehicles topped 
        the two opposing awards lists," Galician said. The movie "Legally Blonde" 
        earned the Realistic Romance Grand Prize for healthiest portrayal, while 
        "Sweet Home Alabama" received the Overall Stupidest Cupid from Galician.</p>
      <p>"'Sweet Home Alabama' deserves the Stupidest Cupid because the mean-spirited 
        movie promoted just about every myth in my Mass Media Love Quiz - from 
        the notion that your perfect partner is pre-destined and nobody can separate 
        you to the dangerous belief that bickering and fighting mean that you're 
        really passionate about each other," Galician said.</p>
      <p>"Although 'Legally Blonde' has some totally unrealistic college and courtroom 
        aspects, it offers a good model of Realistic Romance,&quot; Galician explained, 
        "because the Valley Girl in this fantasy transforms herself into a top 
        Harvard Law School student, turns enemies into friends, and empowers a 
        variety of other people along the way.</p>
      <p>&quot;Wisely dumping her shallow earlier crush whose values are clearly 
        inferior to hers, she ultimately and rewardingly partners with a man who 
        shares her idealism and social activism,&quot; Galician added. &quot;He's 
        a lawyer, too, and he's her friend. These two respect and honor each other."</p>
      <p>Galician's &quot;Stupid Cupid&quot; designations for the 12 individual 
        myths include popular movies Serendipity, Romeo &amp; Juliet, The Princess 
        Bride, Entrapment, As Good As It Gets, The Mexican, Pretty Woman, Maid 
        in Manhattan, Jerry McGuire; television soap operas; Playboy, Maxim, Cosmo, 
        and Seventeen, and "media critics who describe mythic and stereotypic 
        portrayals as 'completely harmless'."</p>
      <p>Those honored with the more exclusive Realistic Romance Awards for rarer 
        healthier portrayals include CastAway, While You Were Sleeping, My Big 
        Fat Greek Wedding, 28 Days, TV's Life with Bonnie and Mad About You, Newsweek's 
        December 9 (2002) cover story on teen abstinence, and Alanis Morissette's 
        music video, Precious Illusions.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, Stupid Cupid nominees abound in the media," Galician 
        explains, "but it's much more difficult to find examples of healthy models 
        of sex, love, and romance that are entertaining and appealing."</p>
      <p>Galician's research of what she calls "The Romanticization of Love in 
        the Mass Media" examines how mass media portrayals of sex, love, and romance 
        affect nearly everyone - men and women, young children and seniors, singles 
        and couples - even though we might not realize it.</p>
      <p>"People in my studies with unrealistic expectations are less satisfied 
        in their own romantic relationships," says Galician, "and many of these 
        unrealistic expectations come from media we enjoy without fully considering 
        how they influence us at a subconscious level."</p>
      <p>Galician insists that her work "is not about censorship or avoiding media. 
        It's all about being a wise media consumer, about using the media instead 
        of the letting media use you, and about 'getting real about romance' to 
        be more successful and happier."</p>
      <p>She notes, "It's important to take time to consider how mass media portrayals 
        at the least reinforce - if not create - unrealistic expectations that 
        most of us can't dismiss completely. First we have to understand where 
        they come from. Then we must learn how to analyze and critique them and, 
        most important, how to reframe them more constructively."</p>
      <p>Galician's book offers her seven-step system for analyzing and criticizing 
        unrealistic portrayals. She even includes suggestions about how parents 
        should debrief their children after they view cartoon classics like "Beauty 
        and the Beast" and "Lady and the Tramp," which are seemingly harmless 
        but filled with myths and stereotypes.</p>
      <p> For this inaugural year of the Awards that Galician promises will be 
        an annual Valentine Week event, she expanded the timeframe beyond 2002 
        media portrayals, and she chose the winners primarily from her own nominations 
        and from those suggested by her students and presentation audience members.</p>
      <p>"Dis-honorable mentions" as well as honorable mentions were included. 
        The complete listing of all awards with their citations is on her website.</p>
      <p>Next year, the public will be able to participate in the voting - so 
        Galician invites mass media consumers to begin thinking now and throughout 
        the year about their choices for next year's awards.</p>
      <p>"We can still enjoy the 'escape' that unrealistic romantic media portrayals 
        offer us," Galician says, "but it's not wise to use them - or media celebrities 
        - as models in our real lives.</p>
      <p>"It's much healthier and smarter to make yourself the hero or heroine 
        of your own true love story."</p>
      <p>Her ultimate advice: "Get real!"</p>
