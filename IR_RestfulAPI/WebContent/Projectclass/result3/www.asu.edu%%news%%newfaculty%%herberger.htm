Upon graduating, Ms. Solis accepted a position as assistant professor of art at DePauw University in Indiana. Ms. Solis has exhibited regionally and nationally, including California , Louisiana , and New York. The importance of the human figure has remained consistent throughout her career.

Mirroring the absurdity of contemporary logic, Ms. Solis strives to represent a quintessentially modern sense of instability in her work by creating images that are disorienting, visually confusing, and that evoke a sense of being grounded in reality without being quite real. </p>
