      <h2>Is science losing weight? </h2>
      <p>On April 30, the ASU Center for Biology and Society and the Actors Theater
        of Phoenix will come together to present something new - the debut performance
        of "Is Science Losing Weight?" a reading of plays about science by students
        of ASU's new interdisciplinary workshop, "The Staging of Science."</p>
      <p>The workshop was a first for ASU. It brought together students ranging
        everywhere from pre-med majors who had never written a play, to graduate
        student playwrights who had never taken a science class. The course gave
        the students the chance to learn from one another, as well as work under
        the guidance of the award-winning New York playwright Arthur Giron. </p>
      <p>The title, "Is Science Losing Weight?" is taken from a play about a
        controversial weight-loss pill. The play was written by Heidi Ernst,
        a Masters student in the ASU School of Life Science who had no prior
        playwriting experience.</p>
      <p>The idea to bring such diverse students together and to give them a
        common charge was conceived by ASU dramaturge Gitta Honegger. A professor
        in ASU's English Department and one of the two instructors for the course,
        Honegger has a PhD in Theatre from the University of Vienna. To Honegger,
        the course is an exploration not only in better understanding and portraying
        science, but also in understanding the usefulness of theatre. </p>
      <p>According to Honegger, she has always used drama as an exploratory tool.
        "Drama has led me through various fields and disciplines," said Honegger,
        "Science is now something that is a great concern and cause of anxiety
        for a population who doesn't understand it. So I can bring my dramaturgical
        approach to theatre, which is connected to research, and then to my love
        of performance." According to Honegger, her vision of the class is that
        it helps rediscover and reexamine the usefulness of theatre as a cultural
        tool.</p>
      <p>The second instructor, Manfred Laubichler, is a professor in ASU's School
        of Life Sciences. Laubichler agrees with his co-teacher, "The theatre
        can lift the fear of abstraction and incomprehensibility. If you look
        at what the theatre can accomplish, it is a completely underutilized
        tool that could help communicate what science is all about." Laubichler,
        with a PhD in Biology from Yale and a PhD in History of Science from
        Princeton, also sees this class as an opportunity to educate prospective
        playwrights in science, as well as an innovative method by which both
        scientists and historians can study science. Working scientists visited
        the class to inform the students' reading and writing, and students were
        encouraged to visit the scientists' labs and shadow their research for
        details and accuracy.</p>
      <p>In addition to having the help of visiting scientists, the course also
        had the benefit of a visiting playwright. Arthur Giron, former head of
        Carnegie Mellon's playwriting program and a founding member of New York's
        Ensemble Studio Theater was on hand instructing playwriting workshops
        during part of the course. Giron has experience with writing plays that
        deal with science. He is the recipient of the Sloan Foundation's Galileo
        Award for his play about Richard Feynmann, "Moving Bodies" as well as
        for his other efforts to promote the communication of science through
        the arts.</p>
      <p>The reading will be followed by a discussion with the student authors
        and the professional actors. It will take place 7:30 PM, Wednesday, April
        30, at the Herberger Theater Center in Downtown Phoenix, 222 E. Monroe
        Ave. Admission is free. For the Herberger Box Office, call 602-253-6701.</p>
