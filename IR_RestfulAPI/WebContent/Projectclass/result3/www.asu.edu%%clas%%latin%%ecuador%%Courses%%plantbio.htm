  <h2>ECUADOR: The Amazon and the Andes Field School<br>Summer Course Syllabi</h2>
  <h3>PLB 498/598: Neotropical Plant Biology</h3>
  <p>New World, or neo-tropical, diversity is among the highest in the world, especially in the Ecuadorian Amazon basin where the Amazon and Andes Field School is located. In the Jatun Sacha Reserve, located a short ways down river from the field school, about 2000 documented species of plant exist within an area of about 7.7 square miles, which is a level of diversity greater than is many U.S. states; this inventory is not yet even complete. Simply trying to obtain a baseline inventory in these relatively small areas is a difficult task, because new humans easily pass by new species waiting for scientific recognition on a daily basis; new species identification is a quotidian occurrence. Millions of years of co-evolution have produced intricate ecosystems biological processes that humans are scarcely beginning to understand.</p>
	<img src="../images/biocourse1.jpg" class="imagefloatleft">
	<p>The need to study these elaborate ecosystems and learn how to manage and maintain their integrity is more critical now than ever. Over the last few decades, the tropical forests have experienced serious threats from human influences: agriculture, geological harvesting (i.e., oil drilling, mining, etc.), logging, and general population growth have put an immense strain on the integrity of tropical ecosystems. Greater knowledge of ecosystems entails wiser decisions regarding their management and preservation.</p>

	<p>With this course, we will get our hands dirty exploring the components and processes in a lowland tropical ecosystem and increase our understanding, and hopefully appreciation, for this unique habitat. First hand experience is by far the best way to become acquainted with the complexity of tropical ecosystems and learn how much there is yet unknown. While this course is meant only to be an introduction to the tropics, we understand that knowledge can be contagious. Maybe this experience will plant a seed of interest in one or two of you.</p>

	<p>For a preview, try out our web-based interactive plant <a href="http://ag.arizona.edu/herbarium/ed/ecuador/familykey/navikey.html">family key</a> to the 'dicots' found within the field school region. This key was developed during last summer's field school session. Such newly developed identification tools that work from a database of plant characters can serve as useful aids in dentifying organisms within areas of such great diversity.</p>

	<p><strong>Course Description:</strong></p>
	<img src="../images/biocourse2.jpg" class="imagefloatright">
	<p>Tropical Plant Biology focuses on three main subjects: forest ecology, plant taxonomy, and human interaction. Within these broader topics, we will address origin, basic ecology, pollination biology, genetic diversity, nomenclature, plant morphology and function, ethnobotany, tropical threats, and ethical and cultural dilemmas within developing tropical countries. The final objective is to provide the student with an enlarged knowledge of tropical forest components, ecology, and influencing factors. This course focuses primarily on low elevation tropical rain forest, though we will also have the opportunity to compare and contrast other tropical habitat types while traveling through the Andes.</p>

	<p>While escaping the necessity of some classroom lecture is difficult, we plan to spend a large amount of our time in the field for a hands-on learning experience. In the classroom, studies of basic ecological principles and plant morphology give us a base for our field observations. A Neotropical Companion will serve as our main textbook. This text covers most of the topics that we will approach in class, and will serve to augment lecture and to provide material for discussion. I strongly advise that you read the material pertaining to the course outline ahead of time, for you will get more out of the lecture.</p>

	<p>Students are likely to have a wide range of rich academic backgrounds and interests. For this reason, the lecture schedule that follows is only meant as basic outline of the topics covered. Actual lectures and field outings will be modified to fit the groups overall knowledge and interests. I hope the participants' interests will help direct the course to form a fun and interesting learning environment, the will make the experience as productive as possible.</p>

	<p><strong>Goals &amp; Objectives:</strong></p>
	<img src="../images/biocourse3.jpg" class="imagefloatleft">
	<ul>
    <li>To introduce the student to the general ecological relationships between environment and organisms.</li>
    <li>Recognize common Neotropical plant families and genera within the field</li>
    <li>Gain an appreciation for the vast biodiversity of the Neotropics</li>
    <li>Become aware of the central threats to sustainability and integrity of tropical ecosystems.</li>
    <li>Have a fun and stimulating learning experience</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>Textbooks and Readings:</strong></p>
	<ul>
    <li><strong>A Neotropical Companion, Kricher, J. 1997. 2nd edition. Princeton University Press</strong>. This text will serve as our primary textbook. This text presents a complete and accurate tour through the major ecosystems, processes, theories, patterns, and players in the American tropics, yet is not so technical that is dry. It serves as a good synthesizer, providing the big picture and a brief introduction to the important ecological ideas.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>Pre-Departure assignment:</strong></p>
	<p>Read the chapters in the text pertaining to the course outline below. Also, read as much as you can about a particular tropical botany, ecology, conservation, or ethnobotany issue appealing to your interests, and be prepared to give a short presentation about this issue. Some topic ideas include climate change, plant strategies by form (epiphytes, lianas, emergent trees, palms, understory plants), predation, protection, competition, nutrient cycling, symbiosis, mutualism, a particular species or family, land use, agriculture, indigenous people, deforestation, species loss, the national park system, economy and sustainability, the timber industry, environmentalism, medicinal plants, etc. DO NOT limit yourself by these suggestions; creativity and an expression of interest will reflect positively on your grade.</p>
