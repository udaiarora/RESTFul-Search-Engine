			 <H4><A NAME="LibraryEvolution3">Library Evolution 3: Microsoft to
				Linux Migration</A></H4>Fletcher Library has migrated 71 public workstations
			 and 14 support servers from a Microsoft Operating System and architecture to a
			 Linux Operating System and open source/open systems architecture. This project
			 was initiated to enable librarians to customize research and instruction
			 applications, to reduce technology-related costs and staff time, and to
			 increase reliability. <BR><BR>In 1999, few institutions had attempted what we
			 hoped to accomplish: migrate from a Microsoft to a Linux operating system in
			 order to eliminate reliance on Microsoft architecture, hardware and software
			 that consumed budget and staff time. By 2003 we developed and implemented an
			 original and unique hybrid thin/fat client Linux workstation that allows us to
			 provide Library users with dependable, trouble-free workstations, and
			 customization of our services to meet their needs and expectations. We have
			 also realized a 50% reduction in technology-related costs while reducing
			 systems and software problems by 91%. Our project has been presented and
			 recognized at national conferences and our library has been referenced as a
			 success model from other libraries considering implementing Linux. Our current
			 roadmap includes integrating grid computing, creating a Linux-based library
			 classroom, and implementing a three dimensional desktop client environment.

			 <H4></H4><B><A NAME="LibrariesVideo">University Libraries' Video Courses Online</A></B> 
			 <P>Until fall 2003, the Libraries supported the Distance Learning and
				Technology Department by manually videotaping televised courses, an expensive
				and labor-intensive process. To replace this approach, the Libraries designed
				and created Video Courses Online, a uniquely-automated streaming digital video
				system that requires almost no staff time to manage. The new system serves
				students better by letting them access their courses twenty-four hours a day
				from any internet-accessible computer. For the Libraries, it drastically
				reduces space requirements and support costs, and increases available staff
				time for other pressing projects. The streaming video system is already being
				adapted to a variety of library informational presentations and is a model for
				other institutions as well.</P>

			 <H4><A NAME="EcologyExplorers">Ecology Explorers</A></H4> 
			 <P>Ecology Explorers is the K-12 education program of Arizona State
				University's Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER)
				project. The aims of the Ecology Explorers program are to</P> 
			 <UL> 
				<LI>help schools develop and implement a schoolyard ecology program
				  where students collect data similar to CAP LTER data, enter results into our
				  database, share data with other schools, and develop hypotheses and experiments
				  to explain their findings; </LI> 
				<LI>improve science literacy by exposing students and teachers to
				  research conducted by university-level scientists; </LI> 
				<LI>enhance teachers' capabilities to design lessons and activities
				  that use scientific inquiry and encourage interest in science; </LI> 
				<LI>provide access to and promote the use of CAP LTER materials and
				  information; encourage collaboration between CAP LTER researchers and the K 12
				  community; </LI> 
				<LI> provide students an opportunity to share their research with
				  other children, adults and researchers. </LI> 
		    </UL> 
			 <P>The program is aligned with the AZ State Education Standards,
				including science, math, writing, social science and technology standards. Over
				100 teachers and hundreds of their students have participated in Ecology
				Explorers.</P>

			 <H4>2002-2003 Award Recipients</H4> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Stretch">The Department of English's Stretch
				Program</A></H4> 
			 <P>Since the fall of 1994, the Department of English has offered a
				unique curriculum for students entering with the lowest standardized test
				scores, students classified as "at risk": the Stretch Program. Essentially, we
				"stretch" ENG 101 over two semesters, providing students an extra semester of
				guided, college-level writing experience. Students read the same textbooks and
				do the same assignments as all ENG 101 students, but they work in smaller
				classes and receive more time and individual guidance for their writing. </P> 
			 <P>Over the past eight years, more than 6,000 students have taken the
				Stretch sequence: they not only pass ENG 101 at a higher rate than do those
				students taking traditional ENG 101, they also pass ENG 102 at a higher rate.
				And almost twice as many students are retained under the Stretch approach: </P>
			 
			 <UL TYPE="CIRCLE"> 
				<LI>Under the old model (before Stretch), out of every 1,000 new
				  students, only 280 were here to register for ENG 102 </LI> 
				<LI>Under the Stretch model, from those 1,000 new students, 460
				  will be at ASU to register for ENG 102 </LI> 
		    </UL> 
			 <P>89 percent of Stretch Program students say-in anonymous
				evaluations-that Stretch has helped them improve their writing. The Stretch
				Program has become a national model and is copied by a number of colleges and
				universities. The complete STRETCH nomination can be found at

			 <H4><A NAME="Ask a Biologist">Ask a Biologist</A></H4> 
			 <P> <I>Ask A Biologist</I> is a web-based program that gives
				students, teachers, and parents access to scientists working at ASU. The site
				contains articles about current research, profiles of scientists, an image
				gallery, mystery images, puzzles, coloring pages, interactive quizzes, and a
				guessing game. At the core of the program is the question feature, which allows
				students in grades K-12 to submit non-homework questions. Pre-service and
				in-service teachers are also encouraged to use the question submission form.
				The questions are answered by ASU life science faculty and graduate student
				volunteers. </P> 
			 <P>In its six years of existence, Ask a Biologist has answered over
				15,000 questions from students, teachers, and parents around the world. The
				site currently averages over 700 visitors a day. Each month there are over a
				thousand downloads of printable puzzles, backyard experiments, and coloring
				pages from the web site. It has received awards for its content and is cited in
				numerous educational resource web sites. <BR><BR> </P>

			 <H4><A NAME="Academic Community Engagement Services">Academic
				Community Engagement Services</A></H4> 
			 <P>Academic Community Engagement Services* (ACES) has grown into a
				multi-faceted, campus- and community-wide initiative since 1994, when ASU's
				English Department, The Salvation Army, and the Roosevelt School District
				pooled their expertise and resources to link service-learning internships to
				special sections of English composition. Today, the number of linked
				composition, linguistics, and English education courses has increased
				dramatically, and ACES has expanded in support of discipline-specific service
				learning internships and course-embedded service learning throughout the
				university, providing training, oversight and research opportunities for
				students and faculty in the sciences, architecture, counseling, education,
				interdisciplinary studies, justice studies, languages, math, nursing,
				philosophy, social work, and sociology. Over 350 undergraduates and graduates
				are involved each semester in experience-based research, writing, and field
				application of their classroom learning, and an ever-increasing number of
				tenured and non-tenured faculty and graduate teaching assistants are mastering
				the pedagogy of engagement. ACES has created extensive funding and placement
				opportunities through reciprocal community partnerships with non-profits,
				corporations, and school districts. ACES also furthers the university's
				community mission through its America Reads Challenge, JumpStart, and
				AmeriCorps*VISTA programs. <BR><BR> * Formerly The Service Learning Program

				NAME="Chain Reaction (Stories of Science & Learning from Arizona State University)">Chain
				Reaction (Stories of Science &amp; Learning from Arizona State
				University)</A></H4> 
			 <P>The Office of Research Publications strives to expand public
				awareness regarding the variety and depth of scholarship and creative activity
				at Arizona State University. In 1998, we reached a new audience with the
				creation of Chain Reaction, a pilot project publication and its companion Web
				site. Chain Reaction is designed especially for young readers in grades 4-8. We
				are the first university in the United States to target this audience with an
				educational resource of this type. Teacher and student response to the premier
				Chain Reaction was immediately positive. Four reprints totaling 55,000 copies
				went to schools throughout Arizona. A total of 110,000 copies of Issue #2 were
				distributed in fall 2000. Issue #3 required a printing of 150,000 copies
				distributed to 2,600 teachers at 800 schools in fall 2001.<BR><BR> The
				publication serves as a scholarly passport to ASU for younger students. Chain
				Reaction expands ASU's community involvement by providing an educational
				resource to teachers. Using both print and Internet, Chain Reaction provides
				Arizona educators with quality, tangible classroom-teaching tools that are tied
				directly to the Arizona science standards. </P>

			 <P></P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Quack Quack">ASU Leadership Development Team: Project
				Duck</A></H4> 
			 <P> In the fall of 1999, the ASU Leadership Development Team, a
				cross-functional group of higher education professionals, developed an
				innovative strategy to address the challenge of how to increase student
				involvement on campus. In light of the limited success of traditional methods
				for publicizing opportunities, the team sought to identify new and creative
				ways to share information with students. </P> 
			 <P>With the goal of increasing students' awareness of involvement
				opportunities and the benefits of getting involved, the team engaged in a
				series of meetings and brainstorming sessions. Students participated in the
				process, by providing valuable input and feedback. The resulting innovation
				came to be known as "Project Duck." </P> 
			 <P>"Project Duck," a multi-level marketing and awareness campaign,
				featured a duck theme, complete with rubber ducks imprinted with the URL for a
				newly-created student involvement web site. Posters containing duck-themed
				"teasers" were distributed across campus, and 1200 rubber ducks were released
				into the Cady Mall fountain. "Project Duck" generated tremendous curiosity and
				excitement among students, and continues to positively impact their success by
				supporting and promoting involvement. </P> 
			 <P></P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Training Program">ASU and Valley of the Sun Training
				Program </A></H4> 
			 <P> Arizona State University's Purchasing and Business Services
				department provides an innovative example of community spirit and active
				participation in improving the lives of individuals with developmental
				disabilities. Since 1994, Purchasing and Business Services has sponsored a
				training program in conjunction with Valley of the Sun School and Habilitation
				Center. The program is the first of its kind that trains developmentally
				disabled persons in areas that are not normally available to them; areas where
				they would have upward mobility, above minimum wage salaries and comprehensive
				benefits packages. Most similar programs train in custodial, fast food and
				other related areas that provide dead-end jobs. The ASU training requires
				one-on-one, individualized, training allowing the trainee to receive valuable
				hands on experience in positions such as mail clerk, copy center clerk, bindery
				clerk, furniture installer, materials handler and copy machine technician. </P>
			 
			 <P>Training is provided by volunteer ASU employees who train these
				individuals while performing their own duties. A job coach from Valley of the
				Sun School is also available to help with training and/or to reinforce program
				and socialization skills. </P> 
			 <P></P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Electronic Reserve">University Libraries - Electronic
				Reserve </A></H4> 
			 <P>The University Libraries Electronic Reserve system provides ASU
				students easy online access to required course reading. Journal articles,
				tests, syllabi and class notes are digitized and available on any computer with
				internet access. Students no longer need to make a trip to the library but can
				now read, download or print these items at their convenience. The documents are
				easily located through a direct link in the Libraries' online catalog and
				retrievable with "two clicks of a mouse". The only requirement for the student
				- remember and enter their ASURITE ID. This system was designed by University
				Libraries' Access Services and Systems staff. While outside vendors offered
				programs ranging in price from $47,000 to $70,000, less than $400 was spent by
				the Libraries' on software. Staff developed the system during the summer of
				1999, incorporating the work into their regular work hours. With over 750 files
				for 169 courses digitized for the Fall 1999 semester, electronic reserve is
				popular, averaging 11,000 "hits" a month. Students and faculty are very excited
				and pleased with this new service. </P> 
			 <H4>1998-1999 Award Recipients</H4> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Implementation">Implementation of Computer Technology in
				Processing of Graduate Admissions</A></H4> 
			 <P>In the Spring of 1997, the Graduate College and Information
				Technology embarked on a project to improve processing of admissions for
				graduate studies at Arizona State University. This project is known as the
				Graduate Admissions Reengineering Project (GARP). Many facets of this project
				have involved staff development and significant process improvement through
				reengineering of workflow. Additionally, a large focus of the project has
				entailed the implementation of new technology, in support of improved
				processes. <BR><BR> </P> 
			 <P>Included in the first phase of this project were the deployment of
				a Web based application for admissions, which now accounts for over 30% of all
				graduate applications received. Furthermore, an imaging system was introduced
				using new, innovative technology that significantly reduces the keystrokes
				required for paper based applications. A special approach has been adopted by
				the Technical Team to enable new applications for admissions to be uploaded to
				ASU's Student Information System, without having to re-enter the data.<BR><BR>
			</P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="ASU Employee Wellness">ASU Employee Wellness Program
				Advisory Network</A></H4> 
			 <P>A team of ASU faculty and staff developed a proposal for a
				comprehensive work site health promotion and wellness program for the enhanced
				work/life and well-being of ASU employees. From this team an Advisory Network
				was established. The goal was to develop a coordinated, cost-effective program
				using existing resources. This would promote holistic health for employees by
				providing wellness services and by promoting a healthy workplace environment.
				The program has offered an increasing number of diverse activities and has
				gauged its effectiveness and determined its programming goals through ongoing
				evaluations. Educational programs have been offered during the lunch hour, and
				health screenings have been made available to employees at their department
				work site. Employees have been kept informed about the Wellness Program through
				the Health Watch newsletter, brochures distributed to new employees during
				orientation, and a web site. Funding from the State covers the cost of the
				Health Watch staff; and ASU provides the administrative services, facilities
				and technologies for program operations. Numerous academic departments
				contribute faculty and graduate students time to deliver programs. <BR><BR>
			</P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="University-College">The University College
				Center</A></H4> 
			 <P>ASU West and Glendale Community College (GCC) have pioneered a new
				way for students to earn a college degree. The highly innovative partnership,
				called the University-College Center (UCC), makes it possible for more students
				to pursue a bachelor's degree at a public university, near home, without
				changing campuses.<BR><BR> </P> 
			 <P>The primary goal is to offer completely seamless transfer for
				community college students into an upper-division institution. It is hoped,
				through this educational partnership, a greater number of students will achieve
				their goal of higher education. GCC and ASU West, through the UCC, are offering
				students more choices and an enhanced, encouraging educational
				experience.<BR><BR><BR> </P> 
			 <H4>1997-1998 Award Recipients</H4> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Peoplelinks">PeopleLinks Network Team</A></H4> 
			 <P>The PeopleLinks Network is located within the Training Unit at the
				Arizona Prevention Resource Center (APRC) at Arizona State University. The APRC
				serves Arizona as a statewide resource center, providing accessible technical
				assistance on a variety of prevention and health promotion issues through
				training, information dissemination and program evaluation. By promoting
				collaboration among state agencies, service providers, schools and communities,
				the APRC provides leadership in the planning and development of effective and
				results oriented prevention initiatives.<BR> </P> 
			 <P>The purpose of the PeopleLinks is to promote and support
				comprehensive prevention planning and implementation in Arizona. Specifically,
				the PeopleLinks network ensures the availability of a diverse, highly
				qualified, statewide consultant cadre to provide free training and technical
				assistance for schools, non-profit agencies, communities, universities, and
				state agencies throughout Arizona.<BR> </P> 
			 <P>This project fills a critical need of communities, schools,
				non-profit agencies, and state agencies. A fundamental challenge for people
				attempting to effect change and improve services is access to timely,
				appropriate training and technical assistance. PeopleLinks increases the
				prevention capacity of the state by providing readily accessible individually
				designed training and consultation.<BR> </P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Repertory">ASU Repertory Troupe (A.R.T.)</A></H4> 
			 <P>The ASU Repertory Troupe (A.R.T.) is a unique campus-wide
				collaborative tool as well as a community outreach program for ASU. Student
				performers, playwrights, technicians and facilitators share their talents by
				serving diverse groups in a variety of innovative ways. Founded by Jean Thomsen
				in the Theatre Department, it has become an unprecedented and vital artistic
				network within the University community and has the ability to create
				significant forums for social awareness issues in the metropolitan arena. These
				actors continuously perform in mock depositions, trials, etc. for the ASU Law
				School Clinic. The Date Rape Project is a continually developing series of
				innovative plays performed in conjunction with events coordinated by Student
				Life, Student Health, Greek Life, the Sexual Assault Coordinating Committee
				(S.A.C.C.) and various other departments on campus. Recently, the Date Rape
				Project has also become involved with S.A.R.V (Sexual Assault and Relationship
				Violence), a state-wide organization spearheaded by the Oasis Center in Tucson.
				The Theatre for Youth Tour has performed plays and conducted workshops on
				Shakespeare in Valley high schools. The Scene Library Tour has performed in
				classrooms ranging from grade school to upper division courses at ASU. It has
				also created entertainment for important commemorative events on campus. By
				participating in the ASU Repertory Troupe and its projects, ASU students become
				"ambassadors" for the University. They reach out to each other and to the world
				at large. The A.R.T. provides them with a unique opportunity to become agents
				for change.<BR> </P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Lab">Laboratory Management Information System at ASU
				Team</A></H4> 
			 <P>Due to increasing regulatory compliance demands and focus on
				campus safety, Risk Management has developed and implemented a laboratory
				safety certification program with the objective of promoting laboratory safety
				and ensuring that each campus laboratory fulfills the overlapping regulatory
				mandates pertaining to occupational safety and environmental protection. The
				program was developed in-house and utilizes a computer-based laboratory
				management information system (LMIS) that is capable of tracking laboratory
				safety activities and chemical use in academic and research laboratories by
				accessing a series of interactive databases and entry screens. Safety
				inspections, collection of emergency information, and hazardous material
				profiles are completed for each laboratory and entered into the system to
				provide a summary for each building or department. The reporting capability is
				valuable for the university because it compiles statistical data used to review
				service measurements and facilitates academic and research program evaluations.
				Risk Management is able to track which areas are generally in noncompliance and
				can focus on correcting those areas more effectively. With the objective of
				preventing laboratory-related injury and illness and potential damage to the
				environment and property, the laboratory management information system program
				can be used as an effective laboratory safety compliance tool for other
				educational institutions. <BR><BR> </P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="WWW">World Wide Web as a Tool for Project Management
				Team</A></H4> 
			 <P>This innovative technique evolved from the need to efficiently
				manage the Graduate Admissions Reengineering Project (G.A.R.P.). Reengineering
				focuses on radically redesigning and enhancing processes with technology. The
				"traditional" approach to project management seemed incongruent with the focus
				of G.A.R.P. and the idea of using the web as a project management tool was
				explored.<BR> </P> 
			 <P>This innovation involves using the web as the primary source for
				distributing information and communicating with seven project teams, all of
				ASU's academic units, Graduate College employees, and outside entities. Team
				rosters, distribution lists, meeting dates, and minutes were maintained on the
				web. Paper copies of documents were distributed only when a hard copy was
				needed. Team members had immediate access to team documents such as team
				charters and roles. Frequently asked questions and responses to focus group
				issues were added to address academic unit issues. Project documents and
				reports were distributed through the web.<BR> </P> 
			 <P>While web usage in general has increased dramatically over the
				past several years, utilizing the web to this extent for project management is
				in its infancy. This approach enhanced the effectiveness of project
				communication while greatly reducing staff time and the costs associated with
				copying and distributing material.<BR><BR><BR> </P> 
			 <H4>1996-97 President's Award for Innovation</H4> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Learning Project">ASU Service Learning Project</A></H4> 
			 <P>&#145;To raise a child it takes a village;&#146; to educate a
				community it requires a University<BR> </P> 
			 <P>The ASU Service Learning Project is a replicable innovation to
				help low-income children and families through service learning partnerships
				between ASU faculty and students and community-based settings, whether schools
				or non-profit agencies. The project uniquely utilizes the University as an
				interdisciplinary partner in community-based efforts to address the educational
				and developmental needs of children scoring below the state and national
				averages on standardized tests in reading, mathematics, and language. </P> 
			 <P>This Service Learning Project reflects the shared missions of the
				partners and utilizes their specific resources in response to
				community-identified needs. Emphasizing learning though service as a factor in
				academic success and a mechanism for community involvement, several ASU
				departments implemented Service Learning internships. </P> 
			 <P>This project uniquely exemplifies the University&#146;s tri-fold
				mission of teaching, community service, and research as it provides a
				meaningful dimension for undergraduates and improves our community, one child
				at a time. The University&#146;s profile in the community is heightened; its
				presence is valued by parents and community organizations. </P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="General Counsel">Office of General Counsel</A></H4> 
			 <P> The Office of General Counsel developed its workshop to provide
				university administrators with practical information about laws and university
				policies that impact the services the university provides to students,
				employees, and the public. Each workshop session addresses specific legal
				issues relevant to the university community, provides practical information
				about current legal developments, and provides functional workshop materials
				that may be used as a reference throughout the year. The interactive nature of
				our workshop encourages participants to learn from each other by applying
				otherwise abstract legal principles to hypothetical examples taken from the
				university environment. </P> 
			 <P>The workshop addresses issues that impact ASU Main, ASU East, and
				ASU West, all of which are represented by our guest speakers, facilitators and
				participants. Speakers and facilitators have included ASU attorneys, university
				representatives from Affirmative Action, the Campus Environment Team, Human
				Resources, Purchasing and Risk Management, guest speakers from County and State
				Government and attorneys who represent other universities. The workshop has
				improved the ability of the Office of General Counsel to provide timely and
				useful legal advice to the university community. </P> 
			 <H4><A NAME="Purchasing">Purchasing and Logistics Management
				Program</A></H4> 
			 <P> Due to continuing questions about classroom and research
				relevancy as well as funding concerns, the Purchasing and Logistics Management
				Program developed and implemented an academic-business partnership strategy.
				The three primary components of this strategy are: the Center for Advanced
				Purchasing studies; the Purchasing and Logistics Management track in the MBA
				program; and, the corporate relationship efforts in the undergraduate program.
				The components are highly related as they use various types of partnerships to
				achieve their goals. The Center of Advanced Purchasing Studies uses the
				Executive Purchasing Roundtable to establish research agendas and generate
				funding for the research. The MBA track uses executive and practicing
				professionals in the classes to assure that leading edge business practices are
				presented. The undergraduate program works with practicing managers to review
				the curriculum, teach in the class and arrange for company visits so that the
				students have a realistic and current perception of business practices. As a
				result of these original partnerships, students receive attractive job offers
				from companies throughout the United States and funding is available to support
				relevant research. </P>
