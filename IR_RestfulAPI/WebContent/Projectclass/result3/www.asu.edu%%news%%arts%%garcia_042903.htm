      <h2>ASU student beats 600+ playwrights to take top honors at Kennedy Center
        American College Theater Festival</h2>
      <p> James E. Garcia, a journalist and playwright enrolled
        in the master's program in playwriting at Arizona State University, won
        first place in the nation's most prestigious playwriting contest for
        university students.</p>
      <p>Garcia beat out more than 600 other playwrights in the category for
        10-minute plays at the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival,
        held April 14-19 in Washington, D.C. Grand prize was $1,000.</p>
      <p>The winning work is entitled "The Crossing." The story was inspired
        by the death of 14 immigrants in the Arizona desert two years ago.</p>
      <p>"I was extremely surprised to win," Garcia says, "given there was so
        much good work submitted. By my calculation, at least three other plays
        could have won first place and I would not have been disappointed. it's
        a tremendous honor.</p>
      <p>I'm new at this, so I hope it opens some doors for me."</p>
      <p>The trip to Washington, D.C., was another high point for Garcia.</p>
      <p>"Growing up in a Latino family, just going into a building named after
        a Kennedy is a really big deal! I made sure to send my mom a JFK postcard
        I bought in the Kennedy Center's gift shop."</p>
      <p>Garcia said he wrote the play, in part, to draw attention to the dozens
        of people who die crossing the U.S.-Mexico border every year. </p>
      <p>"More than 100 people will die in southern Arizona alone in the coming
        months," Garcia says. "It's as if they've been sentenced to death for
        wanting to feed their families."</p>
      <p>"The Crossing tells" the story of Esperanza Fuentes, a Mexican schoolteacher,
        who crosses illegally into the United States. She is the lone survivor
        from a group of 14 abandoned in the southern Arizona desert by smugglers.
        Agent Garza, a Border Patrol agent who came to the United States illegally
        as a boy, finds her.</p>
      <p>It will be performed at St. Anne's Catholic Church in Gilbert on May
        11 at a dedication of a shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The shrine was
        built in memory to the immigrants who died crossing the Arizona desert. </p>
      <p>In addition, "The Crossing" will be performed May 29 at Glendale Community
        College in Glendale, California. </p>
      <p>Garcia, 44, and his wife live in Ahwatukee with their two daughters.
        He has worked as a journalist since 1986, mostly covering issues focusing
        on the Southwest border and Mexico. He is a former Latin America Correspondent
        for Cox Newspapers and a former columnist for the New York Times News
        Service.</p>
      <p>Garcia recently founded the Colores Actors-Writers Workshop in Phoenix,
        a new company devoted to Latino theatre. Its first full season is slated
        for 2003-2004. His play, "Borderlines," opens July 22 at Herberger Lunchtime
        Theater Series. A full-length production of his play, "American Latino
        Redux," has been accepted as part of the Herberger College Mainstage
        2003-2004 season. </p>
      <p>The MFA Creative Writing Playwriting Program is co-administered by the
        College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Department of English and the Herberger
        College of Fine Arts Department of Theatre. </p>
