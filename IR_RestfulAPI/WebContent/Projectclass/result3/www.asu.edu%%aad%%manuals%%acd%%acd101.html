ASU is an institution of learning organized under the constitution and laws of the state of Arizona.  The university is dedicated primarily to higher learning, research, and service to the state and nation.

<P>
When the Board of Regents adopted &#147;Mission and Scope Statements&#148; for each institution in the Arizona university system, it charged ASU to &#147;continue development as a major research university, with special emphasis on programs needed in the state&#146;s major urban area,&#148; and to &#147;become competitive with the best public universities in the nation.&#148;  ASU was directed specifically to develop nationally recognized programs in business administration, solid state sciences, electronics, computers, public programs, fine arts, and law, and to offer excellence in all other disciplines.  The university was encouraged to meet the needs of the state&#146;s largest metropolitan area through instruction, research, and public service.  The board also directed the university to develop the physical plant necessary to achieve this mission by providing more space on campus for research and graduate programs and by developing centers of instruction in Phoenix and western Maricopa County.

<P>
ASU fulfills its obligations to the state and nation by providing opportunities for <A HREF="acd002.html#student" TARGET="New">students</A> to pursue high quality academic programs leading to bachelor&#146;s, master&#146;s, and doctoral degrees.  The development of nationally recognized programs in prescribed areas depends upon excellence in other areas; therefore, the commitment is to quality in all undergraduate and graduate programs.  The university&#146;s teaching and research programs help instill in students a spirit of critical inquiry and challenge them to seek answers to fundamental questions of human concern.  Through general studies the university seeks to expand cultural horizons, provide knowledge of the sciences and technology, improve moral and ethical standards, and educate for responsible citizenship.  Quality research programs at the graduate level contribute to and expand knowledge, thereby serving the instructional needs of students, contributing to the professional advancement of the faculty, and enhancing economic, social, cultural, scientific, and technological progress.
