The defect structure for the aliovalent doped nickel oxides and the effect of the heterogeneous doping by Pd are presented.  The mass transport properties in the composites were investigated by a.c. electrical conductivity measurements as a function of time in reduction reaction from pure oxygen to purified argon (PO<sub>2</sub>@ 2x10<sup>-6</sup>atm) atmosphere at various temperature from 900°C to 1100°C.  The chemical diffusion coefficient for the composites was calculated using the above data by approximate solutions of Fick's second law.  The effect of the presence of a second phase on the chemical diffusion coefficient and the activation energy for the composites is discussed systematically.<p><i>Amer.
