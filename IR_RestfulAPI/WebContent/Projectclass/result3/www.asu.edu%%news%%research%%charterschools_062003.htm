      <h2>Morrison Institute report gives state's charter schools high marks</h2>
      <p>        In the first major study ever done on the quality of charter school authorizing,
          15 states earned B- or better grades for their authorizers' work but
          just four received similar marks for the policy environment within
          which charter schools and authorizers function. Massachusetts and Texas
          led the pack while California, Pennsylvania and New Mexico brought
      up the rear.</p>
      <p>Arizona charter authorizers received an average grade of
            B for their chartering practices, placing them ninth among the 24
        jurisdictions rated
          in a new study titled "Charter School Authorizing: Are States Making
        the Grade?" by the Thomas B.</p>
      <p>Fordham Institute and Morrison Institute
          for Public Policy at ASU. Marks ranged from B+ (for the thoroughness
          of their school contracts) to B- (for the quality of their application
          processes and for sponsors' own transparency and accountability), based
          on judgments by knowledgeable observers of the Grand Canyon State charter
          scene. Arizona received a B+ for the charter-friendliness of its "policy
          environment," placing it first among the 24 jurisdictions. Overall,
        Arizona was ranked 3rd in the nation. The full text of the report and
        supporting
        data are available at (www.morrisoninstitute.org).</p>
      <p>"Arizona's charter
          school landscape is friendlier than in most states. And according to
          local experts, such as the charter school operators
          themselves, Arizona's authorizers have created good processes," says
          ASU's Morrison Institute for Public Policy researcher Rebecca Gau,
        co-author of the report. </p>
      <p>"Charter School Authorizing: Are States Making the Grade?"
          examines 23 states and the District of Columbia to determine how supportive
          they
          are of charter schools, how good a job their authorizers are doing,
        and how policy makers could strengthen their states' charter programs.</p>
      <p>Charter
          authorizers are the bodies - they may be local or state school boards,
          universities, mayors' offices, city councils or non-profit groups
          - that give birth to these independently-operated public schools, monitor
          their performance, hold them to account for results, and decide whether
          to renew their charters. More than 500 such entities are now responsible
          for America's 2,700 charter schools, which enroll almost 700,000 students.
          The new study gathered data from nearly 900 people who are knowledgeable
          about authorizer performance in the 24 jurisdictions where most such
        schools are located.</p>
      <p>"Many studies have looked at whether charter schools
          are succeeding," said Dr. Louann Bierlein Palmer of Western Michigan
          University, lead
          author of the study, "but almost nobody has examined the entities that
          are responsible for such schools - the groups on the other side of
        the charter contract. Using 56 criteria, Louann Bierlein Palmer and co-author
        Gau reached these conclusions:</p>
      <p>. Most major authorizers are doing an adequate
          job but mounting red tape is a concern, since autonomy is a key to
        the success of charter schools; <br>
        . Many states are not supportive of charter schools and authorizers;<br>
        . States with fewer authorizers, serving more schools each, do a better
          job;<br>
        . States getting higher grades have authorizers that assist schools
          as well as overseeing them, and serve as advocates for the charter
          movement;
          and,<br>
        . Quality authorizing costs money - and many authorizers don't have
          much.</p>
      <p>"Arizona
          got off to a remarkable start with charter schools," said Fordham Institute
          president Chester E. Finn, Jr. "and the state and its authorizers
          have generally done a solid job. But when our analysts asked knowledgeable
          Arizonans for a 'holistic' grade for the overall charter situation
        in their state today, they recorded a troubling 'B-.' It appears that
        there's
          plenty of room for improvement if policymakers want Arizona to retain
        its reputation as a leader of this promising education reform strategy."</p>
