Following         the lead of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, fifteen American institutions         came to define the American research university: some of them private,         such as Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, Princeton, and Yale; others, state         and land grant universities, such as the University of Pennsylvania, the         University of Michigan, the University of Wisconsin, the University of         Illinois, and the University of California; still others, new universities         made possible by private bequests, such as Stanford, Caltech, MIT, and         the University of Chicago. These institutions have produced the vast majority         of Ph.D.s in the nation for the past one hundred years. Many here today         are graduates of these elite universities, and very nearly everyone who         has attended a college or university in the nation has been taught by         faculty who are their graduates.</p>      <p>Such has been the influence of these fifteen institutions that, to this         day, every university in the nation measures itself according to their         standards. Make no mistake: these universities represent the gold standard&#8212;but,         as I hope to explain, <em>it is the gold standard of the past</em>. These         universities are considered definitive prototypes, and their disciplinary         departments are the departments by which all others are judged. I think         most would agree that academic departments tend to structure themselves         to resemble the most highly-ranked departments in their respective disciplines.       </p>      <p>As a consequence, academic departments tend to resemble one another across         the nation, each more or less a pale reflection of some distant ideal.         Although innovation is celebrated, and new interdisciplinary arrangements         suggest that variation is possible, academic culture on the whole encourages         each department of physics to compare itself to the physics departments         at Caltech and MIT, each department of economics to compare itself to         the University of Chicago, and each department of theater to compare itself         to Yale. </p>      <p>Our nation&#8217;s research universities resemble one another in other         respects as well. They are concerned with a certain academic profile in         their student body. They have defined their academic excellence by the         academic qualifications of their incoming students&#8212;an input-driven         model. ASU will instead focus on outcome-determined excellence, that is,         we will admit students with different interests and indicators of intelligence,         even different levels of high school preparation. We will judge the success         of our university by the success of each student on a case-by-case basis.</p>      <p>Without exception, our nation&#8217;s research universities have made         considerable efforts to encourage diversity and recruit students from         varied social backgrounds. Each undergoes continuous self-assessment in         order to produce exhaustive demographic profiles of each entering class         to demonstrate their successes year after year. Without question these         initiatives have produced solid results. Yet, at heart, our research universities         remain elitist institutions. </p>      <p>Without exception, our nation&#8217;s research universities have made         considerable efforts to engage society&#8212;to reach out to their local         communities. Each announces ambitious initiatives intended to persuade         the socio-economically disadvantaged and underrepresented that they, too,         are among the university&#8217;s constituents, that they, too, are stakeholders&#8212;that         the university belongs to them as well. Without question these initiatives         have made a difference in public perception and community involvement.         Still our research universities sometimes seem like walled enclaves with         little direct engagement with society. </p>      <p>We cannot hope to develop a university that is ubiquitously present,         but we can certainly strive towards that objective, and reach out not         only to our students, but also to the families that send us their children,         and the families that don&#8217;t. The university cannot be set apart         from society, concerned only with the education of the most intelligent         children of its more successful families. Certainly we must accomplish         that task, but in addition we must reach out across the broad spectrum         of society, and seek to have an impact on the daily lives of people from         all social strata. </p>      <p>There are other reasons&#8212;reasons having to do with the heritage         of this state, changing demographics, and economic and environmental factors&#8212;why         the traditional university model is not right for Arizona State University.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p></td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="bottom"><a href="introduction.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="b2.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="b2.htm"><img src="images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
