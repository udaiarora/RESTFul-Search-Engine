Using AFS Commands to Control File Access at Directory Level
</center></h2>

<p>The Andrew File System (AFS) uses Access Control Lists (ACL) as its 
authorization mechanism to control access to files in various 
directories. The ACL for a directory is maintained using the "fs" (file 
server) command. The commands shown below show how to use "fs" to set up 
access rights to a subdirectory for a single user, for a group, or for 
all users on ASU's AFS.</p>

<p>Suppose you wish to give "read" access to all the files in one of 
your subdirectories called "workshop" which is at a level below your home 
directory. The process involved in setting up access to workshop includes 
first giving access to its parent directory. This access should be at 
least of the "lookup" type.</p>

<h3>1.  Giving access to a single ASU AFS user</h3>

<p>Suppose the user you wish to give access to is "abcde", you can
type the following set of commands at the UNIX command prompt:</p>

<dl>
<dt>fs listacl
<dd>this shows the current ACLs)

<dt>fs setacl ~ abcde l
<dd>this sets the ACL for your home directory to "lookup"

<dt>fs setacl workshop abcde read
<dd>this sets the ACL for your subdirectory called "workshop" 
to "read"<p>
<dt>For read access to SAS datasets from SAS 8.x, use:
<dt>fs setacl workshop abcde rlk
<dd>the "rlk" provides read, lookup and lock access
</dl>

<h3>2.  Giving access to all ASU AFS users</h3>

<p>At the UNIX command prompt type the following commands:</p>

<dl>
<dt>fs listacl
<dd>this shows the current ACLs

<dt>fs setacl ~ system:anyuser l
<dd>this sets the ACL for your home directory to "lookup"

<dt>fs setacl workshop system:anyuser read
<dd>this sets the ACL for your subdirectory called "workshop" to read
<p>
<dt>For read access to SAS datasets from SAS 8.x, use:
<dt>fs setacl workshop system:anyuser rlk
<dd>the "rlk" provides read, lookup and lock access
</dl>

<h3>3.  Giving access to a group of ASU AFS users</h3>

<p>Before using the "fs" command, the "pts" (protection server) commands 
are used for creating a group, for adding users to the group, and for 
verifying membership to the group in the following manner:</p>

<dl>
<dt>pts creategroup youruserid:team
<dd>this creates a group called "team" owned by you

<dt>pts adduser -user abcde fghi40 jklm8 -group youruserid:team
<dd>this adds three users: abcde, fghi40, jklm8, to the group

<dt>pts membership youruserid:team
<dd>this verifies the members in the group

<dt>fs setacl ~ youruserid:team l
<dd>this sets the ACL for your home directory to "lookup"

<dt>fs setacl workshop youruserid:team read
<dd>this sets the ACL for your subdirectory called "workshop" to "read"
<p>
<dt>For read access to SAS datasets from SAS 8.x, use:
<dt>fs setacl workshop youruserid:team rlk
<dd>the "rlk" provides read, lookup and lock access

</dl>

<p><em>Caution</em>: Do not re-enter the names of users already included 
in the group list. When AFS detects an existing name in the series being 
added, that name and all subsequent names are dropped from the group 
membership list.</p>

<h3>Other Useful pts Commands</h3>

<dl>
<dt>pts removeuser username youruserid:groupname
<dd>removes a user from the group

<dt>pts delete youruserid:groupname
<dd>deletes a group

<dt>pts rename youruserid:oldgroupname youruserid:newgroupname
<dd>changes a group name

<dt>pts help
<dd>list protection server commands
</dl>
<p>
<h3>Types of access control rights</h3>

<p>The access control rights can be any one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>"l" provides lookup access, i.e., the ability to see the name of a
file (but not the contents).</li>

<li>"r" provides read access, i.e., the ability to read the contents of
a file. (Lookup access is also required.)</li>

<li>"i" provides insert access, i.e., the ability to create a new file
or directory (which inserts an entry into the parent directory).</li>

<li>"d" provides delete access, i.e., the ability to delete an existing
file or directory. (Lookup access is also required.)</li>

<li>"w" provides write access, i.e., the ability to update an existing
file (but cannot create a file). (Lookup access is also required.)</li>

<li>"k" provides lock access, i.e., the ability to lock a file to
prevent simultaneous access by more than one process.</li>

<li>"a" provides administrative access, i.e., the ability to change the
access control rights for the directory.</li>

<li>"read" is a synonym for "rl".</li>

<li>"write" is a synonym for "rlidwk".</li>

<li>"all" is a synonym for "rlidwka".</li>

<li>"none" is a synonym for removing the access control rights</li>
</ul>

Center. More information is available online also by entering any of
the following at the system prompt.
