      <h2>Israeli and Palestinian experts to discuss possibility of peace </h2>
      <p>Representing both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, four participants 
        in past peace negotiations will meet at Arizona State University on Sunday, 
        February 9 and discuss future possibilities for restoring the peace in 
        two public workshops. </p>
      <p>Discussing issues that are key to a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian 
        conflict are Palestinian political analyst Manuel Hassassian, Executive 
        Vice President of Bethlehem University; Palestinian history professor 
        Rashid Khalidi, Director of the Center for International Studies at the 
        University of Chicago; Israeli political science professor Dr. Menachem 
        Klein, expert advisor to Israel's Minister of Internal Security and Foreign 
        Affairs; and Israeli lawyer Daniel Seidmann, an authority on East Jerusalem 
        issues.</p>
      <p>"These are people who have all taken part in the previous peace negotiations, 
        who all know each other and are still in communication," said Jess Schwartz 
        Professor of Modern Hebrew Literature and ASU Jewish Studies faculty member 
        Shai Ginsburg. "The purpose of the workshops is to show that people can 
        still talk reasonably to each other, and are still working to resolve 
        the conflict peacefully."</p>
      <p>Entitled "After Oslo: New Strategies for Middle East Peace," the event 
        begins at 10 a.m. with a two-hour public workshop on the subject of "Can 
        a Peace Process be Reinstated?" and then continues at 2 p.m. with a session 
        on "Overcoming Stumbling Blocks." The free workshops are in the ASU Education 
        Lecture Hall, located just north of Gammage Auditorium. Free parking is 
        available at Gammage.</p>
      <p>The workshops are part of a national series of similar events scheduled 
        to take place in Amherst, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. 
        The ASU event is sponsored by the ASU Jewish Studies Program and ASU's 
        Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict and was made possible in 
        part by a gift from the Marshall Fund of Arizona. Additional support was 
        also provided by the Jewish Federation-Israel Center and Hillel.</p>
      <p>&quot;Many of us have been concerned about developments on campuses nationwide 
        regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict where rhetoric stands in place of 
        knowledge and the complexities of a settlement are not understood,&quot; 
        explained Jack Kugelmass, director of ASU's Jewish Studies Program. &quot;I 
        thought Jewish Studies should play a proactive role here by taking what 
        is in the public mind and using it as an opportunity to teach--to make 
        the public knowledgeable about something very few people understand. The 
        best way to do this was to bring to campus people who are on the front 
        line of negotiating a fair settlement. I'm particularly delighted with 
        what Shai Ginsburg put together and I have a feeling that this will be 
        emulated on other campuses.&quot; </p>
      <p>"This workshop promises to be a very informative discussion on the current 
        state of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and possibilities for its resolution," 
        said Linell Cady, director of ASU's new Center for the Study of Religion 
        and Conflict. "The topic is clearly among the most challenging and important 
        in its ramifications for international affairs. The Center for the Study 
        of Religion and Conflict is happy to co-sponsor an event that is so closely 
        aligned with its own thematic interests." </p>

        brief biographies. For more information on the workshops, please call
