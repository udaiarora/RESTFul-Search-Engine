<P>Locke has written and illustrated an early botany textbook, explaining
plant terminology and classification.&nbsp; The author says that purpose
of his work "has not been to bring forward any thing new in elementary
botany, or to alter what has been before established; but merely to collect
and arrange the most important 'outlines' of the subject in a concise form,
and illustrate them
<BR>by examples of native plants, affording a volume of a moderate price
for the use of schools and students."&nbsp; Locke begins with an introduction
which gives definitions of the basic terms.&nbsp; He then discusses in
succeeding chapters, roots, herbage, and frutification .&nbsp; Then Locke
discusses the classification, anatomy, and physiology.&nbsp; The work ends
with a brief description of the various instruments used by a botanist
as well as an explanation of an herbarium.&nbsp; Then Locke has a section
of questions for the student, followed by 16 plates with explanations.
