      <h2><strong>Mars Scientist Rocked by Kids' Interest in Geology, Stays Committed to Outreach </strong></h2>
      <p>NASA has been talking about how great the public's interest has been in the Mars Rovers, with billions of hits to their websites, but if you want to see the real depth of that excitement, take a look at the photo above. </p>
      <p><img src="research_images/rocks_041304.jpg" width="288" height="188" align="right">The man sitting on the chair is Arizona State University Regents' Professor of Geological Sciences Philip Christensen, lead scientist for the Mini-TES instruments on the rovers, and these days his large office is literally filled with mail crates full of - rocks. This very heavy special delivery is the result of a public announcement Christensen made a few months ago encouraging kids to participate in Mars science through a new NASA-funded outreach program now called "Rock Around the World." </p>
      <p>"And these aren't all of them," Christensen said. "We get about ten cartons a day, maybe as many as 100 packages, and we're processing them and getting them moved out as quickly as we can, but we're still behind. It doesn't seem to be letting up. I want to say that the mail carriers have been really tolerant." </p>
      <p>The program, a partnership between ASU and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, asked children to collect a rock from their hometown, gather a little information about where they found it, and send it to ASU for analysis using the same thermal emission spectrometry that is being used by Christensen's instrument on the rovers. Christensen will then compare the data from this global sample of earth rocks with data he's getting from Mars. </p>
      <p>What is astounding to Christensen is not just the quantity of the response - 3,700 rocks sent for 20 countries and all 50 states - but the high level of involvement from the kids participating. "We asked them to tell us where the rock was found, and if they could its longitude and latitude, but what many of them sent us is much more than that - maps, research on local geology, pictures. we've received some ten-page reports and CD's full of information. Some of these kids have gone <em>totally </em> out of control," he said with a smile. </p>
      <p>Though Christensen thought the outreach program was a good idea when he first came up with it, it has exceeded his expectations. "It's gratifying to see kids get excited about Mars science - the geology and the physics of how we do analysis, not just the gee-whiz 'exploring space' stuff," he said. "I think for some of these students, this may be the beginning of a career in earth sciences." </p>
      <p>The program has also surprised Christensen in going far beyond the amount of personnel (and personal) effort that he expected would be involved. Several staff in Christensen's lab now spend a few hours a day opening mail, cataloging and preparing samples for testing. With JPL funding, Christensen has hired three students (a family team captained by Laurie Rogers, her boyfriend, Chris Edwards, and her mother, Teresa Rogers -- all ASU undergraduates) to do the thermal emission spectrometry. </p>
      <p>Doing the spectrometry is not trivial work. According to Christensen, it takes the team eight hours to test about 40 rocks. Some days, over 100 rocks come in the mail. </p>
      <p>Nor does the effort end there. Staff who ordinarily handle the processing of scientific data for the lab are now also involved in daily preparing the students' data submissions and the accompanying thermal emission results for the JPL web page, where the project has promised to post them. Christensen, who is currently working long nights at JPL on managing the Mini-TES instrument and analyzing the Mars data streaming back, personally signs a certificate for every student, thanking them for participating in the project. </p>
      <p>"I've found that if I really focus, I can sign 400 an hour," he said. While signing certificates may not sound like such hard work, the problem is that the demands of the outreach project come on top of a lab that is already stretched to its limit processing data for the current and ongoing rover missions, which are world-class, once-in-a-lifetime science opportunities. These days, Christensen and his team do not get much sleep. </p>
      <p>Christensen, who is committed to science education outreach, has no regrets, however, and would like to see the program grow bigger. </p>
      <p>"There's been some talk about partnering with some national organizations," he noted. "If this happens, it will mean a big jump in the size of an already large project, but I think that's great. I really like seeing kids getting involved in geology, and, selfishly, it will mean that I will really get a lot of great rocks to study." </p>
