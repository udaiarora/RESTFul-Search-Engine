&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Possession, use, or storage of weapons in on-campus student 
housing is prohibited. Possession or storage of weapons on campus, on University 
property, or at a University-sponsored activity is also prohibited, except in 
very limited circumstances. To avoid creating undue concerns, the use or possession 
of non-operational or model weapons that have the appearance of actual weapons 
or firearms is subject to the approval of the ASU Police. <I>Participants or attendees 
at public or special events held on campus or at University facilities may be 
required to submit to security checks as a condition of entry at the discretion 
of ASU Police.</I> [<A HREF="http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/13/02911.htm">A.R.S.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASU takes seriously its responsibility for creating a community 
  conducive to living, learning and working. In keeping with this responsibility 
  is the establishment of clear rules and regulations regarding the use of controlled 
  substances.<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, ASU adopted a comprehensive policy regarding 
  alcohol and other drugs. Copies of the policy are available from the Office 
  of the Vice President for Student Affairs (965-7293). Detailed information regarding 
  possession, use, and distribution of drugs and alcohol is set forth in ASU's 
  Drug-Free Work Place Statement and Drug-Free Schools and Campuses Act Statement, 
  which is printed in the class schedule. ASU maintains zero tolerance toward 
  the possession, use, distribution and manufacture of illegal drugs. Consumption 
  of alcohol and alcohol advertising, sponsorship and promotions are also addressed 
  in ASU's policy regarding Permits to Serve Alcohol Beverages on Campus. (<A HREF="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/sta/sta106-03.html">STA

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a violation of the law 
  to possess and or consume alcohol anywhere if you are under the age of 21. It 
  is a violation of the law to consume alcohol in public even if you are 21. State 
  Law requires permission must be given for extended premises consumption. It 
  is a felony to posses any useable amount of illegal drug or drug paraphernalia.<BR>

  a course on how to overcome Marijuana and Alcohol use.<BR>
