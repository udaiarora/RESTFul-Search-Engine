<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> <B>Generate the block maps for each region.</B>
MIDPOINTS= defines the midpoints of the ranges described in the legend. NAME=
is a full 8 characters ending in 


<CODE><B>1</B></CODE> so the incremented names
match the regions. NAME= specifies the name of the first catalog entry. Because
BY-group processing generates multiple graphs from one BLOCK statement, the
name assigned by NAME= is incremented to provide a unique name for each piece
of output. These names are automatically assigned to the GIF files. DES= specifies
the description that is stored in the catalog and used in the Table of Contents.
Because BY-group processing is used, the same description is assigned to all
the output.
