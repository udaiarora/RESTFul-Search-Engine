  The following bibliography lists reference material dealing with Indian boarding 
  schools during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These resources include 
  material found in the Labriola National American Indian Data Center in the University 
  Libraries at Arizona State University, websites, and other research facilities. 
  This subject guide is also located on the Labriola Center website at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/labriola.htm">www.asu.edu/lib/archives/labriola.htm</a></p>

  <b>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT BOARDING SCHOOLS</b></p><br>

<table width="90%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="49%">The most famous boarding school for Indian children was the 
      Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania, founded by Richard Pratt 
      in 1879. The philosophy and intent of this and most subsequent schools was 
      to assimilate Indian children by removing them from their native cultures, 
      and teaching them the manners, dress, and job skills that were deemed important 
      by the school founders and administrators. </td>
    <td width="51%">
      <div align="center"><img src="Carlise.jpg" width="402" height="257" alt="Carlise Indian School"></div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br><p>While boarding schools still exist, most had changed their practices of forced 
  assimilation by the 1930s. This bibliography only covers the schools from 1879 
  to 1940. It does not contain any novels. It is not a complete list.</p>
<br><p align="center"><br>
  <b>Books</b></p>
<br><p><i><b>Education for Extinction: American Indians and the Boarding School Experience, 
  1875-1928</b></i>, David Wallace Adams. Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 
  1995.</p>
<br><p><i><b>Away from Home: American Indian Boarding School Experiences, 1879-2000</b></i>,

<br><p><i><b>Boarding School Seasons: American Indian Families, 1900-1940</b></i>, 
  Brenda J. Child. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1993. Child uses interviews, 
  letters from children, and archival sources to describe boarding school life

  and Haskell Institute</p>
<br><p><b><i>American Indian Children at School, 1850-1930</i></b>, Michael C. Coleman.

  of these primary sources is included. </p>
<br><p><i><b>Shaping Survival: Essays by Four American Indian Tribal Women</b></i>, 
  Lanniko Lee, et al. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2002. This book 
  covers the educational experiences of four American Indian women who were educated 
  in schools such as the Bureau of Indian Affiars boarding schools, off-reservation 
  public schools, and Indian mission schools.</p>
<br><p>In addition, these books focus on particular schools:</p><br>
 <blockquote>
   <p> <b><i>To Change Them Forever; Indian Education at the Rainy Mountain Boarding 
      School, 1893-1920</i></b>, Clyde Ellis. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 
      1996 (also available on-line).</p>

            of America, 1953.</p>
 </blockquote>
 <br><p>These two books focus on women's boarding schools started by the tribes themselves, 
  in the 1850s:<br>
  <i><b>Listening to our Grandmothers' Stories; The Bloomfield Academy for Chickasaw 
  Females, 1852-1949</b></i>, Amanda J. Cobb. Lincoln: University of Nebraska 
  Press, 2000<br>
  <b>Cultivating the Rosebuds: The Education of Women at the Cherokee Female Seminary, 
  1851-1909</b>, Devon A. Mihesuah. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1993.</p>
<br><p align="center"><b>Reference Books with Articles on Boarding Schools</b></p>
<br><p>Many of the reference books in the Labriola Center have information on boarding 
  schools. Most of the encyclopedias have articles under such topics as Education, 
  Churches and Education, BIA Schools, Boarding Schoos, etc. Other books, such 
  as <i><b>Statistical Record of Native North Americans</b></i>, will have information 
  that can add to your research.</p>
<br><p align="center"><img src="60bor.gif" width="400" height="21" alt="decorative border"><br>
</p>
<br><p align="center"><b>Journal Articles</b></p>
<br><p>There are several ways to find articles on-line. Here are a few suggestions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>From the Hayden Library's home page, click on Indexes. Under Subject, drag 
    to or type in <i>American Indians</i>, and click on <i>Go</i>. You'll have 
    access to 12 data bases-most of these have encyclopedia-type entries on boarding 
    schools. </li>


  <li>From the Hayden Library's home page, click on Resources, then on E-Journals, 
    then on E-Journals by collection. You'll get a list of many collections; some 
    will be helpful. <i>Annual Reviews</i>-<i>Social Sciences</i>, <i>Cambridge 
    On-line Journals</i>, and <i>JStor</i>, for example, all have articles on 
    boarding schools.</li>
 

  <li><p>From the Hayden Library's home page, click on Indexes, and enter ERIC under 
    the subject. ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) has many articles 
    about boarding schools and all aspects of Indian education. </li> 
</ul>
<p align="center"><br>
  <b>Oral Histories</b></p>
<br><p>The American Indian Oral History Collection contains microfilm transcripts 
  of some 700 interviews with members of the Navajo Nation, and from members of 
  the Pueblo Tribes, some of which deal with boarding schools. Ask for guide E77.6 .G854 2000.</p>
<br><br>
<br><p align="center"><b>Periodicals</b></p>
<br><p>The Labriola Center has a collection of magazines and newsletters from the 
  early twentieth century that were produced by Indian boarding schools, or were 
  about the schools. These periodicals were collected by the Princeton
University Library, the Smithsonian Institution, and the 
State Historical Society of Wisconsin.  These are on microfilm or microfiche. Some examples are:<br>
  <ul>
  <li><i><b>Indian School Journal</b></i>, 1905-1977, published by the Chilocco 
    Indian School</li>
  <li><i><b>The Native American, Devoted to Indian Education</b></i> 1900-1931, 
    precursor to <i>The Phoenix Redskin</i></li>
  <li><b><i>The Phoenix Redskin</i></b>, 1930s and 1940s</li>
  <li><b><i>The Red Man: An Illustrated Magazine Printed by Indians</i></b>, 1909-1917</li>

<br><p>There are finding guides for several collections of personal papers and manuscripts 
      that deal directly with Indian boarding schools. The Dorothy L. Parker Papers, 
      for example, document the closing of the Phoenix Indian School, and the 
      Wayne T. Pratt Papers cover the BIA schools. We also have collections that 
      pertain to different aspects of Indian education.</p>

  <p>A search of the Hayden Library's <a href="http://www.asu.edu/lib/resources/db/amerindx.htm"> American Indian Index </a>will bring up some 
    interesting miscellaneous items. We have an 1885 article from <i>Frank Leslie's 
    Popular Monthly</i> called &quot;Educating the Indians,&quot; about the Carlisle 
    School. More recent articles include testimony from the Shoshone/Bannock Tribes 
    Tribal Education Committee, and a July 1989 report titled &quot;From the Boarding 
    Schools to Self-Determination,&quot; by Washington's Indian Education Office. 
    We also have the following:
     <ul>    
  <li><i><b>Carlisle Indian School Yearbook</b></i>, 1917</li>
  <li><b><i>Carlisle Indian School Annual Reports</i></b>, 1909-1912</li>
</ul>
    
<p align="center"> <b>Government Documents</b></p>
    
<p>The Labriola Center has a number of collections from the National Archives 
  and Records Administration, including 38 reels of the <b><i>Bureau of Indian Affairs Records 
Created by the 
Santa Fe Indian School, 1890-1918</i></b>.  Opened in November 1890, the Sante Fe School provided 
industrial training for children from Indian reservations in Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<br>
<p>Another set of records is the <i><b>Superintendents' 
  Annual Narrative &amp; Statistical Reports from the Field Jurisdictions of the 
  BIA, 1907-1938</b></i> (174 reels documenting the accomplishments of agencies, 
  schools, and hospitals-including maps, photos, and newsletters.)  The <b><i>Statistics of Tribes, Agencies, and Schools</i></b>, published by 
    the BIA, is on the Labriola reference shelf. This is a reprint of a 1903 book that listed all tribes, agencies, 
    and Indian schools, showing their population or enrollment, land holdings, 
    buildings, amenities (such as plumbing), etc.</p>
