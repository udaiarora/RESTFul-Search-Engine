What is the key to a successful Data Warehouse?  Strategy, design, and     implementation!  This book skillfully provides a conceptual and working
model of a successful Data Warehouse process that is developed by using    SAS software. Written for both the business and technical sides of the
house, Welbrock supplies real-life experience with Data Warehousing, not   a theoretical approach. This book delivers the following three-phase
strategy for building a Data Warehouse: 1) Build a Conceptual Data         Warehouse that contains metadata about the business elements required to
fulfill enterprise needs.  2) Transition the business elements that are    documented in the Conceptual Warehouse into a technological lexicon.  3)
Implement the physical Data Warehouse.  Topics discussed that support      the Data Warehousing process are data modeling, data transformation,
multi-dimensional databases, data extraction and storage, warehouse        loading, client/server, and the SAS/Warehouse Administrator.  The
strategy for designing your effective Data Warehouse is found in these     pages!
