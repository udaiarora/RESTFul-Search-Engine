      <h2>Staff, students come unbound by sailing </h2>
      <p align="left">While on a hiking trip in 1984, 18-year-old Jack Oppenhuizen fell 60 feet and severely injured his spinal cord. He was left a paraplegic and in need of a wheelchair. Far from devastated, he learned to adapt and found solace in sailing. </p>
      <p align="left">"I had been very athletic before then, and I had to make some drastic changes," Oppenhuizen says. "But I found an enormous amount of joy in sailing." </p>
      <p align="left">Through the years, and after extensive therapy, Oppenhuizen made amazing progress and is now able to walk again. In or out of a wheelchair, he still finds sailing to be a truly liberating experience. </p>
      <p align="left"><img src="comm_images/ASU-Sailing-Club-4.jpg" width="216" height="321" align="right">Oppenhuizen, currently an ASU graduate student, oversees Voyages Unbound, an innovative community-based program that sponsors several local endeavors, including ASU's Sailing Club. The group operates eight sailboats at Tempe Town Lake, each outfitted with adapted technology, including a joystick-type device allowing disabled participants to operate the boat's controls. </p>
      <p align="left">Oppenhuizen says the club is open to all ASU students, alumni and staff and encourages those interested in trying something new to give sailing a try. </p>
      <p align="left">"Sailing is a powerful experience," Oppenhuizen says. "Through Voyages Unbound, the club is meant to be a fully integrated program between those with and without disabilities working together on the same team." </p>
      <p align="left">ASU alumnus Jake Geller is a member of the club and describes sailing as exciting and empowering. </p>
      <p align="left">"I like the freedom and independence of sailing," Geller says. "It also takes me out of my wheelchair and allows me a chance to interact with others on the <br>
  same level." </p>
      <p align="left">Geller, who was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy at the age of 3, has been using a wheelchair for the past 14 years. Geller says he highly recommends sailing - for both disabled and able-bodied adventure seekers. </p>
      <p align="left">"We are not just a sports club," Geller says. "We also develop leadership skills. My involvement in the club has allowed me to grow as a person." </p>
      <p align="left">ASU Alumnus Loren Worthington recently went sailing with the club for the first time, and says he found the experience to be very relaxing. </p>
      <p align="left">Worthington has been in a wheelchair for the past 18 years due to a sports-related accident, and says Sailing Club members did a great job of introducing him to sailing. </p>
      <p align="left">"Jake and his volunteers do a good job," Worthington says. "They were friendly and safety-conscious at the same time. We all had fun. I use a manual wheelchair to push around Phoenix. It is nice to get in the boat and let the sails do all the work." </p>
      <p align="left">Geller says the club will continue sailing through the spring, but unlike most parts of the country, summer sailing in Arizona is far from ideal. </p>
      <p align="left">"The sailing season here is basically reversed from most areas," he says. "It is just too hot and the wind dies down during the summer." </p>
      <p align="left">For more information about Voyages Unbound and ASU Sailing Club activities, call Oppenhuizen at (602) 570-5300 or go to (www.asu.edu/clubs/sailing). </p>
