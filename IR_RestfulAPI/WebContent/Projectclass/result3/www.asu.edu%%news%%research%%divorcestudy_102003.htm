      <h2>Study finds equal time important for children of divorce</h2>
      <p>Young adults whose parents have divorced believe it's
            best to live equal time with each parent, and they appear to be right,
            according to a new
          study by an ASU researcher. </p>
      <p>Psychology Professor William Fabricius reports
          in the October issue of the journal Family Relations (published by
        the National Council on Public
          Relations) that college-age young adults who say they had more time
        with their divorced fathers as they were growing up, years later have
        higher
          quality relationships with them. And an improved relationship with
        the father did not lessen the child's relationship with the mother.</p>
      <p>The finding
          is based on ongoing surveys of more than 3,000 students in ASU Introduction
          to Psychology classes. The majority of the students
          were 18 - 20 years old and their average age when the divorce occurred
          was eight or nine.</p>
      <p>"We always say we want to do what is best for the children
          when it comes to divorce," says Fabricius. "But too often we don't
        know what that is,
          because we have seldom asked them for their perspectives and beliefs.
          These students have lived through their parents' divorces, and they
        are telling us in several ways that the issue of living arrangements
        is central
          to their later adjustment." </p>
      <p>Among the key findings of the study:</p>
      <p>. The students reported closeness
          rose and anger decreased toward their father, based on living arrangements
          with the father, ranging from little
          or no time all the way up to approximately equal time with both parents. </p>
      <p>. The students saw their relationships with both parents independently.
          The students reported no change in closeness or anger toward their
        mother, as they spent more time with their father.</p>
      <p>"A mother shouldn't worry that
          more time with dad will harm her relationship with the child," says
        Fabricius.</p>
      <p>. The students who had either a lot of
          time or equal time with dad actually had better relationships with
        both parents than students from married
          families. Students from married families felt angrier and less close
          toward their fathers than their mothers, although the differences were
          small. But in divorced families with either a lot of time or equal
        time with dad, there were no differences in how students felt toward
        their
          mothers and fathers.</p>
      <p>"Their relationships with both parents were optimal,
          at the top of the scales," says Fabricius.</p>
      <p>. What hurt were attempts
          by one parent to undermine the child's relationship with the other
        parent, especially by interfering or making it difficult
            for them to spend time together. Students reported that 35 percent
            of mothers and 27 percent of fathers did this. This backfired and
        caused long-term anger and resentment in the children toward the offending
            parent. </p>
      <p>The study was a follow-up to a 2000 study in which Fabricius and student
          Jeff Hall found that 70 percent of students reported the best living
          arrangement for children would be equal time with both parents. Of
        the students who actually lived in an equal arrangement, more than 90
        percent
          said it was best. The students reported that they and their fathers
        both wanted more time together, but that their mothers did not agree.</p>
      <p>"The
          new findings show the kids were right," Fabricius says. "Equal time
        or close to it does appear to be the best for children and their parents."</p>
      <p>The
          journal article "Listening to Children of Divorce: New Findings That
          Diverge from Wallerstein, Lewis and Blakeslee," points out the findings
          vary dramatically from the conclusions long-time divorce researcher
        Judith Wallerstein and her colleagues drew in an influential 2000 book
        reporting
          a 25-year follow-up to Wallerstein's original study on divorce and
        parental relationships. </p>
      <p>"They underplay the importance of sharing residential
          custody, but back in the early 1970's when they recruited families
        to study, few did that,"
        Fabricius says.</p>
