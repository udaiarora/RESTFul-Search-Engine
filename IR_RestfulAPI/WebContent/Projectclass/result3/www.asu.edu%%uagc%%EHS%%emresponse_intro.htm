       <p align="left"><font size="2"> Emergencies, disasters, accidents, injuries, and crimes can occur without warning at any time. Being physically and psychologically prepared to handle unexpected emergencies is an individual as well as an organizational responsibility. </font></p>

       <p align="left"><font size="2"> This Emergency Response Guide has been developed to assist in minimizing the negative affects from such events. Please read this guide thoroughly before an emergency occurs, become acquainted with the contents, and keep this flipchart available in your office for immediate reference. Place your Building Name, Room #, and Supervisors Name and phone number on the front cover. </font></p>

       <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong> DO NOT FILE THIS DOCUMENT!!!</strong></font></p>

       <p align="left"><font size="2"> Once you are familiar with the information enclosed, you will be better prepared to protect yourself and your co-workers.

       <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong> EMERGENCY RECOVERY AT ASU </strong></font></p>

       <p align="left"><font size="2"> After an emergency occurs, recovery is the next step. ASU is insured for losses to University-owned property (real and personal), and injury to non-employees such as student, patrons, visitors, and volunteers (liability), and injury to employees while on-the-job (workers&rsquo; compensation). However, a claim must be generated in order to make the loss known to appropriate ASU representatives, and ultimately to the ASU&rsquo;s self-insurance provider.</font></p>

       <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong> For Property and Liability Losses </strong></font></p>

       <p align="left"> <font size="2">Property claims that exceed $10,000 must be reported within 24-hours. Property claims less than $10,000 must be reported within 90 days. A death on campus or serious injury to a patron, student, or visitor must be reported within 24-hours to Insurance Services at: (480) 965-1851 or (602) 524-5107. Information on filing and various claim forms are available at: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/purchasing/insurance/">http://www.asu.edu/purchasing/insurance/</a></font></p>

       <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong> For Workers&rsquo; Compensation Losses </strong></font></p>

       <p align="left"> <font size="2">All workers&rsquo; compensation claims must be reported verbally within 48-hours of the occurrence by calling (602) 542-9675. Questions regarding workers&rsquo; compensation should be directed to Human Resources at (480) 965-2701. Information and forms for filing a workers&rsquo; compensation claim are available at: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/hr/benefits/workers_compensation.html">http://www.asu.edu/hr/benefits/workers_compensation.html</a></font></p>

       <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong> For Follow-up on Potential or Sustained Injuries</strong></font></p>

       <p align="left"><font size="2"> Whether or not a claim is filed, report all accidents and incidents involving potential or sustained injury to an individual on ASU property to the Environmental Health &amp; Safety Loss Prevention Coordinator at (480) 965-0975. Information and forms for filing an accident and incident report are available at: <a href="http://www.asu.edu/fm/Risk/riskforms.htm">http://www.asu.edu/fm/Risk/riskforms.htm</a></font></p>
