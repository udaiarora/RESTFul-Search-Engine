      <h2>'Stretch' rewrites ending to struggling students' futures</h2>
      <p>        In the early 1990s, faculty members in ASU's department of English were
          facing a frustrating reality - more than a third of students taking
          ENG 101 and ENG 102 were failing. Students coming to the university
          with low test scores and academic deficiencies were especially at risk.</p>
      <p>ASU
            English professors wondered how they could help under-performing
        students become capable writers and ultimately successful graduates.</p>
      <p><img src="campus_images/stretchprogram_090103.jpg" width="252" height="170" align="right">The
          answer came in 1994 with the Stretch program, which has been so successful
          it is now used as a model for several universities throughout the nation.
          Last spring, President Michael Crow recognized the program by giving
          those involved an ASU President's Award for Innovation.</p>
      <p>The idea for the
          program came from John Ramage, associate professor of English, and
        David Schwalm, vice provost for Academic Programs and Services
          at ASU East. In 1991 they began a pilot program, which was the basis
          for the Stretch program. The concept was simple, but highly effective.
          What struggling writing students need to succeed is more time to practice
          writing.</p>
      <p>The name of the Stretch program is fitting. ENG 101 is stretched
          over two semesters instead of one. Students take Writing Across the
        Curriculum (WAC) 101 their first semester and then take ENG 101 the next
        semester.
          Stretch students usually take both classes with the same instructor
        and same students. </p>
      <p>Karen Dwyer, a senior lecturer with the Department of
          English, serves as the Stretch program coordinator. She says all students
          have the potential
          to be skilled writers, but some need a bit more attention and encouragement.</p>
      <p>"When
          students get more teacher time, more time working on assignments and
          more time making friends in their Stretch classes, they are likely
          to flourish," Dwyer says. "They find that they have a support system
          because the program is designed to help them succeed."</p>
      <p>And there is no
          doubt the students are succeeding. Stretch students consistently pass
          ENG 101 and ENG 102 at a higher rate than their counterparts not
          in the program - those students who initially scored higher on achievement
          tests.<br>
        Dwyer says teachers in the Stretch program are very committed to their
          students. </p>
      <p>"Many of our teachers have repeatedly asked to teach Stretch
          classes even though they could have other teaching assignments. They
          like getting
          to know their students over the whole school year, and they can see
        that they are making a real difference in the classroom," Dwyer says. </p>
      <p>ASU
          Executive Vice President and Provost Milt Glick says the Stretch program
          is an impressive example of what can be achieved when creative
          individuals step back from an issue and give it a fresh look. </p>
      <p>"They were
          able to design a new approach that has a much higher success rate,
        both in the course and in the follow-up courses, and provides excellent
          learning in the area of composition, a critical skill for success across
          the board," Glick says.</p>
