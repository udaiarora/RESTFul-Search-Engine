      <h2>Bernstein joins NSF, Allison to serve in interim</h2>
      <p>        ASU Graduate Dean Bianca Bernstein will serve the next two years as director
          of the National Science Foundation's Graduate Division. Maria Allison
          has been appointed interim dean of the ASU Graduate College.</p>
      <p>Bernstein
            says she is looking forward to working with NSF. </p>
      <p>"I will have
          the opportunity to influence the national agenda on graduate education,
          which will surely help ASU, as well as all other universities,"
          she says. "Expanding my contacts in the national and international
        networks of decision makers and academic and agency leaders will be advantageous
          for ASU during my tenure at the NSF and upon my return to the university.
          I look forward to participating in a very exciting phase of re-conceptualizing
          graduate education, working among a group of extremely talented and
        accomplished
          national leaders and learning much more about the world of competitive
          funding."</p>
      <p>Milton Glick, executive vice president &amp; provost, said Bernstein's
        appointment "is very good for ASU, just as the Woodrow Wilson National
        Fellowship Foundation Responsive Ph.D. initiative was two years ago.
        This positions us very well in Washington. It's a very exciting time
        for Dean Bernstein and for ASU."</p>
      <p>With Bernstein's NSF appointment, ASU
          has appointed two new deans to serve in the Graduate College.</p>
      <p>Allison will serve as interim dean and
          Filiz Ozel will begin her duties as associate dean for academic programs,
          effective May 16.</p>
      <p>Allison joined
        the faculty in the recreation management &amp; tourism
        department in 1984. She became associate dean for academic programs in
        the Graduate College in 2001. Allison earned her Ph.D. at the University
      of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. </p>
      <p>Ozel has been a member of the faculty
        in the School of Architecture, in the College of Architecture &amp; Environmental
        Design, since 1995. Formerly the assistant director of the School of
        Architecture and the
        interim director of the interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in Environmental
        Design &amp; Planning, Ozel has advised graduate students on theses and
        dissertations, served as a graduate student mentor and taught research
      methods and numerous other graduate-level courses.</p>
      <p>Graduate programs have
          greatly expanded during Bernstein's eight years as dean. ASU has added
          12 new degree programs, seven certificate programs
          and seven concentrations in that time. ASU has created 17 new interdisciplinary
          programs and is tied for the national lead with three Integrative Graduate
          Education Research and Traineeship (IGERT) programs. The Graduate College
          has continued to make program quality a major priority, evidenced by
          rewarding outstanding doctoral mentors, coordinating Teaching Assistants
          orientation, funding the Research Conference Award Program and the
        Millennium Interdisciplinary Dissertation Fellowship awards.</p>
      <p>"I am very proud of
          what we have accomplished in these eight years and remain appreciative
          of the opportunity to serve the university in this
          capacity," Bernstein said. "We have raised the visibility of graduate
          education in a national context, and I look forward to taking ASU's
        best practices to Washington, D.C."</p>
      <p>Bernstein will direct a budget of $140
          million and oversee numerous graduate award programs at the NSF. Bernstein
          will also serve as the incoming
          president for the Western Alliance of Graduate Schools (WAGS), for
        2003 - 04. ASU will host the 46th Annual General Meeting of WAGS March
        5 -
          7, 2004. The conference will feature workshops, topical discussions
        and presentations, among other activities. </p>

          can be reached at (480) 965-6426, or (djdurb@asu.edu).<br>
