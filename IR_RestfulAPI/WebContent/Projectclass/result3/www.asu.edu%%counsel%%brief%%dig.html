&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, copyright law has grown in importance in educational and research
environments.  Issues include establishing internal policies regarding copyright ownership
created at or at the instruction of the institution; educating institution personnel and establishing
policies regarding the use of others' copyrighted works; the "copy shop course packet" cases and
the examination of the "fair use" doctrine (concluding that the practice of collecting and binding
copyrighted works, even for academic and educational purposes, without permission from the
copyright owners, is generally not a fair use); other "fair use" implications; and other issues at the
crossroads of copyright law, advancing technology, and educational, research, and non-profit
institutions. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In response to concerns regarding liability for online service providers ("Service
Providers" or "SPs") for copyright infringement, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
("DMCA") was passed in October, 1998.  The DMCA addresses what Service Providers must do
to enjoy the copyright infringement liability limitations in a section called "Online Copyright
Infringement Liability Limitation Act" or "OCILLA."  Also covered in the DMCA is a section on
Copyright Protection and Management Systems ("CPMS"), which addresses liability limitations
regarding technologies that protect access to copyrighted works, good faith computer and
encryption research, and related issues.   This summary is an overview of the DMCA, focussing
mostly on OCILLA with some references to the CPMS.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Under the OCILLA,</U> a Service Provider that (a) implements a policy of terminating usage
accounts of repeat infringers, (b) informs account holders of the SP's "no infringement" policy,
and (c.) does not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to protect
their works <U>may qualify for immunity from copyright infringement claims</U> for (1) transmitting,
routing, and providing connections to material ("transitory digital network communications"), (2)
intermediate and temporary storage of material ("system caching"), (3) information residing on
the system at the direction of others, (4) referring or linking users to sites containing infringing
material ("information location tools"), and (5) "good faith removal" of infringing material <EM>(i.e.</EM>,
SP's obligation to remove or disable access to infringing material).</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OCILLA requires a "<U>notification" process</U> by which a party claiming infringement notifies
the SP.  The process also requires a <U>"counter notification" process</U> by which the accused infringer
can reply, explaining away the alleged infringement.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Liability limitation for nonprofit educational institutions.</U>  OCILLA provides specific
protection for nonprofit educational institutions:  (1) faculty members or graduate student
employees, who meet certain criteria, shall be considered persons "<U>other than the institution</U>" for
certain infringement claims (<EM>i.e.</EM>, the institution may escape liability for the ill deeds of
employees), and (2) the knowledge or awareness of infringement by faculty members or graduate
student employees, who meet certain criteria, "<U>shall not be attributed to the institution</U>" (<EM>i.e.</EM>, the
institution may escape liability for infringement <U>even if</U> the wrongdoing employees knew they
were infringing, providing the institution complies with provisions on responsiveness to
infringement claims.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>CPMS</U> prohibits the circumvention of technology tools that protect access to and use of
copyrighted works, including the manufacture and trafficking in devices used to circumvent
protective technological measures.  However, for certain uses, the CPMS provides exemptions
for nonprofit libraries and educational institutions, including the right to access a copyrighted
work to determine whether to acquire a copy; reverse engineering of computer programs for
certain research; circumvention to develop interoperability of computer programs; circumvention
to perform certain encryption research and security testing; and others.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>The DMCA provides for civil and criminal penalties for violations.</STRONG></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we enter the new millennium, many "intellectual property" issues once relegated to
"intellectual property" attorneys are now equally likely to be management issues that regularly
impact administrators, professors, students, lawyers, and others. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of the DMCA,<A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> educational professionals must remain aware of
changing copyright law and policy and act to monitor and protect their institutions.  Relevant to
education and research institutions are DMCA provisions establishing limitations of liability for
copyright infringement for online/Internet services providers (hereafter "SPs"; <EM>e.g.</EM>, "online
service provider" ("OSP"),  "Internet service provider" ("ISP"), search engines, and others);
providing "safe harbor" copyright liability limitations for system caching; establishing notice
(and counter notice) provisions as part of liability limitation; establishing liability limitations for
nonprofit educational institutions; prohibiting the circumvention of technological protection for
copyrighted works; prohibiting tampering with copyright management information used to
identify and protect rightful owners; and establishing liability limitations for copyright
infringement for computer maintenance and repair needs.  The first four items above are found in
OCILLA; the next two are found in CPMS.  The DMCA defines "SP" broadly, providing ample
room to seek coverage for our organizations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, general issues of copyright have become more important and prominent
on university campuses, in classrooms, in courtrooms, and on our desks.  The copyright cases
that first attracted the attention of university administrators and lawyers were the "course pack"
or "copy shop" cases,<A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> which focussed on the practice in which instructors created a package of
class materials, often physically prepared and bound by a photocopy business, so that students
would have all necessary materials in one volume.  "Course pack" cases forced the "fair use"
issue forward, culminating in only limited guidance for compliance.<A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  The "fair use" analysis,<A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>
famous and infamous on college campuses, provides some direction; however, concerns exist
that educators may conclude that a work is fair game for fair use simply because it is being used
for an "educational" purpose (<EM>i.e.</EM>, simply because of its use at a college or university); such a
conclusion is not necessarily correct and can be fraught with peril.   As copyright law provides
for statutory damages (<EM>i.e.</EM>, actual harm need not be proven; only infringement need be proven),
mistaken infringement can still result in money payments).  Further, though the law says that
States and state employees are subject to copyright law, the 1998 <U>Chavez v. Arte Publico Press</U>
case addressed Eleventh Amendment<A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> sovereign immunity for copyright infringement against a
state entity, holding that Eleventh Amendment immunity may protect states against copyright
claims in federal courts.  Note well:  <U>Chavez</U> is controlling law only in the 5th Circuit.<A HREF="#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A></P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as those of us charged with overseeing copyright compliance were beginning to
understand copyright analyses for course pack and fair use, the exponential growth of technology
has provided an electronic frontier replete with issues in need of attention. </P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright law comes from Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of the  U. S. Constitution.<A HREF="#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A>  The
Copyright Act of 1976 establishes rights and remedies regarding copyrights, existing in <STRONG>original
works of authorship that are fixed in any tangible medium of expression</STRONG>, now known or
later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated,
either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.  The amount of creativity required for
copyright is minimal; however, the arrangement of simple facts is not sufficient.  In short, if a
work is original, involves some, even if limited, element of creativity, and is fixed in a tangible
medium, it is protected by copyright laws.<A HREF="#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>  In educational environments, copyright may appear
as books, journals, magazines, newspapers, works created in courses, electronic versions of the
foregoing, software programs, digitized images,<A HREF="#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A> and others. Copyright protection is also
available for compilations and derivative works.<STRONG></STRONG></P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright protection begins as soon as a work of authorship, eligible for protection, is
sufficiently fixed in a tangible medium of expression; notice (e.g., "Copyright 199___" or the "c"
symbol") is no longer required. <STRONG></STRONG></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are <STRONG>eight categories of protectable subject matter:</STRONG>  literary works; musical
works; dramatic works; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic and sculptural
works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works; and sound recordings; and architectural
works.  Specifically excluded from protection are ideas which are inseparable from their
expression.  The way one expresses an idea or concept is protectable; the underlying idea or
concept is not.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The<STRONG> exclusive rights</STRONG> of the copyright owner include the rights: to reproduce the
copyrighted work; to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work; to distribute
copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or otherwise; to perform the
copyrighted work publicly; to display the copyrighted work publicly.  Without permission from
the copyright owner, one cannot engage in any of the exclusive rights.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright protection is also available for <U>interactive works</U>,<EM> </EM>such as video games and for
<U>live transmissions</U>, such as the live broadcast of a baseball game.</P>

<P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Length of copyright protection</STRONG> has changed under different Copyright Acts; the date of
creation and/or publication defines the term under the applicable Act.  In October, 1998, the Sony
Bono Copyright Term Extension Act<A HREF="#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A> was enacted to extend the term of copyright protection. </P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Infringement</STRONG> is the inappropriate use of another's copyright, and the aspect of intent is
not relevant in establishing infringement.   Intent may impact the extent or amount of damages
awarded (<EM>i.e.,</EM> the amount of damages may differ depending upon whether the infringer acted
willfully or not); however, intent neither creates nor negates infringement. <STRONG>Contributory
infringement</STRONG> is a claim against those who induce or cause copyright infringement by another.
<STRONG>Vicarious liability</STRONG> for copyright infringement exists when one has the ability to supervise the
infringing activity of another and a financial interest in the infringing activity.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	The remedies</STRONG> available to a wronged copyright owner include injunctions (court orders
wrongdoer to stop), destruction of infringing goods, payment by wrongdoer to copyright owner
of damages (actual loss and wrongdoer's profits), statutory damages (<EM>i.e.,</EM> damages outlined by
the statute), and others.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Fair use </STRONG>is a body of copyright law that allows use of another's work in center limited
circumstnaces which require a balancing analysies using the following factors:  the purpose and
character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;  the nature of the copyrighted work;  the amount and substantiality of the
portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and the effect of the use upon the
potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.  Note well:   just because a proposed use is
for and/or relates to education, research, or academics, does not necessarily mean that the use is
fair.<A HREF="#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A></P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Organizations should establish copyright use and management policies to miminize
risk of damages</STRONG>.<A HREF="#N_12_"><SUP>(12)</SUP></A>  Though copyright owners can seek/collect statutory damages, an
organization's behavior may become important in assessing damages and addressing contributory
infringement and various liability claims.  The organization that establishes, disseminates, and
enforces policies that prohibit violations of copyright law may be able to limit its liability when
employees violate copyright laws.  Creating a <U>culture of compliance</U>,<EM> i.e.</EM>, making employees and
students aware of the law and the university's policies and making it known that the university
expects compliance, may help to minimize infringement and will allow the university to distance
itself from individual employees' wrongful behavior.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>THE DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT</STRONG></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To protect copyright owners from infringement, to protect service providers from
expanding liability risks,<A HREF="#N_13_"><SUP>(13)</SUP></A> and to provide additional guidance to the general public, the DMCA
was enacted.  Though general aspects were discussed above, the following information outlines
the portions of the DMCA most applicable to university, research, non-profit, and similar
institutions.<br>

<STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Transitory digital network communications.</STRONG>  An online service provider ("SP") shall
not be liable for money damages or for injunctive relief for infringement of copyright because of
the SP's transmitting, routing, or providing connections for material through a system or network
controlled or operated by or for the SP, or because of the intermediate and transient storage of
that material in the course of such transmitting, routing, or providing connections, if:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>the transmission was initiated by someone other than the SP; </LI>
  <LI>the transmission, routing, provision of connections, or storage is carried out through an
automatic technical process without selection of the material by the SP; </LI>
  <LI>the SP does not select the recipients of the material except as an automatic response to
another's request;</LI>
  <LI>no copy of the material made by the SP during such storage is maintained on the system
and is ordinarily accessible to anyone other than anticipated recipients; </LI>
  <LI>no such copy is maintained on the system or network in a manner ordinarily accessible to
such anticipated recipients for a longer period than is reasonably necessary; and</LI>
  <LI>the material is transmitted through the system or network without content modification by
the SP.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	System caching</STRONG>.  An SP shall not be liable for money damages or for injunctive relief for
the intermediate and temporary storage of material on a system or network controlled or operated
by or for the SP when:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>the material is made available online by one other than the SP; </LI>
  <LI>the material is transmitted from the non-SP through the system or network to a person
other than the non-SP person at the direction of that other person; and</LI>
  <LI>the storage is carried out through an automatic technical process to make the material
available to users of the system or network who, after the material is transmitted as
described above, request access to the material from the person described above <EM>(i.e.</EM>, the
original submitting party), if the following conditions are met:</LI>

</ul>
<P><STRONG>Conditions:</STRONG> the material is transmitted to subsequent users without content modification; the SP
complies with the submitter's rules concerning the refreshing, reloading, or other updating of the
material in accordance with a generally accepted industry standard data communications
protocol; the SP does not interfere with the ability of technology to return to the original
submitter the information that would have been available to that person if the material had been
obtained by the subsequent users directly from the original submitter.  The preceding clause
seems to require that SPs allow unfettered return to the submitting party of recipient information,
including responses and personally identifying information, if such is normally available,
providing: such technology does not significantly interfere with the performance of the SP's
system or network; is consistent with generally accepted industry standard communications
protocols; and does not wrongfully extract information from the SP's network. <U></U></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Other conditions include</STRONG>:  if the original submitter imposes access/response conditions,
<EM>e.g.</EM>, <U>fee payment, password, or age verification</U><A HREF="#N_14_"><SUP>(14)</SUP></A>, the SP permits access to the stored material
only to users who have met those conditions; and if the original submitter makes that material
available online without the authorization of the copyright owner of the material, the service
provider responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be
infringing upon notification of claimed infringement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Information residing on systems or networks at the direction of users</STRONG>.  An SP shall
not be liable for money damages for infringement of copyright because of the storage at the
direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for
the SP, if the SP</P>

<UL>
  <LI>does not have actual knowledge that the material is infringing; </LI>
  <LI>is not aware from facts or circumstances that infringing activity is apparent; </LI>
  <LI>upon obtaining such knowledge, acts expeditiously to disable access to the infringing
material; </LI>
  <LI>does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity; and </LI>
  <LI>upon notification of claimed infringement, responds expeditiously to disable access tothe
infringing material.</LI>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2"></UL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	SPs must establish a designated agent to receive notices of copyright infringement</STRONG>.
The above limitations on liability <U>apply only if</U> the SP has designated an agent to receive
notifications of claimed infringement by making agent contact information available through its
service, including on its website in a location accessible to the public, and by providing to the
Copyright Office,<A HREF="#N_15_"><SUP>(15)</SUP></A> with the following information:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>the name, address, phone number, and electronic mail address of the agent;</LI>
  <LI>other contact information which the Register of Copyrights deems appropriate.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The Register of Copyrights shall maintain a current directory of agents<A HREF="#N_16_"><SUP>(16)</SUP></A> available to the public
for inspection, including electronic and hard copy formats, and may require payment of a fee by
service providers to cover the costs of maintaining the directory.</P>

<P>      </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Notification<A HREF="#N_17_"><SUP>(17)</SUP></A> of claimed infringement must be</U> written,  provided to the SP's designated
agent, and must include:  a physical or electronic signature<A HREF="#N_18_"><SUP>(18)</SUP></A> of a person authorized to act on
behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; identification of the
copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; identification of the material that is claimed to
be infringing and reasonably sufficient to permit the SP to locate the material; information
reasonably sufficient to permit the SP to contact the complaining party; a statement that the
complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is
not authorized; a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty
of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive
right that is allegedly infringed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A notification that fails to comply substantially with the foregoing provisions shall not be
considered in determining whether an SP has actual knowledge of infringing activity.  However,
if the notification fails to comply substantially with the above provisions, <U>but substantially
complies</U> with the second, third, and fourth provisions, then the SP enjoys limitations of liability
only if it promptly attempts to contact the person making the notification or takes other
reasonable steps to assist in the receipt of notification that substantially complies with all the
identification provisions.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Information location tools</STRONG>.  An SP shall not be liable for money damages for
infringement of copyright by reason of the SP referring or linking<A HREF="#N_19_"><SUP>(19)</SUP></A> users to an online location
containing infringing material or infringing activity, by using information location tools
(including a directory, index, reference, pointer, or hypertext link) if the SP</P>

<UL>
  <LI>(1) does not have actual knowledge that the material or activity is infringing; is not
otherwise aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent; or
upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove or disable
access to the material;</LI>
  <LI>(2) receives no financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, when the
SP can control such activity; and</LI>
  <LI>(3) upon notification of claimed infringement, responds expeditiously to remove or
disable access to the infringing material.</LI>

</UL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Limitation on liability for nonprofit educational  institutions.</STRONG></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<u>Transitory digital network" and "system caching</U>."  When a public or other nonprofit
institution of higher education is an SP and when a faculty member or graduate student who is an
employee of such institution is performing a teaching or research function, for purposes of the
"transitory digital network communications" or "system caching" issues, such faculty member or
graduate student <U>shall be considered to be a person other than the institution</U> (<EM>i.e.</EM>, less chance of
liability for SP; more chance for personal liability for individual infringer).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	"<U>Information residing on systems" and "information location tools.</U>"  For the purposes of
"information residing on systems/networks at direction of uses" or "information location tools"
analysis, such faculty member's or graduate student's knowledge or awareness of his/her
infringing activities <U>shall not be attributed to the institution if</U></P>


<UL>
  <LI>such individual's infringing activities do not involve the provision of online access to
instructional materials that are or were required or recommended, within the preceding
3-year period, for a course taught at the institution by such faculty member or graduate
student; </LI>
  <LI>the institution has not, within the preceding 3-year period, received more than 2
individual notifications of claimed infringement regarding such faculty member or
graduate student, and such notifications of claimed infringement were not actionable
under the below section on "misrepresentation" (<EM>i.e.</EM>, such claims were not flawed as
defined in 17 U.S.C. 512(f));  and</LI>
  <LI>the institution provides users of its system with information that describes and promotes
compliance with the U. S. Copyright laws.  </LI>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2"></UL>

<P>Presumably, making copyright policies and related materials available online will address this
"education" function requirement - and will, hopefully, serve to inform those who need to know
the rules.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Misrepresentations</STRONG>. Any person who knowingly, materially misrepresents that material
or activity is infringing or that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or
misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by
the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner's authorized licensee, or by an
SP, who is injured by reliance upon such misrepresentation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Replacement of removed or disabled material and limitation on other liability</STRONG>.  In
general, SPs will not be liable for good faith removal of material,  regardless of whether the
material or activity is ultimately determined to be infringing.  The foregoing liability limitations
shall not apply to material residing at the direction of a subscriber of the SP on a system
controlled or operated by or for the SP to which access is disabled by the SP, unless the SP</P>


<UL>
  <LI>takes reasonable steps promptly to notify the subscriber that it has disabled access; </LI>
  <LI>upon receipt of a counter notification, promptly provides the person who provided the
original notification with a copy of the counter notification and informs the original
notice submitter that it will replace the previously removed material or cease disabling
access in 10 business days; and</LI>
  <LI>replaces the removed material and ceases disabling access not less than 10, nor more than
14, business days following receipt of the counter notice, unless its designated agent first
receives notice from the original notice submitter that he/she has filed an action seeking a
court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the
material on the SP's system.</LI>

</UL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Identifying infringers</STRONG>.  The OCILLA provides that a copyright owner or designee can
seek a subpoena to require an SP provide the identity of an alleged infringer .</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Counter notification</STRONG>.<STRONG>  </STRONG> If an SP responds by removing information or disabling access to
a notice of claimed infringement, and another party believes that the first notice is incorrect or
inapplicable, the second party can so notify the SP.  This counter notificaiton notification must be
written, provided to the SP's designated agent, and </P>

<UL>
  <LI>include a physical or electronic signature of the subscriber; </LI>
  <LI>identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled;</LI>
  <LI>the location at which the material appeared before it was removed; </LI>
  <LI>a statement, under penalty of perjury, that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the
material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification; </LI>
  <LI>the subscriber's name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber
consents to certain jurisidictional and serivce processs.</LI>

<P>This provision seems to allow for an endless hall-of-mirrors series of back-and-forth allegations,
termed "dueling notifications" by a colleague, for SPs to manage.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Conditions for eligibility</STRONG>.  These limitations on SP liability shall apply to an SP only if it
has adopted and reasonably implemented, and informs its subscribers and account holders of, a
policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of accounts of the SP's
subscribers and account holders who are repeat infringers and accommodates and does not
interfere with standard technical measures.  <STRONG>In other words:  establish, distribute, and enforce
policies</STRONG>.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Scope of relief</STRONG>.<STRONG>   </STRONG>With respect to conduct other than that which qualifies for the
limitation on remedies set forth above, the court may grant injunctive relief with respect to an SP
only in one or more of the following forms:  </P>


<UL>
  <LI>an order restraining the SP from providing access to infringing material or activity
residing at a particular online site on the provider's system or network; </LI>
  <LI>an order restraining the SP from providing access to a subscriber or account holder of the
SP's system or network who is engaging in infringing activity and is identified in the
order, by terminating the accounts of the subscriber or account holder that are specified in
the order;</LI>
  <LI>such other injunctive relief as the court may consider necessary to prevent or restrain
infringement of copyrighted material specified in the order of the court at a particular
online location, if such relief is the least burdensome to the service provider among the
forms of relief comparably effective for that purpose.</LI>

</UL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the SP does qualify for the above limitation on remedies, the court may only grant
injunctive relief against an SP in limited circumstances.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
<br>
("CPMS") (17 U.S.C. § 1201, <EM>et seq.</EM>)</STRONG></center>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the OCILLA outlines the steps which SPs can take to minimize their liability for
copyright infringement, the CPMS addresses the different types of technology used to protect
information, technology, copyrighted works, and use of and access to them.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<STRONG>The circumvention of copyright protection systems is prohibited</STRONG>.  The CPMS
prohibits the circumvention of technological measures that are in place to protect copyrighted
works.  This provision is good for organizations wanting to protect and commercially exploit
their copyrighted works; however, the enforcement methods (<EM>e.g.</EM>, trying to identify and locate
wrongdoers) seem somewhat complicated, like tracking down e-mail spammers and other
cyberspace outlaws, who are often unknown and difficult to find.  </P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Also important is the provision of <U>review periods for analysis of the law's impact</U> on
various fields - including non-profits and educational institutions. The Librarian of Congress will
publish a list of a class of copyrighted works which the Librarian has determined that non-infringing uses are, or are likely to be, adversely affected by the DMCA.  Though protection of
copyright owners' works is important, the areas which Congress wants to monitor (<EM>e.g.</EM>, libraries,
distance education, <EM>et al.</EM>) indicates the acknowledged importance of the convergence of the
Internet, electronic communication, and (higher) education.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Also prohibited by the CPMS are the manufacture, import, and trafficking in any
technology, product, service, device, or component that is primarily designed/produced to
circumvent a technological measure that controls access to a protected work; has only limited use
other than to circumvent; or is marketed by someone who knows such is being used to
circumvent.  Not only is circumvention prohibited, engaging in the industry supporting or
assisting such prohibited actions is likewise prohibited. </P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Other rights are not affected</STRONG>.  Other rights, remedies, limitations, or defenses to
copyright infringement, including fair use, are not affected by this Act.   CPMS neither enlarges
nor diminishes vicarious or contributory liability for copyright infringement regarding technology
or otherwise. </P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Exemption for nonprofit libraries, archives, and educational institutions</STRONG>.<STRONG>   </STRONG>Nonprofit
libraries, archives, and educational institutions can,  without being in violation of the
circumvention prohibition,  access a commercial copyrighted work to determine whether to
acquire a copy for the sole purpose of permitted conduct.  A copy of a work gained under this
exemption may only be used for the determination and may be kept no longer than needed to
make the determination.  Though this exemption only applies to a work when an identical copy is
not reasonably available in another form,  Congress, nevertheless, provided a specific exception
for many educational institutions in assessing works that they may want to obtain.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Qualifications for exemptions</STRONG>: impacted collections must be open to the public or
available not only to researchers affiliated with the institution, but also to other persons doing
research in a specialized field.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Reverse engineering and further exemptions for certain research</STRONG>:  under certain
conditions, a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a computer program may
circumvent a technological access control to a particular portion of that program for the sole
purpose of identifying and analyzing portions of the program that are necessary to achieve inter-operability of an independently created computer program with other programs.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Circumvention to allow interoperability</STRONG>.  Despite the manufacturing and distribution
prohibitions, a person may develop and employ technological means to circumvent a
technological measure or to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure to enable
the identification and analysis, or for the purpose of enabling inter-operability, to the extent that
doing so does not otherwise constitute infringement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Permissible acts of encryption research</STRONG>:  it is not a violation to circumvent a
technological measure as applied to a copy phonorecord, in the course of good faith encryption
research, if the researcher lawfully obtained the encrypted copy; such act is necessary for the
research; the researcher first made a good faith effort to obtain authorization; and such act does
not otherwise constitute infringement.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Factors in determining exemption</STRONG>.<STRONG>  </STRONG>In determining whether an encryption exemption
applies, consider whether the information derived from the encryption research was
disseminated, and, if so, for what purposes; whether the researcher is engaged in a legitimate
course of study or work regarding encryption; and whether the researcher provides the work's
copyright owner with his/her findings.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Security testing</STRONG>.  It is not a violation to engage in security testing, if such act does not
otherwise constitute infringement.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Be aware of changes/updates</STRONG>.<STRONG>  </STRONG> Be on the lookout for revisions, as the DMCA requires
reports from the Register of Copyrights and the Assistant Secretary for Communications and
Information of the Department of Commerce to be submitted to Congress on the effect this
section has on <U>encryption</U>; the adequacy and effectiveness of technological measures designed to
protect copyrighted works; and protection of copyright owners against the unauthorized access to
their encrypted copyrighted works.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Protection of personally identifying information</STRONG>.  In addition to addressing legal and
policy matters regarding protection of copyrighted works and development of new technologies,
encryption and otherwise, Congress has taken steps to allow the public to seek privacy
protection.  The DMCA permits circumvention of a technological measure if the technological
measure, or the work it protects, is capable of collecting personally identifying information
reflecting online activities; in the normal course of its operation, the technological measure
collects personally identifying information without providing notice of such collection or
dissemination to the user and without providing the user with the ability to prevent or restrict
such collection; the act of circumvention has the sole effect of identifying and disabling the
collection capability;  and the act of circumvention is carried out solely for the purpose of
preventing the collection or dissemination of personally identifying information.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<STRONG>Removal or alteration of copyright management information</STRONG>.   No person shall,
without the authority of the copyright owner or the law, intentionally remove or alter any
copyright management information; distribute or import for distribution copyright management
information knowing that it has been removed or altered; or distribute, import for distribution, or
publicly perform works, copies of works, or phonorecords, knowing that copyright management
information has been removed or altered. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Civil remedies</STRONG>.  Any person injured by a violation of CPMS may bring a civil action in
U. S. district court.  The court may grant injunctions to prevent or restrain a violation, but can not
impose a prior restraint on free speech or the press.  The court may order the impounding of any
device or product in the alleged violator's custody or control that the court believes was involved
in a violation; may award damages; may allow the recovery of costs by or against any party other
than the United States or a U.S. officer; may award attorney's fees to the prevailing party; and
order the modification or the destruction of any device or product involved in the violation that is
in the custody or control of the violator or has been impounded.  These remedies can provide
warnings to individual employees, who may not otherwise understand and appreciate (or want to
understand) the ramifications, including personal liability, for copyright infringement.
Establishing disciplinary personnel actions for violations of copyright law, just like for violations
of any other law, may be worth considering.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Criminal penalties</STRONG>.  Any person who violates the above restrictions  willfully and for
purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain is subject to fines of not more than
$500,000 or imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both, for the first offense; and fines of
not more than $1,000,000 or imprisonment for not more than 10 years, or both, for any
subsequent offense.  <STRONG>Limitation for nonprofit library, archives, or educational institution</STRONG>.<STRONG>
</STRONG>The foregoing criminal penalties shall not apply to a nonprofit library, archives, or educational
institution.<STRONG></STRONG></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>	Innocent violations</STRONG>.  The court may reduce or return the award of damages in any case in
which the violator convinces the court that the violator was not aware and had no reason to
believe that its acts were violations.  When nonprofit libraries, archives, or educational
institutions appear to be culprits, the court shall remit damages in any case in which the library,
archives or educational institution convinces the court that it was not aware and had no reason to
believe that its acts constituted violations.</P>
