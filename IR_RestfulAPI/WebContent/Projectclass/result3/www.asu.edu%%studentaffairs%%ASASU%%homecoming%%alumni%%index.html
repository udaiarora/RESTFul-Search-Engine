			    Arizona State University is excited to put on a week of events that highlight
			    all of those areas.Â  As the years have passed since your graduation, it
			    is understandable that time has become more precious and those little

			    ever, the ASU is urging all Alumni to return to their Alma Mater to see
			    and experience all the fantastic changes that are happening all over the
			    ASU campuses.Â  For all of you who have said, â??Oh, Iâ??ll go next yearâ?? this
			    is definitely the year to come back!Â  Weâ??ve got events for the whole familyâ??some
			    educational and thought-provoking and all of them certainly entertaining.Â 
			    So, October 20-22, bring the entire family and experience what Arizona
			    State is so proud to call Sparkyâ??s Homecoming FestDevil: Maroon and Gold
			    Feverâ?¦Itâ??s Contagious.</p>
