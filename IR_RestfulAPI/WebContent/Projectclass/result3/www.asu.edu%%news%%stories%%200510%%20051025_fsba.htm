<h1 class="storyhead">Hooping it up: Faculty, staff take time for friendly competition</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>One by one, ASU faculty and staff members trickle into the Physical Education West gym at the Tempe campus, make their way over to a person holding a coffee can and draw out a colored paperclip. Teams assemble according to paperclip color as basketballs begin to fly at the baskets. <em>Swoosh.</em> After a few minutes of shooting around, play begins.</p>
<p><img src="images/Hoopsters4.jpg" width="175" height="249" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The scene repeats itself from 11:30 a.m. &ndash; 1 p.m. every Monday, Wednesday and Friday for members of the Faculty-Staff Basketball Association. The association comprises ASU faculty and staff members and provides a midday break for some friendly competition and exercise.</p>
<p>&quot;Participants get a good workout, social interaction with their peers and the chance to experience the joy of a game that we all love,&rdquo; says Department of Exercise and Wellness professor emeritus Chuck Corbin, who was instrumental in the organization of the association in the early 1980s. &ldquo;We have even been studied to see what physical benefits are derived from participation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some members of the FSBA have been playing together at the school for more than 20 years, with the number of faculty and staff members playing basketball growing as time passed. Since its inception as an official organization in 1993, the FSBA has seen its numbers increase to more than 50 members and average daily participation hover around 20 to 30 players.</p>
<p>&quot;People just come out to have fun,&rdquo; says Anne Kelsen, a research specialist in the School of Life Sciences and current FSBA president. &ldquo;They exercise and don&rsquo;t generally care about winning or losing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot;Except for me,&rdquo; adds Kelsen, who played basketball for the University of Rhode Island. &ldquo;I want to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paperclip color determines five-person teams. Usually, more than 10 people show up, so the FSBA uses multiple courts, with games going simultaneously. Games are played to 12 points, one point per basket, and winners stay on the court, but rules are in place to ensure that everyone can play at least two games over their lunch break.</p>
<p>Journalism professor George Watson, like Corbin, has been playing basketball at the university long before there was ever an official faculty-staff organization. He says having an association with structured rules helps keep the games fun for everyone.</p>
<p>&quot;By randomly assigning the teams, it doesn&rsquo;t let the competitive element take over,&rdquo; Watson says. &ldquo;The person you&rsquo;re playing against in one game could easily be your teammate in the next game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Watson, members of the FSBA are not the only ones to benefit from the organization.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the entire university benefits from anything that promotes faculty and staff wellness,&rdquo; Watson says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s social interaction, and in a sense, it&rsquo;s interdisciplinary. Ultimately, I think it pays academic dividends, as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="images/Hoopsters3.jpg" width="250" height="284" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Longstanding members, like Corbin, 65, and Watson, 62, remember that before the FSBA was organized, it was a struggle to play exclusively faculty-staff basketball games. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, faculty, staff and students all shared the three courts inside the West gym.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, we liked to compete but wanted to avoid injury, which was not always possible when playing with students who sometimes played a rougher game and felt that if you were on the court, you should play rough,&rdquo; Corbin says. &ldquo;In the years prior to the FSBA, there were a lot of injuries, and arguing over rules and fouls. I broke three ribs. There were even a few fights and threats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Student Recreation Complex was opened in 1989, students playing in the West Gym dropped off considerably, while the number of faculty and staff members playing there increased. In 1993, the FSBA officially formed and lobbied Recreational Services to set aside a block of time in the West gym for the FSBA to play exclusively. Bylaws were drawn up and officers were chosen, with Watson serving as the first president. Since that time, the organization has remained relatively unchanged, with only the faces rotating as new faculty and staff members join and older ones retire. For younger members, the FSBA is more than just a basketball association &ndash; it&rsquo;s a chance to be around mentors.</p>
<p>&quot;Coming here and being around people who&rsquo;ve been here for so long keeps you excited about the university,&rdquo; says Information Technology staff member Jeremy Marcott, 25, who started playing with the FSBA four years ago when his boss encouraged him to join. &ldquo;The type of game is more skilled, which emphasizes the team concept, not just showboating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The FSBA is open to all faculty and staff members and games take place Monday, Wednesday and Friday, with play beginning promptly at 11:30 a.m. People interested in joining are encouraged to show up ready to play &ndash; and to introduce themselves. Watson stresses that the FSBA is for players of all ages and abilities.</p>
<p>&quot;By all means, if you enjoy playing, we have room for you,&rdquo; Watson says.</p>
