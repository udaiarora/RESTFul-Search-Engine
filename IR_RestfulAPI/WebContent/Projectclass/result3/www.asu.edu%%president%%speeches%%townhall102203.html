                    Remarks by President Michael M. Crow</p>
                  <p>Good afternoon. I want to welcome everyone to this town hall 
                    session. The purpose of this meeting is a simple one: to get 
                    folks together and have a chance to talk about where we are, 
                    where we are going, what we have achieved and what we hope 
                    to achieve. </p>
                  <p>First, let me start off by saying the report being printed 
                    through the ASU Alumni Association in the <em>ASU Vision Magazine</em> 
                    is a summary of our collective efforts this year. I want to 
                    thank all of you for your contributions to what I think has 
                    been a very successful year at Arizona State University. If 
                    you look through the document, you will see significant achievement 
                    across a number of areas with regard to students, faculty, 
                    initiatives, community outreach and a range of things. All 
                    of these achievements are possible only as a function of the 
                    hard work of not only all of you who are here, but all of 
                    your colleagues and partners who are not here. </p>
                  <p>Before talking about the report specifically, I want to talk 
                    about where we are. I don&#8217;t know how many of you are 
                    familiar with the University&#8217;s history and how we have 
                    evolved, but we are in what I would characterize as the sixth 
                    evolutionary step of a territorial normal school into a national 
                    university. Some of you may have heard me talk about this 
                    before: most universities are designed at the time of their 
                    origin for what they ultimately want to be. Some universities 
                    are not and they go through one or two steps. </p>
                  <p>We are embarking on the sixth step in a very short period 
                    of time. We were only established in 1885, we became a state 
                    college in the 1920s, a state university around 1960, and 
                    most of our PhD programs had evolved by the early 1970s. We 
                    didn&#8217;t offer any graduate degrees until the 1940s. We 
                    had been rapidly evolving through a range of evolutionary 
                    steps, from a territorial teachers college to a normal college, 
                    to a state college, to a comprehensive state college, to a 
                    state university, and now the step from a state university 
                    to a national university. </p>
                  <p>National universities are places like the University of Minnesota, 
                    Ohio State, UCLA, and the University of Texas. Those are national 
                    universities, and we are stepping up to that challenge. What 
                    do I mean by national university? I mean it is an institution 
                    that is competing at the highest possible level in all aspects 
                    of its identity: its academic programs, its specialty programs, 
                    its athletic programs. Here is an example: the University 
                    of California at San Diego was founded around 1960 and was 
                    designed from the day that it opened to be a national university. 
                    In forty years, they haven&#8217;t achieved that yet but they 
                    almost have. Within the next ten years or so they will achieve 
                    it. </p>
                  <p>When this institution opened, what was our mission? To train 
                    a few teachers for a very small state with a highly disbursed 
                    population which had no other colleges. This was it. In 1925, 
                    when we became a state college, it was pre air-conditioning. 
                    The population of metropolitan Phoenix in 1925 was under 150,000; 
                    it was small. So, what they needed in metropolitan Phoenix 
                    then, and what Arizona needed then, was a small state college 
                    for what was then a small state. By 1960, the population of 
                    metro Phoenix was about 600,000 and this small state college 
                    had a hard time servicing a major metropolitan area that was 
                    growing and evolving. By then, high tech companies had moved 
                    in, air-conditioning came along, and more and more people 
                    wanted to be here. The economy was diversifying, the population 
                    was diversifying, and metro Phoenix clearly saw itself as 
                    ultimately becoming a major city. Major cities do not have 
                    small state colleges as their only public university. They 
                    have universities. So, against the wishes of the regents, 
                    against the wishes of the Legislature, the people of Arizona 
                    voted to establish Arizona State College as Arizona State 
                    University. Just because it was voted in as a state university, 
                    however, did not make it so. You then have to build it, and 
                    so the aspiration at that particular point was to build a 
                    good, solid, high-performing state university. That has been 
                    done. That has been accomplished. That has been accomplished 
                    in a very outstanding way. </p>
                  <p>Now, metropolitan Phoenix has three and one-half million 
                    people, growing to 7 million people or 8 million people, and 
                    the state&#8217;s 6 million people is growing to 10 or 12 
                    million. In big cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, 
                    San Francisco and Seattle there are major national-class universities 
                    competing on a national basis for everything. That is our 
                    next step. We have not achieved that step. If you calculate 
                    each of the steps that we have taken, it is the sixth step. 
                    I would not necessarily call it the final step because I do 
                    not know what the world will look like 200 years from now 
                    or what might be required. At that point, we may be building 
                    global universities connected into multicultural communities 
                    in ways that we can not even imagine at the moment. </p>
                  <p>Six steps of evolution in a little more than a hundred years 
                    is huge. Almost no institution has had to go through that; 
                    certainly almost no university has had to go through that. 
                    Step six is essential for the success of metropolitan Phoenix 
                    and the success of Arizona, and this report is an early summary 
                    of the initial things that we have undertaken collectively 
                    to prepare ourselves to take step six. Overall, step six is 
                    probably something on the order of a twenty-year process, 
                    and maybe we would spend five years preparing to take that 
                    step, ten years taking the step and five years sort of evening 
                    out once the step has been taken. This is the end of the first 
                    year of the first five years of preparing to take the step. 
                  </p>
                  <p>What do we need to do to take the step in this particular 
                    setting? We need to be able to meet our three great challenges: 
                    grow and enhance our quality, expand our research enterprise 
                    and imbed the university in the community more deeply. This 
                    report, which represents the work of many people, is an effort 
                    to communicate both to the community within the university 
                    and to the community external of the university how we are 
                    preparing to take the step. Let me talk about the elements 
                    of the step by going through the Table of Contents page. </p>
                  <p>The first section that we focus on in the report is the culture 
                    of academic enterprise. How many of you have heard me talk 
                    about the enterprise model, or being more entrepreneurial? 
                    It means, to boil it down very simply, being responsible for 
                    ourselves, being responsible for our own destiny, plotting 
                    our own course, and moving forward and behaving in ways where 
                    we do not act and think like an agency of the government but 
                    we act and think like a university, an independent creature. 
                  </p>
                  <p>How many of you were at the naming gift ceremony for the 
                    new Piper Memorial Trust Creative Writing Center? That group 
                    of nine or ten faculty members from the English department 
                    and the Theatre department and the staff that work with them 
                    and the students that are a part of that program represent 
                    in every possible way everything that I mean when I say academic 
                    enterprise, academic entrepreneurial behavior. It is not linked 
                    to the Business school, the Engineering school, or the Science 
                    departments; it is linked to the faculty members and students, 
                    and the groups that have a vision for what they want to be 
                    and take extraordinary steps to advance that vision. That 
                    faculty group has built writing clinics; they built the national 
                    meeting; they have done a range of things to advance their 
                    agenda. It was relatively easy when an outside group came 
                    along and wanted to invest in the university, settled on the 
                    humanities as an area, and then settled on this particular 
                    group because they represented academic enterprise in every 
                    way: highly achieving, highly productive, high standards, 
                    a vision for their own future from themselves. Not from us, 
                    not from me, themselves. That is what I mean by a cultural 
                    of academic enterprise. </p>
                  <p>It also means projecting so that people will invest in us, 
                    not as a function of our resource deficiencies, not because 
                    we have financial needs or budgetary needs, though we certainly 
                    do. The three investments that we have received this year 
                    are extraordinary in the sense that they are unprecedented 
                    in the intuition&#8217;s history. The people of Arizona, through 
                    their representatives, gave us 185 million extra dollars on 
                    top of all the other dollars that we could put together to 
                    build some research facilities. They did that because they 
                    felt that we could parlay those investments into an expanded 
                    and more successful nationally competitive university, and 
                    that university would have a positive impact on this community 
                    as a function of that investment. Second, we received two 
                    $50 million naming gifts. Well, that really was not what they 
                    were. They were two private sector $50 million investments 
                    in our aspirational goals. The College of Business set an 
                    aspirational goal of being among the top 25 of all Colleges 
                    of Business in the country, and the Engineering School likewise. 
                    Outside folks believed that we could attain that goal if we 
                    worked hard and were willing to invest in us to help us to 
                    attain that goal. We did not go to any of those three sources 
                    of additional investment in the university and ask them to 
                    please help us because we need your help, please help us because 
                    we are under-funded, please help us because we lack resources. 
                    They sensed the energy of an enterprise wanting to move forward 
                    and all of those investments were a product of that. </p>
                  <p>The second section of the report is on academic transformations. 
                    Why that term academic transformation? Academic transformation 
                    does not mean that what is going on here now is not good or 
                    high quality, but as in all institutions striving to achieve 
                    greatness, you have to continue to transform yourself to move 
                    in that direction. The transformation process for us is one 
                    of stepping up and focusing on that continual improvement 
                    process. We have identified in the report several items related 
                    to institutional achievement: the new School of Life Sciences, 
                    which I think will go down over the next several decades as 
                    a huge achievement of our faculty who have conceptualized 
                    this new approach to the Life Sciences and our staff that 
                    work with them; the movement in the creation of a new Computer 
                    Sciences Institute and the moving of the Institute to Downtown 
                    Tempe on Mill Avenue; the formation of the consortiums for 
                    rapidly urbanizing regions. All of these are meant to indicate 
                    that this is not a static institution. The new Center for 
                    Conflict and Religion is another example of an academic transformation. 
                    So, in this part of the report we are talking about groups 
                    driven by faculty and staff with high aspirations for what 
                    they can achieve academically, driving new conceptualizations 
                    of themselves forward, transforming our little version of 
                    the academy. We will transform the institution by bottom up 
                    initiatives coming from faculty and staff who want to do new 
                    things and achieve new levels of greatness, as self-assembled 
                    groups. The report highlights about 15 or so of those as examples 
                    of how we are evolving. </p>
                  <p>We also move toward academic transformation by hiring key 
                    people, leaders, exemplars, high achievers who come into the 
                    midst of the rest of us, and by example and by interaction 
                    and by sheer energy, energize the rest of us, not because 
                    we are not energized enough, but because we can always be 
                    energized more. We can always be energized to move in new 
                    directions. New appointments like Dean Reiter in the College 
                    of Architecture and Environmental Design are a new energy 
                    force. Another new person is Kevin Gover in the Law School. 
                    He brings a new perspective, a new dimension, a new focus, 
                    new energy, and new experiences. The report also focuses on 
                    faculty achievements: Guggenheim Fellows, the high number 
                    of high achievers on our faculty. We have tried to identify 
                    those folks and what they do. </p>
                  <p>Academic transformation is also driven by the energy and 
                    achievements of our students, and we tried to highlight those 
                    achievements, what those students have done, what they mean, 
                    what they represent for us. We will be transformed academically 
                    as a function of new ideas and new teaming driven by ideas 
                    from our existing staff and faculty, new faculty and leaders 
                    coming to help energize us more and what are students are 
                    able to achieve. </p>
                  <p>Research innovation is the second challenge of the university 
                    that I mentioned just a few minutes ago. The second challenge 
                    in becoming a national university, to have the kind of impact 
                    on this community that we need to have, to become recognized, 
                    to increase our value proposition to the people that invest 
                    in us, including to the state of Arizona, is to increase our 
                    research activity by at least a level or a factor of three. 
                    That factor of three &#8211; about $400-500 million a year, 
                    depending on how we calculate where we started - is the critical 
                    mass necessary to compete among the great national universities. 
                    That is the minimum necessary to even be observable on a national 
                    map of academic research intensity. </p>
                  <p>Right now we are proud to say that we are ranked 10th among 
                    all universities in the U.S. in athletics. Just suppose that 
                    we are ranked 90th in research and 10 years ago we were ranked 
                    90th and, even though we have been growing dramatically in 
                    these last 10 years, we have not grown dramatically enough 
                    to alter our position. That ranking, by the way, is a proxy 
                    for the competitiveness of our creative ideas in those arenas 
                    where people are willing to pay for those ideas. This particular 
                    section of the report is a projection of the unbelievable 
                    achievements that our faculty and staff and our students have 
                    attained now, where we are, which will position us for where 
                    we need to be. The report segments these achievements. Which 
                    of these research achievements are advancing the human condition? 
                    Which of these achievements are helping to understand what 
                    we are as a species? Where we came from? What we might be 
                    becoming? How we are evolving? How does the universe work? 
                    These are fundamental questions that, if successful in addressing, 
                    we change everything about who we are, what we are, and how 
                    we see ourselves. </p>
                  <p>A critical element of our research agenda is to make sure 
                    that our research is not esoteric to the place in which we 
                    live. We have highlighted the research that we are doing that 
                    has an impact on this region or focuses on this region because 
                    we are not here to do research that does not have an impact 
                    at all on the place in which we live. And then lastly, and 
                    perhaps most importantly, the report includes examples of 
                    the creative energy that is out there, coming from anywhere, 
                    in any subject, any discipline, any perspective. </p>
                  <p>We are not here, by the way, to be an institution that only 
                    teaches and transforms and tries to be great and makes discoveries. 
                    We are also here to try to add additional value to the public, 
                    and so the last section focuses on public service. When you 
                    hear me talk about social embeddedness it means enhanced levels 
                    of public service and direct connections. We talk about the 
                    socioeconomic impact of the university, the impact we have 
                    as a social economic force, as a change agent, as a teaching 
                    mechanism out in the community. Our impact on the Pre K-12 
                    educational arena is an area that we have highlighted. We 
                    talk about the specific impact we have on our communities. 
                    Not the kinds of things we are hoping to do, but this is a 
                    report on things that we are doing. For instance, ASU West 
                    received the highest score among 400 U.S. colleges on their 
                    public engagement level, setting an example for other universities. 
                    We talk about the impact of our public television station, 
                    KAET. It is the third or fourth most watched public television 
                    station in the U.S. It is a powerful tool, and we walk you 
                    through what has been achieved. Three hundred thousand K-12 
                    students watch programs distributed to their classrooms by 
                    that station. </p>
                  <p>This university has achieved much in this year. I believe 
                    that we have successfully taken the first baby steps towards 
                    this transformation of step six, transformation to a national 
                    research university. It is a long road. There will be many 
                    reports on our progress. This is a huge institution. We picked 
                    examples, exemplars, things that make the point, things that 
                    get across the progress that is being made. The hope is that 
                    over time we will have an opportunity to recognize everyone 
                    and all of their achievements. We will not be coming back 
                    to the same people when we advance these types of documents 
                    in the future. </p>
                  <p>As far as I know, we have never produced a document like 
                    this before. So, why would we do this? We have a huge communications 
                    challenge both inside and outside the university. This is 
                    a diverse institution. It is a complicated institution with 
                    many, many different programs and many, many different academic 
                    subcultures. If you go out beyond the institution into the 
                    community of investors, who will invest in an institution 
                    they do no know anything about? Who will invest in an institution 
                    that would say we do not have an annual report of our progress? 
                    Not very many people. This is an annual report of our progress 
                    toward attaining a new objective. The hope is that it will 
                    help us within the community to understand what is going on, 
                    what we are doing, and that it will help us outside of the 
                    community to have people get a sense of where we are going. 
                    Not as a school or a college or a department or a program 
                    or a center, but as a university. We are working to get the 
                    message out about what we are doing, what we are achieving, 
                    and it is significant. </p>
                  <p>One of the things we have to overcome both within the university 
                    and outside the university is our own view of ourselves. This 
                    is a great university, and it is going to be even greater. 
                    This is a tremendously successful institution achieving much. 
                    Here is some evidence of some of those achievements, not all 
                    of them, some of them. Not everyone in our community views 
                    it that way. Not everyone in the university views us that 
                    way. This report is a part of that process. This meeting is 
                    a part of that process, so we can talk about this report and 
                    where we are. It is as a part of the process of taking this 
                    step towards building a national university that we are here 
                    today. </p>
                  <p>One last point before we open up the floor for comments and 
                    questions. The building of a university, the setting of an 
                    agenda, the advancement of our message, the transformation 
                    of the institution along the lines we are talking about &#8211; 
                    we are right in the middle of it. We are a very successful 
                    state university trying to become a unique national university 
                    in a unique place. We have a long way to go. The institution 
                    is probably funded at 50% of the level that is needed to carry 
                    out the mission we have, 50%. Tremendous things have been 
                    done with the limited funding. The people of Arizona, by the 
                    way, are the most significant contributor to this institution 
                    and person for person they are also the most generous contributor. 
                    The alumni contribute very little to this university, almost 
                    nothing financial. That is not true at other successful national 
                    universities. Private donors contribute very little to this 
                    university, almost nothing by comparison. The students themselves 
                    and the families through tuition contribute very little. Our 
                    tuition revenue, if I get the number right, is $150 million. 
                    The University of Michigan&#8217;s tuition revenue is $450 
                    million and they have fewer students. For us, that extra $300 
                    million could mean substantial increases in financial aid, 
                    substantial improvements in access, substantially enhanced 
                    salaries for all staff, substantial expansion of faculty, 
                    larger number of advisors, better repair of our buildings, 
                    all the things that we need. So those of you who think that 
                    the solution rests with the ability of the administration 
                    of the university to sell the Arizona Legislature are incorrect. 
                    Our future rests in our ability to dream what we want to be 
                    and sell it to everyone: to students, to families, to donors, 
                    to alumni, to everyone. That is what we are trying to do. 
                    This report is but one tiny little piece of that. </p>
                  <p>Let me switch gears for one moment, not withstanding anything 
                    I have said. We are as we speak mounting the most significant 
                    campaign yet to secure additional investment from the people 
                    of Arizona through their representatives in the Legislature. 
                    We will be asking them for a roughly $60 million increase 
                    in the base budget of this university, a huge increase at 
                    exactly the wrong moment in the state&#8217;s fiscal history. 
                    We need those resources to help with the cost of additional 
                    students and to help maintain the quality of our academic 
                    programs and access to the universities. This will be a major 
                    undertaking and, if we are successful, $60 million is a lot 
                    of new resources to invest in the university to make up our 
                    funding deficiencies. We will need everyone&#8217;s help to 
                    advance this idea. You will see us out there fighting, and 
                    I hope as we advance forward, as I glance around from side 
                    to side, I will see some of you there fighting with us. </p>
                  <p>We have to make the case that ASU must have resources to 
                    maintain quality and to maintain access or the university 
                    will have to begin moving in the direction of doing something 
                    that we do not want to do. There are certainly some on this 
                    faculty and some on this staff who think we should have shut 
                    off the university to qualified students a long time ago. 
                    I do not intend to do that but we must have the resources 
                    to move forward, the resources we need to educate our students, 
                    to maintain access to the university. </p>
                  <p>At this moment, by the way, the university is becoming more 
                    diversified then ever, more accessible then ever, more open 
                    to qualified students then ever, more engaged in the community 
                    then ever. This is not the time to say we are all full, you 
                    can go somewhere else because at least in this state there 
                    is nowhere else to go to achieve a full scale university education. 
                    So we have to advance this university by seeking additional 
                    resources from our prime investor: the people of Arizona. 
                    However, I do not want you to take that to mean that is the 
                    pathway to our success. It&#8217;s not. Go back to my example 
                    of the University of Michigan. The University of Michigan&#8217;s 
                    appropriation from the people of Michigan is larger then ours 
                    but not dramatically larger then ours. And even if they gave 
                    us the exact same appropriation as the University of Michigan 
                    gets from the people of Michigan, it would not be enough to 
                    save the day. It would not be enough. We are going to go in 
                    to test it, bump it up by $60 million in a single year, and 
                    that will help us. </p>
                  <p>We have a lot of other work to do, a lot of people to sell 
                    on our idea about what a great university is so they can invest 
                    in it. We have been trying to demonstrate in the past year 
                    through a number of different examples what it takes to do 
                    that.</p>
                  <p>I will stop talking and see if any of you have anything you 
                    want to add to the conversation. We have a microphone in the 
                    front. It will be most efficient if you line up behind the 
                    microphone rather then wait for each person to walk over. 
                    If you don&#8217;t want to use the microphone and shout out 
                    your question, you can, and I&#8217;ll repeat it for the people 
                    who can&#8217;t hear you.</p>
                  <p>Q: Can we expand distance education to expand our role without 
                    accruing as much cost in doing so?<br>
                    A: So far no one has proven you can reduce costs through distance 
                    education electronically. It actually turns out, at least 
                    for the moment, that it costs more in some ways because you 
                    need to prepare the material, invest in the material, so there 
                    is a start up cost that we have not figured out completely 
                    yet. Second, it is a part of our strategy to expand distance 
                    education dramatically as a way of helping us manage the student 
                    population that we have where that technology might be appropriately 
                    used which is far from everywhere. It is also a way for us 
                    to reach out into the community more broadly for students 
                    that are place bound for particular reasons. We are hoping 
                    to be able to do that. We have a good foundation to build 
                    from. I think we offered 60,000 credit hours from some form 
                    of digital or distance originated education, although my numbers 
                    might be wrong. We already have a good foundation to build 
                    from, we just need to expand it dramatically. However, it 
                    is not free. It requires a huge upfront investment to get 
                    something like this going. But that is a good point. </p>
                  <p>Q: With a twenty year process ahead of us, what do I see 
                    in the next year, next four or five years. Basically, where 
                    are we going? <br>
                    A: I want to say that I literally believe the single most 
                    important thing we have to make progress on is mind set. The 
                    mind set that we are not an agency of the state of Arizona. 
                    We are a creation of the state of Arizona with the free will 
                    to build the enterprise that we want to build. I actually 
                    see that as critically important. You will see me working 
                    with others to try to make as many examples of how that works. 
                    More funding, more gifts, more focused investments around 
                    that. You will see a lot of that within the next year and 
                    more of that in the next four years, if we go up to that five-year 
                    benchmark. </p>
                  <p>One of the things we have got to change is the way we accrue 
                    resources, so one of the things we are hoping to do in the 
                    next year is to begin the process of rethinking our financial 
                    planning and budgetary processes so that deans can be empowered 
                    to be the front run leaders. It turns out that it should be 
                    the deans and the staff on the front line, and not the president 
                    and provosts. We are only a few people, just a handful of 
                    us. We have to take a certain set of directions and positions 
                    but it is really at the school level, at the college level, 
                    at the unit level and at the centers that people have to be 
                    advancing the agenda. So, you are going to see us putting 
                    in mechanisms that help facilitate that, and we are trying 
                    to learn together right now. We are in that learning mode. 
                    We are learning what that means and how to do that because 
                    that is not how we worked in the past. So that&#8217;s the 
                    second thing we have to do. </p>
                  <p>With the Arizona BioDesign Institute, we basically said that 
                    ASU has the capacity to build a world-class research institute. 
                    We have never built one and we are saying we are ready to. 
                    We went out and found a leader, George Poste, we hired a bunch 
                    of faculty, and we took some of the best research groups. 
                    We gave these people a couple hundred million dollars to get 
                    started, which we know is half of what they actually need 
                    but it is better then nothing. Within this five-year window, 
                    they need to be up, running and on the track to being successful. 
                    If that can not happen in that window, then we have a really 
                    big problem. It means we are not ready to do that. And if 
                    we are not ready to do that, then we need to step back and 
                    regroup and think about what it takes to get ready, which 
                    is a whole other process that takes a much longer time. </p>
                  <p>We need to do some serious fundraising. We need more investors 
                    and we need more partners. All the talk about staff salaries, 
                    faculty salaries, about what we need to make things happens 
                    is empty talk without resources. There will be some talk about 
                    resources and it can not just be the people I am working with. 
                    It has to be every unit, every group, every center, every 
                    department, every school thinking about how to generate those 
                    resources. Some are advantaged in that over others. It is 
                    easier for the biomedical engineering department to generate 
                    new revenue than a department I met with yesterday, the theatre 
                    department. They are not in the same arena, same type of funding 
                    activity, so we need to figure that out.</p>
                  <p>I think more than anything, beyond this enterprise model, 
                    in the next five years we have to find ways to step up in 
                    every unit from the departments and centers up and start competing 
                    nationally. We are doing it in a lot of places but we need 
                    to do it more consistently in terms of faculty recruiting, 
                    staff salaries, graduate student salaries, graduate student 
                    recruitment, and undergraduate student financial aid. There 
                    are certain national standards and we are behind on many of 
                    those. We have to start looking at those and focusing on those. 
                    These are the kinds of things we will be focusing on. </p>
                  <p>Q: The question is if the annual report is going to go online. 
                    <br>
                    A: I can only hope so but I do not know. It will go to every 
                    investor. In fact, if there is anyone that you think should 
                    get this type of document, we need to hear about them. We 
                    are trying to put together a list of who it needs to go to. 
                    Right now it is an issue of the Alumni Magazine, which is 
                    a vehicle to do this and not overburden the taxpayers of Arizona, 
                    which is something we are trying not to do. We are trying 
                    to get it in the hands of every potential advisor, every potential 
                    investor and every existing stake holder, partner, and investor. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Q: Have we invested $200 million in the Arizona BioDesign 
                    Institute?<br>
                    A: The answer is yes. </p>
                  <p>Q: She thinks George Poste should be talking about what he 
                    is doing. <br>
                    A: Most of that investment, by the way, is in two buildings. 
                    If I added in the third building, it is actually more than 
                    $200 million. Most of it is being used in the physical investment 
                    plan but there are substantial program investment dollars, 
                    as well. George will be communicating to the community so 
                    we can be aware of where he is headed. Right now he is still 
                    getting organized and up to speed. I know that you and I came 
                    from the same schools and in our disciplines $200 million 
                    would bring you lots of progress. You have to trust me when 
                    I tell you $200 million or $250 million in the area where 
                    George has been asked to move us is one half of what he needs 
                    to even get started. The best way we have found to get George 
                    is to wheel out a light and shine it into the sky. It looks 
                    a lot like a bat when you put it up there. Then George comes 
                    in. He is spread out very thinly right now. We ought to work 
                    on getting a session so George can talk about his plans and 
                    what they mean. </p>
                  <p>Q: Where do teaching and learning fit into the priority hierarchy 
                    at the university we have, at step five basically. Where does 
                    the gift of teaching and learning fit in the things that you 
                    have talked about?<br>
                    A: That is a complicated commentary and question so I will 
                    boil it down to the last part which is where does teaching 
                    and learning fit in the priority hierarchy of expanding and 
                    taking this next step of the university while at the same 
                    time we have a step five university to run. You are right 
                    on the nub of our most complicated and hairy problem. That 
                    is, we have this very large and still growing step five, great 
                    state university right here and yet we are trying at this 
                    exact same instant, even before we are stabilized because 
                    growth is still occurring, to begin towards taking step six. 
                    In the context of that, teaching and the creation of a successful 
                    learning environment remains the first mission, the mission 
                    that we must fulfill first and above all others, to be successful. 
                    None of our plans or initiatives are intended to move us away 
                    from that at all, but to enhance it. So you will see us trying 
                    to do the following things:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>There will be a dramatic expansion of our on-campus residence 
                      living environment to enhance student living and learning 
                      activities.</li>
                    <li> Second, we have announced some minor expansion of the 
                      faculty through the tuition increase and a merit driven 
                      salary adjustment, which will take effect in January. This 
                      is activated by the tuition increase, not a function of 
                      it, but the tuition increase enables it. This is a positive 
                      step to maintain the core focus on teaching and learning.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><br>
                    But here is the scale of our problem, we are 1,700 faculty 
                    members short from a built-out university, and on this campus 
                    we are hundreds of faculty members short. We will never fund 
                    those faculty members, or get staffed at the level that we 
                    need to be at, and staff comes along with faculty, until we 
                    solve this resource problem. So the reason we are going for 
                    the $60 million, the reason that we will recommend a tuition 
                    increase again, the reason that several of the deans think 
                    of me in a not very positive light at the moment is because 
                    of a focus on acquiring the resources to allow the faculty 
                    not to be overrun by the numbers of students that we have. 
                    We are attacking this from a resource perspective. At some 
                    point, we will say this is as far as we can go without additional 
                    resources. We are very near that point right now.</p>
                  <p>Q: I am from facilities management and we are being told 
                    we have to possibly do more with less. The university is not 
                    getting smaller and newer, it is getting larger and older. 
                    And with all these new buildings coming onboard, is there 
                    any consideration of<br>
                    bringing the biotech buildings online for utilities and workforce 
                    and things of this nature?<br>
                    A: The question is as we are getting bigger and older, which 
                    is the correct premise, some of our facilities are in the 
                    aged category and new facilities are coming online, how can 
                    we be expected to maintain older buildings and take on new, 
                    more complicated buildings unless we expand our capacity to 
                    be able to do that? In our request for the funding from the 
                    state is funding for additional commitments for facilities 
                    operations and maintenance. So, that is a piece of it. Second, 
                    the successful research funding will be what provides the 
                    money to maintain the research-intensive buildings that are 
                    being built, as is the case at every major public or private 
                    research university in the United States. And that is the 
                    risk we have taken on, that if we are successful in the research 
                    arena we will generate revenues to maintain those buildings 
                    above the means that we have now, and we will also generate 
                    more investment dollars for the library and for other critical 
                    services around the university. Right now we have roughly 
                    $10 million a year from indirect cost recovery to invest in 
                    the rest of the university. At Stanford, they have $125 million 
                    a year from that same pot, and at UCLA and Berkeley, they 
                    have approximately the same levels. We have to be successful 
                    and then we will have the resources to get the staff to maintain 
                    the buildings at the levels that we need. </p>
                  <p>We do have a big problem with deferred maintenance, with 
                    things that have been let go over long periods of time. When 
                    Yale University identified that problem they were only $2 
                    billion down in deferred maintenance. We are not quite $2 
                    billion down in deferred maintenance. Every university goes 
                    through this problem. They would rather spend the money on 
                    the students and on the faculty then worry about the buildings 
                    later, usually when they are about to fall down. So, it is 
                    a problem and we know it is a problem and it needs attention.</p>
                  <p>I think that is about all the time that we have. I appreciate 
                    everybody being here.<br>
                    I hope that you find the report useful and that we will have 
                    a better one next year.</p>
