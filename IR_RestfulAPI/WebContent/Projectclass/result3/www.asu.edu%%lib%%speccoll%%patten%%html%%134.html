This herbal by Hieronymus Bock ranks second only to that of
 Leonhart Fuchs in its importance.  The realistic woodcut
 illustrations by David Kandel make this a memorable work
 because of its visual appeal.  Bock's purpose was not just
 to identify plants known by Dioscorides, but also to discuss
 their characteristics.  He wrote about what he had actually
 observed rather than merely copying or synthesizing the writings
 of others.  Although Bock was self-taught, he was the first to
 create a system of botany that classified plants into three
 categories: herbs, shrubs, and trees.  He then subdivided each
 group by similar characteristics or relationships.  Although he
 did not develop such concepts as "genus" or "species," his work
 laid the foundation for later botanists such as Bauhin and
 Linnaeus.  As Bock prepared to publish the results of his study,
 he realized he could ill afford to hire illustrators for his book.
  To compensate for a lack of illustrations he focused on writing
 such clear descriptions of the plants that even laymen would
 recognize what he was trying to portray.  Thus he developed
 the prototype of modern phytography, the science of plant
 description.  When later editions were issued, however, the
 publisher decided that illustrations should be included to
 make the book more useful.  This third edition is illustrated
 and the plates are hand-colored.
