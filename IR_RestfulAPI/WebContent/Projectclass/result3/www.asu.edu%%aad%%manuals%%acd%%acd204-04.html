<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Published Professional Instructional Material</B></FONT>

<P>
ASU encourages and aids <A HREF="acd002.html#facultymember" TARGET="New">faculty members</A> in publishing professional instructional materials, whether in print (e.g., textbooks), electronic (e.g., CDs or software), or other media.  The university does not claim any portion of the income in the form of royalties that accrue when the publisher of such work has recognized standing and when copyright has been secured for the instructional materials.

<P>
There is no prohibition against the use of such published material by the author in his or her classes (with the collection of related royalties), provided that the textbook, CD, or other material

<P>
<OL>
<LI>has been produced and copyrighted by a recognized, independent publisher at its own expense</LI>

<P>
<LI>has been made available for open sale

<P>
and</LI>

<P>
<LI>has been approved for such use by the dean of the college concerned.</LI>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Unpublished Material Prepared for Classes or Laboratories</B></FONT>

<P>
Members of the ASU faculty or staff shall not have any financial interest in or receive compensation from the sale of unpublished material prepared for classes or laboratories.

<P>
If faculty-prepared educational material that is dittoed, mimeographed, photocopied, or in other multigraphed form is to be used in class or laboratory work at the university, it is recommended that such material be prepared by one of ASU&#146;s Copy Centers. Such material should be made available through the copy centers and/or the ASU Bookstore for sale primarily to university <A HREF="acd002.html#student" TARGET="New">students</A> enrolled in courses in which the material is used.

<P>
If faculty-prepared, nonpublished material for class use is in electronic media (e.g., CDs or software), it is recommended that such material be made available via ASU Gopher services, or through COMPASS or the ASU Bookstore for sale (for costs of material and duplication) primarily to university students enrolled in courses in which the material is used.

<P>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Direct Sales to Students and Cooperative Purchases</B></FONT>

<P>
University faculty or staff members shall not make sales directly to students of faculty-prepared materials, CDs, books, or publications (in print or electronic media).  Cooperative purchases of magazines or other published material (excluding material described in the preceding paragraph) required for a specific course, may be coordinated by a faculty member with prior approval of the <A HREF="acd002.html#departmentchair" TARGET="New">department chair</A>.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Exceptions</B></FONT></CENTER>
<IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2">

<P>
Exceptions to any section of this policy may be made on appeal to the appropriate department chair in consultation with the dean and the executive vice president and provost of the university.  In all instances, the welfare of the student and the educational program should be of primary concern.
