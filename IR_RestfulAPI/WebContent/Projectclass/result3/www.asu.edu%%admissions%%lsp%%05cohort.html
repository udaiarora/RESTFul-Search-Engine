			Hey Everyone!  My name is Amanda Badali and I am from Oakmont,
			Pennsylvania.  I am a Secondary Education, Social Studies major 
			with a subconcentration of Political Science and 
			a double minor in Religion and History.  I hope to
			become a motivational speaker while in college, a
			government/international relations teacher post-college, and hopefully
			hold a political office someday.  Throughout high school, I was really
			involved with the Kiwanis Family.  In my spare time, I play guitar, go
			to concerts, hangout with friends and take random photos of anything
			and everything.  I am really into digital photography and art, and
			really love abstract pieces.  I live for excitement and fun, and
			believe laughter is the key to life.  I'm determined to see everything
			and to do everything.  I'm not afraid to take chances and risks. After
			all, the game of life is one big sea of opportunities and chances. I'd
			rather regret doing something than regret not doing something.  My
			goal is to try something new and do something "crazy" every year.

			 Hey, I'm Erin Barrett and I graduated from Xavier College Prep. Throughout my high school career,
			 I was very involved in my school and community. I was heavily involved at Xavier in my school paper,
			 Mock Trial, the Political Action Committee, Amnesty International, Gatortown (Unitown), and President?s Council.
			 In addition to these activities, I also participated in the YMCA?s Youth & Government, various City of Phoenix
			 activities (including being a youth ambassador to Japan), and internships for two different political campaigns.
			 As I?m sure you can tell, I?m very interested in politics and civics. So it probably isn?t a surprise that I am
			 majoring in Political Science and plan on attending law school and venturing out into the political arena. I am very
			 excited to be involved in this program and look forward to getting to know all of you very soon!

			I graduated from Mesquite High School in Gilbert, Arizona and will forever be a Wildcat at heart.
			In high school I enjoyed Drama, A World of Difference, Best Buddies, Renaissance, Arizona Heat
			(a cheer team) and Swim Team. I was also a student delegate chosen by Sister Cities to go to
			Newtownabbey, Northern Ireland last summer, which only fueled the fire for my love of traveling.
			My true passion in high school was Student Council. I was the Class President twice and my
			senior year I was the Dance Director (I like to be involved). At ASU I am planning on majoring
			in Nursing. I enjoy reading, writing, shopping and teaching swimming lessons. I could not be
			happier about the amazing opportunity I was given to be a part of the LSP family!

			Hello! My name is Meghan Burns. I was born and raised on a small island on the southwest coast of Florida,

			I graduated from Mountain Pointe High School, where I was very active in their Student Government.
			My sophomore through my senior year, I acted as President of my class, which was a great honor but also a
			great deal of stress! On top of those responsibilities, I was in NHS, Key Club, AP and honors classes,
			Best Buddies... blah blah blah. Just from meeting some of you, I know that I?m not the only overachiever here.
			Honestly, I could not wait to graduate. I am so excited about becoming a Sun Devil and beginning a new part of
			my life! My goals for college are to graduate with honors, travel as much as possible, meet as many great people
			as I can and just have a good ?ol time doing it! I feel very honored to be apart of the LSP family and can?t wait
			to meet the rest of you!

			devoted to my school newspaper, the Sunrise, for which I served as Editor-in-Chief during my senior year.
			I was also involved with Competition Government, Marching Band, and many other clubs and organizations.  
			My summer has been spent freelancing for the Wrangler News, a community newspaper in my area, and 
			working on a campaign for the Chandler City Council:

			In the middle of the heartland, where the cows flourish and the corn grows, I?m anything but a country cowboy.
			From the fast beat of my feet on the boogie floor, I?m the brand of chap who loves to get the party started.
			I?m a graduate from Palmyra R-1 High School in Palmyra, Missouri.  I?ve grown up with my mother raising my
			sister and I in our small community of 3,500 people.  My senior class consisted of only 76 individuals.
			I plan to further my education by studying to be a Government Service Executive and working in politics.  
			My target is to have a double major in Political Science and Law.  Continuing my education, I will pursue 
			and earn a Master's, then a Doctorate in either field.  I would like to complete my job in the field, and 
			after retirement, come back to a university and educate college students. In addition to my career, I plan 
			to be a member of charitable organizations and help with any of their regulations or legal issues. I hope to 
			coordinate with charitable and social service agencies, make legislative decisions and truly demonstrate how 
			I can make a difference.  Being part of the LSP Program will help further these goals and dreams.  
			I'm looking forward to being a part of this large family.

			Hey everyone!  My name is Marcos Valdez and I am one of the new LSPers coming in this fall.  
			I graduated from Tolleson Union High School in the top 1% of my class with a 4.4 GPA.  I was also 
			one of Tolleson?s athletes, and I ended up winning the Athlete of the Year Award (which really 
			surprised me considering the fact there were several other quality athletes).  I played basketball, 
			baseball, and football.  In basketball and baseball, I was captain during my junior and senior 
			years for both squads. Even though athletics took up a great deal of my time, I still found time 
			to participate in a few extra-curricular activities.  Some of these include being the President 
			of the National Honor Society, a member of the ASU?s Rodel Math Program, a member of the Gifted 
			and Talented Program, and a member of the Cub Crew, which was a senior mentor program aimed at 
			helping freshmen become acquainted with the life of a high schooler.  The Cub Crew was probably 
			my favorite program because I was given an opportunity to mentor not freshmen, but rather young 
			individuals who are barely about to begin their lives.  Other than school, I am a normal guy that 
			likes to hang out with friends, go to the movies, talk on the phone, and play lots of sports.  
			I can?t wait for the school year to begin so I can meet some of the other LSPers!  Oh yeah, you 
			can find me in Cholla hall, because that?s where I?ll be stayin?!
