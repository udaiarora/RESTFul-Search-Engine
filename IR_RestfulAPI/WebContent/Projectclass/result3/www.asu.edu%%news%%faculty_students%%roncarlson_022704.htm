      <h2>Writer turns new page as Regents Professor </h2>
      <p>New Regents Professor of English and Creative Writing Ron Carlson is often charged with the artistic crime of not being peculiar. </p>
      <p align="left"><img src="facstudents_images/ron_carlson_022704.jpg" width="180" height="276" align="right">"I really have been accused of being 'normal,'" says Carlson. "It's a horrifying thing, but in interviews, people have felt comfortable in saying, 'what's your secret - why are you so normal?'" </p>
      <p align="left">Literary figures are often portrayed by their biographers as being writing-focused to the point of selfishness - geniuses that direct all their energy and personal interests toward their art. Carlson has managed to make a career out of being nearly the antithesis of this paradigm, taking, if you will, a writer's road that is less traveled by. </p>
      <p align="left">This is not to say that Carson hasn't put plenty of energy into his art. Nationally renowned as a writer of great humanity and nuance, he has published eight books, two of which have been cited by the <em>Los Angeles Times </em> as being among the "best books of the year," and two others have also been named to the same list at the <em>New York Times </em>. His stories routinely appear in <em>Harper's Magazine </em>, <em>The New Yorker </em>, <em>Esquire </em> and <em>Gentleman's Quarterly </em> - <br>
  all the top publishers of short fiction. </p>
      <p align="left">Locally, however, Carlson's literary fame comes close to being eclipsed by other roles he plays - by his reputation as a passionate and insightful teacher and by his popularity as a public figure in the ASU cultural community. </p>
      <p align="left">For this, Carlson has been selected as one of eight new Regents Professors, one of the university's highest honors for faculty members. The others include Charles Arntzen, molecular biologist and the Florence Ely Nelson Presidential Endowed Chair; Phil Christensen, Korrick Professor of Geological Sciences; Gene Glass, professor of educational leadership and policy studies; Luis Gomez-Mejia, Horace Steel Arizona Heritage Chair in management; Stephen Pyne, life sciences professor and authority on fire; Psychology Professor Irwin Sandler, director of the Center for Prevention Research; and Mary Lee Smith, educational leadership and policy studies professor. </p>
      <p align="left">Carlson has acquired an almost legendary status among aspiring fiction writers as a writer's teacher and coach. </p>
      <p align="left">Carlson's strength as a teacher comes from having thought deeply about both the psychology of writing and about art's place in the writing process, and from the fact that he has had 30 years of experience in putting what he knows into practice. </p>
      <p align="left">"Both writing and teaching are investigations, and they've been investigations in my life," he says. "What I've done over the years, is to develop and approach ways of offering students information about their very personal work that they can actually hear. </p>
      <p align="left">"Part of what I do is to understand the way fiction operates its component parts and the possibilities, but the second part is understanding how a writer operates." </p>
      <p align="left">For many years, Carlson co-hosted "Books and Company" (with Valley journalist Jana Bommersbach), a popular literary arts program on KAET-TV. He has given countless talks and readings to groups around Arizona. Carlson also has been a perennial favorite as the master of ceremonies at the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Convocation events. </p>
      <p align="left">Though Carlson has always been a faculty member who takes the "service" part of his job seriously (including serving as director of ASU's Creative Writing Program for six years), his work in the community is exactly the kind of outside distraction that he warns his writing students against. He calls it "spending your principal." </p>
      <p align="left">"Though I love to help the university, and I've always taken all the facets of my work and school seriously, boy, there is nothing better than going four days and not leaving the house." </p>
      <p align="left">Carlson notably doesn't take much of his own very wise advice, and yet somehow manages to succeed anyway - a contradiction that is surely part of his genius. While popular wisdom in fiction writing is that no writer makes a living out of writing short stories anymore - novels are what publishers pay the big bucks for - he has largely chosen to write stories, publishing nearly two collections of short fiction for every novel he's written. In the end, he is widely considered to be one of the genre's masters. </p>
      <p align="left">"One of the ways I've lived my life has been that I never wrote a thing for market. Sometimes I wrote book reviews or nonfiction pieces knowing that they would be published, but all of my fiction has been an absolutely idiosyncratic adventure," he notes. "So there is something kind of pure about that, that I like. I haven't followed." </p>
      <p align="left">He has pursued his artistic career in the same way, ignoring convention and wisdom, even when it is his own, and following the road "less traveled by." "And that," as Robert Frost says, "has made all the difference." </p>
