  <h2>ECUADOR: The Amazon and the Andes Field School</h2>
  <h3>FAQ: What to expect once you get to Ecuador</h3>
  <a name="tribe" id="tribe"></a>
	<p><strong>What tribe or ethnic group will be hosting the class in the Amazon?</strong></p>
<p>In the Amazon, the most important social units are extended families (called &quot;ayllus&quot; in the Quichua language). An extended family, the Andi ayllu, descended from a medicine man named Paqui Andi, who was active in the first half of the 20th century, will host the class. The larger ethnic group with which the Andis identify themselves is the Napo Runa or Napo River People. Although the Napo Runa speak the Quichua language, they are not genetically or culturally related to the Andean Quichua. Their religious and cultural life is similar to that of other Amazonian people, especially to that of other language families living on the Napo River such as the Waorani and the Cofan.</p>

<hr>
<a name="site" id="site"></a>
<p><strong>Where is the research site in the Amazon?</strong></p>
<p>The Andi families who serve as hosts for the class live along the right or south bank of the Napo River at the mouth of a small stream called the Canoa Yacu. The closest town is Puerto Misahualli. The community consists of indigenous farms spread out along the banks of the Napo. The area within two or three hundred yards of the river cultivates traditional subsistence crops of manioc, plantains, and corn interspersed with cash crops of coffee and cacao. Farther back from the river is virgin jungle. When the Napo meets the Ucayali River much farther downstream, they become the Amazon. The community is accessible by a gravel road, constructed in 1978. They have no electricity or running water.</p>

<hr>
<a name="conditions" id="conditions"></a>
<p><strong>What are the living conditions in the Amazonian Napo Runa Community?</strong></p>
<p>The goal for summer program participants is to live as close as possible to the way the indigenous community lives. You will sleep on a raised platform surrounded by second growth Amazonian forest; there is a roof, but no walls; you will have a mattress, clean sheets, and a blanket; mattresses for each of the students and program faculty will be spread out across this one platform. In the early evening, candles will be lit around the platform. There is no electricity. When the candles are extinguished, the night will seem darker and the stars brighter than usual. Because the platform is open to the night, you will hear frogs, owls, and insects as well as bats flying above you. In the background, you will hear the rushing sound of the Napo River. Frequently, heavy rainstorms come in at night creating a deafening din on the roof. Cool misty air will blow across your face. At dawn, you will hear many bird calls.</p>

<hr>
<a name="plumbing" id="plumbing"></a>
<p><strong>Is there plumbing or running water?</strong></p>
<p>Near the raised platform where the group will sleep, there is a single outhouse. The outhouse is kept clean and has a standard plastic toilet seat. There is no piped running water. The group bathes and washes clothes in the Napo River alongside the Andi family.</p>

<hr>
<a name="food" id="food"></a>
<p><strong>What is the food like?</strong></p>
<img src="images/Picture059.jpg" alt="Cristina Cerda and Bertila Grefa preparing lunch for ASU students in the forest." class="imagefloatright" />
<p>In the Amazonian community, good meals familiar to American students will form the basis of the group?s diet. You will be served arroz con pollo, spaghetti, red beans and rice, fresh fried fish and rice, and homemade locro Quiteno (an Andean potato soup). In addition, students will have the chance to sample a variety of more exotic Amazonian foods that come from the hunting and gathering traditions, if they so desire. In the summer of 1999, students sampled roasted chonta grubs, armadillo, cassava, huge jungle snails, peach palm fruit, a vegetable dish made from the flower of the plantain, and a vegetable made from fern heads.</p>

<hr>
<a name="kosher" id="kosher"></a>
<p><strong>Are kosher or vegetarian meals available?</strong></p>
<p>The class works with the indigenous communities to provide vegetarian alternatives for meat-based meals. Nevertheless, rural communities in Ecuador have trouble understanding what vegetarianism is and have almost no understanding of kosher cooking. It is sometimes not possible to supervise the ways in which food is cooked. Sometimes, the locals may simply remove the meat from a dish that has been cooked with it and serve that as vegetarian. For example, they may serve corn as vegetarian without noting that it has been toasted in pork fat. The program faculty will do their best to solve these problems, but there may be mixed results. Vegetarians may experience less variety and sometimes less plentiful food. Nonetheless, provisions will be made for vegetarians during the program.</p>

<hr>
<a name="hiking" id="hiking"></a>
<p><strong>Will we be hiking and camping out in the jungle?</strong></p>
<p>During the time that you are in Napo, the group will spend two or three nights camping out in virgin old-growth jungle in the traditional hunting and gathering grounds of the Andi family. From the Napo River, you will hike up a shallow tributary stream for about two hours to a base camp in the forest. Many species of palm trees, giant ferns, philodendrons, and vines crowd the banks of this narrow stream. Small waterfalls drop into it from the cliffs above. The stream is home to three species of the giant morpho butterfly whose bright blue wings--with luck-- can be seen during the hike.</p>

<p>At the base camp, the group sleeps on a raised platform surrounded by virgin jungle; there is a palm thatched roof but no walls. The Andi family cooks for the students over an open fire. Students who wish to be helpful may join the Andis in the cooking, chatting with them around the fire. There are no mattresses. Each student will carry in their own sheets that have been issued to them by the Andi family. The Andis carry in blankets for the students.</p>

<p>On the second day in the jungle, the Andi family will take the group on a fairly strenuous hike through their traditional hunting and gathering grounds. While in the forest, members of the Andi family tell stories about experiences they have had in the forest, such as encounters with the spirit world. As the group hikes, the Andis will point out the many plants that they use for healing and describe how to gather and prepare the plants for medicinal use.</p>

<hr>
<a name="animals" id="animals"></a>
<p><strong>What animals and birds will be see?</strong></p>
<p>The mammals present in the area where you will be hiking include anteaters, sloths, marmoset monkeys, owl monkeys, pacas, otters, deer, collared peccaries, woolly opossums, kinkajous, marsupials, armadillos, Amazonian red squirrels, jaguarundis, margays, ocelots, and jaguars. Among the hundreds of species of birds present in the area are toucans, toucanets, Amazon green parrots, cali, chilicres, tubish, parrots, parakeets, harpy eagles, caciques, giant guan, and tinamou. Because the indigenous population regularly hunts the animals in this area, the animals are very wary. It is unlikely that the group will encounter many animals. More likely, you will see butterflies and other insects, frogs, and smaller birds as well as the signs of other animals.</p>

<hr>
<a name="snakes" id="snakes"></a>
<p><strong>Are there snakes?</strong></p>
<p>There are several species of poisonous snakes native to the area of the Amazon where you will be hiking. However, poisonous snakes are no more common than they are in wilderness areas of the western United States. It is unlikely that the group will encounter them. If snakes are present, experienced native guides usually spot them and point them out for those who wish to see them. These snakes generally flee at the approach of human beings and will not bite unless molested. Protective boots in most sizes are provided for students for hiking. (Students with a shoe size greater than 11 should bring their own boots, however.) Professor Swanson does not know of any cases where foreign students, tourists, or missionaries have been bitten by snakes. Even among the indigenous population that cut brush every day, snake bites are rare. Nevertheless, it is good to observe appropriate caution by watching where you walk, using a flashlight when walking at night, and not thrusting your hands into brush without examining it carefully first.</p>

<hr>
<a name="insects" id="insects"></a>
<p><strong>Are there noxious insects?</strong></p>
<p>There are no biting insects in the Andes. During the Amazonian portion of the trip, students may encounter some sand flies, mosquitoes, and chiggers. Mosquitoes are present only at night and not in large numbers; the mosquito population is much less prolific than one would encounter during a summer in the American Midwest. Program Director Tod Swanson who spends summers in the Amazonian community with his family does not use bug spray and has not found bugs to be much of a problem. However, some visitors react to bug bites more strongly than others, and you are advised to bring bug spray and use it as a precaution.</p>

<hr>
<a name="spanish" id="spanish"></a>
<p><strong>Do the native communities we will be visiting speak Spanish?</strong></p>
<p>In the Napo Runa Amazonian community which serves as the base for the class, people of all ages speak the Quichua or Runa Shimi language as a first language. Most people over 45 in this community speak only Quichua. All people under 45 at least understand Spanish as a second language and can communicate in basic Spanish when necessary. An increasing number of younger people have served in the Ecuadorian Army or have worked outside the community for a period of years and returned. These people converse easily in Spanish on a one-to-one basis, but always prefer Quichua for public speaking such as storytelling or presenting oral history. Students who can speak Spanish will find ample opportunity to chat informally with these Quichua people. They are open and willing to answer questions about their culture. However, even these Spanish speakers prefer Quichua for public speaking such as storytelling or presenting oral history to the class, so Professor Swanson will translate these presentations directly from Quichua into English by Professor Swanson. Students who know Spanish can ask questions of the presenters in Spanish. Some younger people, especially young women, who have never worked or lived outside the community do not feel comfortable speaking Spanish and in practice speak only Quichua.</p>

<p>In the Andean communities, you will visit people of all ages who are fluent in Spanish. Some will also speak Quichua but many no longer speak the language of their grandparents. The Spanish spoken in these communities is an Andean Spanish strongly influenced by Quichua grammatical structures and pronunciation. This Andean Spanish is nevertheless intelligible to students who have studied more standard Spanish.</p>

<hr>
<a name="knowledge" id="knowledge"></a>
<p><strong>Is knowledge of Spanish required?</strong></p>
<p>No. Classes are in English; Spanish is not required. Professor Tod Swanson translates class presentations by indigenous Quichua into English</p>

<hr>
<a name="use" id="use"></a>
<p><strong>If I know Spanish will I be able to use it in Ecuador?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Students will get more out of the program if they speak Spanish. In some field research exercises, students will work in small groups with Spanish-speaking indigenous community members. Spanish-speaking students will be able to ask questions directly. Students who speak only English will be divided among these small groups so that they can work with Spanish-speaking students who can assist in facilitating communication.</p>

<hr>
<a name="volcanoes" id="volcanoes"></a>
<p><strong>What is the danger from volcanic activity in the region?</strong></p>
<p>Currently two volcanoes in Ecuador are in the process of erupting. A team of international scientists monitor these volcanoes daily, and advise local authorities as to the seriousness of the situation. Two of the program faculty, Professors Swanson and Mafla, know Ecuador well. Their parents and siblings live there. Through these relatives, they keep well abreast of the day-to-day living conditions in the volcanic regions. In addition, they stay informed of any alerts posted by the U.S. and Ecuadorian governments with regard to the volcanic activity. If any areas are deemed to be unsafe at the time of the trip or at any time during the trip, the itinerary will be changed and the group will be redirected to alternative safe areas.</p>

<hr>
<a name="altitude" id="altitude"></a>
<p><strong>Will I experience altitude sickness in the high Andes?</strong></p>
<p>Quito, the capital city of Ecuador, is just less than 10,000 feet above sea level. The highest areas where the group will be hiking are approximately 12,000 feet above sea level. You should not experience altitude sickness but you may tire more quickly and may experience shortness of breath while hiking. Take it easy and rest frequently. If you do feel tired or ill for any reason inform the group leaders so that the group can rest.</p>

<hr>
<a name="crime" id="crime"></a>
<p><strong>Is there any risk of violent crime or guerilla activity?</strong></p>
<p>The risk of crime is low. Ecuador has no active guerilla groups such as those found in Colombia and Peru. You will not travel in any areas near the borders of those countries. The risk is probably no greater and maybe lower than it would be in your home communities in the U.S. Anytime anyone travels there is some risk of being pickpocketed or of losing a wallet. Make a copy of your passport. Bring your money in travelers' checks. Keep the copy of your passport and the numbers of the travelers? checks in a separate location and also leave copies of these documents with your emergency contact. Do not bring extra credit cards.</p>

<hr>
<a name="drugs" id="drugs"></a>
<p><strong>Are there drugstores available where I will be able to purchase toiletries?</strong></p>
<p>There are drugstores available in Quito and Ba&ntilde;os where personal items are available. In the Amazon and in the rural Andean areas, such stores are not available, so you should plan and pack accordingly. The program provides participants with toilet paper and soap. All other personal items which you might require should be brought from home.</p>

<hr>
<a name="swim" id="swim"></a>
<p><strong>Do I need to know how to swim or canoe?</strong></p>
<p>No. However, if you cannot swim, please let the group leaders know. The Napo Runa community which hosts the group is located on the banks of the Napo River, a fast flowing good sized tributary of the Amazon. On one or two occasions, the class will take a motorized dugout canoe into town. The distance traveled is approximately 6 kilometers round trip. Students will also be transported short distances out to islands in the Napo River in small non-motorized dugout canoes. Students will wear life preservers during these trips. The canoes will be maneuvered by experienced people who have grown up on the River. Group members will bathe and wash their clothes in shallow areas of the Napo, but do not need to know how to swim to do these things. Participants who are strong swimmers may swim or ride the currents at their own risk.</p>

<hr><a name="tax" id="tax"></a>
<p><strong>Is there an airport exit tax?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. There is a $25.00 airport tax that students must pay upon their departure from the Quito Airport.</p>
