This book discusses categorical data analysis and its implementation       with the SAS System. Both nonparametric methods and model-based
parametric methods are discussed. Specific topics include association      in 2-by-2 tables, Mantel-Haenszel methods for assessing association in
sets of tables, logistic regression for dichotomous and polytomous         responses, weighted least squares regression, repeated measurements
analysis, and loglinear models. Special topics include bioassay and the    analysis of categorized time-to-event data. The methodology is
illustrated with practical examples using the FREQ, LOGISTIC, CATMOD,      and GENMOD procedures.
