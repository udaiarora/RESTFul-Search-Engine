    <h2><strong>Award-Winning News Correspondent Suarez to Speak On "The Changing Face of America" </strong></h2>
    <p>One can hardly deny that the world has changed quite a bit in recent times. The way in which peoples of the world regard and interact with one is in flux. Even in the U.S., we are susceptible to social change - and change is not always for the better. </p>
              <p>The 2004 A. Wade Smith Memorial Lecture Series on Race Relations will present&nbsp; a lecture by&nbsp; a man who is both a scholar and a firsthand witness to this changing world - <strong>Ray Suarez </strong>,&nbsp; Senior Correspondent for PBS's "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer" and former NPR reporter and host. Suarez's lecture, <strong>"The Changing Face of America," will take place on Monday, April 5, 2004 at 7:00 PM in ASU's Gammage Auditorium. </strong> The lecture is free and open to the public. (Please see the end of this release for more information.) </p>
              <p>Suarez has been first on the scene of some of the most world-changing events of the last 20 years. When South Africa held its first all-race elections, Suarez, then a correspondent with National Public Radio, was on location hosting the popular call-in show "Talk of the Nation" live from Johannesburg. The show allowed people in South Africa, Western Europe and the U.S. to talk in real-time about the elections and their impact. When a quarter century of "the troubles" ended in Northern Ireland, making room for peace, Suarez presented a series of interviews from all sides in the Ulster conflict. The interviews were aired live throughout Ireland, the U.K. and the U.S. </p>
              <p>Here at home, Suarez has done more than witness and report on change - he has made a study of it. Suarez, with a BA in African History from New York University and an MA in Urban Affairs from the University of Chicago, is the author of <em> The Old Neighborhood: What We Lost in the Great Suburban Migration, 1966-1999</em>. </p>
              <p>Published in 1999, Suarez's book chronicles the effects of the American migration from cities to suburbs over the last four decades. In the book he visits cities such as Chicago, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Miami and Washington asking what went wrong. To find an answer, Suarez makes use of researched data and interviews with community organizers, government officials, people who stayed in the cities and those who left. Suarez's book addresses issues such as the lack of inner-city jobs, crime, the poor state of urban schools, the increased availability of cars and highway system development. Suarez also discusses what he sees as America's inability to deal with race - the tendency of white communities to move out further and further from minority-populated inner cities to avoid the race issue. </p>
              <p>Other books by Suarez include <em>Totally Brooklyn </em> (Workman, 2001), <em>Saving America's Treasures </em>(National Geographic, 2000), <em>Las Christmas: Favorite Latino Authors Share Their Holiday Memories </em> (Knopf, 1998), and <em>About Men </em> (Poseidon, 1986). </p>
              <p>Suarez has won many awards throughout his career in radio and television. In 1994 and 1995, Suarez shared in NPR's duPont-Columbia Silver Baton Award for his work with "Talk of the Nation." Suarez also received the 1996 Ruben Salazar Award from the National Council of La Raza, the 1995 Global Awareness Award from Current History Magazine, a Chicago Emmy Award and the Chicago-based Community Media Workshop's Studs Terkel Award. </p>
              <p>Suarez has been a contributing editor for <em>Si Magazine </em>, a national magazine for Latinos. His writing has been published in the <em>Washington Post </em>, the <em>New York Times </em>, the Chicago <em>Tribune </em>, the <em>Baltimore Sun </em>, and many other publications here and in Britain. </p>
              <p>The lecture is free but tickets are required. Tickets are available at all ASU Bookstores, Borders Books or by calling 480-965-0051. For more information please call (480) 965-0051, visit &lt; <a href="http://clas.asu.edu/newsevents/publicevents/wadesmith/default.htm">http://clas.asu.edu/newsevents/publicevents/wadesmith/default.htm </a>&gt;, or email clasevents@asu.edu &lt; <a href="mailto:clasevents@asu.edu">mailto:clasevents@asu.edu </a>&gt;. </p>
              <p>The A. Wade Smith Memorial Lecture on Race Relations was created in 1995 to perpetuate the work of a man who had devoted his life to the ideal of racial parity. As professor and chair of sociology at Arizona State University, A. Wade Smith worked tirelessly to improve race relations on the ASU campus and within the greater community. When he died from cancer at the age of 43, his wife, family members and friends made memorial gifts to establish and fund this lecture series. </p>
