          <h2>Navajo brothers from ASU make military service a point of pride </h2>
          <p> Two young brothers, members of the Navajo Nation, are upholding a long tradition of serving their country. Both are students at ASU, and they are following in the path of the Navajo Code Talkers who helped protect the United States in World War II.</p>
          <p> Lance Cpl. John Bailon, 22, and Cpl. Cheston Bailon, 21, are serving in the Marine Corps in Haditha, Iraq. The two have been inseparable since their childhood days, where they grew up on the Navajo reservation in Shiprock, N.M.</p>
          <p> John came to ASU first, enrolling as a freshman in the Native American Achievement Program in fall of 2001. It was Cheston who talked him into joining the Marine Corps Reserves, following the 9/11 attacks. The two went to boot camp separately but were reunited at the specialty School of Infantry, where they found themselves in the same platoon and fire team.</p>
          <p> Both continued their military training in the summers, and Cheston eventually joined John at ASU last fall. The two were active in NATIONS, a support and enrichment organization for Native American students. John had completed five semesters and Cheston one semester when they learned that their 4th Reconnaissance Battalion would be deploying for Iraq last January.</p>
          <p> &ldquo;They&rsquo;re both good boys, brave young brothers who had to leave family, friends and ASU to go to Iraq,&rdquo; says Aaron Woods, the ASU student success coordinator who worked with both brothers. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re in a dangerous place. They drop short e-mail messages when time permits.&rdquo;</p>
          <p> Upon reaching Iraq, the brothers were separated and sent to two different locations. John went to help train the Iraqi National Guard at Camp Hit, which became a focus of insurgent mortar attacks. Cheston was based at Haditha Dam, also a mortar target, and he went on numerous patrols and operations.</p>
          <p> The two brothers were reunited in May.</p>
          <p> &ldquo;I had just returned from patrol when I saw him,&rdquo; Cheston says. &ldquo;I dropped all my gear right there and hugged him, and it felt like we were at home again.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> The two hope to be back home by September or January. Cheston says he is proud of the military tradition among the Navajos, and says his ancestors are his role models and heroes.</p>
          <p> &ldquo;We strive to emulate them,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They are not only heroes among the (people), but heroes of the Marine Corps.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> He plans to be a role model when he returns to the reservation, saying: &ldquo;I want to help my community by bringing more businesses into it. I will continue to earn my bachelor&rsquo;s degree in business and marketing at ASU to help realize this vision.&rdquo;</p>
          <p> Woods says he looks forward to the brothers&rsquo; return to ASU.</p>
          <p> &ldquo;Keep them in your prayers,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In all truth, they want nothing more than to come home, eat some mutton and frybread, attend a movie, hang out with friends, enjoy family and return to ASU.&rdquo;</p>
          <p> With reporting by Cpl. Ken Melton, 2nd Marine Division. Auffret, with Marketing &amp; Strategic Communications, can be reached at (480) 965-6991 or (sauffret@asu.edu).</p>
