      Doctor of Humane Letters, <em>honoris causa</em></p>
	  <p>Jane Dee Hull, a native of Kansas City, Missouri,  graduated from the University of Kansas with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Elementary Education,  and undertook postgraduate coursework in Political Science and Economics at Arizona State University.&nbsp; She is also a graduate of the Josephson  Ethics Institute.&nbsp; A dedicated educator,  she taught elementary school in her home state and on the Navajo Nation in  Chinle, Arizona, while raising four children with her husband, Terrance Hull.</p>
	  <p>Active in Arizona politics since 1965, Governor Hull  was first elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 1979, where served  until 1993.&nbsp; During that time, she acted  as both the GOP Whip (1987-1988) and the Speaker of the House (1989-1992).&nbsp; In 1995, she was elected Secretary of State  and distinguished her administration by transitioning the office into a new  technological age.&nbsp; She succeeded to the  governorship of Arizona  in 1997, making her the second female in state history to hold the office.</p>

	    Ever the advocate for the  youth of Arizona,  Governor Hull&rsquo;s Students FIRST program helped to ensure funding equity for  school facilities throughout the state.&nbsp;  Under her leadership, the KidsCare program provided healthcare coverage  for over 130,000 children of the working poor, and Arizona became one of the first states in  the nation to provide Internet access to all of its public schools.&nbsp; Arizona  made significant headway in providing classroom and teacher funding and  expanding accountability the state&rsquo;s education system during her  administration. </p>
	  <p>Governor Hull is also  credited with making important strides in strengthening Arizona&rsquo;s  relationship with Mexico,  especially in the areas of commerce, trade and tourism.&nbsp; Working closely with other western governors  and then Mexican President, Vicente Fox, Governor Hull&rsquo;s leadership established  Arizona as a  leader in bi-national relations.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>In addition to her education  and public service careers, Governor Hull has served on the boards of many  community service and political organizations including the Western Governors  Association, Bush-Cheney 2004 Steering Committee, Women for Bush, 2004, the Advisory  Council on Historic Preservation, the Arizona Women&rsquo;s Forum, Race for the Cure,  Save-A-Life Alliance, Developing Older Adult Resources, the Morrison Institute  of Public Policy, and many others.&nbsp; An  elementary school in Chandler,   Arizona has been named in her  honor.&nbsp; Governor Hull is also the  published author of multiple newspaper and magazine articles including, <em>The Power of Character; The Challenge of Public  Service</em>.</p>
	  <p>Among her numerous awards and  acknowledgments, she was named National Legislator of the Year in 1989 by the Republican  Legislators Association.&nbsp; She also received the Distinguished Public  Service Award from the Arizona Regional Board of Directors of the  Anti-Defamation League; the Freedom of Information Award from the Arizona  Newspaper Association; the Good Neighbor Award from United   States and Mexico Chambers of Commerce; and the <em>Condecoracion  Aguila Azteca</em> from the government of Mexico.</p>
