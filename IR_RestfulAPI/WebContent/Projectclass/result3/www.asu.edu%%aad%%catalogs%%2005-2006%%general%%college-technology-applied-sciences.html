Purpose</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The College of Technology and Applied Sciences (CTAS) helps students develop knowledge and skill in technological fields that qualify them for career positions and leadership responsibility in industry, government, and commercial enterprise. Each student is guided to select a major that addresses short-term employment goals through state-of-the-art technological preparation. Long-term career aspirations are supported through the development of a strong base in mathematics, science, engineering, and technical principles, coupled with a solid foundation in liberal arts and a commitment to lifelong learning.</p>
<p>
Engineering technology programs offer professional preparation through a BS degree that stresses state-of-the-art technological applications. Special emphasis is placed on the development of knowledge and skill in applied mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering principles with formal laboratory experiences. This mixed educational approach provides the basis for both employment and a long-term career evolution.</p>
<p>
The other CTAS technology programs provide the opportunity for students to develop knowledge and skill in solving broad-scale industrial problems, operating modern technological systems, and managing personnel in the implementation of processes and production. Programs of study focus on the latest technologies in areas such as aviation flight training and management, environmental technology management, graphic information technology, fire service management, and industrial management.</p>
<p>
Each student is encouraged to participate in creative activities through a close relationship with a faculty mentor. Learning through execution of the scientific method, using both inductive and deductive processes in applied research activities, is essential for both faculty and students.</p></div>

<h3>
<b>
Preprofessional Status</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
All other students are admitted with preprofessional status and may apply for professional status after they have removed the deficiency that disallows awarding professional status. All students are admitted to the professional flight concentration, in the Department of Aeronautical Management Technology, with preprofessional status. A secondary application process is required to attain professional status. Students with preprofessional status may not register for 300- and 400-level courses in the college until they have been awarded professional status. See an advisor for details.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Transfer Credit</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Credit for courses taken at a community college or another four-year institution is awarded according to the guidelines under 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a11716">Transfer Credit</a>. Students who are transferring from an Arizona community college and have been in continuous residence may continue under the catalog in effect at the time of their entrance into the community college. Students should be aware that some course work that transfers to ASU may not be applicable toward CTAS degree requirements. Students should confer with an advisor. The College of Technology and Applied Sciences maintains a cooperative agreement with most Arizona community colleges and with selected out-of-state colleges and universities to structure programs that are directly transferable into the technology programs at East campus. For assistance in transferring from Arizona community colleges, transfer guides are available at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/provost/articulation">www.asu.edu/provost/articulation</a>.</p>
<p>
Courses taken more than five years before admission to a CTAS degree program are not normally accepted for transfer credit at the option of the department in which the applicant wishes to enroll. Courses completed within the five years preceding admission are judged as to their applicability to the student&#8217;s curriculum.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Admission&#8212;BAS Degree</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Admission to the BAS degree program is restricted to students holding an AAS degree from a regionally accredited U.S. postsecondary educational institution. A GPA of 2.00 or higher is required for all resident applicants and a 2.50 for nonresident applicants.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Advising</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
New incoming and transfer students should seek initial advising from an academic advisor in the Dean&#8217;s Office. CTAS students are then assigned faculty advisors who assist them with planning a program of study in the department of their major. The college requires that students consult with advisors before registering each semester. Advisors should be made aware of any employment obligations or special circumstances that may affect a student&#8217;s ability to successfully handle a full course load. CTAS students may register for a maximum of 19 semester hours per semester. Any student wishing to take more than the maximum must petition the CTAS Standards Committee and have an approval on file before registering for a course overload.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Graduation Requirements</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Students must meet all university graduation requirements given in 
<a href="university-graduation-requirements.html#a29335">University Graduation Requirements</a>, as well as degree requirements of their major in the College of Technology and Applied Sciences. For detailed information on the degree requirements of a major in CTAS, refer to that department&#8217;s individual description.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
College Standards</b>
</h2>
<h3>
<b>
Pass/Fail Grades</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The College of Technology and Applied Sciences does not offer pass/fail grades. Courses graded on a pass/fail basis do not count toward degree credit in CTAS. Students may request credit for pass/fail courses by petitioning the CTAS Standards Committee.</p></div>
<h3>
<b>
Entry into Upper-Division Courses (BS Degree)</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Before enrolling in courses at the 300 level and above, CTAS students must be in professional status within the college. Students who are not in good academic standing must petition the CTAS Standards Committee. Students enrolled in another ASU college may not register for any 300- and 400-level CTAS courses unless those courses are required in the degree program and the students have the proper course prerequisites. </p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Academic Standards</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Retention.</b> 
A student is expected to make satisfactory progress toward completion of degree requirements to continue enrollment in the College of Technology and Applied Sciences. Any one of the following conditions is considered unsatisfactory progress and results in the student&#8217;s being placed on probationary status:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
a semester with a GPA less than or equal to 1.50; </li>
<li>
two successive semesters with GPAs less than 2.00; or</li>
<li>
an ASU cumulative GPA less than 2.00.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
A student on probation is subject to disqualification if (1) a semester GPA of 2.25 is not attained and the cumulative GPA is below 2.00 at the end of the probationary semester or (2) the student is placed on probation for two consecutive semesters and is unable to achieve the standard GPAs stated in number one.</p>
<p>
Students on academic probation are not allowed to register for more than 13 semester hours. Probationary students may not register for the semester following the semester in which they were declared probationary without a special permit from an advisor in the dean&#8217;s office. Special permits are given only after the registrar records grades for the current semester.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Disqualification.</b> 
During a semester on academic probation, a student who fails to meet the retention standards is disqualified. Students may request a review of their disqualification status by contacting the CTAS associate dean in the College of Technology Dean&#8217;s Office. Any disqualified student who is accepted by another college at ASU may not register for courses in CTAS unless the courses are required in the new major. Disqualified students who register for courses in CTAS may be withdrawn from these courses any time during the semester.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Reinstatement.</b> 
The college does not accept an application for reinstatement until the disqualified student has remained out of the college for at least a 12-month period. Merely having remained in disqualified status for this period of time does not, in itself, constitute a basis for reinstatement. Proof of ability to do satisfactory college work in the chosen discipline is required; for example, completing pertinent courses in the discipline at a community college with higher-than-average grades.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Student Responsibilities</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Course Prerequisites.</b> 
Students should consult the <i>
Schedule of Classes</i>
 and the catalog for course prerequisites. Students who register for courses without the designated prerequisites may be withdrawn without their consent at any time before the final examination. The instructor, the chair of the department, or the dean of the college may initiate such withdrawals. In such cases, students do not receive monetary reimbursement. </p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Special Programs</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Academic Recognition.</b> 
Students completing baccalaureate degree requirements receive the appropriate honors designations on their diplomas consistent with the requirements specified by the university.</p>
<p>
Students in the college are encouraged to seek information concerning entry into honor societies that enhance their professional stature. Tau Alpha Pi is the engineering technology honor society, and Alpha Eta Rho is available for aeronautical management technology students. </p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Barrett Honors College.</b> 
The College of Technology and Applied Sciences participates in the programs of the Barrett Honors College, which provides enhanced educational experiences to academically superior undergraduate students. Participating students can major in any academic program. For more information, see 
<a href="general-studies.html#a88218">General Studies</a>.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Scholarships.</b> 
Information and applications for academic scholarships for continuing students may be obtained by contacting departmental offices. Other scholarships may be available through the university&#8217;s Student Financial Assistance Office.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
ROTC Students.</b> 
Students pursuing a commission through either the Air Force or Army ROTC program must take 12 to 20 semester hours of courses in the Department of Aerospace Studies or Department of Military Science. To preclude excessive overloads, these students should plan on at least one additional semester to complete degree requirements.
