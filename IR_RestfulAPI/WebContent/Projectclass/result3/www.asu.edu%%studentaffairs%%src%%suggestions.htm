	    <p> &quot;The machines are so old I'm afraid they will break if I use them. The treadmills with the tractor track make the user trip and there are never enough working treadmills for people that want to run. At least 3 are always broken!&quot; </p>
	    <h3>Response:</h3>
	    <p>We maintain the machines on a regular basis. We have a very extensive maintenance program for the cardio and strength equipment in the SRC. It is because of the maintenance that we conduct, that the equipment last as long as it does. We would agree that we need to replace some of the older equipment with newer equipment. However, we do not have the money to invest in this type of replacement. </p>
	    <p>As for the Woodway treadmills tracks causing a trip hazard, many of our patron enjoy the Woodway treadmills and I the equipment is proven to be safe by industry tests. However, we try to provide a diverse selection of equipment. <br>
	      With that said, I encourage you to use the Precor treadmills. They have a smooth belt and may allow you to work out more comfortably. </p>
	    <p>Finally, because of the high use we experience at the SRC, we do experience some down time with our equipment. We attempt to get the equipment repaired as soon as possible. However, sometimes we have to wait on parts that may be back ordered, or for a company to come in to make the repair.</p>

	    <h3>Response:</h3>
	    <p>We are aware of both of these issues. Both repairs involve a substantial cost. These costs are beyond what the SRC can financially afford to pay. Therefore, we are submitting both repairs as part of the end of year repair<br>

	    <p>  &quot; it is hot by the treadmills. Put up shades to block the sun/turn down the AC get nice treadmills. Not safe to run when it is so hot in here. &quot;<br>
        </p>
	    <h3>Response:</h3>
	    <p>We recently trimmed the trees at the pool, allowing more sunlight in the facility. As result, it took a few days for the air temperature to balance. I hope that you are more comfortable working out now. If not, please notify the<br>
	      front desk and we will contact Facilities Management.</p>
	    <p>Regarding the installation of shades, the SRC operates with natural lightning as much as possible. Therefore, will not be installing shades on the windows.</p>
	    <p>Finally, I am sorry that you are unhappy with the condition of the treadmills. We purchased new treadmills approximately a year ago. Treadmills are very expensive and we have established a replacement plan. The plan does not include the treadmills to be replaced for at least 2 years. If you discover any broken<br>
	      equipment, please inform the SRC staff and we will get it repaired as soon as we are able.</p>
	    <p>Thanks for the feedback.</p>

	    <p>The SRC averages 4800 people per day. The majority of these users prefer to<br>

As for the East Field, since the West Field was closed during the Spring semester, the East Field received a large amount of use.&nbsp; This caused significant turf erosion.&nbsp; We are presently attempting to overseed and fertilize the field to prepare it for the Fall semester.&nbsp; We hope that the East Field will also be open on August 1. As for the fee that is paid, the fee you pay is for the use of the entire SRC Complex.&nbsp; Unfortunately, each space that you would like to use, will have to be shut down, or closed, at some time within the year for maintenance.&nbsp; I encourage you to use other areas that are presently available.

        &quot;The tennis courts in front to the SRC need to be washed - at least once a month. Hire a student, (cheap). The tennis nets are unacceptable. Buy new nets - $100 each. Macy Sales - Tennis Supplies in Phoenix. Think of all the visitors - They see bad nets, dirty courts don't care attitude.<br>
        Contract out someone to clean upper window inside the SRC. Spider webs and take pride in SRC, dust everywhere.&quot;</p>
	  <h3>Response:</h3>
	  <p>First off, thanks for your comment. You are 100% correct. We want to maintain a positive imagine for our patrons of the SRC. I hope that the maintenance demands and follow-up does not demonstrate a &quot;don't care attitude.&quot;</p>
	  <p>Regarding the washing of the outside tennis courts, that is the responsibility of ASU Facilities Management. Unfortunately, with their staffing demands the washing of the court is not big as a priority as blowing the leaves and picking up the trash. We will see if we are able to establish a washing routine through the SRC staffing.<br>
          <br>
          As for the nets, we will have the damaged nets replaced as soon as possible.</p>
	  <p>Finally, Facilities Management has strict guidelines as to how high their employees clean high areas. This policy has been established for the safety of the employees. With that said. Facilities Management contracts a company to come in and clean the windows of the SRC every August. The SRC also contracts the same company, at the same time, to clean the high areas in the hallways, stairwell and gymnasiums.</p>

	  This facility needs more machines. I pay for it so I deserve what I pay for.
	  <h3>Response:</h3>
	  <p>Thanks for your comment. I, as well as many of the other members of the SRC, agree that we need more machine/workout equipment. Unfortunately, our operational budget does not allow for us to purchase additional equipment or replace old equipment as often as we should. </p>
	  <p>As for the $25 fee that students pay to use the facility each semester, I must point out that that fee does not go to the operational budget of the SRC. That fee go directly to pay the debt of the facility, or the cost of construction. The operational budget comes from local collections. That is money distributed from the university, money from program fees, money from optional memberships, etc.</p>
	  <p>Unfortunately, our operational budget has dedicated purposes throughout the year. At the end of each year, usually July 1, if we have money left over, we will allocate it to replacement of equipment, capital improvements, and repairs of large cost items. Often there is not much money left therefore, our spending power is limited.</p>
	  <p>Last summer, our Director dedicated spending money out of our reserve accounts to pay for the additional treadmills and the electrical project that was necessary to operate the treadmills. The choice of purchasing treadmills was primarily because of feedback from the users, and because the summer before we purchased new stationary bikes. </p>
	  <p>The SRC has a little over $2 million in deferred maintenance that needs to be addressed. However, with limited revenue streams, this costly item will not be addressed immediately. Instead, we have to make priority decisions. Deferred maintenance items would be replacement of the carpet upstairs, which is still original from 1989, replacement of old cardio and strength equipment, that is still original from 1989, repairs to the balcony tiles, still original from 1989, and countless other projects. </p>

	  <p>With the addition of the McAllister Village across the street from the SRC, our user numbers will increase.

	  <p>So much of the cardio equipment is malfunctioning or outright broken. I feel like this gym is falling apart underneath me! In the past 3 years I've been coming here, the quality of the facility and equipment has declined.
</p>
	  <h3>Response:</h3>
	  <p>Thanks for your email and the details of the equipment that is not operating correctly. Please share information regarding damaged equipment with our front desk staff. The more they know, the better we can serve you. If you do not have time, please feel free to email me. Each piece of equipment has a number on it. Please report the type of equipment, the number and the specific problem. We will have it repaired as soon as possible. I am sorry to hear that you are unhappy with the service that you are experiencing at the SRC. I assure you that we have every intention to provide the best service possible. However, our present operational budget plays a major factor in our decision where we allocate our spending. Below is a informational piece that I share with students that are asking questions regarding our decisions how we spend out operational budget. I hope it provides an understanding of some of the issues that we face when making priorities. In addition, I would like to point out that the operational budget go to repairs of cardio/strength equipment, facility repairs, general maintenance issues, program equipment, employment salaries and many other items. The $25 fee that students pay to use the facility each semester, does not go to the operational budget of the SRC. That fee go directly to pay the debt of the facility, or the cost of construction. The operational budget comes from local collections. That is money distributed from the university, money from program fees, money from optional memberships, etc. Unfortunately, our operational budget has dedicated purposes throughout the year.

In regards to the upkeep of the equipment that we do have, we have one maintenance mechanic on staff to service all the equipment. He is very dependable and does his best to keep up. However, as I said before, often we are not aware of the malfunctioning equipment. Please keep me informed. Unfortunately, there are times when we have to order parts, or we have to have a service expert visit. This will prolong the time it takes to repair the equipment.

Thanks for the information regarding the equipment. We hope to have it addressed by next Monday or Tuesday.

	  <p>&quot;How much money does the school invest in the SRC? THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH MACHINES!!&quot;
</p>
	  <h3>Response</h3>
	  <p>Thanks for your comment. I, as well as many of the other members of the SRC, agree that we need more machine/workout equipment. Unfortunately, our operational budget does not allow for us to purchase additional equipment or replace old equipment as often as we should to meet the demand of our users. However, there are slow use times in which the equipment is available. These times are generally, Monday -Friday from 8am - 11am and 2pm - 5pm. I realize that these may not be ideal time for you, but they are options.

In addition to these dates, we have a custodial crew that help maintain the SRC facility during normal day to day operations. However, with the user load that the SRC experiences, the cleanliness of the SRC has always been a concern. Therefore, we have assembled a maintenance crew of student employees that will be supervised by the SRC staff and work in collaboration with the custodial staff. By doing so we hope to continually get better in maintaining the SRC.
