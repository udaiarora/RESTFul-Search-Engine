      <h2>Statehood Picnic welcomes new legislative members</h2>
      <p> <img src="campus_images/statehoodpicnic_022103.jpg" width="288" height="184" align="right">The 
        ASU Alumni Association sponsored its 20th annual Statehood Picnic, Feb. 
        17. The informal gathering at Wesley Bolin Plaza, located near the state 
        capitol, has been an annual event since 1983 when the picnic was first 
        held to honor the legislature for its ASU support. </p>
      <p>This year, the gathering of ASU supporters, students, parents, faculty 
        and staff welcomed more than 30 new state legislative members and their 
        staff to the tradition. More than 600 people attended the picnic, a record 
        number for the event. <br>
        Blake Anderson, ASU state relations director, said the impressive attendance 
        - 45 of the 60 members of the House of Representatives and 15 of the 30 
        Senate members - demonstrated legislators' great support for the university. 
      </p>
      <p>"We are very grateful to legislators for working so diligently to balance 
        the state budget while reaffirming the enormous public contribution the 
        state universities make not only in economic terms but also to the quality 
        of life for Arizona citizens," he said.</p>
      <p>Gail Howard, economic policy adviser for Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano, 
        said although the governor was not able to attend the event in person, 
        she supports the universities and their teaching and research missions.</p>
      <p>"The governor knows the state universities are a critical engine for 
        the Arizona economy and now is not the time to be making Draconian cuts 
        to their budgets," Howard said. ASU President Michael Crow told the state 
        legislature that providing the necessary financial resources to fund research 
        infrastructure is a key priority for the university. An investment in 
        ASU today will not only help establish Arizona as an important industry 
        force, but it will also enable the university to become a more independent, 
        self-funded entity.</p>
      <p>The Arizona Biodesign Institute (AzBio) Mobile Bone Density Lab, a 30-foot 
        long motorized research center, made its debut at the event as one of 
        many quality exhibits presented by ASU students and faculty. Kathy Matt, 
        AzBio assistant director, said the newly completed lab-on-wheels is an 
        integral component to fulfilling the institute's mission of research, 
        teaching and service.</p>
      <p>Matt, who researches the effects of stress on the human body, said the 
        motorized lab will reach community populations who may not be familiar 
        with the university's research or other community outreach programs.</p>
      <p>Two former students of Matt's, Shauna Traub and Christy Dueck, donated 
        the mobile lab to ASU in December. In making the donation, Matt's former 
        students made their mentor's longtime dream - to bring her research into 
        communities - a reality. Matt has applied for grants that would allow 
        her to also bring the state-of-the-art equipment into economically disadvantaged 
        neighborhoods for much needed health screenings.</p>
      <p>Besides offering community bone density assessments, the mobile lab also 
        measures body fat and muscle mass. The test data is then mapped to determine 
        participants' individualized risk for certain disease. Once identified, 
        at-risk participants will also receive counseling on possible intervention 
        measures to slow or eliminate the risk factors. </p>
      <p>Matt says most diseases are contracted through a combination of genetic 
        and environmental factors. </p>
      <p>"Identifying a potential health problem before it occurs is an important 
        first step toward creating a society with less disease and other serious 
        health problems," she said.</p>
      <p>Marla Giarratano, director of ASU Alumni Association Constituent Relations, 
        says her organization and its Phoenix chapter appreciate the generosity 
        of dozens of volunteers who have helped to make the Statehood Picnic successful 
        over the last two decades.</p>
      <p>"This is a great opportunity to showcase the wonderful research being 
        done at ASU and to let our legislators see how the university community 
        supports the greater vision of Arizona's future," Giarratano said. "We 
        are so pleased to be able to continue this tradition."</p>
