<h2>
Preston, Ralph</h2>
<i><font size=+1>The Modern English Fruit-Gardener and Practical Wall-Tree
Pruner: Explaining the improved methods of propagating, raising, planting,
pruning, and training all sorts of fruit- trees, and for walls, espaliers,
and standards, with the art of forcing early fruits in hot-walls, peach-houses,
vineries, &amp;c.</font></i>
<p>London: Printed for John Fielding, 1785.
<p>Ralph Preston, gardener at Chelsea, wrote this popular fruit culture
book, which is illustrated with designs for hot-walls and forcing-houses.&nbsp;
Preston writes this work because nothing exists which covers the subject
in sufficient detail.&nbsp; His work "is not founded upon theory or verbal
information, but on real and practical experiments."&nbsp; Preston begins
with general information about fruit trees, including propagation, grafting,
and budding.&nbsp; Then particular information is given for specific types
of fruit trees, such as plum, cherry, almond, and fig.&nbsp; Raising fruit
early by artificial heat is covered, as are in-depth discussions of various
methods for grafting, raising, and training fruit trees.&nbsp; Standards
are also given for various types of fruit trees.
