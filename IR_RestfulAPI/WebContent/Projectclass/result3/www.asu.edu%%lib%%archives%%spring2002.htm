<p>
  In response to popular demand, and starting with the Fall semester, the Labriola 
  Center was open for service to students and the public between 10 a.m. and 5 
  p.m. daily. As a result, attendance and use of the Center's collections almost 
  doubled.<br>
  The Center is grateful to Noel Stowe, Chair of ASUs History Department, who 
  collaborated with us and assigned two Graduate Teaching Assistants, to provide 
  a total of 20 hours of reference for our patrons and assist with other projects. 
</p>
<p><b>The Center welcomes:</b><br>
  Vickey Kalambakal, who is in her first year of a Masters program in the History 
  of the American West. She left the aerospace industry after 12 years, entered 
  UCLA, and received her B.A. in history in 2001. She is a free-lance writer and 
  has published in American History Magazine, LAX Magazine and others.<p>
  Alton Carroll has a B.A. in history from the University of Texas at San Antonio 
  and an M.A. from Purdue University. His thesis was entitled &quot;Medicine Bags 
  and Dog Tags: American Indian Veterans, their Traditional Ways, and their Influence 
  on the Military.&quot; He is in the doctoral program at ASU, continuing his 
  interest in American Indian veterans. </p>

  Even more important is the fact that they have just finished indexing the Hopi 
  newspaper from Oraibi, Arizona, Qua't&ouml;qti or Eagle's Cry. The paper was 
  published between 1973 and 1985 and Emilia and Michael have described 560 articles 
  from the paper. As far as we know, this paper is not indexed in any other media. 
  It contains a good deal of historical information on the Navajo-Hopi land dispute 
  and can be searched by clicking on &quot;American Indian Index&quot; from the 
  Labriola website.<br>
  In addition to the above, the students have indexed articles from Native Monthly 
  Reader, Pima Maricopa Echo, Winnebago Indian News, First Nation Messenger, Intertribal 
  News and many others.<br>
</p>
<p>Emilia Morgan plans to graduate with a degree in Social Work as well as American 
  Indian Studies. She wants to be with a social service agency and work with people 
  in the Indian Community.<p>
  Michael Redhouse is a Biology senior from Shiprock, New Mexico, and will be 
  going to medical school. He wants to help and educate Native people in physical 
  health, diet, and in life.</p>

<p> The Marine Corps established the Navajo Code Talker Program in September 1942. 
  At that time, few people outside of the reservation spoke the Navajo language, 
  and it was expected that it would be completely unintelligible to an outsider 
  and could successfully be used as a code to transmit secret messages (the Choctaw 
  language had been used as a code during World War I).<p>
  The experiment was completely successful and by the end of World War II there 
  were some 400 active Navajo code talkers in the Pacific Campaign. They were 
  instrumental in almost every Marine action in the Pacific from Guadalcanal to 
  Okinawa in 1945. To this day, it remains the only un-broken code ever used in 
  the history of war. <br>
</p>
At the center of the exhibit is an 11&quot; code talking Marine, complete 
      with camouflage-covered helmet, web belt, hand phone set, backpack radio, 
      shirt, pants, boots, and M-1 rifle. He speaks seven Navajo phrases and translates 
      them to English. <br>
      Since there were no Navajo words for many phrases, the Navajo Code Talkers 
      created words that could translate. For example, a Commanding General was 
      a &quot;war chief,&quot; America was &quot;our mother,&quot; a tank became 
      &quot;tortoise,&quot; and route became &quot;rabbit trail.&quot;

  The Office of Institutional Advancement at ASU sponsors various tours for faculty 
  and staff, and the ASU Community. Up to this time, we have talked about and 
  shown some of the Labriola Center &quot;treasures&quot; to a group from the 
  University Club Box Lunch, and some 20 individuals from the Scottsdale Seniors 
  organization. In March, we will welcome a group of supporters of the Graduate 
  College.</p>

  Peterson Zah, Counselor to President Coor on American Indian Affairs, announced 
  that there are 1,089 American Indian students registered at ASU; 120 of them 
  in the Honors Program, and over 200 in the graduate program. This represents 
  a 300% increase in the past 10 years. </p>

<p> While surfing the Internet, Sandra Thompson of Queensland, Australia, found 
  her grandfather's name, Charles F. Shaffer, on the Labriola Center web page. 
  The Shaffers lived and taught school in the village of Supai, ten miles below 
  the rim of the Grand Canyon between 1930 and 1940.
<p> The Labriola Center purchased the collection from a dealer in 1996. There 
  are a number of scrap books, letters, postcards, and photographs by a frequent 
  visitor, Joseph Muench. We have sent a copy of the Finding Guide to Ms. Thompson.

  The Labriola Center receives a great many gift books every year that are duplicated 
  in both the circulating stacks and in the Center. Once or twice a year, we mail 
  a list to Native libraries in the Four Corners area and receive an overwhelming 
  response. During this past year, we have distributed over 200 books to some 
  10 needy and grateful libraries. <p>In response, Librarian, Leona Smith, wrote 
  from the AhaMakav Tribal Library in the Mohave Valley of Arizona: &quot;Thank 
  you for thinking of the tribal libraries and sharing your abundance. It will 
  benefit many people.&quot; And Jennifer Yellow Hair at Rock Point Community 
  School on the Navajo Reservation, wrote, &quot;A big thank you and an appreciation

  The National Agricultural Library has been involved with Tribal Colleges and 
  Universities for a number of years now, in an effort to enhance library and 
  information services to under-served populations in the united States and Canada. 
  It informs us that a recent fire at the Red Crow Community College on the Blood 
  Reserve in Alberta, Canada, destroyed about 60 percent of the Library's holdings. 
  <br>
  This included its collection of journals, magazines, newspapers, artwork, furniture, 
  and electronic equipment. The Native American collection of 2,000 books was 
  completely destroyed. The Library is asking for donations of books in all disciplines. 
  Unfortunately, our library distributed our books before this news reached us.

  Arizona State University History Professor, Robert A. Trennert, reports that 
  his book, The Phoenix Indian School: Forced Assimilation in Arizona, 1891-1935 
  (University of Oklahoma Press, 1988) will be translated to Japanese and available 
  in Japan sometime in the near future. The book is also accessible as an electronic 
  book through the World Wide Web.<p>
  We have also been told that the original volume will be added to a time capsule 
  at the Phoenix Indian School.<br>
  A more recent Trennert publication, White Man's Medicine: Government Doctors

  John F. Boette, who recently donated the Indian Tribal Series books and medallions 
  by the Franklin Mint, has added three medals to the Labriola Center collection. 
  <p>
  The 3&quot; Sterling Jim Thorpe Commemorative Medal was authorized by Public 
  Law 93-132, and struck at the Philadelphia Mint. A portrait of Jim Thorpe is 
  engraved on the obverse within a pentagon representing the Pentathlon, within 
  a decagon representing the Decathlon, the athletic events that he won in the 
  1912 Olympics. The reverse design symbolizes the truth in the statement made 
  by King Gustav of Sweden: &quot;You sir, are the world's greatest athlete.&quot; 
  Thorpe was later denied the honors as he had played minor league baseball for 
  money, which made him a professional athlete.<p>
  Proceeds of the sale were to be used to restore Jim's name to the Olympic record 
  book and the return of his awards to the U.S.A., create a national Jim Thorpe 
  organization to honor all of this nation's outstanding athletes, and to build 
  a national Jim Thorpe shrine. The International Olympic Committee restored his 
  status and his medals in 1982.<br>
  The United States minted Indian Peace Medals from the administration of President 
  George Washington until Congress stopped ratifying U.S. treaties with Indian 
  nations. These were presented as a symbol of allegiance to friendly and peaceful 
  chiefs and other Native American leaders.<p>
  The Mescalero Apache Tribe celebrated the centennial of the United States Presidential 
  Executive Order setting aside its present reservation on July 8, 1973. In connection 
  with the celebration, the tribe minted a its own peace medal for its leader, 
  Wendell Chino, to present to President Nixon.

</p>
<p>During 2001? Students and researchers find many ways to use the Labriola Center 
  collections and their search for information embraced numerous topics keeping 
  our research staff on its toes.<br>
  The ASU debating team was assigned a semester-long project on the issues of 
  Native gambling. Students from Construction 101 required material on the construction 
  of a Navajo hogan and we not only found construction plans but also a reminiscence 

  by an individual pointing out the problems one might face in building the structure. 
  Other students were assigned Hohokam Platform Mounds and we could help them 
  with information from the Library and also send them to the local Pueblo Grande 
  archaeological site, where they could view remains on site.<p>
  Sovereign rights and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation 
  Act was a popular topic. This was also the year of the Code Talker, boarding 
  and mission schools, Native American women's literature, American Indians in 
  cinema and the arts, American law &amp; s ociety, and issues in bilingualism, 
  education, and the environment. <br>
  In addition, the Labriola Center welcomed Dr. Susan Miller and her students 
  twice weekly to the Center's classroom, where she taught American Indian Languages 
  and Culture.</p>
<p>
  <font size="+1" color="#CC3300"><a name=RESEARCHING>Researching Newspapers Eased by Indexing Projects</a></font><p>
  One of the most valuable sources of information is found in Native Newspapers. 
  Until recently, however, one needed patience and determination to read hundreds 
  of pages of crumbling newsprint or peruse numerous rolls of microfilm to find 
  an elusive article. Help is on the way.<p>
  In addition to our own efforts at indexing, we want to tell our readers about 
  American Native Press Archives at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock: <a href="http://www.anpa.ualr.edu">www.anpa.ualr.edu 
  </a> Directors Daniel Littlefield and James Parins have indexed the Cherokee 
  Advocate for the years 1870-1879. It features an alphabetical list of names 
  and subjects and is accessed through the above website. They are also working 
  on other titles, which will also appear on the website.<p>
  The American Native Press archives some 2000 Native papers in both hard copy 
  and microform covering the period from 1828 to the present. The Archives is 
  also the official repository for the Papers of the Native American Journalists 
  Association and the Wordcraft Circle of Native Writers and Storytellers.</p>
