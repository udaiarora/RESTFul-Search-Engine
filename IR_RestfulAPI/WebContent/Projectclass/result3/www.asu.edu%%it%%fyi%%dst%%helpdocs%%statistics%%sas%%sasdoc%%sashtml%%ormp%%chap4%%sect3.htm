<H2>Network Models  </H2>
<P><A NAME="idxnet0003">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet0004">&#13;</A>A network consists of a collection of nodes joined by a collection of arcs. 
The arcs connect nodes and convey flow of one or more commodities
that are supplied at supply nodes and demanded at demand nodes 
in the network.
Each arc has a cost per unit of flow, a flow
capacity, and a lower flow bound associated with it.
An important concept in network modeling is <EM>conservation 
of flow</EM>. 
<A NAME="idxnet0005">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet0006">&#13;</A>Conservation of flow means that the total flow 
in arcs directed toward a node, plus the supply at the node,
minus the demand at the node, equals the total flow
in arcs directed away from the node.
<P>A network and its associated data can be described 
in SAS data sets.
PROC NETFLOW uses this description and finds the flow through 
each arc in the network that minimizes the total cost of flow, meets the 
demand at demand nodes using the supply at supply nodes
so that the flow through each arc is on or 
between the arc's lower flow bound and its capacity, and
satisfies the conservation of flow.
<P>One class of network model is the
production-inventory-distribution problem.
The diagram in <A HREF="#netfpis">Figure 4.1</A> illustrates this problem.
The subscript on the PROD, INVNTRY, and SALES nodes
indicates the time period.
Notice that if you by replicate sections
of the model, the notion of time can be included.

<P>In this type of model, the nodes can represent a wide
variety of facilities.
Several examples are are
suppliers, spot markets, importers,
farmers, manufacturers, factories, parts of plant, production lines,
waste disposal facilities,
workstations, warehouses, coolstores, 
depots, wholesalers, export markets,
ports, rail junctions, airports, road intersections,
cities, regions, shops, customers, and consumers.
The diversity of this selection demonstrates the richness
of potential applications of this model.
<P>Depending upon the interpretation of the nodes, the objectives
of the modeling exercise can vary widely. 
Some common types of objectives are:
<UL>
<LI> to reduce collection or purchase costs of raw materials
<LI> to reduce inventory holding or backorder costs.
Warehouses and other storage facilities sometimes have
capacities, and there can be limits on the amount of goods that
can be placed on backorder
<LI> to decide where facilities should be located and what the capacity
of these should be.
Network models have been used to help decide
where factories, hospitals, ambulance and fire stations, 
oil and water wells, and schools should be sited
<LI> to determine the assignment of resources 
(machines, production capability, 
workforce) to tasks, schedules, classes, or files
<LI> to determine the optimal distribution of goods or services.
This usually means minimizing transportation costs, and
reducing time in transit or distances covered
<LI> to find the shortest path from one location to another
<LI> to ensure that demands (for example, production requirements, market demands,
contractural obligations) are meet
<LI> to maximize profits from the sale of products or the charge for
services
<LI> to maximize production by identifying bottlenecks
</UL>
<P>Some specific applications are
<UL>
<LI> car distribution models. These help
determine which models and numbers of cars should be
manufactured in which factories and where to distribute cars from these
factories to zones in the United States in order to meet customer
demand at least cost.
<LI> models in the timber industry. These help determine
when to plant and mill forests, schedule production
of pulp, paper and wood products, and distribute products for sale or export.
<LI> military applications. The nodes can be 
theatres, bases, ammunition dumps, logistical suppliers, or 
radar installations.
Some models are used to find the best ways to mobilize personnel and 
supplies and to evacuate the wounded in the least amount of time.
<LI> communications applications. The nodes can be
telephone exchanges, transmission lines, satelite links, and consumers.
In a model of an electrical grid, the nodes can be 
transformers, powerstations, watersheds, reservoirs, dams, and consumers.
Of concern might be the effect of high loads or outages.
