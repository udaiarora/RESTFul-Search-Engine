Tempe, AZ 85287-6006. <p><i>Abstract: </i>  In this investigation, several spectroscopic and analytical techniques were used to determine the chemical compositions and structures of the lead, zirconium, titanium, and Pb-(Zr,Ti) alkoxides involved in the sol-gel synthesis of PZT thin films.  These techniques included <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, and <sup>207</sup>Pb NMR; FT-IR; gas chromatography; Karl Fischer titration; and number-average molecular weights (M<sub>n</sub>) determined by cryoscopy. It was found that the titanium precursor had a M<sub>n</sub> of 548 and a formula of [Ti(OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sub>1,6</sub>; the zirconium precursor had a M<sub>n</sub> of 1015 and a formula of [Zr(OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>] <sub>2,6</sub>; and the lead precursor had a formula Pb<sub>6</sub> (OOCCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub> (OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>7</sub>? 4 H<sub>2</sub>O and a molecular weight of 2131 (M<sub>n</sub> = 2113).  It was observed that residual water from the incomplete dehydration of lead acetate trihydrate coupled with released water due to the esterification of acetic acid caused M-O-M (M = Pb, Zr, Ti) bonds in the Pb-(Zr, Ti) alkoxide.  Two possible isomeric structures of the Pb-(Zr, Ti) alkoxide have been proposed.  They are both cyclic and have a formula of Pb<sub>2</sub>M<sup>'</sup>M<sup>"</sup>O<sub>2</sub> (OR) <sub>8</sub> (ROH) <sub>2</sub>, (M<sup>'</sup>M<sup>"</sup> = Zr and/or Ti) and a molecular weight of 1336 (M<sub>n</sub> = 1386).<p><i>Journal of Sol-Gel Science and Technology 1:251-265 (1994). </i><br><hr><p><a href="../5abstrac.htm#coff">Return to Abstract List</a></body></html>
