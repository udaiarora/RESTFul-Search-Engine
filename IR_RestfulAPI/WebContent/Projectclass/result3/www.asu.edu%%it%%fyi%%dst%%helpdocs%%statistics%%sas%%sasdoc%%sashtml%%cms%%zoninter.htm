<P><A name="z0595093">&#13;  When you use SAS in noninteractive mode, the SAS program (which
has been stored in a CMS file) usually runs without your intervention.  CMS
retains exclusive use of the terminal as the noninteractive SAS job executes.
 However, if your SAS program invokes windowing procedures, you can interact
with the program during program execution.</A>
<P>To invoke SAS in noninteractive mode, enter the SAS
command followed by the name of the SAS program file that you want to execute,
as well as any SAS system options that you want to specify.  For example,
suppose you have stored SAS statements and data lines in a program file named
MYPROG SAS. At the CMS ready prompt, type the SAS command, the name of the
file, and any system options as follows:    

<PRE>sas myprog (nodate</PRE>
<P>The program file must have a filetype of SAS. However,
you do not need to include the filetype in the filename because the SAS command
uses the SAS filetype by default.  The program file can reside in any accessed
disk or SFS directory; SAS uses the standard CMS search order to locate the
file.  The file can contain either fixed-length lines or varying-length lines.
<P>A SAS program file can be constructed by any of the
following: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>the FILE command <P>

<LI>a CMS editor<P>

<LI>another
program.<P>
</UL>

<P>When you execute a SAS program noninteractively, the
SAS log and your procedure output file are each written to a CMS disk file.
Normally, these files are written to the disk on which the SAS program file
was found.  The SAS log is stored in a file of filetype SASLOG. The procedure
output (if any) is stored in a file of filetype LISTING.
<P>After the last step of your program executes, the CMS
READY prompt shows that CMS is again ready to process commands.
