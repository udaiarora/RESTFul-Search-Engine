          <h2>Lecture features influential civil rights policy maker</h2>
          <p>Though he&rsquo;s not a familiar household name, few people have had as much influence on the state of civil rights in America as Chistopher Edley Jr., a professor and dean of the University of California at Berkeley School of Law.</p>
          <p>Edley is an academic, to be sure, with impressive credentials in public policy and civil rights law, but the former adviser to President Jimmy Carter and President Bill Clinton has had an even more notable career as an activist and as a policy maker, wielding enormous influence on American social policy.</p>
          <p>Edley will be the featured speaker at this year&rsquo;s A. Wade Smith Memorial Lecture on Race Relations, to take place at 7 p.m., April 19, at ASU&rsquo;s Gammage Auditorium. Edley will give a free lecture titled &ldquo;Race, Policy and the Political Process.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Edley&rsquo;s academic work is primarily in the area of civil rights with additional concentrations in public policy and administrative law. Edley is co-founder of the Civil Rights Project, a renowned multidisciplinary research and policy think tank focused on issues of racial justice. He is serving a six-year term on the bipartisan U.S. Civil Rights Commission and is a member of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform.</p>
          <p>Edley was the assistant director of the White House domestic policy staff under President Carter, where his responsibilities included welfare reform, social security and a variety of anti-poverty measures. He served as national issues director for the 1988 Michael Dukakis presidential campaign, and as senior adviser on economic policy for President Clinton&rsquo;s transition team in 1992. In the Clinton administration, he worked as associate director for economics and government at the White House Office of Management and Budget from 1993 &ndash; 1995, and as special counsel to the president in 1995, directing a White House review of affirmative action and helping Clinton develop the &ldquo;mend it, don&rsquo;t end it&rdquo; position. He returned to the Clinton White House in 1997 as a consultant to the president&rsquo;s advisory board on the race initiative.</p>
          <p> Edley also is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration, a member of the board of the National Immigration Forum, and a member of the executive committee of the board of People for the American Way . He joined Berkeley School of Law as the dean in 2004 after 23 years on the law faculty at Harvard University . </p>
          <p>Edley, an articulate and insightful speaker, also is a media favorite. He has appeared in numerous national broadcast news programs, including ABC News&rsquo; &ldquo;Nightline,&rdquo; CNN&rsquo;s &ldquo;Capital Gang&rdquo; and CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Capital Report.&rdquo; He also has been quoted in major national print media, including the <em>New York Times, </em><em>Washington</em><em> Post, </em><em>L.A.</em><em> Times</em> and <em>Boston</em><em> Globe.</em></p>
          <p> The A. Wade Smith Memorial Lecture on Race Relations was created in 1995 to perpetuate the work of A. Wade Smith, professor and chair of sociology at ASU. Smith devoted his life to the ideal of racial parity and worked tirelessly to improve race relations on the ASU campus and within the greater community. When he died from cancer at the age of 43, his wife, family members and friends made memorial gifts to establish and fund this lecture series. </p>
          <p>The lecture is free and open to the public, but tickets are required. Tickets are available at ASU&rsquo;s Tempe Bookstore and at Changing Hands Bookstore, and they can be reserved online at (<a href="http://clas.asu.edu/newsevents/publicevents/wadesmith/AWSTickets.aspx">http://clas.asu.edu/newsevents/publicevents/wadesmith/AWSTickets.aspx</a>).</p>
          <p>Hathaway, with the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, can be reached at (480) 965-6375 or (hathaway@asu.edu).</p>
