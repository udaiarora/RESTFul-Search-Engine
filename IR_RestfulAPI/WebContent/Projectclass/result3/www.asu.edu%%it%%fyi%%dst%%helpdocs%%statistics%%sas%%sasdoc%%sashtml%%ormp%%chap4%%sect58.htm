<H2>Introduction  </H2>
<P>The Simplex algorithm, developed shortly after World War II, was the 
main method used to solve Linear Programming problems.
<A NAME="idxnet1469">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet1470">&#13;</A>Over the last decade, the Interior Point algorithm has been developed
<A NAME="idxnet1471">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxnet1472">&#13;</A>to also solve Linear Programming problems.
From the start it showed great theoretical promise, and considerable 
research in the area resulted in practical implementations that performed 
competivitely with the Simplex algorithm.
More recently, Interior Point algorithms have evolved to become
superior to the Simplex algorithm, in general,
especially when the problems are large.
<P>The Interior Point algorithm has been implemented in PROC NETFLOW.
This algorithm can be used to solve Linear Programs, as well as
network problems. When PROC NETFLOW detects
that the problem has no network component, it automatically envokes 
the Interior Point aglorithm to solve the problem.
The data required by PROC NETFLOW for a Linear Program resembles
the data for nonarc variables and constraints for
constrained network problems.
<P>If PROC NETFLOW does detect a network component to the problem,
(the problem has arcs),
you must specify the option <A HREF="sect30.htm#netflowintpoint">INTPOINT</A> in the <A HREF="sect15.htm#netflownetflow">PROC NETFLOW</A> statement
if you want to use the Interior Point algorithm.
PROC NETFLOW first converts the constrained network model into an 
equivalent Linear Programming formulation, solves that, then converts
the LP back to the network model.
These models remain conceptionally easy since they are
based on network diagrams that represent the problem pictorially.
This procedure accepts the network specification in a
format that is particularly suited to networks. 
This not only simplifies 
problem description but also aids in the interpretation of
the solution.
The conversion to and from the equivalent LP is done
&#34;behind the scenes&#34;.
<P>There are many variations of Interior Point algorithms.
PROC NETFLOW uses the Primal-Dual with Predictor-Corrector algorithm.
This algorithm and related theory
can be found in the texts by Roos, Terlaky, and Vial 1997, 
Wright 1996, and Ye 1996.
<P>The remainder of this section is split into two parts.
In the first part, how you use PROC NETFLOW's Interior Point algorithm 
to solve network problems is described.
In the second part, using PROC NETFLOW to solve Linear Programming problems
(it's Interior Point algorithm must be used) is described.
Both parts are organized similarly:
<UL>
<LI> The way data is supplied to PROC NETFLOW is outlined in a 
&#34;Getting Started&#34; subsection.
<LI> An &#34;Introductory Example&#34; is solved to demonstrate how the data is set up, 
how PROC NETFLOW is used to do the solution and the optimum saved.
<LI> More sophisticated ways to use PROC NETFLOW interactively are 
detailed in a &#34;Iteractively&#34; subsection.
<LI> A &#34;Functional Summary&#34; lists the statements and options
that can be used to control PROC NETFLOW.
Of particular interest are the options used to control the optimizer,
and the way the solution is saved into output data sets or is displayed.
<P></UL>
The part for Linear Programs has additional subsections:
<UL>
<LI> &#34;Mathematical Description of LP&#34;
<LI> &#34;Interior Point Algorithmic Details&#34;, a brief theory of the
algorithm containing information about the options that can be specified to control
the Interior Point algorithm.
<LI> &#34;Syntax&#34; subsection, which is a subset
of the syntax when the Simplex algorithm is used.
Gone are the statements and lists relevant only when the Simplex algorithm is 
used.
