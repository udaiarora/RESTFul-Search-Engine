      <h2><strong>W. P. Carey School of Business builds new leadership team </strong></h2>
      <p>The W. P. Carey School of Business announced a shift in senior leadership to align the organization under the leadership of Robert Mittelstaedt, who became the sixth dean in the business school's history July 1. </p>
      <p>Philip Regier, who has served as interim dean of the W. P. Carey School of Business for the past year, has been named deputy dean. In this newly created position, Regier will assist with the new dean's transition and work with the chairmen of the academic units in the management of their departments. This structure is utilized at a number of business schools, including Wharton, where Mittelstaedt was vice dean and director of the Aresty Institute of Executive Education. </p>
      <p>The new organizational model will allow the dean of the business school to focus more on increasing the school's national reputation, community engagement and development efforts. </p>
      <p>Kay Faris, who has been associated with the undergraduate program for more than 20 years, will replace Regier as associate dean for undergraduate programs. As assistant dean, she coordinated the re-accreditation of the W. P. Carey School of Business by AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) last winter. Faris will focus on identifying and implementing changes in the undergraduate curriculum, facilitating technology improvements and developing an undergraduate career center. </p>
      <p>At the same time, the school announced the appointment of Dennis Hoffman as associate dean of research and doctoral programs, and director of the L. William Seidman Research Institute. Gerald Keim has been named associate dean for the W. P. Carey MBA - Full-time Program, a responsibility formerly held by Hoffman. </p>
      <p>"Phil Regier was an effective leader during the transition year. As deputy dean, he will provide direction and support in the area of thought leadership as we accelerate the development of the W. P. Carey School," Mittelstaedt said. "This is an exceptionally strong and loyal team, and I am looking forward to a close working partnership with them." </p>
      <p>Hoffman, who has led full-time graduate business programs at the W. P. Carey School of Business as associate dean since 1999, replaces Timothy Hogan, who is retiring as the Seidman Institute director at the end of the month. </p>
      <p>Under Hoffman's leadership, the W. P. Carey MBA - Full-time Program achieved the highest ranking in the school's history - 29th in the nation - according to <em>U.S. News. </em> Hoffman guided the program through curriculum innovations and supported technology enhancements that made the school a model for the effective use of technology in the classroom. He lobbied successfully in the Pac-10 to launch a conference-level business case competition, which later led to the W. P. Carey School's victory in the first ever Pac-10 vs. Big Ten MBA Case Challenge. </p>
      <p>His new responsibilities formally reunite Hoffman with the research that has distinguished his career. Well-known for his work in the area of empirical macroeconomic modeling, Hoffman constructed the tax revenue forecasting model that has been used by the Executive Budget Office of the state of Arizona every year since 1982. Hoffman will also remain in charge of doctoral programs at the W. P. Carey School. </p>
      <p>As associate dean for the W. P. Carey MBA - Full-time Program, Keim will focus specifically on this reputation-building MBA program. Known as a great teacher, Keim brings a passion for MBA education and business school insights through his teaching at University of Western Ontario, Texas A&amp;M University and Stanford University. This spring, he was the recipient of the Teets Outstanding Graduate Teaching Award, given by students to the instructor they determine the most effective in the classroom. Keim's own education in economics and management allows for a deep understanding of analytical approaches and behavioral management theories - cornerstones of business education. </p>
      <p>Farquhar, with the W.P. Carey School of Business, can be reached at (480) 965-7774 or (liz.farquhar@asu.edu). </p>
