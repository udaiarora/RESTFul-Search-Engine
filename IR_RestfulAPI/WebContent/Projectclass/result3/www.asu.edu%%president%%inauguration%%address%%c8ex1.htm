We will enhance our study of the borderlands,         deepening our understanding of these transnational communities, societies,         and cultures of the American Southwest. Beyond the borderlands, we will         engage in productive social, economic and cultural dialogue with Mexico         and Central and South America. </p>      <p>The communities of the borderlands are uniquely advantaged and disadvantaged         at the same time. Situated between two cultures, they exist in a social,         economic, cultural, and political context that demands closer examination.         Disciplines that may come to bear on this research include history, economics,         political science, geography, sociology, both English and Latin American         literatures, and may include scientific research addressing environmental         and health challenges. </p>      <p> Turning our focus from the borderlands further south, Arizona State         University will also develop an initiative devoted to engaging the nations         and cultures of Latin America. We hope to bring new dimension to teaching         and scholarship on Mexico and Latin America, particularly with an interdisciplinary         emphasis not only on culture and society, but also on advancing technology,         increasing scientific understanding, helping to reduce poverty, and promoting         sustainable development. At the same time, we hope to discern new possibilities         for global engagement, not only for the nations and peoples of Latin America,         but for those of us north of the border. I am committed to these issues         and hope to engage in collaborative teaching, research, and knowledge         transfer with academic institutions in Latin America.<br>           </p></td>    <td align="center" valign="top"> &nbsp;<BR>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
