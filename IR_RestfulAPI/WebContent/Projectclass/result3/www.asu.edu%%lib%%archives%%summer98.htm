<a name=CARLISLE><h2>Carlisle Indian Industrial School Favorite Research 
Topic</h2></a>
                  
     Research on Native American Boarding
schools is a favorite topic for many ASU
undergraduates and Carlisle School is one that
tops the list.  It was the first off-reservation school
for Indian children and was operated between 1879
and 1918 by Richard Henry Pratt.  The Center has
the school's publication, <i>The Red Man</i>, on
microfilm, and can supply its students with video
recordings, books, oral histories and ephemeral
material, such as an 1885 article from <i>Frank
Leslies Popular Monthly</i>, "Educating the
Indians."<p>
     Now there is more.  Lisa Mitten,
American Indian Library Association,  reports the
formation of a new website in the Spring 1998
issue of <i>American Indian Libraries Newsletter</i>.  I
have just completed a "virtual tour" of the old
school grounds at Carlisle; read a fine segment on
the school's history; taken a look at the
bibliography of primary and secondary sources;
and was impressed that the author of the home page,
Barbara Landis, is adding lists of scholars who
once attended the school.  The Labriola Center
will link to the page and promote its use to our
students.

     First Nations people brought an
incredible array of arts and crafts to the Scottsdale
Center for the Arts for a three-day exhibition in
February. Artisans came from all over Canada,
including Vancouver Island and Alert Bay, British
Columbia; Winnipeg and Waywayseecappo,
Manitoba; Toronto and Tyendinaga, Ontario;
Yellowknife and the Hay River Reserve,
Northwest Territories; and cities in Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, and Labrador.

     White tents dotted the park, where each 
artist displayed individual creations: masks;

sculpture; clothing; bead and feather work, and
more.  Two members of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police added a certain elegance as they
strolled through the crowd in their red-jacketed
dress uniforms. Many visitors  happily munched
on delicate salmon burgers and native delicacies.

     Continuous screening of the video
documentary <i>In the Hands of the Raven</i> covered
the history and contemporary state of Northwest
Coast Native art.  There was a continuum of
activities on the outdoor center stage and
attendees could listen to the Metis Fiddlers or
watch Nisga's Ts'amiiks  dancers.  A highlight
was a Fashion Show by Sacred Soul Designs,
which were expertly modeled  by Native American
students from ASU.

<a name=CHEROKEE><h2>Cherokee Nation Film Festival</h2></a>
     The University of Oklahoma Libraries'
<b>Western History Collections</b>, in cooperation
with the <b>Oklahoma Historical Society</b>, have
completed filming the Cherokee Nation Papers.  
We learn that there are 68 rolls of microfilm in the
set, and these may be purchased or borrowed
through interlibrary loan. Those interested may
contact the Curator of the Western History
Collections, University of Oklahoma Libraries,
Room 452, Monnet Hall, Norman, Oklahoma,
73019.<p>
     The collection covers some 100 linear feet
of publications and official records of the
Cherokee Nation.  The personal papers of
Cherokee leaders James Madison Bell, Stand
Watie, John Rollin Ridge, and Elias C. Boudinot
are also part of the collection.  Inclusive dates for
the collection are 1830-1907.

     The Heard Museum sponsored its 40th
annual Indian Fair on March 7 and 8, 1998,  and
invited over 350 of the nation's top Native
American artists to show and sell their work.  The
fair draws some 20,000 people over the two-day
period.  The artists set up under the protective
canopy of huge tents, where they sell cultural
items, baskets, fine arts, jewelry, pottery, weaving
and fabric art, wood carving and sculpture.
<p>
     Visitors had the opportunity to listen to
music provided by the Ga:ak Akimel Waila Band,
cheer on the World Champion Hoop Dance
finalists, or watch a variety of dancers including
the Apache Crown Dancers from the White
Mountain Apache Tribe, who performed
traditional Gaan dances representing the Mountain
Spirits.
<p>
     Visitors did not go hungry and sampled a
variety of specialties.  A Hopi cook poured a
batter of blue corn, rabbit brush ashes, and water
over a hot piki stone, then folded and rolled it to
produce the crunchy, paper thin <b>PIKI</b>.

<p>
     Golden, fluffy <b>FRY BREAD</b> is always a
winner with the folks.  The Heard Museum tells us
that each year, some 1,300 pounds of flour and
815 pounds of vegetable shortening are used to
make the bread and that 27 pounds of honey and
32 pounds of powdered sugar are used to top it.
<p>
     A popular snack is <b>PARCHED CORN</b>,
which the Hopi cook from native corn in special
sand.
<p>
     <b>POSOLE</b>, popular among Arizona's
Tohono O'odham and New Mexico's pueblos, is a
spicy soup made from pork or beef and hominy
and red chile pods.
<p>
     <b>HOPI STEW</b> is made with hominy and
beef.  The hominy is soaked in rabbit brush ashes
to cause the kernels to pop and also give the stew
a distinctive flavor.
<p>
     The Apache people are noted for
<b>ACORN SOUP</b>.  They cook ground acorns until
the bitter flavor disappears and then combine the
acorns with meat and other ingredients.
