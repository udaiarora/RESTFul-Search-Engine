      <p>A graduate from Arizona State University is a product of the values
        of the New American University. This graduate, like graduates from other
        universities, is skilled in the competencies of communication, analytical
        and critical thinking, and quantitative analysis. He/she is also knowledgeable
        about US history and culture, in particular, and of world history and
        cultures in general. He/she has practiced, at some level, an array of
        disciplinary and interdisciplinary methodologies and studied an array
        of knowledge areas. He/she is a thoughtful, reflective, and engaged citizen.</p>
      <p>What distinguishes the ASU graduate from graduates of other colleges
        and universities, however, is the influence of the new American University&rsquo;s
        design imperatives upon the formation of the individual student. The
        ASU graduate is equipped with imagination, empathy, and curiosity. He/she
        understands the active nature of knowledge creation and application as
        the means for advancing human society through social, economic, political,
        and cultural entrepreneurship. He/she is a citizen of the world, who
        celebrates the energizing effects of intellectual and cultural diversity.
        The ASU graduate takes responsibility for living an examined life. </p>
      <p><strong> Learning Outcome 1: Knowledge Categories</strong><br>
          <br>
  Human beings understand the world through knowledge categories that are often
  traditionally-defined. ASU graduates will understand the content and methodology
  of these knowledge areas and of emerging fields, and will be prepared to develop
  new ways of knowing. The mission of the university is to provide opportunities
  and experiences in basic knowledge that include, but are not limited to, the
  following areas: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mathematic studies </li>
        <li>Humanities and the fine arts and design </li>
        <li>Social and behavior sciences </li>
        <li>Natural and physical sciences </li>
        <li>Technology </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong> Learning Outcome 2: Interdisciplinarity </strong></p>
      <p>Citizens and scholars who have interdisciplinary training will be able
        to work outside their own disciplines. They will understand the issues
        and the languages of other disciplines and be able to integrate these
        areas into new ideas and solutions. Student will collaborate across traditional
        disciplines. Not only will they understand what is being said in other
        disciplines, but they will also incorporate it into their own approach
        to complex problems.</p>
      <p>Students will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Value intellectual fusion </li>
        <li>Open their mind to a diversity of ideas </li>
        <li>Identify problems not approachable from a single discipline </li>
        <li>Incorporate multiple disciplinary perspectives </li>
        <li>Integrate information from multiple perspectives </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong> Learning Outcome 3: Communication Skills</strong></p>
      <p>Communication is the fabric of civilized society. Being able to communicate
        is essential for an individual&rsquo;s success and well being. Students
        will acquire strong communication skills, both the obvious ones of reading,
        writing, and speaking, but also all the skills necessary to navigate
        an increasingly cross-cultural world. Students will study language(s)
        beyond English or at least read world literature and develop knowledge
        of other languages and cultures. Students will be made aware of the skills
        necessary to employ changing technologies in their lives &ndash; in a
        creative and not complacent or reactive way. The development and refinement
        of communication skills will be ubiquitous and continuous throughout
        the curriculum. </p>
      <p><strong> Learning Outcome 4: Critical Thinking and Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>Critical thinking includes the ability to recognize and define a problem
        or issue; identify relevant approaches, sources, and information; formulate
        well reasoned arguments; and evaluate arguments. Students will learn
        the ability to distinguish information from supposition, to challenge
        ideas, and to develop new ways of seeing the world. Students must be
        able to challenge accepted knowledge and to be creators of new knowledge.
        Critical thinking is naturally embedded in any discipline and is built
        through examined assessment of the products, logic, and processes of
        those disciplines. Both quantitative and qualitative reasoning are necessary
        in the development of critical thinking.</p>
      <p><strong> Learning Outcome 5: Self-awareness</strong></p>
      <p>TBA</p>
      <p><strong> Learning Outcome 6: Information and Technology Literacy</strong></p>
      <p> ASU graduates live and work in a world increasingly informed by the
        interaction of information, technology, and computing. Students will
        understand the implications and applications of technology. They will
        have facility with the technology used to acquire, process, and disseminate
        information in a global context.</p>
      <p> Students will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Understand the scope of knowledge in their discipline and how it
          differs from other intellectual traditions </li>
        <li> Know where information comes from and how it is validated </li>
        <li> Create and evaluate strategies for locating information </li>
        <li>Use technology and tools appropriately to solve problems </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong> Learning Outcome 7: Transnational and Global Perspective</strong></p>
      <p>Students will be globally engaged. They will be able to understand the
        diversity of cultures in the United States and around the world. They
        will be aware of the impact of culture on human behavior. They will be
        culturally competent and able to successfully interact with multiple
        cultures. Students will understand the process of acculturation and the
        negotiations that arise when cultures meet. <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Learning Outcome 8: Being a Positive Community Member</strong></p>
      <p>Students will recognize the need and obligation for involvement as positive
        members of communities. Students will exhibit social responsibility,
        foster civic engagement, and take leadership in addressing social and
        professional issues. </p>
      <p>Students will: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Participate as a citizen of a diverse democracy </li>
        <li>Develop knowledge and skills in the ethical and legal responsibilities
          of society </li>
        <li>Exercising leadership in addressing issues of concern to the community </li>
        <li>Recognize the interrelations within global and cross-cultural communities </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong> Learning Outcome 9: Ethical Perspective </strong></p>
      <p>Examination of one&rsquo;s values precedes the ability to take informed
        action on those values. <br>
  Students will critically examine their own personal values in the context of
  historical and contemporary perspectives. They will examine and articulate
  belief and value systems. Students will participate in self-reflection and
  honest dialogue with others. </p>
      <p>Students will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be proficient in dealing with personal values and responsibilities </li>
        <li>Demonstrate capacity to identify personal, professional, and societal
          values </li>
        <li>Discern consequences of actions </li>
        <li>Transform information into knowledge, judgment, and action. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong> Learning Outcome 10: Creativity</strong></p>
      <p>Students will acquire a core depth of knowledge about standard methodologies,
        but will be aware of shortcomings in these traditional ways of knowing.
        Students will move beyond that awareness to envision a new poem, anew
        equation, a new world. Students will need both empathy and imagination.
        Students will have flexibility, long-term vision, and curiosity. They
        will have an appreciation for the new and unproven, and confidence in
        the potential of alternative methods and ways of knowing.</p>
