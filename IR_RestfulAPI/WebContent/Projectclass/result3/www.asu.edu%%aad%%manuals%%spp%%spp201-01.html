This policy and <a href="spp213.html">SPP 213</a>, &#147;Reduction in Force,&#148; will allow qualified candidates an opportunity to apply for positions and encourage the professional growth of current employees.<p>All notices of job vacancies must include a statement that a criminal background check will be performed prior to an offer of employment. If the results of the background check are not received prior to an offer of employment being extended, the hiring unit may only extend a conditional offer of employment. If the vacant position is considered to be either a security or safety-sensitive position, the notice of job vacancy must state that designation and that a fingerprint check will be required of the finalist.<p>When a position depends on continuation of funding from a specific source and may, therefore, terminate when the funding is no longer available, this must be clearly stated on staff requests, vacancy notices, and advertisements of job openings.<p>Human Resources (HR) is a resource to the hiring unit that provides advice and consultation in the recruitment and employment process.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Essential Job Functions</b></font><p>The essential functions of a position must be determined before a position is opened for recruitment and must be included on the Staff Request (SR). The essential functions are the core, or required, duties of a position as opposed to the marginal responsibilities of a position. The following factors should be used in determining essential functions:<br><p><ol type="1"><li>the reason the job exists is to perform the function(s)</li><p><li>the availability of other employees among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed</li><p><li>the nature of the function is highly specialized so that the person is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function</li><p><li>the hiring official&#146;s judgment as to which functions are essential</li><p><li>the amount of time spent on the job performing the specific function</li><p><li>the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function</li><p><li>the work experience of past incumbents in the job<p>and</li><p><li>the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.</li></ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Application Procedure and Deadlines</b></font><p>All positions open for recruitment must specify an application deadline date, except ASU at the West campus pool recruitment positions. The application deadline will always be noted as  &#147;deadline is 5:00 p.m. in Human Resources&#148; or the <a href="spp002.html#department">department</a> on the date specified. In some cases, a department may advertise a rolling deadline, e.g., 5:00 p.m. 4/1/02; if not filled, every two weeks thereafter until search is closed. A rolling deadline is limited to a maximum of six months from the initial deadline and establishes the cycle for reviewing applications should a hire not be made from the applicants who apply by the initial deadline.<p>Applicants who submit false information or who do not include material information about their employment history at any point during the recruitment process can be disqualified from employment or, if hired, could subsequently be dismissed. Hiring units must notify the Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action (EO/AA) office when a qualified disabled applicant requests accommodation for an interview; notification must occur before a hiring unit agrees to provide the requested accommodation. Vietnam-era veterans and other protected veterans may also voluntarily identify their status at any time to the EO/AA office.<p><b>ASU at the Tempe and East Campuses</b><p>Applicants must submit all required application materials, as stipulated in the posting/ad, to HR or the department (whichever is identified on the SR) by the 5:00 p.m.  advertised deadline. All required application materials must be submitted for each position.<p><b>ASU at the West Campus</b><p>Applicants must submit specific application material or official ASU at the West campus application (at the hiring unit&#146;s discretion) as stipulated in the posting/ad. This must be submitted to HR or the department (whichever is identified on the SR) by the 5:00 p.m. advertised deadline. The application material or ASU at the West campus application must be submitted for each position.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Advertising Requirements</b></font><p>All positions opened for recruitment, except those limited to the hiring unit and pool recruitment at ASU at the West campus, must be listed in <i>ASU Insight</i> at least once. Positions advertised in newspapers and other publications, as well as notices sent to agencies, other universities, and organizations, must have one of the following on the ad or notice:<p><ol><li>ASU is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer<p>or</li><p><li>AA/EOE.</li></ol><p>Hiring units must submit all required material to the EO/AA office for approval, in order to meet the publication deadlines. All advertisements must be reviewed and approved by EO/AA and posted for advertising by HR, upon request. Advertisements to appear in <i>ASU Insight&#146;s</i> Friday edition must be received in HR by noon on Thursday of the previous week.<p>Hiring units are encouraged to place additional statements in the ad to encourage diversity. For example:  &#147;ASU actively seeks diversity among applicants for positions and vigorously supports diversity among its employees.&#148; <p>HR can assist hiring units, through the use of a contract agency, in developing and placing advertisements in national publications, newspapers, and journals. The hiring unit pays the cost of the ads. Hiring units at ASU at the Tempe and East campuses placing ads for faculty and academic professional positions must send the <a href="sppforms.html">Ad Placement Form</a> (APF) along with a copy of the EO/AA-approved ad to HR for placement in the publication; however, departments placing ads for all other openings need only submit the Staff Request (SR) form. Units placing ads with ASU at the Tempe and East campuses will pay the ad agency directly by submitting payment voucher (PV document) with invoice(s) to Payables and Reimbursements. Hiring units at ASU at the West campus must send an Interdepartment Purchase Order (IDPO) to HR for ad placement in the publication. The hiring unit will be billed by ASU at the West campus HR.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Search Committees</b></font><p>A <a href="spp002.html#search committee">search committee</a> is required for <a href="spp002.html#administrator">administrative</a> position recruitment and may be used for <a href="spp002.html#classified staff">classified</a> and <a href="spp002.html#service pro">service professional</a> position recruitment. In classified and service professional recruitment, the hiring official may choose to make the hiring decision without using a search committee. Search committees must include a trained affirmative action representative. Training certifies an affirmative action representative for two fiscal years. Any classified, service professional, or administrative employee may serve as the affirmative action representative for any of these types of recruitment. The hiring official appoints the committee (of at least two members) and informs the committee whether underutilization of <a href="spp002.html#minority">minorities</a> and/or women exists for the position being recruited.  Search committees usually are responsible for screening and evaluating applications, recommending candidates for interview, conducting reference checks, interviewing candidates, and/or recommending which candidates should receive consideration for hire by the hiring official.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Screening</b></font><p>Every person involved in screening, interviewing, and selecting candidates must exercise judgment at each step in the process to assure that no candidate is discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, citizenship, sex, <a href="spp002.html#gender identity">gender identity</a>, sexual orientation, age, disability, Vietnam-era veteran status, other protected veteran, newly separated veteran, or special disabled veteran status.<p>ASU positions may include the phrase &#147;OR any equivalent combination of education and/or experience from which comparable knowledge, skills, and abilities have been achieved&#148; in the required qualifications. This phrase may only be interpreted as one year of relevant education is equal to one year of experience or one year of experience is equal to one year of relevant education. Additionally, the certificate of completion of ASU&#146;s Supervisory Academy is equal to one year of supervisory experience. The certificate of completion of the &#147;Stepping into Leadership&#148; program plus 12 hours of HR-approved ASU training is equal to six months of supervisory experience. For some positions, equivalencies are different from the foregoing; these are identified on the specific job postings.<p><b>Tests</b><p>A &#147;test&#148; may not be used as part of the screening process unless it has been validated as required by 41 <i>Code of Federal Regulations</i> &#167; 60-1. A test is any performance measure used as the sole basis for an employment decision or which by itself could preclude the hire of an individual. Any test used in the screening process must be approved in advance and be on file in the Office of EO/AA before use. Contact the Office of EO/AA or HR for information about test validation requirements.<p><dl><dd><b>Essential Skills Assessment</b></dd><p><dd>Hiring units may use essential skills assessment as part of the interview process to help evaluate an applicant&#146;s skill in performing any of the essential job functions. For more information on how essential skills assessments may be used, contact HR or the Office of EO/AA.</dd></dl><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Interviewing</b></font><p>An applicant must meet all minimum qualifications to be eligible for an interview. Interviews may not be conducted before the application deadline and before the Applicant List (AL) has been approved by the Office of EO/AA. This requirement is not applicable to emergency hires,  &#147;named in grant/contract&#148; positions, and waivers. Applicants not recommended for interview may be notified only after the Office of EO/AA approves the candidates recommended for interview. The Office of EO/AA will contact hiring units with approval to interview and/or questions within 24 work hours of receipt of the AL and r&#233;sum&#233;s (for ASU at the Tempe and East campuses positions) or receipt of the AL and application materials. Job-related reasons must be provided for all applicants not selected for interview. Stating that the applicant  &#147;does not meet minimum qualifications&#148; is an unacceptable reason; specificity as to which of the minimum/desired qualification(s) has not been met must be noted. <p>Screening criteria must be based on the minimum and desired qualifications. All questions asked of persons being interviewed must be job related (see the <i>EO/AA <a href="recruitbook.html">Recruitment Handbook,</a></i> available upon request from the Office of EO/AA, for more information). Persons being interviewed for a specific job opening must be asked the same basic set of questions.<p>The hiring unit should request all finalists to complete and sign a Candidate Consent and Disclosure Form while on-site. The completed forms shall be held in a secure file maintained by the hiring official. When the hiring unit identifies the finalist on whom the background check will be run, HR will verify that a signed consent form has been provided so that the background check can be conducted. When a search is closed, the Candidate Consent and Disclosure Forms of all the unsuccessful finalists will be destroyed.<p><b>ASU at the Tempe and East Campuses</b><p>A Conditions of Employment Form (COEF) must be completed by all new classified and service professional employees hired. The COEF will be provided by HR and will be included in the packet of materials that contains pertinent information that the hiring unit will receive upon the position closing. The COEF will be provided to the individual selected by the hiring unit upon accepting the job offer.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Reference Checking</b></font><p>Reference checks may be made at any point in the recruitment process that is most useful to the hiring unit and should be made on all finalists for positions. The same basic set of questions must be asked of each reference, and written documentation of each reference check must be maintained for three years. For assistance in this process, hiring units may request assistance from HR or may select this service from the outside vendor performing background checks. <p><b>Checking Personnel Files for Current or Former ASU Employees</b><p>Hiring officials shall request a review of current or former ASU employees&#146; available personnel files for business necessity. Such a review may be conducted when an ASU employee is a finalist for a position. The hiring official must request permission to review the file through HR, which will arrange for the review of the appropriate material. Job-related information (e.g., letters of commendation, awards, special training, education completed, performance evaluations, disciplinary actions, and other related information) is the only material from the file that will be shared. The personnel file of a former employee terminated for cause will reflect an &#147;ineligible for rehire&#148; status.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Offering Employment</b></font><p>No offer of employment should be made until a satisfactory result from the background check of the finalist has been received by HR. If a hiring official believes it is necessary to extend an offer of employment before the result of the background check will be known, the hiring official may only extend a conditional offer of employment. The offer of employment is conditional upon the hiring official receiving a satisfactory result from the background check; otherwise, the offer may be withdrawn.<p>No offers of employment may be made prior to the approval of the Hiring Process Report (HPR) by the Office of EO/AA, except for emergency hires, waivers, or &#147;named-in-grant&#148; positions. Interviewees not selected for hire may be notified only after approval by the Office of EO/AA of the candidate(s) recommended for hire. <p>If a finalist has requested that the hiring official not contact his or her current or last supervisor as a reference, the hiring official may choose to honor that request; however, if the hiring official extends an offer of employment to the finalist, that offer must be a conditional offer of employment.  The offer of employment is conditional upon the hiring official receiving a satisfactory reference from the current or last supervisor; otherwise the offer may be withdrawn.<p>Job-related reasons are required as the basis of the hiring decision. Stating that an applicant is  &#147;not the best qualified&#148; is an unacceptable reason; specific reasons for recommending an applicant for hire and specific reasons for not recommending other applicants are required. <p>For administrative and service professional positions, an offer letter indicating the title of the position, salary, start date, and terms of the appointment should be sent to the candidate offered employment. The letter should also request the individual to respond in writing with an acceptance or rejection of the offer. An offer letter also should be provided to candidates offered employment for classified jobs when the job is dependent on funding for continuation and/or when the job is for a specified time period only. After the offer has been accepted, written notification should be sent to all applicants not selected for the position.<p>The selected candidate for a high-risk position, as identified by Human Resources (HR), must pass a physical or vision examination as a condition of being employed. Examinations can be required only after a conditional offer of employment has been made. Selected candidates may not perform any work until the department is notified that the candidate has passed the examination.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Employment of Minors</b></font><p>No child under the age of 14 years shall be employed in any gainful occupation at any time during the hours in which the public school of the district in which the child resides is in session; nor shall any child under 16 years of age be employed in any hazardous occupation as declared by the Department of Labor. Documented proof of age will be required for employment.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Employment Eligibility Verification</b></font><p>Persons selected for hire must produce documentation establishing both identity and authorization to work in the United States and sign the I-9 verification form within 72 hours of the date employment begins, as required by the <i>Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.</i> In the event an employee is unable to provide evidence of employment eligibility within the time limits required by law, the employee either will not be hired or will be terminated.  HR will maintain the official documentation files to comply with the rules and regulations.<p>Employees who are not eligible to continue employment due to an expired work authorization date will be terminated.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Salary Offers</b></font><p>Classified employees may be hired at a salary between the minimum and <a href="spp002.html#midpoint">midpoint</a> of the market pay grade based on their qualifications and the internal impact. Salary offers above market pay grade midpoint require approval of a vice president/provost or designee.<p>Administrative and service professional employees may be hired at a salary based on their qualifications and market data, if available.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Retention of Records</b></font><p>With the exception of records related to any background check performed in accordance with <a href="../acd/acd126.html" target="new">ACD 126</a>, which shall be maintained by HR, the hiring unit must retain all records associated with a hire for a minimum of three years. The hiring unit must be able to document a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for the hiring decision. At a minimum, hiring records will contain the following documentation:<p><ol><li>the Staff Request and ad copy (if used), or the approved Waiver of Recruitment form</li><p><li>the approved Applicant List, Hiring Process Report (HPR), and all application materials submitted by all applicants</li><p><li>the letters of reference or notes from telephone reference checks</li><p><li>all correspondence with applicants, individuals interviewed, and/or offered employment<p>and</li><p><li>the documentation of search committee (if used) findings, recommendations, notes, and reasons why the committee considered each applicant qualified or unqualified.</li></ol><p><hr><font size=+1><b>Recruitment Alternatives</b></font><p>The alternative recruitment processes identified below are subject to the provisions of <a href="../acd/acd126.html" target="new">ACD 126</a>, &#147;Reference Check and Background Verification.&#148;<p><ol><li>Recruitment Limited to the Hiring Unit<p>This recruitment may be used when a hiring unit has a sufficiently diverse applicant pool within the hiring unit. Emergency hire, graduate assistants/associates, and student employees are not eligible to apply for positions limited to the hiring unit. This process also may not be used to preclude achievement of affirmative action hiring goals in the vice presidential/provost area. Positions must be posted in a conspicuous place in the hiring unit and/or a notice sent to each employee. The position must be open for recruitment at least five calendar days from the date the vacancy is posted in the hiring unit and/or notice given to employees.</li><p><li>Recruitment Limited to Current ASU, U of A, NAU, and Arizona Board of Regents&#146; Staff<p>This recruitment is open only to current administrative, service professional, and classified employees, and to faculty and academic professionals. Emergency hire, graduate assistants/associates, and student employees are not eligible to apply for these positions. The announcement of the opening must appear in <i>ASU Insight</i> at least once with the application deadline at least five calendar days after the last notice in <i>ASU Insight.</i> HR will post vacancies on the <a href="hrjobs.html">HR Web</a> page on each ASU campus and will provide notices to the U of A, NAU, and the Board of Regents.</li><p><li>Recruitment Open to the Public<p>This recruitment is open to both internal and external applicants. The announcement of the opening must appear in <i>ASU Insight</i> at least once. Recruitment may be local, state, and/or national in scope. It must include advertisement in newspapers, professional publications, and/or notices sent to local, state, and national agencies and professional organizations to assure affirmative action recruiting. Hiring units may request a copy of the  &#147;ASU EO/AA Referral and Advertising List&#148; to assist in the identification of recruitment sources that will assure reaching diverse populations.<p>Application deadlines for local and state recruitment must be at least five calendar days after the last advertisement is published or the notice appears in <i>ASU Insight,</i> whichever is later. Application deadlines for national recruitment must be at least 14 calendar days after the last advertisement is published or the notice appears in <i>ASU Insight,</i> whichever is later. HR sends notices to agencies and organizations in support of ASU&#146;s affirmative action recruitment/outreach efforts.<p>HR will post vacancies on the <a href="hrjobs.html">HR Web</a> page on each ASU campus, list the vacancies with the Arizona Department of Economic Security Job Bank, and include them on the ASU Dial-A-Job Lines (ASU at the Tempe and East campuses, 480/965&#150;5627; ASU at the West campus, 602/543&#150;5627). Vacancy notices will only be posted on the HR Web page, and be included on the Dial-A-Job Line of the campus with the vacancy.</li><p><li>Pool Recruitment<p><b>ASU at the West Campus</b><p>HR will identify positions that are eligible for hire through campus pool recruitment. Hiring units may request a list of pool candidates from HR prior to advertising for the position to help determine which recruitment process to use.<p>Pool recruitment positions require an official ASU at the West campus application. Advertising for  &#147;pool recruitment&#148; will indicate that applications will be accepted at any time. Applications will be provided to hiring units upon request for pool positions. Applications for these positions will remain active for six months. To keep an application active for an additional six months, an applicant must either resubmit the application or request that HR keep the application active.<p>HR will provide applications to the hiring unit after receipt of the SR requesting pool recruitment. If the hiring unit is not satisfied with the initial applications provided, a request for additional applications may be made, or another recruitment method may be selected by the hiring unit.<p>Notices of pool recruitment will appear in <i>ASU Insight,</i> be listed on the HR Job Board, be noted on the ASU Dial-A-Job line, be advertised in newspapers and/or appropriate publications, and be sent periodically to local agencies and organizations.<p>Once a candidate is hired through the pool recruitment procedure, he or she becomes inactive in the pool. To be referred out on any open staff requests submitted to HR after the pool hire date, applicants must resubmit their r&#233;sum&#233;s.</li><p><li>Trainee Assignments (see <a href="spp403-11.html">SPP 403&#150;11</a>, &#147;Trainee Assignments&#148;)<p><li>Grant and Contract Position Recruitment<p>When an individual is named in a grant or contract, follow the procedures for Emergency Hires or Waivers identified below.</li><p><li>Exceptions to Recruitment: Emergency Hires and Waivers<p>Emergency hires or waivers may be requested when a hiring unit has a temporary staff need and a candidate has been identified, or when Human Resources has determined that a request to hire a consultant/independent contractor does not meet required Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criteria.<p><b>Emergency Hire</b><p>An emergency hire may fill a vacant classified position for no more than 120 calendar days. This period will allow a hiring unit time to conduct recruitment to fill the position permanently or meet the need for a temporary replacement. That request must include:<br><p><ol type="a"><li>a completed &#147;<a href="sppforms.html">Emergency Hire</a>&#148; form</li><p><li>candidate&#146;s r&#233;sum&#233; for ASU at the Tempe and East campuses or application form or r&#233;sum&#233; for ASU at the West campus<p>and</li><p><li>the Hiring Process Report (HPR).</li></ol><p>HR will review the candidate&#146s r&#233;sum&#233; or application to ensure the candidate meets minimum qualifications and will contact the hiring unit within 24 hours of receipt regarding candidate&#146s eligibility.<p><b>Waiver</b><p>Advertising may be waived when the director of EO/AA or designee decides it is in the best interest of ASU to follow a different recruiting procedure.
