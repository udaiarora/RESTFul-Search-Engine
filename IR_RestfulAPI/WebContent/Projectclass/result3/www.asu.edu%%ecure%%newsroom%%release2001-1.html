<h2>Press Release:<br />
    New Technology Demands New Strategies for University Records Management
</h2>

<p>July 2001</p>

<p>In a video-streamed presentation recently released by Arizona State
University, networked information expert Clifford Lynch sounded a call to
action, urging colleges and universities to examine the critical challenges of
managing their data.</p>

<p>&#8220;The relatively static boundaries that we&#8217;ve understood between
scholarly publication, academic records, and what happens in the classroom are
all getting blown out the window,&#8221; Lynch said. &#8220;We have to
fundamentally rethink what we&#8217;re doing about records.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lynch is the executive director of the Coalition for Networked Information
(<acronym title="Coalition for Networked Information">CNI</acronym>), an
organization dedicated to supporting the transformative promise of networked
information technology for the advancement of scholarly communication and the
enrichment of intellectual productivity. He spoke at 
<acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym>&nbsp;2000, 
a national conference concerning the future of electronic records in higher
education. The full speech can be viewed online at
&lt;<kbd><a href="http://is.asu.edu/copyright/">http://is.asu.edu/copyright/</a></kbd>&gt;.</p>

<p>Lynch went on to observe, &#8220;The discussion about management, archiving
and access to records is going to become a very rich and complicated
conversation which is going to engage everyone from archivists to librarians to
faculty to publishers to systems builders to legal counsel to
registrars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although the design of an adequate digital signature infrastructure is
critical for e-learning, Lynch emphasized that when thinking through the
interplay of such evolving infrastructure with records management policies and
approaches, universities &#8220;also have to hedge our bets a little bit, and
recognize that twenty years or so downstream this infrastructure itself might
change in radical ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lynch also suggested that the fate of student research products be
considered. &#8220;It used to be that students didn&#8217;t leave very much
behind. They left a confidential transcript, a master&#8217;s thesis or
dissertation, but that&#8217;s about it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now they leave
these enormous trails of term papers and class projects. Are those things going
to become records? The way we&#8217;re going right now, this is left to the
discretion of the faculty member and the availability of disc space,&#8221;
warned Lynch.</p>

<p><acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym>,
at which Lynch was a keynote speaker, is an annual conference that seeks to
promote dialogue about record keeping issues across institutions. It brings
together professionals from diverse fields for workshops and interdisciplinary
discussion. The third annual conference, 
<acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym>&nbsp;2001:
Preservation and Access for Electronic College and University Records, is
planned for October 12 and 13, 2001, in Mesa, Arizona. Early registration is
available through the 
<acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym> 
Web site at
&lt;<kbd><a href="http://www.asu.edu/it/events/ecure/">http://www.asu.edu/it/events/ecure/</a></kbd>&gt;.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s speakers will address topics that include metadata
standards, campus policymaking, legal and regulatory issues, electronic
publishing of dissertations and theses, and email management. Provosts, records
managers, archivists, faculty, legal experts, registrars, technology
professionals and other campus administrators will attend. Interdisciplinary
teams will receive registration discounts. Special discussion sessions will
offer conference goers a chance to interact with presenters and peers from
around the nation.</p>

<p><acronym title="Electronic College and University Records">ECURE</acronym>
is sponsored by Arizona State University with support from 
<acronym title="Coalition for Networked Information">CNI</acronym>; the Arizona
State Library, Archives and Public Records; and Bell &amp; Howell Information
and Learning.</p>
