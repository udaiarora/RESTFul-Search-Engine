      <h2 align="left">ASU state-of-the-art classroom building opens </h2>
      <p>The January 7 grand opening of Lattie F. Coor Hall on ASU's Main Campus in Tempe was a celebration not only of the building, which is impressive in its own right, but also of the man for whom it is named, Lattie F. Coor, who was ASU's president for 12 years until his retirement June 30, 2002. </p>
      <p>"The dedication of Lattie F. Coor Hall is a significant milestone for Arizona State University, which is on an upward trajectory to greatness, thanks in large part to the solid foundation of excellence laid by President Emeritus Lattie F. Coor," said ASU President Michael M. Crow. "The building's grand stature lives up to its namesake, who, during his 12-year tenure as president, set ASU on a path of global excellence and global achievement." </p>
      <p>During his introduction, Crow called Coor a "man I have admired, learned from and mentored under. He is a man dedicated to social transformation through education, and is totally dedicated to making sure education is available to everyone." </p>
      <p>Coor, who brought members of his immediate and extended family to the dedication, was overcome with emotion at seeing the name "Lattie F. Coor Hall" on the building. </p>
      <p>"I proudly wear my father's name and it is quite significant that what you have done is represent both of our names and all that it stands for - and for that I am very grateful," Coor said. "My father is the one who started education in our family, having gotten his two-year teaching certificate from ASU, as well as his three-year certificate and bachelor's degree. I could not be prouder than to have our name attached to a building where the greatest, most active frontier teaching in America will be taking place." </p>
      <p>The building, a state-of-the-art instructional environment and academic center, has seven stories, with academic units housed on floors two through six, an open computing site with 150 stations on the first floor, and 25 mediated classrooms on the first floor and one floor below ground. </p>
      <p>Located at 10th Street and Myrtle Avenue, the building is 275,000 square feet - the largest building on the Main Campus. The 25 mediated classrooms range in capacity from 20 students to 299 students, with full classroom capacity at 1,700 students during class periods. Oversized stairwells at either end of the building are designed for moving people quickly, particularly between class periods, when up to 3,400 students will be coming and going. </p>
      <p>Floors two through six house academic and research units from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, including the departments of Political Science, Sociology, Chicana/Chicano Studies, History, and Speech and Hearing Science, which also will operate a speech and hearing clinic in the building. </p>
      <p>"This is a wonderful facility," said ASU Chief Information </p>
      <p>Officer William Lewis, whose team is in charge of the building's information technology and instructional mediation. </p>
      <p>Thirteen of the mediated classrooms have computers installed so that every student or every pair of students has a computer at their fingertips. Some of the classrooms feature special tables inspired by Lewis, who wanted computers to be accessible, but also unobtrusive when not in use. The tables are designed so lap-top computers fit into recessed bins that rise to eye level for use and then lower below the table surface, where they are covered and locked. </p>
      <p>The other 12 classrooms also have computer capability, but students will bring their own lap-top computers. All 299 seats in the auditorium have dedicated electrical power. </p>
      <p>Instructors will have access to ultra-modern technology, including adjustable height 7-foot teaching stations with computer, amplifier, DVD and CD capability, touch-screen controls, and wireless access. Each room will have a web cam for remote assistance to instructors and also for security purposes. </p>
      <p>Five classrooms feature media capture capability, allowing live production, live broadcast, video conferencing, and web capture - with a fully staffed central control room. </p>
      <p>All of the classrooms feature Digitally Addressable Lighting Interface, a new technology that enables the user to control lights individually for optimal lighting. </p>
