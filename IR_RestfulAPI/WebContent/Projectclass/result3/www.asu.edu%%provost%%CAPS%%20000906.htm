<h2><b>Minutes of Meeting</b></h2>

<b>September 6, 2000</b>
<P>
CAPS met at the Memorial Union, Room 204
<P>
<b>Present:</b>  Santos Vega, Chair, Victor Becerra, Maggie Mangini, Helen Seaton, and Linda
Shackle.
<P>
Our meeting room assignments at the M.U. have been confirmed and Santos' signature is on file. 
All meetings except the one on March 7, 2001 will be held there.
<P>
The minutes of August 2 were read and approved.
<P>
Linda Shackle is the "owner" of the CAPS listserv.  From there we can send messages to the
bigger AP list.  We need to be cautious in our use of the AP list.
<P>
Gail Hackett is the new Vice Provost.  She is familiar with the post continuing review document
for the faculty.  We will let her know that CAPS also developed such a document even though it
has been shelved.  We will ask her to visit at a CAPS meeting later.
<P>
Victor Becerra discussed the Council of Academic Advisors (CAA).  Some personnel issues came
up and they contacted Tom Keating, past chair of CAPS.  The committee drafted a letter which
Tom signed and sent on to the Vice Provost.  Some of the academic advisors are APs but not
eligible for continuing status.  They are looking for a way to be recognized as a class and to be
protected.  Maggie will check with Cecelia in the Vice Provost's office to see how many academic
associates are APs, how many are classified staff, and how many year-to-year appointments are
eligible for continuing status.  Academic professionals without continuing appointment usually
have that status due to funding.  Maggie will also check to see if some APs are half continuing
and half not continuing. 
<P>
The committee discussed our agenda for the year and decided on four topics:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Victor will invite someone from the Council of Academic Associates to attend our October 4
meeting to update us on the issues and what progress they have made so far.
<P>
<li>Linda Shackle and Helen Seaton will work on organizing a workshop to inform and educate
APs - specifically about how to prepare for promotion and continuing appointment.  We will
target APs who don't have continuing appointment yet.  Tentatively planned for March 2001.

<P>
<li>Invite Vice Provost Gail Hackett to the December 6 meeting.  Helen will draft a letter of
invitation and agenda of what issues we would like to discuss with her and bring it to the
committee.  Then she will contact Dr. Hackett on Santos' behalf.
<P>
<li>Have an open meeting for AP presentations - a kind of show and tell in which invited APs can
share what they do to help inform other academic professionals of what's going on and to improve
networking among APs.  Tentative plans are to feature the work of three invited APs at brown
bag luncheons which CAPS will sponsor.  Maggie suggested Richard (Dick) Filly who works in
the Corporate Executive Program in the College of Engineering for the November 1 meeting.
</ol>
<P>
Maggie will be in charge of the November meeting since Santos will be out of town.  The second
and third luncheons will be on February 7 and April 4.
