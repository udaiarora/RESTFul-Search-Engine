Double Checking those PPP dial-up numbers
</center></h2>
<p>		
It has been brought to my attention (Thanks to Kurt Johnson!!), that a
gentleman out in Mesa has the phone number of 972-7003!  If this looks
somewhat familiar it's because our own PPP dial-in number is 727-0030.
Unfortunately this gentleman has received 105 calls, from modems, in the
past few days!!!  Fortunately he is a nice person, has a lot of time on
his hands, and has caller id - so he's been calling people back and
telling them they have the wrong number!
<p> 
I suppose you're now asking - "what does this have to do with me?"  As
consultants we often have our customers bring in that laptop or home
machine to have PPP set up for them.  In doing so (since we are thorough
consultants) we need to test the dial in to make sure it works properly
- in which case we may be using 9-727-0030.  (I wasn't aware that a 9
would work to get an outside line until this morning).  If we do not
change that number back to just 727-0030, very often our customers don't
either and this results in misdialed calls to 972-7003.  This will also
happen to 872-7003 (8-727-0030)!
<p> 
What can we as consultants do to rectify this situation?  There are a
couple of options - first whenever you set up a laptop or home machine
be sure to re-set the phone number, minus the leading 8 or 9, before you
return it to your customer.  Another option would be to use 7-0030 for
your on-campus testing - which would not work at all when taken off
campus.  And lastly, this condition will also occur if, in the Microsoft
Networking section, the "needing to get an outside line through a PBX"
selection is checked so we need to insure that this option is not
selected.
<p> 
Thank you for your attention to this matter - especially from the
gentleman in Mesa!

A better way to do it is to used the Dial Properties under the Dialup
Icon to create entries like ("From Home", "From Office", etc) and the
user just switches depending on where they are. This way the number is
always, 727-0030 and the system will add, 8 or *70 or whatever is
needed.

To add to Martha's comments about the PPP number: For those of us who test
PPP using the short on-campus number, be careful to dial 7-0030,
NOT 5-0030. That is a number in the Intercollegiate Athletics ticket
office. I speak from experience :)
