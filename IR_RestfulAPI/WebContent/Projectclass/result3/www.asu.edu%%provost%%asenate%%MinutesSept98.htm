<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1. Call to Order.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The meeting was called to order by

Senate President William Davey at 3:06 p.m.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. Approval of Previous Minutes (August

31, 1998).</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate President Davey: Our first

order of business is to approve the <i>Minutes</i> from the August 31,

1998 Senate meeting. These were sent to you by campus mail and we asked

you to bring them to this meeting. Are there any corrections or emendations?

Hearing no corrections, the chair asks someone to move approval from the

floor. Moved and seconded. Any further discussion?&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Gully: I would like to make

a request that in the future during the Open Session that senators who

raise issues have their name appear in the <i>Minutes</i>. They are speaking

for a certain constituency and those people should know if a senator is

doing their job.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So noted.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The <i>Minutes </i>of the August

31, 1998 Senate meeting were approved by voice vote.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3. Announcements and Communications.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.A Senate President's Report (William

Davey).</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Both Dr. Burstein and I took part

in the Regents meeting in Flagstaff on Thursday and Friday of last week.

The Board approved several action items: Dr. Glick will speak on the budget

item and I will pass on to you information about what the Arizona Faculties

Council approved at that meeting. As I reported to you last meeting, the

AFC, in a tri-university project, is coordinating the establishment of

a virtual conference center with the Board of Regents, for members of the

extended university community to talk about important issues that the Board

has identified as their focus issues for this year. In the <i>Academic

Senate Newsletter</i>, which you should receive by the end of this week,

there is a column that I put together which outlines those focus areas.

We hope to have this operational by November 1. In the next Senate newsletter,

there will be instructions on how you can develop a password and logon

to this discussion group. This will serve as a resource center for the

Regents because we are creating a virtual library in which we will put

documents and articles and other important reports that supports their

discussion.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Arizona Faculties Council and

the Arizona Students Association had a joint meeting and this is the first

time we believe this has ever happened. The Board was excited about this

formalized collaboration between the faculty and students. We had substantive

discussion about the use of social security numbers readily available on

campus and other privacy issues, tuition and academic advising. We will

be working together on some legislative initiatives and some action items

relative to these issues.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The third item is an update on the

Presidents' whistleblower agreement. The bids that were put out for arbitration

services closed on September 17. This group will become the external hearing

officers and the Universities General Counsels were satisfied with all

the people who bid. There should be an announcement on the award of that

contract by the end of the week. In addition, there is a draft whistleblower

policy, which Mary Stevens has said will be made available by the end of

next week. This will be distributed and discussed by the Executive Committee

and the Personnel Committee. This has gone a little bit slower than we

would have anticipated. We want to go slow enough to articulate a good

policy.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr. Burstein will give a short report

about what is being done to develop the Student Information System (SIS)

and other academic computing resources.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.B Senate President-Elect's Report

(David Burstein).&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The innocent question of how can

we institute pluses and minuses on the Student Information System eventually

leads to a much more complicated answer than one might have supposed from

the start. What we find is not just the SIS is involved, but also human

resources and finance, research; parts of the system cannot easily be separated

from the others. We are in the process of refining what are the needs of

our business information systems on campus. One of the issues is that because

we have been effective working as individual units, there has not been

a lot of cross talk among those units. What we are finding out is that

no one person in the university has a good overview of what the needs are

of the university. We will be in the process of finding that out over the

next year.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr. Davey: The Alumni Association

is again coordinating a series of Legislative Coffees. The season begins

on October 7 this year. In the <i>Academic Senate Newsletter,</i> there

is a list of all fall semester academic legislative coffees. We invite

all members of the faculty, administration, and staff to attend these.

Particularly try to attend the ones in your own legislative districts.

They have had a significant effect on influencing our legislative initiatives.

I have also included in the newsletter a summary of the decision packages

and other initiatives that the university is pursuing in its budgeting

process. In the event that you do have contact with legislators, it would

be good that you knew about these issues, and that you helped take these

issues on down the road.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I would also publicly like to thank

Paul Frost and the members of ASASU and Nancy Higgins and the work of the

Classified Staff Council for helping make Faculty/Staff Appreciation Day

a very wonderful success. The members of the Staff Council worked long

hours passing out food and tee shirts and collecting tickets and we really

appreciate their efforts. On behalf of the faculty, thank you.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.C University Provost's Report (Milton

Glick).&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I want to thank Dr. Davey and Paul

Frost and Nancy Higgins for continuing the wonderful history we have had

of organizing these legislative coffees. Not just talking to the legislators

but understanding the issues that are important. I can not overstate the

impact that we as a community have had on the legislature. It is important

that we not just act as advocates but we act as informants because a problem

that we face as a public university is not just whether they like us but

whether they know us. Legislators typically hear from a small number of

people (three is a landslide) and they are not the three happiest students

or parents we have. That is their vision of the university. The effort

that you folks made really makes a big difference.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I also want to compliment Dr. Burstein

on the leadership he is taking in bringing together people to talk about

what our needs are in the enterprise of computing systems. It is the right

thing for us to be doing now. We have dedicated all of our administrative

computing resources for the last two years to the FY2000 Project, and it

is working. When I read the horror stories elsewhere, we are already into

Beta testing now of the systems and we will be there when we need to be.

This is not to say we will not find a few glitches on January 1, 2000 but

they will be few in numbers. It is now time to ask how do we bring the

systems together. My own view is that we want to have computing systems

that do what needs to be done in an efficient way. We do not want to be

known as having the best administrative computing in the country. No university

is great because it has the "best" administrative support systems but they

have to be good enough and that is what I think that Dr. Burstein is trying

to organize. One of the problems in computing, like everything else, is

the best drives out the good. This is a good opportunity for us.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The budget that Dr. Davey has asked

me to explain is virtually an unexplainable process. I would rather be

the one that explains it. First some distinctive features: It is the first

two-year budget that we have dealt with. The legislature has gone to a

biennial process and we have to treat it as though it will work in the

best possible way, and then move from there.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Secondly, there is now a statewide

task force set up by the Office of the Governor to look at salaries of

all state employees. As you know, our top priority for a number of years

has been fixing salaries at this university. The two major discretionary

investments we have made in the last six years are salaries and undergraduate

education. We must continue to keep those priorities because if we experience

one dry year, we will be back to where we were six years ago. The three

presidents, the leadership of the universities, and the board here agreed

that the best way to continue the salary agenda is to join forces with

the rest of state government and urge an adequate state employee salary

package. We have committed ourselves and the Board has recommitted itself

to this high priority but to do it by getting the best state employee package.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Board did something unusual at

this meeting. It is the first time that they said that there are Board

priorities that are so high that we are placing them at the top of the

university's agenda. Two collaborative efforst are at the top. Those two

areas were teacher education and access. With respect to teacher education,

there is great concern over the fact that students graduating from our

College of Education, this December, will be subjected to two exams; a

content exam and a pedagogy exam, neither of which have yet been written.

Many may have read about what happened in Massachusetts. If State policy

is that if seventy-five percent of our students do not pass, we will not

be eligible to be a teacher education institution. I think seventy-five

percent is a low number because we would expect ninety percent of our graduates

to pass; but when you are talking about a test that is yet to be written,

seventy-five percent may be a very high number. Our College of Education

is working with the leadership of our College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

to try to ensure a good performance on a test we have not seen yet. That

is very tough. Once the test is available we will know how to prepare our

students. The more difficult process is that two years out they have to

take a performance test, not a knowledge test. That performance test will

be on students that have been out for two years that we do not have any

control over. However, is they do not do well on it, we will certainly

have failed. Some of those people taking those performance tests will be

students that attended NAU, some that went to ASU, some that went to UofA

and some that came in from out of state, or from Grand Canyon University

or whatever. We will still be held responsible if our students do not do

well on that although we lack control over those students. In the budget

we ask for funding to set up a collaborative center between the three universities;

that center would be a coordinating center to help each university reach

out to those new teachers in our region. We would have an obligation to

help teachers in Maricopa County, whether they graduated from ASU, UofA,

or NAU, Grand Canyon or Cal State, Fullerton. How we are going to do that

is unknown, but we are trying to use the joint center to consolidate our

efforts. It can best be done in collaboration with the public schools.

No teacher has to come for help; they are now the employees of the public,

charter, and private schools; they are not our employees and they are not

our students. Therefore, building this collaboration between K-12, the

universities and the new teachers is a difficult and important task.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Board of Regents has made it

clear that this collaboration is their top priority. They have also made

it clear that they want a collaboration providing greater access to students

both from high school and from the community colleges. On that we have

not yet entered a joint project but rather each of us has put in our budget

effort to make it more accessible to those students.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Finally, there is a joint project

for a software institute that would help prepare Arizona's work force.

We have decision packages (that Dr. Davey will send out to senators) that

are in three areas: research and economic development initiatives aimed

at making Arizona's future sustainable; continued improvement in undergraduate

education; improving technology.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In addition to aiming at first and

second year students as we have done in the past several years, we propose

investing in key needs at the upper division. As we have expanded our freshman

class we are increasing the pressure on units to make sure that there is

good available access to upper division with quality instruction and so

on. We will emphasize advising.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The provocative part of the meeting

dealt with the fact that our projected tuition revenue was considerably

higher than our realized tuition revenue. Our estimates on how many students

and the non-resident/resident mix were too high. Part of the reason for

this is that we have under projected in the past and the joint legislative

budget committee has criticized us for this. We decided that instead of

a conservative projection to do an aggressive projection this year. Wrong

year! How did we over project, where did the changes come? The changes

came in that we have five hundred fewer seniors this year than last year.

That could be very good if that means we have graduated people. While we

do not know whether our graduation rate is up, we do know that last year

we had only three hundred students graduate with between one hundred and

one hundred twenty-five hours. This year we had eleven hundred students

graduate within that range. We would like to believe that the loss of seniors

is because students are succeeding. We do not know that yet.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The second reason is that we are

down in freshman, about three hundred students. I am not happy about that

because our goal has been to build the freshman class. I am not surprised

by it because last year we had a nine hundred-freshman student increase.

You usually do not have that kind of growth without some fallback. The

third piece is that we are down about two hundred fifty graduate students.

Dr. Tom Callarman told me yesterday that it is almost all attributed to

the fact that the state no longer requires a master's degree for public

school teachers. We have to look carefully at all of these things.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The greater shift however was between

our resident and our nonresident mix. This was partly brought on by ourselves.

We have been very close to twenty-five percent out-of-state students, Board

of Regents policy states we should not exceed that. We have made a special

effort to recruit high achieving Arizona students this year. It turns out

that we stayed about even in Arizona freshman but we lost two hundred out

of state freshman from where we were last year. That has a big budget impact.

When you take all that into consideration it means that our projected tuition

revenue and our achieved tuition revenue is off about six point seven million

dollars, a significant budget hit, part of which we took into consideration

when we did our budgeting. That does not mean that we lost $6.7M from last

year, it means we lost $6.7M from what we projected. We will be able to

work through that without having to reduce unit budgets because of contingencies

that we have built in but it will mean in some cases slowing down on important

things like start up money, computer infusion, computer upgrades, major

equipment needs, and slowing down some hiring. There is a real hurt to

us but it will not require dipping into unit budgets and withdrawing money.

However, if we do not change those numbers next year, the story will be

different. We are taking the recruitment very serious for next year.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With regard to recruitment, I did

an analysis of some data on student persistence here. The best indicator

we have of freshmen success is whether they return in the second year.

Students were divided by high school class rank in terms of five percentile

groupings. It turns out that the first two five percent groups do similarly

(0-5 and 5-10 percent) and they do substantially better than the goals

that we have set for ourselves on persistence. The next three groupings

(10 -25) are comparable and they perform above our goal. What that tells

us is that we want to place special emphasis on recruiting the top twenty-five

percent of the high school class because they are students who are succeeding

here. As we drop below that, persistence is substantially worse. That does

not mean that we should not admit those students but it does mean that

we need to target our efforts on students who will be successful at ASU,

for our good, for their good and for the state's good. We also plotted

SAT scores and found out there is no predictive value to student success

here whatsoever other than the sixty-seven students that have SAT scores

above 1400. All the rest of the students have similar persistence. The

only differentiating occurs if they take SAT tests. As we develop our recruiting

strategy for freshmen, this reinforces the students who are likely to do

very well and will benefit from ASU. For several years we focussed on recruiting

the top two percent and the top five percent and that is good, those are

very important students to attract. That is why we have two hundred or

more national merit scholars here today and we want to keep building that.

That is not enough high achievers to change the culture of the enterprise.

We can get enough top twenty-five precenters to continue to make success

a feature of this campus for our students. This is the type of agenda we

are on for the next couple of years.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.C ASASU President's Report (Paul

Frost).</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thanks to Dr. Davey for putting together

the joint Arizona Students Association/Arizona Faculties Council meeting;

it was the first one. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend that meeting,

but it represents a large step in collaborating with the faculty senates

from all three campuses. We are going to see some very significant and

positive things from that meeting.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Over the last week, I had the opportunity

to attend a leadership conference, a national student leadership forum

in Washington, D.C. where I met with about 250 other students from all

over the country. It was hosted by congress members from various states.

It was a very uplifting and educational experience for me personally. We

were able to meet with Vice President Al Gore and his wife there as well

as have some dialogue about things that are happening with our nation and

the Office of the President. I was not able to attend the last Board of

Regents meeting because of that but I will be briefed about what went on

there.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Just a quick report about some of

the activities that Associated Students are involved with this year: We

are pushing just at the 1,000 mark with registered voters on campus in

the upcoming election. Jennifer Holzer is our task force coordinator for

that job. We have been hosting barbecues before each home football game.

We hold them between Palo Verde east and west and everyone is invited to

come by and have a burger before the game.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have been moving forward the teacher

evaluation project. A computer program is being written to generate the

data that will be collected from the evaluation forms. You will probably

be hearing about the status of teacher evaluations at the next Academic

Senate meeting and I believe there is going to be an article written about

the Teacher Evaluation Program in <i>The Arizona Republic </i>within the

next couple of weeks.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.E. ASUW Senate President's Report

(InJ s Chisholm).</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of the things that I have mentioned

in my previous discussion with you was that the ASUW Senate is looking

seriously at aligning our tenure and promotion process with the strategic

goals. As a result there will be a team from the Senate that will be attending

an institute at Oregon State beginning October 1, entitled "Scholarship

Unbound: Reframing Faculty Evaluation and Reward Systems." We are hoping

to come back with some good ideas that we can share with our senators as

well as with our units and departments.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In addition to that, we have also

been talking, at the request of our Provost, about the barriers for students

who move from one campus to the other to take courses. At our last Senate

meeting on Wednesday, we had a very interesting dialogue on the Senate

floor the issue of grade inflation. There was no consensus at that time.

We did agree that it is a very complex issue, that it relates to philosophical

standpoints on what grading is about, and we agreed to continue this dialogue

via our individual units. The senators will provide the information discussed

in their college meetings to me, so that I am able to have a general overview

as we continue to discuss grade inflation.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Like this Senate, we have been talking

about student evaluation of faculty teaching. Our student issues committee

is looking at the student evaluation issue and working with the student

organization to come up with a form that would be agreeable to both students

and faculty.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4. Open Forum.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate representative Hal White:

I am president of the ASU Retirees Association for this year and the employees

at ASU represent about 1600 retirees, faculty and staff and our membership

in the ASURA is now approaching 900. We do many things for our members,

but we are also doing some things for those of you who are anticipating

retiring one of these days. One of those things is the protection of the

retirement funds within the system, and we have a governor of recent memory

who had very strong ideas about tapping into those retirement funds to

help in investments of his choosing or colleagues' choosing. In the last

year, the retirement system has earned about 1.4 billion dollars and there

is about 16 billion dollars in there right now. The way things are going

I am not going to use all that up, so there will be some left for you folks.

This election in November contains a proposition that will become part

of our State Constitution, if passed, which says that there will be controls

over those funds and they will not be left to the whim of the legislature

or the governor or other group. Look for proposition 100; it is for protection

of the retirement funds. We should be interested in it, you as potential

retirees should be interested in it because you have been contributing

your money to it all these years. If we talk this up among your neighbors,

people who are not involved with the system throughout the state, you might

point out to them that they have been putting their tax money into that

and the money ought to go where it was intended to go. If you look at the

voter's brochures there are several letters of support of this proposition;

there are no letters that are against it. I think that the only thing that

would prevent this from passing would be inertia on the part of the voters.

With the permission of the Senate, if possible, I would like to use one

of your mailings in the next six weeks to distribute our flyer to the members

of the Senate. He ended by saying to the Senate: Vote, and Vote often!&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">5. Unfinished Business.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">5.A Senate President Davey said there

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Committee on Committees currently

I have contacted personally for serving as committee replacements for the

emergencies that have arisen so far in the semester.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate President Davey explained

to the body that motions on curricular matters normally are brought up

at one meeting and voted upon at the next meeting. Since these items today

are coming before the Senate for a first reading, questions of information

will be entertained but debate of the substantive issues will take place

at the second reading. Today we will try to clarify what information may

be needed in making your decision in a more effective way. All of these

motions are being entered for first reading.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate Motion #1 (1998-99): The Curriculum

and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of

a request from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to establish a

Certificate in African American Studies (a copy of this motion is available

from the Academic Senate Office/965-9245).&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Blumenfeld-Jones asked what

a certificate is. Is it like a minor?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Johnson: It is similar to

a minor. Is there anyone here who can specifically answer that?&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Vice Provost Bantz: Certificates

are one of the harder things to define. What we do is package 15-18, 20-21

credits; academic programs decide exactly what courses need to be taken

to fill it. It is not a degree and you can be a non-degree student and

still earn a certificate.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Gully: Is it envisioned that

the students who get a certificate are only taking these courses in the

college of Liberal Arts and Sciences?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Johnson: There are courses

outside of the CLAS in the certificate program.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Leonard: Will the requirements

for certificates be included on the motion that we vote upon?&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate President Davey: We will make

sure that they are available to you. There usually is a list of the courses.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Matt: Are certificates only

given at the undergraduate level?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Johnson: No they are not.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dean Bernstein: There are a variety

of certificate programs; there about ten graduate certificates at the university

and some of them are for both undergraduate and graduate students.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate Motion #2 (1998-99): The Curriculum

and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of

a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to establish

a BA in African American Studies (a copy of this motion is available from

the Academic Senate Office/965-9245.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Perry: Can the nineteen hours

from the certificate apply for a bachelor or arts degree in African American

Studies?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Johnson: Is your question:

Can a person who has an earned certificate apply then for a degree in that

area and use those credits from the certificate? Typically, they can.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Vice Provost Bantz: I think you asked

a question that we do not have a policy on because you can get the certificate,

enroll in the program and then get the degree. I will check and make sure.

We do not have a policy that says you cannot do this.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Theime: What departments

are involved in this minor?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Johnson: It is a major, a

BA in African American Studies. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences

is involved.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Theime: Is it one department

or several departments?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Provost Glick: Next meeting we will

make sure that there is someone who is present to answer specifically from

that program. We made a decision several years ago to create programs such

as African American Studies, Chicana/o Studies, American Indian Studies,

and others. In one case, they are a department and in the other cases,

they are programs. We decided that they would live in a college because

we do not have a dean of undergraduate instruction. The American Indian

Studies program lives in the College of Public Programs and the Chicana/o

and African American Studies Programs live in the College of Liberal Arts

and Sciences but they are not restricted; they are meant to be university-wide

programs that happen to have a reporting relationship with a particular

college. We will check but I am sure that in addition to the faculty who

are full-time in the program, African American Studies, there are participating

faculty from History, English, Music, Theatre, Communication, and Justice

Studies. We will bring that back to you but the fact that they live in

a college was not intended to mean that they are college programs. They

are university-wide programs. Senator Escobar was the first chair of Chicana/o

Studies. Ed, could you respond on that?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Escobar: Only that we started

out the same way approximately three years ago. What the Senate Motion

before us today does is establish a degree program. Faculty can be housed

in a program, in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. In addition

to that, I have worked with Lenor Johnson as she developed her program

(AAS) and she is working with music faculty and faculty from a variety

of other departments in the CLAS, and in other colleges. She is using courses

that already exist to count for degree requirements in that area. It is

going to be a college-based degree program, like Women's Studies and others,

but that it is a university-wide program.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate Motion #3 (1998-99): The Curriculum

and Academic Programs Committee requests Academic Senate approval of a

proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to establish

a certificate in Scandinavian Studies (a copy of this motion is available

from the Academic Senate Office/965-9245).</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate Motion #4 (1998-99): The Curriculum

and Academic Programs Committee requests Academic Senate approval of a

proposal submitted by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to establish

a Writing Certificate.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Bortner: Is there an operational

definition for expertise in professional writing, what that means?&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Professor Duane Roen, Director of

Composition, Department of English: Essentially that means writing in the

workplace.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate Motion #5 (1998-99): The Curriculum

and Academic Programs Committee requests Academic Senate approval of a

proposal submitted by the College of Business to change the name of the

Master of Accountancy to change the name of the Master of Accountancy to

Master of Accountancy and Information Systems.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Mignolet: Is "Information

Systems" already a part of another degree name.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Johnson: The College of Business

and the School of Accountancy do offer an undergraduate degree and masters

degree in computer information systems. The Master of Accountancy and Information

Systems program is distinct, and reflects the merging of the two areas

in the workplace situation.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate Motion #6 (1998-99): The Curriculum

and Academic Programs Committee requests Academic Senate approval of a

proposal submitted by the College of Business to change the name of the

Department of Business Administration to the Department of Supply Chain

Management.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Blumenfeld-Jones: The way

that I read the rationale is that there is an expediency to change the

name. Could that be explained more?</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Vice Provost Bantz: I can speak briefly

about it. Supply chain management is growing to be one of the strongest

areas in the college. It reflects a trend in that department, which was

formerly named Purchasing and Logistics. Some of you may know that the

National Association of Purchasing Agents resides in the ASU Research Park.

We have built up faculty in that area and they clearly decided that this

is the name that they wanted to use rather than business administration,

which in fact does not have a large core of faculty.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Bortner: Could you tell us

about the procedure CAPC uses new curricular motions. Are there any motions

that were not recommended by the Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee.

If you do vote against recommending an action to the Senate, what happens

to those proposals?&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Johnson: Generally they will

go back to where they originated because of a particular concern or questions

the committee may have and then a revised proposal can be resubmitted to

us.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Information Items:</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senator Johnson read them: The establishment

of two concentrations under the B.A. English of Linguistics and Literature;

the establishment of minors in African American Studies and Linguistics;

the name change to an existing minor: English to Literature; the name change

to an existing Center for Urban Studies to Center for Urban Inquiry; and

the M.B.A. Program in Beijing, China, CAPC has reviewed and has no objections

to this item.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">6.D Personnel Committee (Kevin Carroll).</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate President Davey: Dr. Carroll

is out of town but I will report on behalf of that committee. We are working

on two issues right now: 1) working with Walter Harris and Human Resources

on the legislature's policy on retroactive sick leave accrual for faculty

and the incumbent policies that will be used to implement that program.

That report then will be put together by the Personnel Committee and then

to the Senate for its approval.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The other issue that the Personnel

Committee will be working on is the alterations in the ACD Manual to effect

the implementation of the President's whistleblower policies. They will

also come to the Academic Senate for approval, probably at the next meeting.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">6.E Student-Faculty Policy Committee

(John Crawford).</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is no closure on issues yet,

but we are continuing to work with the ASASU government on the teacher

evaluation program look forward to being able to have a formal presentation

for the Senate, so you may see what happened in the pilot study and what

the intentions are for this coming semester.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The other continuing issue is the

possibility of a change in the grading system to the twelve-point system

and I believe it is our committee's primary obligation to find out the

degree to which you would support that and the degree to which it would

be helpful to you as academics to have that option.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">6.F University Services and Facilities

Committee (Rodney Rogers).&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate President Davey: Rodney Rogers

was elected chair of that committee. While there is no report today, they

are looking into some of the issues that are surrounding the relocation

of Administrative Services, at the request of Mernoy Harrison. They are

examining the health insurance issues for faculty. If any of you or your

colleagues have anecdotal information about your health care or how you

were affected by the closure of The Thomas Davis Clinic or the lack of

an indemnity program, or any of those issues, please pass those on to Rodney

Rogers or myself. We are working very closely with the Human Resources

personnel as well as the Vice President for Administrative Affairs, to

try to go forward with a good understanding of what the role and the needs

of faculty are in the current insurance coverage, but we will also make

some important recommendations for change, so that we might have a bit

more stability in that process.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">7. Adjournment.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There being no further business,

the chair entertained a motion to adjourn. Senator Escobar made a motion.

Seconded. The meeting was adjourned at 4:07 p.m.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
