<h1 class="storyhead">Summer research program offers advances for undergrads</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p align="left"><img src="200608_images/20060828_summergrads.jpg" width="288" height="216" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Shondra Seils could have worked in retail this summer, like many of her undergraduate classmates, but this creative undergraduate took a walk on the wild side instead. Seils, a senior majoring in ecology and evolutionary sciences with the University of Arizona, applied for a field research position at ASU's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences in the Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program in the School of Life Sciences . </p>
<p align="left">Seils' project, titled ?Urban Open Spaces: Track Plate Surveys in Phoenix Mountains' Parks,? examined a series of different methods to record wildlife abundance, distribution and activity patterns in local urban parklands. She tested baits ? apples, dog food and scent tablets ? and the accuracy of recording methods, including plates with sticky tracking paper and live traps. </p>
<p align="left">She also set up surveys at night, including tripwires connected to infrared cameras. </p>
<p align="left">She even learned how to do owl calls. </p>
<p align="left">?I heard about the summer program from Lisa Shender, a wildlife specialist with Arizona Game and Fish,? Seils says. ?I didn't realize that I could apply, and I was thrilled to be accepted. It was an invaluable experience.? </p>
<p align="left">The School of Life Sciences' summer research program is little known at ASU. Students are hired to support ongoing research projects, and they are paid to spend 10 weeks of their summer conducting full-time, hand-on studies at the bench or in the field. </p>
<p align="left">Research appointments commonly include a stipend of roughly $3,000, with support for housing and travel, if needed. Students also receive six hours of course credit and a tuition waiver. </p>
<p align="left">In addition to doing research, students are expected to give an oral presentation of their work. Landing an undergraduate research project is more than a boon to their pocketbooks, too. It's also a crucial step in creating an outstanding career portfolio. </p>
<p align="left">?Undergraduate research is a much-needed requisite to get into graduate school and medical school,? says program participant Bony Ahmed. </p>
<p align="left">Ahmed, a sophomore majoring in biology, is headed to medical school. He believes that his summer project with mentor Nancy Grimm, an ecosystems ecologist, on ?Food Web Dynamics in Above-Ground Desert Remnant and Xeric Residential Landscapes? has uniquely prepared him to achieve his goals. </p>
<p align="left">?It was a real eye-opener to the world of research,? he says. ?I worked with graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, technicians and professors. I learned lessons in the lab, but I also learned lessons in life to help prepare me in research and in maturity.? </p>
<p align="left">Ahmed's comments were echoed by Katherine Dunning, a junior pursing a dual major in biology and mathematics. Her summer project was titled ?Effects of Light Intensity on Daphnia Dynamics and Coexistence: A Stoichiometric Perspective.? </p>
<p align="left">Dunning has participated in undergraduate research in mentor James Elser's laboratory since her freshman year. She hopes her career will take her on into a graduate program. </p>
<p align="left">Her dream job includes deep-sea research. </p>
<p align="left">?I'd love to go down in Alvin and see the deep sea vents,? she says. (Alvin is the Navy-owned deep submergence vehicle that serves as a mobile undersea laboratory for the Woods Hole Marine Oceanographic Institute.) </p>
<p align="left">While not as well-known as Alvin , the summer research experience is just one of many undergraduate research programs geared toward enriching the undergraduate student experience at ASU. School of Life Sciences also is home to Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) and PreMARC programs, and the School of Life Sciences Undergraduate Research (SOLUR) program. </p>
<p align="left">Edward Castaneda, an associate professor in the Department of Psychology and program director of PreMARC Program, stresses how undergraduate research experiences are crucial to honing students' analytical and communications skills. </p>
<p align="left">?The summer program makes students more competitive when they apply for graduate and professional schools,? he says. ?We are so fortunate that such programs now exist.? </p>
<p align="left">Castaneda should know. He claims to have he spent his undergraduate years working at Kmart to put himself through school. </p>
<p align="left">?We have an option to get involved in things that we care about,? he says. ?I think that these students' work are reflections of the quality of the mentors and the research experience of the students here as ASU and School of Life Sciences.? </p>
<p align="left">Besides dedicated mentors in the life sciences, the undergraduate research program is backed by collaborative institutional relationships with the School of Life Sciences facilities office, business office and undergraduate programs office; the Central Arizona Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research Program at ASU, in conjunction with the Global Institute of Sustainability at ASU; and the National Science Foundation. </p>
<p align="left">Research facilities also have been made available by the new School of Earth and Space Exploration in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Additional support for REUs comes from the National Institutes of Health, and the Office of the Provost and Senior Vice President at ASU, as well as individual researchers. </p>
