      <h2 align="left"><strong>Doug Ducey of Cold Stone Creamery Honored During ASU Homecoming Festivities </strong></h2>
      <p>Success has been sweet for Doug Ducey, a 1986 finance graduate of the W. P. Carey School of Business and chief executive officer and chairman of Arizona-based Cold Stone Creamery. In recognition of Ducey&rsquo;s accomplishments in business and his commitment to the community and the university, the W. P. Carey School of Business Alumni Chapter will induct him into its Hall of Fame during ASU Homecoming festivities on Friday, Nov. 5 and Saturday, Nov. 6.</p>
      <p><strong><em> Complimentary media seating is available for the Hall of Fame Luncheon on Friday, Nov. 5 from </em></strong><strong><em>11:30</em></strong><strong><em> to </em></strong><strong><em>1 p.m.</em></strong><strong><em> at the University Club. For information please contact Liz Farquhar at (480) 965-7774.</em></strong></p>
      <p> Ducey joined Cold Stone Creamery in 1995 after a nearly 20-year career that included executive sales and marketing positions with Procter &amp; Gamble and Anheuser-Busch. Under his leadership, Cold Stone is on track to having 1000 profitable stores operating by Dec. 31, 2004. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m truly honored to receive this award,&rdquo; Ducey said. &ldquo;The W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University has incredibly high standards and I am proud to be a graduate of this institution. It prepared me well for my future in business and continues to do so for thousands of others.&rdquo;</p>
      <p> Cold Stone is a market leader in the ice cream franchise business. It is the nation&rsquo;s fastest growing creamery concept ranked in the top 100 of America&rsquo;s fastest growing franchises by <em>Entrepreneur</em> magazine. Its interactive concept allows customers to personalize their own dessert experience. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;Cold Stone has been not only a tremendous opportunity to grow professionally, it has been a once-in-a-lifetime chance to build a company dedicated to making people happy and a culture that is founded on results,&rdquo; Ducey said.</p>
      <p> In 2002, the Cold Stone Creamery received the Spirit of Enterprise Award &trade;. The award, presented annually by the Center for the Advancement of Small Business at the W. P. Carey School of Business, honors companies that have consistently exhibited a successful and vibrant spirit of entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p> Ducey has maintained his connections to ASU and the W.P. Carey School, appearing frequently to speak to students and other campus groups. He has also been actively involved with Young Entrepreneurs Organization and just recently Young Presidents Organization, The Thunderbirds, The Phoenix Zoo, and many local charity boards. He also coaches T-ball and soccer. </p>
      <p> During his time as a student at ASU, Ducey worked for Hensley &amp; Co./ Anheuser-Busch. He was also president of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and president of the Inter Fraternity Council. Upon graduation in 1986 he was recruited by Procter &amp; Gamble into their management training program.</p>
      <p> The W. P. Carey School of Business Alumni Chapter Hall of Fame recognizes business alumni who have achieved significant success in their chosen field and who have made notable contributions to the local or national community. Previous winners include PayPal vice president and CFO Mary Hentges, Phoenix luxury housing developer Bruce Merrill and New York investment banker George Schreiber of Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
