          <h2>MIT physicist tackles issue of women in science</h2>
          <p>Last month, when Harvard University President Larry Summers suggested that innate biological differences may make men more likely than women to become scientists, he ignited an age-old debate about sex, equality and opportunity. </p>
          <p>Mildred Dresselhaus, an institute professor of physics and electrical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has lived most of her adult life in the middle of this debate. She was born to a poor immigrant family in the Bronx; when she won a state scholarship to attend Hunter&rsquo;s College in New York, she had the intention of becoming an elementary school teacher. However, driven by a love and talent for math, she switched her focus to the study of science. The decision proved as successful as it was unorthodox for the time.</p>
          <p>Today, colleagues regard Dresselhaus as one of the scientific community&rsquo;s most important leaders, a stalwart advocate for the inclusion of women in science, and a researcher on the frontiers of physics and technology &ndash; fields in which a woman was an oddity when she first chose her career.</p>
          <p>At 8 p.m., March 2, Dresselhaus will share her perspective on &ldquo;Expanding the Opportunities for Women in Science and Engineering&rdquo; as part of the Distinguished Lecturer Series in the Bateman Physical Sciences Center F Wing, room 166. At 4 p.m., March 3, she will address the Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy in a more technical colloquium on &ldquo;Addressing Grand Energy Challenges Through Advanced Materials&rdquo; in room 173 of the same building. Both talks are open to the public.</p>
          <p>For more information, contact the ASU Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy at (480) 965-3561. </p>
          <p>Though women today choose careers in the sciences more than ever before, men still hold most of the top research positions nationwide. In the engineering and physical sciences, the disparity between men and women is even more pronounced. </p>
          <p>She has addressed this inequality from some of the most prestigious posts in science, serving terms as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the American Physical Society, as well as treasurer of the National Academy of Sciences. Throughout her career, she has worked to identify and dismantle the obstacles standing between young women and occupations in scientific fields. Dresselhaus&rsquo; lectures will discuss the difficulties still facing women in science and the commitments that academia and industry must make to close the gender gap. </p>
          <p>Dresselhaus is an institute professor of physics and electrical engineering at M.I.T. She is the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the National Medal of Science and 19 honorary doctorates. She has served as the director of the Office of Science at the U.S. Department of Energy from 2000 &ndash; 2001, and is the chair of the governing board of the American Institute of Physics. </p>
          <p>Her most recent research at M.I.T. delves into novel nanostructures, specifically focusing on carbon nanotubes, bismuth nano-wires, and low-dimensional electricity. She previously conducted research in superconductivity and experimental solid state physics of carbon-related structures.</p>
          <p>Hathaway, with the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, can be reached at (480) 965-6375 or (hathaway@asu.edu).</p>
