			<h2>Software Assurance</h2>
			
			<p>Software Assurance is an option you can select when you make your initial software purchase with the 
			Select Agreement.</p>
			
			<p>Software Assurance is what some people call "upgrade insurance" or "version upgrade rights."  Software Assurance is for a 
			specific amount of time, current to your Select Contract (not when the software is purchased) and allows
			you to upgrade to new versions for free.  Software Assurance must be purchased at the same time the software 
			is ordered, it cannot be added in later on.</p>
			
			<p>The Campus Agreement includes Software Assurance automatically; any product included in the Campus Agreement 
			can be upgraded at any time during the agreement.</p>
			
			<br />
			<h3>Software Assurance Benefits</h3>
			
			<h3>Productivity</h3>
			<p>A key element of Software Assurance is productivity. You can access the latest technology when you need it and 
			choose to spread out payments annually. Offerings include: </p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>New Version Rights</strong> - Simplify the procurement process, deploy at your own pace, and reduce the costs associated 
			with acquiring new version releases by automatically receiving upgrades and updates of the software covered 
			by Software Assurance. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Support Resources and Tools</h3>
			<p>Software Assurance provides institutions with access to Microsoft support resources and tools to help IT 
			staff efficiently deploy and use software. You also have access to tools to help get systems up and running 
			smoothly. Offerings include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Microsoft Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE)</strong> - Build custom solutions that speed up deployment through 
			automation.  Available through the ASU Bookstore.</li>
			<li><strong>Corporate Error Reporting</strong> - Identify which systems are failing and why, map solutions to crashes, and connect to 
			up-to-date knowledge and fixes.</li>  
			<li><strong>Extended Lifecycle Hotfix Support</strong> - Customers with Software Assurance for their server software may request 
			hotfixes for products in the Extended Support Phase (the two years following the five-year Mainstream Support 
			Phase) without signing an up-front contract. As always, security fixes are automatically extended to customers. </li>
			<li><strong>"Cold" Backups for Disaster Recovery</strong> - Receive complimentary "cold" backup server Licenses for the purpose 
			of disaster recovery. A cold server is a server that is turned off until a disaster arises. No other 
			processing or production is done on this server.</li>  
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Training</h3>
			<p>With Software Assurance, faculty and staff can get up to speed quickly on new products, and IT professionals can
			 keep up-to-date with the latest technical information and keep your institution moving forward with integration 
			 of current technology. The courses include streaming audio and video software demonstrations and animations. 
			 Offerings include: </p>
			<ul> 
			<li><strong>Desktop eLearning</strong> - Get training on different versions of Microsoft Office (including the various applications), 
			Microsoft Windows, and more. Includes courses specifically-designed to help you migrate to a new version. </li>
			<li><strong>Server eLearning</strong> - IT professionals can learn how to implement and administer Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 
			2000, Exchange Server, SQL Server and other Microsoft server products.</li>
			</ul>
