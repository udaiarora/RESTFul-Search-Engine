The Request for Academic Personnel Action form provided by the Office of the Executive Vice President and University Provost along with any additional forms used by the college. &nbsp; (The form is also available on the web at www.asu.edu/provost/forms.) </p>        <p>2. Table of Contents for the materials in candidate's submission. </p>        <p>3. Evaluation letters and committee recommendations (omitting identification of external/internal reviewers). </p>        <blockquote>          <p>A. Department Personnel Committee evaluation of job performance, professional development and contribution, and service in relation to approved unit/department criteria. </p>          <p>B. Chair's/Director's independent recommendation in relation to unit/department goals. &nbsp; If applicable, include an analysis of teaching success. </p>          <p>C. College Personnel Committee evaluation and recommendation. </p>          <p>D. Dean's independent evaluation and recommendation. </p>        </blockquote>        <p>Internal letters should explicitly address the following: </p>        <blockquote>          <p>&#149;&nbsp; analysis of the candidate's job effectiveness; </p>          <p>&#149;&nbsp; detailed evaluation of the quality and impact of the candidate's professional contributions; </p>          <p>&#149;&nbsp; assessment of expected future contributions; </p>          <p>&#149;&nbsp; clear specifications of the candidate's contributions to collaborative projects (including external funding where applicable); </p>          <p>&#149;&nbsp; comparative analysis of the candidate's standing in the field, relative to national peers; and </p>          <p>&#149;&nbsp; if the committee vote is not unanimous, explicitly state the minority view in a separate section of the letter. </p>        </blockquote>        <p>It is extremely important that at each level of review a substantive evaluation of the case is provided and questions arising at earlier levels of review are directly addressed. &nbsp; Please DO NOT repeat case details that have already been described in earlier letters. &nbsp; Rather, in subsequent letters, evaluate the case, correct misstatements, substantiate or challenge claims, and provide additional perspectives. &nbsp; Whatever the recommendation, the letter should argue the point--in other words, make a statement and provide support. &nbsp; Each level of review has a different perspective on the candidate and this perspective should be evident. &nbsp; Please also be scrupulous in providing evidence and documentation for important assertions about the case. &nbsp; </p>        <p>4. If applicable , a summary analysis of teaching evaluations prepared by the chair/director. &nbsp; The chair/director should explain special challenges and/or teaching accomplishments and describe how teaching is evaluated in the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>It is highly desirable that some data comparing the candidate's student evaluations with the unit/department or college averages be presented. </em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, at the very least, the candidate's course ratings should be compared to unit/departmental averages in similar courses. </p>        <p>5. External/Internal Evaluations. </p>        <blockquote>          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In preparing the final list of external/internal reviewers, half should be from the candidate's list of suggested reviewers and half from the chair/dean's list of suggested reviewers. &nbsp; Include identifying information about the reviewers <strong>only </strong> on the grid/form provided by the Office of the Executive Vice President and University Provost. &nbsp; See also the enclosed Academic Senate guidelines for soliciting external/internal letters. &nbsp; REMINDER: &nbsp; Please provide detailed information about each reviewer's qualifications, stature in the field, and familiarity with the candidate's overall performance contributions. &nbsp; Be sure to anticipate the potential questions from evaluators within ASU who are not in the candidate's discipline/research area. &nbsp; Providing such detailed background information is particularly important if the general guidelines for selecting reviewers are not followed (e.g., selecting a distinguished academic in the field as a reviewer, but that academic is not affiliated with a research university). </p>          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. A copy of the letter used to request the reviews must be included. &nbsp; [See attached Template #2.] &nbsp; NO MORE THAN TEN LETTERS SHOULD BE Formally SOLICITED. &nbsp; All original letters received must be included. &nbsp; Department Chairs/Unit Directors should feel free to contact potential reviewers prior to the formal solicitation to identify those potential reviewers most likely to respond. &nbsp; Additional reviewers may be contacted in an attempt to ensure at least 6 responses. </p>          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Current letters from reviewers in the candidate's field of expertise. &nbsp; These evaluations may come from within ASU, although not from people already assigned to play a role in the review process. &nbsp; Every attempt should be made to solicit external/internal evaluations whenever possible and appropriate given the candidate's workload expectations. &nbsp;&nbsp; External/internal reviews for scholarly contributions are required. &nbsp; If possible, department chairs/ unit directors and deans should explicate any troublesome or confusing statement made by a reviewer. </p>        </blockquote>        <p>6. A statement of not more than four pages written by the candidate to put past work into perspective and to outline future goals growing out of that work. &nbsp; The statement should assist reviewers to determine relationships among the individual's job performance, professional development and contributions, service, and how these activities have built the foundation for continued professional growth. &nbsp; </p>        <p>7. A current curriculum vitae, presenting a record of professional activities and contributions to the unit, college/school, institution, and profession. &nbsp; This might include institutional and professional service, professional publications, papers presented, grants, etc. &nbsp; The individual effort of the academic professional in collaborative activities should be specified. </p>        <p>8. A copy of four publications or other material reflecting scholarly/creative and professional endeavors of the candidate. &nbsp; A portfolio documenting overall professional activity may be submitted as one piece of evidence. &nbsp; If local units have reviewed a greater quantity of material, the candidate should be consulted about weeding the material to fit the space restrictions at the University level. </p>        <p>9. A job description. </p>        <p>10. <strong>Optional, if candidate's responsibilities include instruction: </strong>&nbsp; Supplemental materials providing evidence of instructional effectiveness may be submitted for up to 2 courses, e.g., syllabi, copies of major tests and assignments, reading lists, web sites, &nbsp; CDs, etc. </p>        <p>11. Send only ONE file per academic professional; i.e., do not send duplicate department and college files. </p>        <p>12. A current copy of the unit's/department's and college's approved promotion and continuing status review process criteria. </p>        <p>The dean should provide a cover list including the names of all academic professionals in the college that are going through the review process, listed by department, who are being considered for promotion and/or continuing status this cycle. </p>        <p><strong></strong></p>        <br><p>&nbsp;</p>        <p>&nbsp;</p></td>    <td width="14%" valign="top"><p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/asunews/Insight/index.htm">         </a></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p></td>  </tr></table><BR CLEAR=ALL><!--Page Footer-->    <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->	      </div>	</td>	  </tr>      <!--Footer-->	  <tr>    <td width="220" align="left" valign="bottom" bgcolor="#000000"><p>&nbsp;</p> </td>    <td bgcolor="#000000">	<div id="superfooter">	    <p>		<a href="http://www.asu.edu/search/">Search</a> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <a href="http://www.asu.edu/copyright/">Copyright</a> &nbsp;| &nbsp;         <a href="http://www.asu.edu/accessibility/">Accessibility</a> &nbsp; | &nbsp;         <a href="http://www.asu.edu/privacy/">Privacy</a> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 		<a href="http://www.asu.edu/admin/">Administration</a> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 	    <a href="http://www.asu.edu/contactasu/">Contact ASU</a></p>    </div>	</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="220" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p>      </p></td>    <td><div id="footer">		<table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">          <tr>            <td width="84%" align="left" valign="top">				<p>Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University<br>		  Location:		  Foundation Building, Suite 420, 300 E.
