Because fusion has been an important         dimension in the arts during much of the past half-century, an institute         dedicated to the study of fusion in the arts offers students and faculty         members an ideal opportunity to examine its implications for and relationships         with other disciplines&#8212;in the humanities, social sciences, natural         sciences, and fields of technology.</p>      <p> Building on the innovative and renowned programs of our existing <a href="http://isa.asu.edu/home.html">Institute         for Studies in the Arts</a>, the enlarged scope of the institute will         bring together researchers from disciplines as diverse as dance, music,         theatre, computer science, electrical engineering, bioengineering, the         liberal arts, the biological sciences, education, and architecture and         environmental design. The institute will offer a special focus on the         relationship of the arts to developments in technology and new media.         Our location in Metropolitan Phoenix offers an ideal opportunity to explore         the creative ferment of a dynamic urban environment. </p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><br>      </p>      &nbsp;<BR> </td>    <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
