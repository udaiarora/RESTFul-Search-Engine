      <h2>Major Valley ceramics collection to be exhibited at ASU Art Museum</h2>
      <p>TEMPE, Ariz. - Selections from the important ceramics collection of Valley 
        residents David and Sara Lieberman will go on exhibit at the ASU Art Museum's 
        Ceramics Research Center this spring, providing a unique opportunity to 
        view a collection that recently was featured in American Craft magazine.</p>
      <p> Shared Passion: Sara and David Lieberman Collection of Contemporary 
        Ceramics and Craft will open Feb. 8 and run through May 18. A weekend 
        of activities, including a free public reception from 7-9 p.m., Feb. 8, 
        will launch the exhibition. Also scheduled are two free lectures by nationally 
        renowned ceramists. Ken Price will speak at 7 p.m., Feb. 7, and Josh DeWeese 
        will speak at 2 p.m., Feb. 9. Both lectures will take place in Neeb Hall 
        at the intersection of Forest and Tyler Malls on ASU's Tempe campus.</p>
      <p>The Liebermans' collection of more than 200 contemporary ceramics pieces, 
        which was last year promised to the ASU Art Museum's Ceramics Research 
        Center, is a Who's Who of contemporary ceramics, including works by Peter 
        Voulkos, Michael Lucero, Ruth Duckworth and Beatrice Wood. Approximately 
        40 pieces from the collection will be on show as part of this exhibition.</p>
      <p>Shared Passion will continue in the museum's Nelson Fine Arts Center 
        location, with selections from the Liebermans' other great collections 
        of contemporary fiber works, baskets, metal, glass, wood and jewelry. 
        Senior curator Heather Lineberry said that the complete exhibition in 
        both buildings would present about 100 works in total. The exhibition, 
        she said, is about passion - the Liebermans' passion for art and craft.</p>
      <p> "In a relatively short amount of time, the Liebermans have assembled 
        a magnificent contemporary craft collection that touches upon most of 
        the major artists and movements of today," Lineberry said. </p>
      <p>The museum's new curator of ceramics, Peter Held, said that when he was 
        first introduced to Sara and David Lieberman, it didn't take him long 
        to detect the gleam in their eyes and the heightened pitch in their voices 
        when talking about ceramics.</p>
      <p>"Passionate, knowledgeable and articulate about their growing ceramic 
        collection, the Liebermans have - over the course of 20-plus years - amassed 
        a significant group of ceramic art focused on post-World War II clay artists," 
        Held said.</p>
      <p> The Liebermans' ceramics collection had been sought by a number of museums, 
        but they chose to donate it to the ASU Art Museum. They also made an immediate 
        monetary donation toward operating costs at the new center.</p>
      <p>J. Robert Wills, Dean of the Herberger College of Fine Arts, recognized 
        the long-term importance of the gift. </p>
      <p>"This is a two-part gift that not only helps us build momentum at the 
        beginning of the center, but also helps guarantee its long-term excellence. 
        We owe them special thanks," Wills said.</p>
      <p>Lineberry described the Liebermans' ceramics collection as "a who's who 
        of contemporary ceramics on an international scale." She said it both 
        complimented and expanded the museum's collection, including the significant 
        addition of numerous works by contemporary Native America artists. The 
        ASU Art Museum collection specializes in contemporary and 20th century 
        British and American ceramics, and is one of the best in the country.</p>
      <p>The Liebermans have long been major supporters of the ASU Art Museum 
        and more recently the new Ceramics Research Center. Sara Lieberman is 
        chair of the Ceramics Research Center's community support group, Ceramic 
        Leaders of ASU (CLA).</p>
      <p>Both Sara and David are recognized benefactors of multiple valley art 
        and community organizations. Sara has a 10-year history of volunteering 
        and supporting the ASU Art Museum, having started as a community docent 
        and now holding the position of chair of CLA's board. David was recently 
        recognized for his nearly 10 years as a volunteer in inner city elementary 
        schools, during which he has encouraged and inspired many children. He 
        also established a number of trusts to assist at-risk children in gaining 
        an education.</p>

        of Fine Arts at Arizona State University. It is located on the southeast 
        corner of Mill Avenue and 10th Street, Tempe. The Ceramics Research Center
