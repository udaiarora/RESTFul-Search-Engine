      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know a community servant.  Her name is Carmen.  She has black, curly hair, brown eyes, and a big smile.  She likes to shop, to help me, my brother, and my cousins, and likes to hear my ideas.  She loves my family, but she can be mad sometimes.  She's a great person.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On thing that makes her so great is she helps the community.  Every Tuesday she goes to deliver food to people who are sick or are too weak.  She takes a list of people who are sick, puts a sign up in her car, and takes the food.  My tata (Grampa) helps her deliver.
    	<br>
    	<br>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is better with Carmen because she is helping the community by helping and caring for others by delivering food to them.  She also is better for the world by teaching others to do the same.  I know a lot about Carmen because she is my Nana (Grandma)!
    	<br>
    	<br>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things I am learning from my Nana are: helping others is good for your family and your community; when you're a community servant it should touch your heart and theirs; to be a community servant is like having a gift!
