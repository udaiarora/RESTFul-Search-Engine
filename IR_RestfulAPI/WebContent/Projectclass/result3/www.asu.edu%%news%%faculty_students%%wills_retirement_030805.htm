          <h2>Wills to step down as </a> Herberger College dean in 2006</h2>
          <p> <img src="facstudents_images/Wills_030805.jpg" width="288" height="217" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">J. Robert Wills, dean of the Herberger College of Fine Arts, has announced he will retire from that position at the end of the next academic year. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;It has been a joy to serve this college as dean, but this is the longest I&rsquo;ve been anywhere, and it&rsquo;s time for whatever comes next,&rdquo; Wills says. </p>
          <p> By June 2006, the dean will have been at ASU for a dozen years. </p>
          <p> The college is celebrating its 40th anniversary this academic year. During Wills&rsquo; tenure, the college became one of the first to be named when, in 2000, Katherine K. &ldquo;Kax&rdquo; Herberger gave $12 million to further fine arts education at ASU. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;As dean of the Herberger College , Bob Wills has a remarkable track record,&rdquo; ASU President Michael Crow says. &ldquo;He was instrumental in bringing Katherine Herberger&rsquo;s name, which is synonymous with culture in Arizona, to ASU along with what was the largest personal gift ever received at that time. Bob&rsquo;s energy, passion and unswerving vision for ASU&rsquo;s arts program have resulted in national rankings for all of the college&rsquo;s academic programs, and he is the only dean at ASU to have reached this enviable position.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Crow points out that an equally important signature for Wills has been &ldquo;his passion for students and his celebration of their accomplishments.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Wills constantly has looked for ways to recognize students, whether it was special commencement recognition of the 10,000th graduate in 2002 or last week&rsquo;s pizza party for the music student recently named to <em>USA Today&rsquo;s</em> All-USA Academic Team. </p>
          <p> He encouraged the formation of a fine arts student council and a fine arts residential community to foster cross-disciplinary exploration among dance, music, theater and visual arts students. </p>
          <p> He also pushed for one of the country&rsquo;s first cross-disciplinary research centers between fine arts and other schools. This resulted in ASU&rsquo;s Arts, Media and Engineering Program, which is jointly sponsored by the Herberger College and the Fulton School of Engineering and, in just two years, embraces the efforts of 14 disciplines within the university. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;There is a sense of cohesiveness in the college and an engagement with the community that are noteworthy,&rdquo; says Milt Glick, ASU&rsquo;s executive vice president and provost. &ldquo;The bridges of the Herberger College to the community and to other programs in the university have never been stronger.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Wills initiated a college community programs office three years after he came to ASU, and it routinely partners with public, business and government sectors to reach more than 25,000 people annually. </p>
          <p> This summer, through his efforts, the college will launch Herberger College for Kids and Herberger College at Large, a broad-based community school program for children and adults. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;This is a model of an engaged university,&rdquo; Glick says. </p>
          <p> Wills joined ASU as fine arts dean and professor of theater in 1994. He has been in higher education for 43 years, and served as the dean of fine arts at the University of Texas-Austin and the University of Kentucky . He also taught at Wittenberg University and Pacific Lutheran University, where he served as provost from 1989 &ndash; 1994. </p>
          <p> He received his bachelor&rsquo;s degree from College of Wooster , his master&rsquo;s degree from University of Illinois and his doctorate with honors from Case Western Reserve University . He also attended Harvard University, where he earned a certificate in arts administration, with commendation for excellence. </p>
          <p> He has remained an active director in theater, directing the world premiere of &ldquo;Caterina&rsquo;s Son&rdquo; with the Lyric Opera Theatre in 2004 and &ldquo;The Birds&rdquo; in 2001. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;The Birds&rdquo; was a major AriZoni Awards winner, and he and the cast of &ldquo;Caterina&rsquo;s Son&rdquo; were invited to Italy during spring break to perform songs from the production. </p>
          <p> Wills said he announced his retirement early to give the university ample opportunity to search for new leadership. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;My role at ASU has been fulfilling and rewarding &ndash; and, with the help of faculty, staff and students, we&rsquo;re not done yet,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still more than a year to go, and I&rsquo;m eager for what lies ahead.&rdquo; </p>
