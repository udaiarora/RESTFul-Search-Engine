<p>
Altered admission standards in one college often affect enrollment patterns in other colleges&#151;and may affect overall university enrollments.

<font size=+1><b>Changes in Programs</b></font>

<p>
Program quality serves as the guiding principle in evaluating proposed changes.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in College Admission Standards</b></font>

<p>
Changes in college admission standards must be approved by program faculty, college faculty, and the executive vice president and provost of the university.  Proposed changes in graduate programs must also be approved by the dean of the Division of Graduate Studies. Changes approved by the university will be presented for information only to the chief academic officers of the three state universities and are reported to the Board of Regents annually.

<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1><b>Responsibility of the Dean</b></font>

<p>
The dean of the college proposing the change in program or in college admission standards is responsible for assuring that questions of rationale, coordination, and enrollment impact have been addressed satisfactorily.

<p>
<li>Review the proposed admission requirement change with the appropriate Admissions Office (undergraduate and/or graduate) relative to the effect on future applicants, processing of applicant files, and outreach efforts needed for public awareness of policy changes.
