  You must have verification of two MMR (measles [rubeola] /mumps/rubella) immunizations on record at ASU, or you cannot register for classes. Freshmen should complete this step before attending ASU Orientation. Use the ASU Immunization Form that ASU sends to you with your admission certificate or print the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/health/measles.html" target="_blank">ASU Immunization Form</a>. </p>
      <p>To verify that ASU has received and recorded your immunization documentation before you attend ASU Orientation, go to <a href="http://www.asu.edu/interactive" target="_blank">ASU Interactive</a>, log in, and view your ASU Orientation Summary. Please be aware that it takes approximately two days from the time ASU receives your documentation to record it in the system. Therefore, you must send/fax your MMR documentation well in advance of your scheduled Orientation program. </p>
