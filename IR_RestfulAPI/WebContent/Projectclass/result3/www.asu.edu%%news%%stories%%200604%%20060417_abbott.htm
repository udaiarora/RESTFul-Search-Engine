<h1 class="storyhead">Law scholar brings international expertise to ASU </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>Kenneth Abbott, a leading scholar in international law, has joined ASU from Northwestern University in Chicago to teach an interdisciplinary set of courses, some in the College of Law and some in the School of Global Studies. </p>
<p>He will hold a joint appointment as a professor of law - the Willard H. Pedrick Distinguished Research Scholar in the College of Law - and as a professor of global studies. </p>
<p>Patricia White, dean of the College of Law, says Abbott brings a wealth of international expertise to the College of Law, ASU and Arizona. </p>
<p>"Professor Abbott is one of the most influential scholars in the country working in international relations and international law," she says. </p>
<p>Abbott says his subject is best approached from multiple directions. </p>
<p>"Law classes often focus on the legal rules in a specific subject area, but my interest is more crosscutting," Abbott says. "When you try to solve international problems, you need to look more broadly at a wide range of institutions, rules and policies. "Organizations like the World Bank, for example, are able to implement all kinds of norms and policies around the world. The bank's internal policies have tremendous impact through its lending programs, but policies are not really law." </p>
<p>David Jacobson, director of the School of Global Studies, says it was a coup to hire Abbott, and that his expertise will enhance all the areas studied at the school, including environment, urban issues, health, global governance and migration. </p>
<p>"Part of our mandate is to find better ways of bringing academia to bear on concrete global issues," Jacobson says. "Any policy dimension we need to address in the school ultimately needs to be formulated and codified. Law is central in that respect." </p>
<p>In addition to teaching, Abbott will be working on large, collaborative research projects with other faculty, Jacobson says. </p>
<p>"He is an eminent scholar of international law and has tremendous energy and intellect," Jacobson says. "We're delighted to have him here, and look forward to this as a foundation for further collaboration with the College of Law. That is a relationship we'd very much like to develop." </p>
<p>After 27 years of teaching and four as director of Northwestern University's Center for International and Comparative Studies, Abbott was ready for a change. </p>
<p>He and his wife, Debbie, a landscape designer, began looking at places where they wanted to live, with the goal of spending half their time in Chicago and half in the Southwest. </p>
<p>They were intrigued by ASU, and about a year ago Abbott contacted White. She immediately invited him to visit. </p>
<p>On that first visit, Abbott met ASU President Michael Crow and the faculty in the School of Global Studies. </p>
<p>"I liked everything about ASU," Abbott says. "I was very attracted by the vision of President Crow, and the innovative programs being created around the university in fields such as global health and sustainability." </p>
<p>But White probably sealed the deal with a hike in the McDowell Mountains. </p>
<p>"My wife in particular had a terrible mental image of Arizona, but when we saw the desert, we loved it," Abbott says. </p>
<p>ASU is a perfect place to contemplate international relations, he says. </p>
<p>"Arizona looks like a microcosm of globalization," Abbott says. "President Crow says Phoenix is the northernmost city in Latin America, and I think he's right in looking at it that way. </p>
<p>"Many of those who study here will stay here, and they will participate more and more in a global economy. They need to be prepared for it." </p>
<p>International relations and international law are not just a set of rules and procedures, Abbott says. </p>
<p>"International law was traditionally made by states or nations," Abbott says. "Nowadays, the demand for new rules comes from industries, non-governmental organizations and businesses. It's a whole different kind of politics. This is true for issues of international human rights, the environment, trade and intellectual property. The politics can be very complex. </p>
<p>"At the same time, most often, it's not the behavior of states that you want to influence. It's the private actors, like businesses that pollute or pay bribes, or individual officials who demand bribes, or prison guards who abuse their prisoners." </p>
<p>Abbott is interested in international health issues, such as the AIDS pandemic, environmental issues and international development policy, as well as international trade and economic law, all from an interdisciplinary perspective that emphasizes the politics of making and applying law. </p>
<p>His courses will focus on how the international community organizes itself to solve pressing problems. </p>
<p>Students with this background could work for the government, non-governmental organizations, business groups, or anyone with significant international interaction. </p>
<p>The interdisciplinary study of international law is small but growing, Abbott says. </p>
<p>"When I started, there was nobody," Abbott says. "Other people quickly came along. Now this interdisciplinary approach has a momentum of its own." </p>
