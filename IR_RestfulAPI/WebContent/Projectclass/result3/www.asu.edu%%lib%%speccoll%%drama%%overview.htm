        <p> The Jonathan Levy Collection was donated to ASU Libraries in 1999. 
          It contains over 600 books with copyrights from the 17th through 20th 
          centuries, and manuscripts chronicling Levy's distinguished academic 
          and professional career. This collection documents the very early history 
          of Theatre for Youth, the position of children in society, and the taste 
          and sensibility of historical periods. These subjects are addressed 
          in the following types of books: plays to be acted for and by children; 
          school textbooks, readers and speakers; annuals and gift books, many 
          with short plays; biographies of playwrights and children's writers; 
          criticism and history of theatre for young audiences; reference books 
          on children and theatre; and dialogues and recitations. Levy has been 
          amassing this collection since the 1960s. These published monographs 
          and periodicals are catalogued separately on the ASU Libraries online 
          catalogue under the call numbers SPEC LEV and SPEC LEVP.

        According to Levy, building his library started almost by accident while 
        he was working on his doctoral degree and beginning his teaching career. 
        &quot; . . . I was also writing plays, some of which were plays for children. 
        I got interested in who had written plays for children before me, why 
        they did it and what good they thought could come of it. I looked for 
        a standard general history of the field and found, to my surprise, that 
        none existed. From then on, I began to buy books for my own use, out of 
        curiosity. Over the years I got increasingly serious about my collection 
        and worked with antiquarian booksellers in America and Europe to build 
        the collection. Also, when I was traveling, I spent a good deal of time 
        looking through piles of old books in second-hand shops, barns, flea markets 
        and so on, occasionally finding some treasure that had been previously 
        overlooked. That was, as any collector will tell you, the most satisfactory 
        of all.&quot; </td>

        Levy's manuscripts document his playwriting for adult and young audiences, 
        arts consulting and academic careers. Also included are the research and 
        pre-print materials for his books and articles and his curricular work 
        with Project Zero at Harvard University and with the International Baccalaureate 
        Organization. A finding aid with a list of the materials in the Levy manuscript 
        collection is located in the Luhrs Reading Room in Hayden Library. To

        The Levy donation supplements the theatre for youth scholarly resources 
        in Special Collections. Previously the Child Drama Collection documented 
        the history of the field from 1900 onward. The Levy collection expands 
        research possibilities back to the 17th century. This makes ASU the largest 
        repository of materials on theatre for youth in the United States.<br>
