<P>As
an alternative method to signing on to a remote session by using a TSO sign-on
script, the OS/390 spawner program initiates SAS/CONNECT sessions
on OS/390 systems without requiring that username and password pairs be passed
over the network in clear text mode.
<P>If the local SAS session is running Release 6.09E or a subsequent release
or Release 6.11 TS040 or a subsequent release, all data that flows from the
local host to the spawner program during sign on is encrypted by default.
<P>The OS/390 spawner program supports encrypted sign ons, by default,
to an OS/390 system with or without scripts. 
<P>The OS/390 spawner runs as an OS/390 started task. It uses OS/390 Unix
System Services, and you must be running OS/390 Version 2 Release 4 or later.
The spawner program requires APF-authorization. To start the OS/390 spawner,
enter the following operator console command:
<PRE>START SPAWNER</PRE>
<P>This command activates the started task procedure. An example of this
procedure follows:
<PRE>//SPAWNER  EXEC PGM=SASTCPD,
//         PARM=(' =&lt;//DDN:PARMS')
//STEPLIB  DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=SAS.SPAWNER.LOAD
//SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=A
//SYSTERM  DD   SYSOUT=A
//PARMS    DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=SAS.SPAWNER.PARMS</PRE>
<P>Here is the syntax to configure the OS/390 spawner program:

<DL>
<DT>-HELP</DT>
<DD>prints a list of valid parameters.<P></DD>

<DT>-INHERITANCE</DT>
<DD>causes the SAS session that is spawned to inherit the socket
that was created when the spawner accepted the initial connection from the
local SAS session .  This option is useful if your configuration involves
a firewall and you want to minimize the number of ports that you define to
the firewall for use by SAS/CONNECT. 
<P>If you start a spawner with the -INHERITANCE option, you then define
the port that the spawner is listening on to the firewall and map it to the
server machine's port.  This will enable any number of SAS/CONNECT clients
to connect through this single port and SIGNON to a remote host on the inside
of the firewall.  Each client just opens a unique socket on the defined port.
 This eliminates the need to define an individual port for each client that
may need to come in through the firewall.  In this configuration you set your
REMOTE= value to a two-level name where the first level is the name of the
host running the firewall and the second level is the well-known service name
of the port that you have enabled for connections.<P></DD>

<DT>-NETENCRALG
<B>algorithm</B></DT>
<DD>If you specify more than one algorithm, enclose the algorithm
names in parenthesis and use commas to separate the names. If there are embedded
blanks in the algorithm name,  enclose each algorithm in quotation marks.
<P>Set this option at the remote host and, optionally, at the local host
to specify one or more encryption algorithms to use in a SAS/CONNECT session.
However, the local host and the remote host must share an encryption algorithm
in common. If you specify the option in the remote host session only, the
local host attempts to select an algorithm that was specified at the remote
host. If you also set the option at the local host and specify an algorithm
that is not specified at the remote host, the local host's attempt to connect
to that remote host fails when the local host assigns a library. 
<P>Valid values for this option are

<P>See the 



<B>SAS/CONNECT User's Guide</B> or the 



<B>SAS/SHARE User's Guide</B>  for more information about the -NETENCRALG
option.<P></DD>

<DT>-NETENCRYPT</DT>
<DD>Set this option at both the local host and the remote host.
At the remote host, this option specifies that encryption is required for
each connection from a local host SAS session. At the local host, this option
specifies that the local host must connect only to a remote host that supports
encryption. 
<P>The default for this option is that encryption is used if the -NETENCRALG
option is set and if both the local host and the remote host are capable of
encryption. If encryption algorithms were specified but either the local host
or the remote host is incapable of encryption, then encryption will not be
performed.
<P>Encryption may not be supported at the local host or the remote host
for the following reasons:
<UL>

<LI>You are running a release of SAS (prior to Version 7) that does
not support encryption.<P>

<LI>Your site has not purchased a SAS/SECURE license for a specific
platform.<P>

<LI>You specified encryption algorithms in the local host and the
remote host SAS sessions that are incompatible.<P>

<LI>You do not have a cryptographic service provider installed on
your UNIX system.<P>
</UL>

<P>See the 



<B>SAS/CONNECT User's Guide</B> or the 



<B>SAS/SHARE User's Guide</B>  for more information about the -NETENCRYPT
option.<P></DD>

<DT>-NETENCRKEY <B>n</B> </DT>
<DD>You set this option in either the local host or the remote
host SAS session. It specifies the key length to be used by the encryption
algorithm.
<P>Valid values for this option are
<TABLE cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>128</TD>
<TD align="left">specifies 1024-bit RSA and 128-bit RC2 and RC4 key

algorithms.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>0</TD>
<TD align="left">no value is set. This is the default.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>If you require extra security, then set the -NETENCRKEY option to 128.
If you prefer to save CPU, then set the -NETENCRKEY option to 40. 
<P>By default, if you try to connect a host that is capable of only a 40-bit
key length with a host that is capable of both a 40-bit and a 128-bit key
length, then the connection is made using the lesser key length.  If both
hosts are capable of 128-bit key lengths, then a 128-bit key length is used.
<P>See the 



<B>SAS/CONNECT User's Guide</B> or the 



<B>SAS/SHARE User's Guide</B>  for more information about the -NETENCRKEY
option.<P></DD>

<DT>-NETMAC | -NONETMAC </DT>
<DD>Set this option to control the use of Message Authentication
Codes (MACs) on network communications. A Message Authentication Code is the
equivalent of a checksum that is used to ensure that the original message
has not been modified.
<P>This option may be set at either the local host or the remote host.
The default is -NETMAC.
<P>See the 



<B>SAS/CONNECT User's Guide</B>or the 



<B>SAS/SHARE User's Guide</B>  for more information about the -NETMAC
option.<P></DD>

<DT>-NOCLEARTEXT</DT>
<DD>prevents a sign on from a local host that does not support
username and password encryption. This option prevents local hosts in a SAS
session that are running releases prior to 6.09E and 6.11 TS040 from signing
on to the spawner program. The default is to accept both encrypted and clear-text
userids and passwords. This allows local hosts in a SAS session that are running
releases prior to 6.09E and 6.11 TS040 to sign on to the UNIX spawner program.<P></DD>

<DT>-NOSCRIPT</DT>
<DD>prevents sign ons from local hosts that use scripts, and
allows sign ons only from local hosts that do not use scripts.
<P>For the TCP/IP access method, the spawner program requires a script
file, or it will verify the supplied userid and the password. This option
requires that the user set security in the local SAS session prior to sign
on. For details about setting security (for example, by means of the USER=
and PASSWORD= options in an appropriate statement), see <A href="z0216242.htm#z1252230">Setting Security for SAS/CONNECT and SAS/SHARE</A>.
<P>If you use the -NOSCRIPT option, you must also use the
-SASCMD option.<P></DD>

<DT>-SASCMD <B>command</B></DT>
<DD>specifies the SAS command that starts a SAS session when
you sign on without a script. If the RLINK fileref is not defined in the local
host SAS session, then the user is signing on without a script. In this case,
the -SASCMD option must be specified.<P></DD>

<DT>-SERVICE
<B>service-name</B></DT>
<DD>specifies the name of the service that the UNIX spawner
program uses to listen for incoming requests. This value is identical to the <B>service</B> value in the REMOTE= option that the user specifies at the
local host prior to sign on. Because there is no default, you must specify
this value. See <A href="z0363155.htm#z0363163">Specifying the Remote Node Name</A>
for details.
<P>The service name must be defined identically in the SERVICES file on
both the local and remote hosts. See <A href="zervices.htm">Configuring the SERVICES File</A> for more information about the SERVICES file.<P></DD>

<P>The
following examples illustrate how to start the spawner program and how to
connect to it.
<P>Example 1:
<P>The following OS/390 command starts the spawner program at the remote
OS/390 host with the <B>service-name</B> 


<CODE><B>spawner</B></CODE> and allows clear-text sign ons from local hosts that use a
script.



<PRE>START SPAWNER</PRE>
<P>It uses the following PARMS file:



<PRE>-service spawner
-cleartext</PRE>
<P>At an OS/390 local host, the following statements specify a script file
named 


<CODE><B>tcpmvs.scr</B></CODE> that makes a connection to the spawner
program on the system RMTHOST, which is listening on the port that is named 


<CODE><B>spawner</B></CODE>. The value for REMOTE=
 is the name of the OS/390 node, or it can be a macro variable that contains
the Internet address of the OS/390 node where the spawner program is running.
 



<PRE>options comamid=tcp;
filename rlink '<I>!sasroot</I>\connect\saslink\tcpmvs.scr';
signon rmthost.spawner;</PRE>
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not use the return key to break the line that specifies the
filename; continue typing the statement on a single line.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"><BR>
<P>Example 2:
<P>The following OS/390 command starts the spawner program at the remote
OS/390 host.



<PRE>START SPAWNER</PRE>
<P>It uses the following configuration file:
<PRE>-service spawner
-inheritance
-noscript
-netencralg rc2
-netencralg des
-sascmd "SAS OPT('DMR,COMAMID=TCP,NOTERMINAL')"</PRE>
<P>At an OS/390  local host, the TCP/IP access method is used to connect
to the remote host named RMTHOST, which must be either the node name of the
OS/390 node or a macro variable that contains the Internet address of the
OS/390 node where the spawner program is running.  The USER= option in the
SIGNON statement prompts the user for a userid and password when connecting
to RMTHOST on which the OS/390 spawner program named 


<CODE><B>spawner</B></CODE> runs.



<PRE>options comamid=tcp;
signon rmthost.spawner user=_prompt_ ;</PRE>
