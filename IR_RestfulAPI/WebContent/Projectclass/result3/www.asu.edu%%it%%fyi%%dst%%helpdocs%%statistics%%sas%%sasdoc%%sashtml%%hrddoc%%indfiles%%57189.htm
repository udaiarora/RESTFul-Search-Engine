Communications Access Methods for SAS/CONNECT and SAS/SHARE Software, Version 8
</H1><P>
Integral to client-server computing with SAS/CONNECT and SAS/SHARE         software is the ability to make a connection from one host platform to
another using a communications access method. This title provides you      with the explicit steps needed for connecting two platforms, allowing
you to access and manipulate data as desired. The easy-to-follow           procedures are arranged by platform, access method, product, platform
orientation (local host, remote host, client, server), and type of         user.  The different communications access methods discussed include
TCP/IP, APPC, DECnet, and more. This title is written for applications     developers, system administrators, network administrators and
end-users who use SAS/CONNECT and SAS/SHARE software.
