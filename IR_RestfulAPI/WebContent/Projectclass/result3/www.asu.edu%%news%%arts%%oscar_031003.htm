      <h2>      ASU theater professors reveal Academy Award predictions</h2>
      <p>        <img src="arts_images/oscar_031003.jpg" width="252" height="175" align="right">As Hollywood prepares for its biggest night - the 75th Annual
        Academy Awards on March 23, ASU theater professors Ron Newcomer and Gus
        Edwards
          are comparing notes and sharing their predictions on this year's Oscar-nominated
        films.</p>
      <p>Newcomer, who has been with the ASU theater department for more
          than five years, says this year's ceremony promises to be an exciting
          one.</p>
      <p>"The
          Oscars usually try to look seriously at a work of art when it comes
        to films," he says. "Some years they don't find any. This year, they
          have found quite a few that have done a good job in trying to tell
        a different kind of story."<br>
        Edwards, professor of film studies and multicultural theater, agrees
          and says one film has created a big buzz among movie buffs.</p>
      <p>"A real wild
          card this year is 'Chicago,'" Edward says. "Who would have thought
        that a musical, something that comes out of left field, with
          so much pizazz, would receive so many nominations. If a film seems
        to have a little bit of an edge on the others, I suspect it's 'Chicago.'" </p>
      <p>Along with 'Chicago,' this year's nominees for Best Picture are "Gangs
          of New York," "The Hours," "The Lord of the Rings: the Twin Towers"
        and "The Pianist."<br>
        Newcomer and Edwards say "Chicago" should receive the Oscar this year.</p>
      <p>"I
          frankly have not enjoyed going to a movie that much in a long, long
        time," Newcomer says. "It was just a very happy surprise. It was very
          uplifting."</p>
      <p>"He (Director Rob Marshall ) reinvents the musical," Edwards
          says. "'Chicago' is very deserving of it."</p>
      <p>However, Newcomer says there may be two other
          films that may get some attention from the academy.</p>
      <p>"I have a gut reaction that maybe the 'Twin
          Towers' will win," Newcomer says. "I thought it was an extremely well
          done film. It was better than
          the first in many ways, even though it would not exist on its own without
          the first film. The only one I don't want to win is 'Gangs of New York.'
          I just think it was bad film. Marty (Scorsese) may get his Oscar for
          best directing, but he's done better work in the past."</p>
      <p>This year's nominees
          for Best Actor in a Leading Role are Adrien Brody ("The Pianist");
        Nicolas Cage ("Adaptation"); Michael Caine ("The Quiet
          American"); Daniel Day-Lewis ("Gangs of New York") and Jack Nicholson
          ("About Schmidt").<br>
        Newcomer and Edwards feel the academy will select a Hollywood favorite
          as this year's winner.</p>
      <p>"I suspect Jack Nicholson is going to do it again,"
          Edwards says. "There's no denying it, he was great in 'About Schmidt.'"</p>
      <p>"I also think it's going
          to happen." Newcomer says. "Of course if it does, he'll tie the record
          with Katharine Hepburn for the most Oscars
          (four). Nicholson is a working legend in every sense of the word."</p>
      <p>This
        year's nominees for Best Actress in a Leading Role are Salma Hayek ("Frida");
        Nicole Kidman ("The Hours"); Diane Lane ("Unfaithful"); Julianne
        Moore ("Far From Heaven"); and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger ("Chicago").</p>
      <p>Edwards
          says he made a prediction to his theater class right after he saw the
          film.<br>
        "I say Julianne Moore," he says. "She did not miss one beat of that
          character - the emotion and her ability to convince you that she is
          that character." </p>
      <p>"I don't disagree," Newcomer says. "She deserves it. I think Ren&eacute;e
        was wonderful in 'Chicago,' but she is one of those actresses that almost
        made it look too easy. I am also glad to see that Diane Lane was nominated.
        I don't think many people saw her film, but she is definitely worthy
        of a nomination."</p>
      <p>ASU students who are aspiring to create a film, possibly
          worthy of winning an Oscar, may consider the advice of Newcomer and
        Edwards - "Be creative
          and tell a good story."</p>
      <p>"The students probably have more opportunities
          to get in the business now, and they have less chance of staying there
          once they get in," Newcomer
          says. "It's probably the most exciting business in the world, but it's
          right up there with the oil business - it's international. It takes
        both sides of the brain to be successful in this business."</p>
      <p>"You definitely
          have to tell a good story," Edwards says. "Without a story, you don't
          have anything."</p>
      <p>The 75th Annual Academy Awards will be
          broadcast on March 23 on ABC (Channel 15). For the broadcast time and
