<I>Joyfull Newes</I> is significant because it contains some of the earliest accounts of the botany of the New World. Monardes, who was born in Spain, praises the Spanish explorers for bringing back herbs and plants from the New World. To quote from his work: "As there is discovered newe regions, newe kyngdomes and newe Provinces, by our spanyardes, thei have brought unto us newe Medicines and newe Remedies."  John Frampton, the translator, has given us a memorable description of the sunflower, which he refers to as an "Hearbe of the Sunne. . .a straunge flower, for it casteth out the greatest flowers, and the most perticulars that ever hath been seen, for it is greater than a greate Platter or Dishe, the whiche hath divers coulers. . .it showeth marveilous faire in Gardines."
  Included among the New World plants is perhaps the earliest description and illustration of the tobacco plant.
