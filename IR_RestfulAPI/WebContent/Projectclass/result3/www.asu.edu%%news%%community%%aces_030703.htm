      <h2>ACES celebrates decade of impact</h2>
      <p>        From the shoestring efforts of a few dozen ASU students and faculty 10
          years ago, a small inner-city tutoring project has grown into a vital
        community partnership that has touched thousands of lives.</p>
      <p>About 650
            ASU students each year now tutor reading, math and science to more
            than 1,500 children in some of the most impoverished areas of
          the Valley, also teaching literacy skills to their parents. They plant
          gardens, devise experiments, teach computer skills and mentor the youngsters,
          who bloom under their attention.<br>
        Academic Community Engagement Services (ACES), known for many years
          as the ASU Service Learning Program, will celebrate a decade of successful
          partnering with the community with a reception 2:30 - 4:30 p.m., March
          13, in the Old Main ballroom. ACES will honor many of its longtime
          partners,
          including the Roosevelt School District and Salvation Army.</p>
      <p>"It's had
          a huge impact on our district," says Mark Dowling, assistant superintendent
          of the Roosevelt District. "We've seen test scores increase
          as a result of what ASU students have done with our children. Their
        behavior has also improved significantly, and disruptions in the classroom
        have
          gone down. Having mentor relationships has helped steer the children
          in more positive directions."</p>
      <p>Sixth graders at Sunland School who come
          in for tutoring three times a week have increased their reading scores
          75 percent and math scores
          150 percent on standardized tests, says Gay Brack, ACES founding director.
          They also learn science as they plant a garden, and get to take home
          a 35-pound box of food from the United Food Bank at the end of each
        week.</p>
      <p>Many
          schools in the district have a 50 percent turnover rate, as parents
        move from job to job or children are placed in a series of ever-changing
          foster homes. The children see gang violence and drug transactions
        in
          their neighborhoods, and in some areas gunshots ring out every night. </p>
      <p>"We have wonderful ASU students who are doing the impossible, working
          with children who have short attention spans because of parental crack
          use or fetal alcohol syndrome," Brack says. "They work with these kids,
          discover what their interests are, then go to the Tempe library to
        get books that meet their interests. They love these kids. I've never
        seen
          more committed students."</p>
      <p>The ASU students' work is tied to the classroom,
          so they apply their learning and use their experiences as a basis for
          research papers, compositions
          and lesson plans. Many have gone on to become teachers in the inner
        city. Others say it's been a life-changing experience.</p>
      <p>"This has opened my eyes
          to a world I had never seen," says one psychology major. "Though I
        went into the classroom to teach sixth graders about
          geography, the students and the school were a better educator to me
        than I was to them. My experiences there were unforgettable and are among
          the best in my years at ASU."</p>
      <p>With support from the ASU English department,
          Brack designed the program in the fall of 1992, after her son, a Phoenix
          police detective, told
          her the kinds of problems he saw as he worked with children. The Salvation
          Army provided a site where 50 tutors could work with 100 children,
        and funding for a couple of graduate students to supervise them. The
        English
          department linked special sections of composition to internships.</p>
      <p>From
          that tiny beginning, the program has spread its outreach to encompass
          34 programs at 16 different sites, including adult GED preparation
        and literacy classes for the children's parents. More than 4,000 ASU
        students
          have given over 600,000 hours of service. Community contributions have
          totaled more than $3 million, providing transportation, supplies and
          a computer laboratory for the community.</p>
      <p>Working all over the Valley,
          from Tempe to Phoenix to the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian community,
          ASU students have formed science clubs,
          taught creative writing, read stories, helped with homework and taught
          Web page design.</p>
      <p>"They will never, ever understand the lives they've touched,"
          says Sandi Gabel of the Salvation Army.</p>
      <p>"It's been a tremendous, wonderful thing,"
          says Ruben Duran, principal of J.F. Kennedy Elementary School. "It
        would be hard to estimate the
          value of this partnership with ASU, for the children, the parents and
        the teachers." </p>
