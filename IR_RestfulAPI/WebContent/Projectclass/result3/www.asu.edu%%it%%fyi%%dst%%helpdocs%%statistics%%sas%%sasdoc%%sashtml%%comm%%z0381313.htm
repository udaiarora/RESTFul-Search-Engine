<P>Until the configuration is properly specified,
it can be difficult to establish communications within the SNA network, especially
for a host subarea peripheral node. SAS/CONNECT and SAS/SHARE software passes
error handling information to you to help you debug your configuration. This
information includes operation codes, return codes, and sense data relating
to the function that the software is performing. Although SAS/SHARE does not
interpret the information, you can use the information to work with network
systems and SAS support personnel at your site to resolve any problems.
<P>Error reports for the APPC access method include the failing verb operation
code (


<CODE><B>opcode</B></CODE>), the primary return code
(


<CODE><B>prc</B></CODE>), and the secondary return code (


<CODE><B>src</B></CODE>), and, in some cases, sense data.  These
codes and data are documented in the <B>Microsoft SNA Server APPC Programmer's
Guide</B>.  



<PRE>APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASRMT 
opcode = 1400  prc = F004  src = 010000F0.</PRE>
<P>A TP_STARTED verb has failed because the server's communication subsystem
is not loaded.  Make sure that the server has been started along with its
configured connections.  



<PRE>APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASRMT 
opcode = 0100  prc = 0001  src = 0000015B.</PRE>
<P>An ALLOCATE verb has failed because a value specified for a partner
LU_ALIAS was invalid or undefined.  Make sure that you have specified a valid
partner LU_alias in the REMOTE= option or the SERVER= option in the remote
LIBNAME or PROC OPERATE statement, as appropriate.  



<PRE>APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASRMT 
opcode = 1400  prc = 0001  src = 00000003.</PRE>
<P>The TP_START verb failed because the value that was specified for LU_ALIAS
is invalid or undefined. Make sure that you specified a valid local LU_ALIAS
in the APPC_LUNAME environment variable.  



<PRE>APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASRMT 
opcode = 0100  prc = 0003  src = 08570003.</PRE>
<P>An ALLOCATE verb has failed because the remote communications partner
is not active.  For example, the remote application does not have an active
control session with VTAM (host APPL/ACB is not OPEN).  In this case, the
Microsoft secondary return code is replaced by sense data for a more problematic
description. The reported sense data is 08570003.  



<PRE>APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASRMT 
opcode = 0B00  prc = 0003  src = 080F6051.</PRE>
<P>A RECEIVE_AND_WAIT verb has failed because the userid or the password
that was specified in the allocation request was not accepted by the partner
LU.  Make sure that you have specified the correct userid and password in
the APPC_SECURE environment variable.  



<PRE>APPC communication failure: 
transaction program = SASRMT 
opcode = 0100  prc = 0003  src = 57080300.</PRE>
<P>An ALLOCATE verb has failed because the remote communications partner
is not active. For example, the remote application does not have an active
control session with VTAM (host APPL/ACB is not OPEN). In this case, the secondary
return code is replaced by sense data for a more problematic description.
The reported sense data is 57080300.
