<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Law Enforcement Authority</b>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Arizona Board of Regents and the president of ASU are empowered
to organize, provide for, and operate a police department for ASU. [<a href="http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/1/00215.htm">ARS
1-215</a>]
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ASU Police Officers are State certified, and have the same powers as
any Police Officer in the State of Arizona. All Police Officers in the
State of Arizona, including ASU Police Officers, have the authority to
enforce state and federal laws within limits imposed by the state and federal
constitutions and judicial rulings.
  <br>
  &nbsp;
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Law Enforcement Jurisdiction</b>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ASU Police Department is responsible for and has agency
jurisdiction for law enforcement matters occurring on property that is
under the control of the Arizona Board of Regents at several ASU campus locations, including Tempe, Poly and West. The ASU Police Department has primary jurisdictional responsibility
for property within the ASU core boundaries located in the
City of Tempe and for ASU properties outside the core boundaries. Through
mutual aid agreements with the City of Tempe, and because city streets
run through or are contiguous with ASU properties, officers of the ASU
Police Department give the appropriate secondary attention to traffic control
and enforcement on those streets.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The authority of Officers of the ASU Police Department may extend to
any place within the state under State law.
