<H2>Printed Output  </H2>
<P>The output from PROC LOAN consists of the loan summary table, loan
amortization schedule, and loan comparison report.
<P><H3><I>Loan Summary Table</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxloa0113">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxloa0112">&#13;</A>The loan summary table shows the total payment and interest, the initial
nominal annual and effective interest rates, payment and compounding
intervals, the length of the loan in the time units  specified,
the start and end dates (if specified), a list of nominal and
effective interest rates, and periodic payments throughout the life of the
loan.
<P>A list of balloon payments for balloon payment loans and a list
of prepayments (if specified) are printed with their respective
periods (or dates).
<P>The loan summary table is printed for each loan by default.
The NOSUMMARYPRINT option specified in the PROC LOAN
statement will suppress the printing of the loan summary table for all loans.
The NOSUMMARYPRINT option can be specified in individual loan statements
to selectively suppress the printing of the loan summary table.
<P><H3><I>Loan Repayment Schedule</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxloa0115">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxloa0114">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxloa0117">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxloa0116">&#13;</A>The amortization schedule contains for each payment period
the year and period within the year (or date, if you specified the START= option),
principal balance at the beginning of the period,
total payment, interest payment and principal payment for the period,
and the principal balance at the end of the period. If you specified the SCHEDULE=YEARLY
option, the amortization will contain a summary for each
year instead of for each payment period.
<P>The amortization schedule is not printed by default.
The SCHEDULE option in the PROC LOAN statement requests the
printing of amortization tables for all loans.  You can specify the SCHEDULE option
in individual loan statements to selectively request
the printing of the amortization schedule.
<P><H3><I>Loan Comparison Report</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxloa0119">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxloa0118">&#13;</A>The loan comparison report is processed for each report period and
contains the results of economic analysis of the loans.  The quantities
reported can include the outstanding principal balance, after-tax or
before-tax present worth of cost and true interest rate, periodic payment,
and the interest paid through the report period for each loan.  The best
alternative is identified if the asset value (down payment plus loan
amount) is the same for each alternative.
<P>The loan comparison report is printed by default. The NOCOMPRINT option
specified in the COMPARE statement suppresses the printing of the
loan comparison report.
