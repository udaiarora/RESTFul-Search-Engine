      <P><STRONG>Background</STRONG><BR>

The Government Relations Office is the lobbying arm of the Board of Supervisors, and experiences a tremendous increase in workload during the period that the Legislature is in session.  In recent years, sessions have typically lasted for about 100 days.<BR> 
<BR>
Government Relations is responsible for keeping Board members, County management, and departmental staff apprised of legislative developments affecting any aspect of County operations or responsibilities.  This is accomplished by an initial review of all legislative bills introduced, separating out those that appear to affect the County in some way, assigning those bills to Government Relations analysts, and sending those bills out to the affected County departments for more intensive review and comment.  Departmental responses must then be received, assessed, and acted upon at the Legislature, if necessary.<BR>
<BR>
The mechanics of this process are as follows: <BR>
<BR>
Government Relations receives, on a daily basis, all bills introduced during the session.  An original plus five copies are received.  These are sorted, reviewed, assigned, and distributed to the appropriate County departments electronically through our legislative tracking system.  There are, on average, anywhere from 900 to 1200 bills introduced and forwarded to this Office.  After the initial flood of original bills introduced, all amendments to bills must also be received, reviewed, and distributed, as applicable.<BR>
<BR>
Departments' intergovernmental representatives are asked to review the legislation and respond to the Government Relations office.  As County departments send back responses regarding particular bills to Government Relations, responses are reviewed and summarized.  It may be the case that no action is necessary on a bill, that the status of a bill should continue to be closely monitored but no action is necessary at this time, or that a position of immediate support or opposition regarding a bill should be taken.<BR>
<BR>
During this process, bills are individually tracked electronically-- an original is filed in a central repository in Government Relations, the departments to which copies are sent are catalogued, the analyst to which it is assigned is noted, and whether a departmental response is received, and when, is noted. Departmental responses, as they come in, are assessed.<BR>
<BR>
