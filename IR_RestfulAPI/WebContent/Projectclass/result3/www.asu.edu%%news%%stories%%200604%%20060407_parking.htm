<h1 class="storyhead">ASU focuses on parking system improvements </h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p>With a 5 percent increase in enrollment, ASU's Tempe campus is the largest single university campus in the country. </p>
<p>Planned development of new high-density condominium towers near University Drive and Mill Avenue will add to the mounting traffic congestion on and around the Tempe campus. </p>
<p>Tempe campus parking is expensive to maintain, but the parking rates are priced below the cost to maintain existing facilities, let alone build new facilities. </p>
<p>As ASU advances academically and continues to build additional residence halls and research facilities, the campus will experience a reduction in parking availability, rather than an increase. </p>
<p>For these and other reasons, a university task force developed recommendations to address parking and public transit concerns on the Tempe campus. The task force, which consisted of student, staff and faculty representation, evaluated several parking and transportation issues, including: </p>
<p>. The increase in traffic congestion in and around campus. </p>
<p>. A need for improved public transit services. </p>
<p>. Added convenience for individuals who need to commute to campus. </p>
<p>"As ASU continues to flourish with its student body and academic capabilities, we must create sustainable programs for university operations to maintain a high level of functionality," says Carol Campbell, ASU's chief financial officer. "This includes finding realistic solutions for the university's transportation concerns." </p>
<p>The task force sought external consultation from a top research firm that specializes in transportation initiatives. The firm helped the task force organize focus groups, review best practices at other institutions and analyze positive impact studies before making recommendations. </p>
<p>Additionally, the task force considered the funding needed to address parking concerns. As a self-funded department at ASU, Parking and Transit Services (PTS) uses revenue from parking decal sales to maintain existing facilities, services and operations, as well as build new facilities. Current rates do not provide adequate funds to address existing and projected needs. </p>
<p>The task force compared ASU's parking systems and rates with other Pac-10 universities, peer institutions and privately owned garages in Phoenix. The analysis revealed that ASU's parking rates are 41 percent lower than comparable universities and private garages. </p>
<p>PTS needs increased funding to develop new projects that will alleviate the parking crunch on the Tempe campus. Development of parking structures along the light rail route in Tempe and near the University Services Building (USB) would cost about $14,000 per parking space to build. Increasing the frequency of shuttle service between Tempe, Polytechnic and West campuses would cost $1 million more per year. </p>
<p>Armed with that information, the task force concluded that parking rates must be increased to meet the needs of this growing campus and provide improved public transit services. Parking rates will be designed to balance convenience and demand with price by establishing a tiered pricing scale, with the highest rates applied to the most convenient parking spaces on campus. Low-cost options are available, including Lot 59E and a future remote parking site. New parking decal rates for the 2006 - 2007 academic year will range from $150 - $540 at the Tempe campus. To view Tempe campus parking rates, visit the Web site (<a href="http://www.asu.edu/pts">www.asu.edu/pts</a>). </p>
<p>For those who park at one or more of ASU's campuses, reciprocity between the campuses will be provided in designated parking lots that meet the lowest parking decal rate. </p>
<p>Over the next few years, revenue generated from parking decal sales will be reinvested to enhance integration with mass transit and improve existing parking areas. Through collaborative efforts with ASU police and other departments, existing parking facilities will receive upgrades such as better lighting, brightened parking structures, and improved security technology. </p>
<p>While an estimated 35,000 vehicles travel to the Tempe campus daily, just 19,600 parking spaces accommodate this traffic volume, and university expansion plans call for a 25 percent reduction of parking availability over the next five years. The task force recognized the need to establish long-term solutions to decrease the community's reliance on vehicles and recommended the creation of sustainable programs that promote alternative means of transportation. The new programs and service enhancements approved for implementation include: </p>
<p>. ASU U-Pass: Continue offering ASU students and staff access to a free Valley Metro bus pass. </p>
<p>. METRO Light Rail: Negotiate reduced rates or a free pass for ASU students and staff to encourage use of alternative transportation to/from campus on light rail. </p>
<p>. Park-and-ride locations: Build park-and-ride lots near key light rail boarding stations to foster travel on the METRO, which is scheduled to open in December 2008. </p>
<p>. ASU matching carpool service: Provide a carpool ride-matching service online that is solely dedicated to the ASU community. Students and staff can locate others who are looking to carpool to work or class and split the cost of a decal for the two vehicles. </p>
<p>ASU is a diverse community, and the task force developed solutions that also address concerns of commuters and students living in residence halls. For those who need to commute to campus by vehicle, the task force provided recommendations for reducing the travel time to an individual's final destination on campus. These suggestions also benefit students who live on campus and rely on FLASH service for travel on and around campus. They include: </p>
<p>. Expand FLASH service by increasing shuttle rotations on and around campus. </p>
<p>. Establish a dedicated shuttle service for McAllister, allowing better traffic flow between Lot 59 and the south end of McAllister. </p>
<p>. Extend FLASH hours of operation. </p>
<p>Current ASU parking assignments may be renewed using online services between April 10 - 21. For more information, visit the Web site (<a href="http://www.asu.edu/pts">www.asu.edu/pts</a>).
