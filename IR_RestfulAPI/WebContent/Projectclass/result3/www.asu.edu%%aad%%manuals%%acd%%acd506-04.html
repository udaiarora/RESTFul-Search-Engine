An individual&#146;s tenure at Arizona State University is located at Tempe campus, West campus, or Polytechnic campus. Tenure is not transferable among the three campuses, except as provided through university policy and procedure.<p><a href="acd002.html#appointments" target="New">Appointments</a> with <a href="acd002.html#tenure" target="New">tenure</a> are those with continuous annual reappointment until retirement, resignation, release for budgetary reasons, release for reasons of educational policy change, or dismissal for cause, each as provided in the university&#146;s and the Board of Regents&#146; policies. Attainment of tenure can only occur through specific notification from the <a href="acd002.html#president" target="New">president</a> and may not result from inaction or inadvertence.<p>Faculty members are granted tenure because they have demonstrated excellence in scholarship and/or creative activity, instructional contributions, and service.  This excellence is achieved in the context of the program in which faculty members work.  It is understood that units will have different criteria for achieving tenure that depend upon the unit&#146;s mission, stature, and goals.<p>The rapidly changing character of research and its methodologies make it impossible for a university, even one of considerable size, scope, and resources, to have tenured faculty in every discipline.  Therefore, appointments to tenure are offered to only those scholars whose disciplinary contributions are deemed excellent and whose ability to contribute to university priorities is also highly developed.<p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>See&#58;<p><ol><li><a href="acd505-02.html">ACD 505&#150;02</a>, &#147;Faculty Membership, Ranks, Titles, Appointment Categories, and Honored Positions&#148;<p>and</li><p><li><a href="acd506-02.html">ACD 506&#150;02</a>, &#147;Key Terms.&#148;</li></ol><p>&#160;<p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
