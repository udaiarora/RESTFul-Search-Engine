A receiver (<a href="advantageinfo.html">RC Document</a>) is to be entered online.<p>If an invoice is received by Accounts Payable and the ordering department does not enter a receiver within 10 days, a <a href="purforms.html">Receiving Report Request form</a> will be generated.<p>If an ordering department stipulates that it will pay invoices only for a complete shipment, the <a href="pur004.html#Purchase Request">purchase request</a> (or RX) must show such a stipulation so that it is made a part of the bid <a href="pur004.html#Specifications">specification</a> or the contract terms and conditions.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Payment for Partial Shipments</b></font><p>Partial shipments generally require partial payment of the order.  The ordering department should promptly input an online receiver (RC document) and indicate that the shipment is partial.<p>Departments must input an RC within two working days of receipt of any merchandise.  If there is a discrepancy in items received, both Purchasing and Accounts Payable are to be notified immediately.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Online Reporting</b></font><p>Departments may view the invoice on the OVIH and OVIL tables.  If the items have been received, such departments should enter a receiver document (RC) online.<p>&#160;<font color="FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">PUR</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | PUR&#160;manual&#160;<a href="pur001.html">contact</a> | Purchasing&#160;and&#160;Business&#160;Services&#160;Web&#160;<a href="purchasing.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
