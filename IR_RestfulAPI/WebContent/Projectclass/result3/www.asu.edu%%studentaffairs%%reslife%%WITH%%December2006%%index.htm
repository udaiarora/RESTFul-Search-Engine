								<p class="style19"><img src="images/GrandPrizePhoto.jpg" width="109" height="82" align="left">On Thursday, Nov. 30 the grand prize winner of the Spirit Contest was announced. Palo Verde East was the GRAND PRIZE WINNER of the $25,000 cash award to use for hall improvements. This fall, each residence hall was given the challenge to work together and show their ASU spirit through a variety of hall programs and initiatives. The new School Spirit hall decorating contest took place each week before the home football game. A panel of staff and students judged each hall and calculated the points each week. Every home game the best decorated hall received $5,000 to be used for hall improvements. The first four contest winners were Cholla hall (September 30), Sonora hall (October 21), Hassayampa Academic Village (November 9) and Palo Verde East. Points were cumulative, and at the conclusion of the season, the hall with the most points overall will win $25,000 to use to improve its community. Congratulations PV East!!!<br>

                                <p align="left" class="style19"> Along with anticipation of winter break, sleeping late, and no homework, students may be approaching their extended visit home with both feelings of excitement and anxiety. Most students look forward to &ldquo;going home&rdquo; to relax, enjoy home cooking, visit with old friends, and share time with family. </p>
                                <p align="left" class="style19">However, for some students, the visit home may be stir up mixed feelings. Being away from home has meant living with more freedom and less parental involvement. Some families see their sons and daughters as the same in November as when they left them at school in August. Thus, your family may have difficulty accepting your new pattern of coming and going, established at school, and may expect you to adhere to family routine. </p>
                                <p align="left" class="style19">Your new independence as an adult may not be fully understood at home. Conflict may result when you describe how your attitudes or way of thinking has changed in a number of areas&mdash;through new experiences and your studies. Your family&rsquo;s response to how you have changed could lead to feelings of frustration and emotional distance from your family. </p>
