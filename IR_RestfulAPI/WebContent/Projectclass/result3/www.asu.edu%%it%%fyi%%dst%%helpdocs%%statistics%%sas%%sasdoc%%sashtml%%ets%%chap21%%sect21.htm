<P><H3><I>Additional steps when using the X-11-ARIMA method</I></H3>
The X-11-ARIMA method consists of extending a
given series by an ARIMA model and applying
the usual X-11 seasonal adjustment method
to this extended series. Thus in the simplest
case in which there are no prior factors or calendar
effects in the series, the ARIMA model selection,
estimation and forecasting is first performed,
and the resulting extended series goes through
the standard X-11 steps described below.
<P>If prior factor or calendar effects
are present, they must be eliminated from the
series before the ARIMA estimation is done
because these effects are not stochastic.
<P>Prior factors, if present, are removed first.
Calendar effects represented by prior daily weights
are then removed. If there are no further
calendar effects, the adjusted series is
extended by the ARIMA model, and this extended
series goes through the standard X-11 steps
without repeating the removal of prior factors and
calendar effects from prior daily weights.
<P>If further calendar effects are present, a
trading-day regression must be performed.
In this case it is necessary to go
through an initial pass of the X-11 steps
to obtain a final trading-day adjustment.
In this initial pass, the series,
adjusted for prior factors and prior
daily weights, goes through
the standard X-11 steps.
At the conclusion of these
steps, a final series adjusted for prior factors
and all calendar effects is available.
This adjusted series is then extended
by the ARIMA model, and this extended
series goes through the standard X-11
steps again, without repeating the removal
of prior factors and calendar effects
from prior daily weights and trading
day regression.
<P><H3><I>The Standard X-11 Seasonal Adjustment Method</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxx110107">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxx110106">&#13;</A>The following steps comprise the standard X-11
seasonal adjustment method. These steps are applied to
the original data or the original data extended by
an ARIMA model.
<P><OL>
<LI> In step 1, the data are read, ignoring missing values 
until the first nonmissing
value is found. If prior monthly factors are present,
the procedure reads prior monthly <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>P</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>
factors and divides them into the original series to
obtain <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>O</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB>/<I>P</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB> =<I>C</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB><I>S</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB><I>I</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB><I>D</I><SUB><I>tr</I>,<I>t</I></SUB><I>D</I><SUB><I>r</I>,<I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>.
<P>Seven daily weights can be specified to develop
monthly factors to adjust the series for
trading-day variation, <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>D</I><SUB><I>tr</I>,<I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>; these
factors are then divided into the original or prior adjusted
series to obtain
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>C</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB><I>S</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB><I>I</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB><I>D</I><SUB><I>r</I>,<I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>.
<LI> In steps 2, 3, and 4,
three iterations are performed, each of which provides
estimates of the seasonal <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>, trading-day <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>D</I><SUB><I>r</I>,<I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>,
trend cycle <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>C</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>, and irregular components <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>I</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>.
Each iteration refines estimates of the extreme values
in the irregular components.
After extreme values are identified and modified,
final estimates of the seasonal component, seasonally
adjusted series, trend cycle, and irregular components
are produced.
Step 2 consists of three substeps:
<OL>
<LI> During the first iteration, a centered, 12-term 
moving average is applied to the original series <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>O</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>
to provide a preliminary estimate <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/x11eq3.gif"
 ALT="{\hat{C}_{t}}"> of
the trend cycle curve <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>C</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>. This moving average
combines 13 (a 2 term moving average of a 12-term 
moving average)  consecutive monthly values, removing the
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>S</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>I</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>.
Next, it obtains a preliminary estimate

<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="76" HEIGHT="98"
 SRC="images/x11eq5.gif"
 ALT="\hat{S_{t}I_{t}} = \frac{O_{t}}{\hat{C}_{t}}"></DL>
<LI> A moving average is then applied to the
<IMG WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/x11eq4.gif"
 ALT="{\hat{S_{t}I_{t}}}">to obtain an estimate <IMG WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 ALT="{\hat{S}_{t}}">of the seasonal factors.
<IMG WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/x11eq4.gif"
 ALT="{\hat{S_{t}I_{t}}}"> is then divided
by this estimate to obtain an estimate
<IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/x11eq7.gif"
 ALT="{\hat{I}_{t}}"> of the irregular component.
Next, a moving standard deviation is calculated
from the irregular component and is used in assigning
a weight to each monthly value for measuring
its degree of extremeness.
These weights are used to modify extreme values in
<IMG WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/x11eq4.gif"
 ALT="{\hat{S_{t}I_{t}}}">.New seasonal factors are estimated by applying
a moving average to the modified value of
<IMG WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/x11eq4.gif"
 ALT="{\hat{S_{t}I_{t}}}">.A preliminary seasonally adjusted series
is obtained by dividing the original series
by these new seasonal factors.
A second estimate of the trend cycle is obtained
by applying a weighted moving average to this
seasonally adjusted series.
<LI> The same process is used to obtain
second estimates of the seasonally
adjusted series and improved estimates
of the irregular component. This irregular
component is again modified for extreme values
and then used to provide estimates of trading-day
factors and refined weights for the identification
of extreme values.
</OL>
<LI> Using the same computations, a second iteration is
performed on the original series that has been
adjusted by the trading-day factors and irregular
weights developed in the first iteration.
The second iteration produces final estimates of
the trading-day factors and irregular weights.
<LI> A third and final iteration is performed using
the original series that has been adjusted for
trading-day factors and irregular weights
computed during the second iteration.
During the third iteration, PROC X11 develops
final estimates of seasonal factors,
the seasonally adjusted series,
the trend cycle, and the irregular components.
The procedure computes summary measures of
variation and produces a moving average of
the final adjusted series.

<P><H3><I>Sliding Spans Analysis</I></H3>
<A NAME="idxx110108">&#13;</A>The motivation for sliding spans analysis is to answer
the question &#34;When is a economic series unsuitable for
seasonal adjustment ?&#34;. There are a number of past
attempts to answer this question: stable seasonality
F-test; moving seasonality F-test, Q-statistics and
others.
<P>Sliding spans analysis attempts to quantify the stability 
of the seasonal adjustment process, and hence quantify the 
suitability of seasonal adjustment for a given series.
<P>It is based on a very simple idea: for a stable series,
deleting a small number of observations should not result
in greatly different component estimates compared with
the original, full series. 
Conversely, if deleting a small 
number of observations results in drastically different 
estimates, the series is unstable. For example,
a drastic difference in the seasonal factors (Table D10)
might result from a dominating irregular component, or sudden 
changes in the seasonally component. When the seasonal component
estimates of a series is unstable in this manner, they have little
meaning and the series is likely to be unsuitable for seasonal 
adjustment.
<P>Sliding spans analysis, developed at the Statistical Research 
Division of the U.S. Census Bureau (see Findley, et al., 1990, and
Findley and Monsell, 1986 ), performs a repeated seasonal 
adjustment on subsets or spans of the full series. In particular, an
initial span of the data, typically eight years in length,
is seasonally adjusted, and the tables C18, the trading day
factors (if trading day regression performed), D10, the
seasonal factors, and D11, the seasonally adjusted series
are retained for further processing. Next, one year of data
is deleted from the beginning of the initial span and one
year of data is added. This new span is seasonally adjusted
as before, with the same tables retained. This process continues
until the end of the data is reached. The beginning and ending
dates of the spans are such that the last observation in the
original data is also the last observation in the last span.
This is discussed in more detail below.
<P>The following notation for the components or differences
computed in the sliding spans analysis follows Findley 
et al., 1990. The meaning for the symbol X<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>(k)
is component X in month (or quarter) t, computed from
data in the k-th span. These components are now defined.
<P>Seasonal Factors (Table D10): S<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>(k)
<P>Trading Day Factor (Table C18): TD<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>(k)
<P>Seasonally Adjust Data (Table D11): SA<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>(k)
<P>Month-to-month changes in the Seasonally Adjust Data: MM<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>(k)
<P>Year-to-Year changes in the Seasonally Adjust Data: YY<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>(k)
<P>The key measure is the maximum percent difference across spans. 
For example, consider a series beginning in JAN72, 
ending in DEC84, and having
four spans, each of length 8 years (see Figure 1. in
Findley et al., 1990, page 346). Consider S<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>(k)
the seasonal factor (table D10) for month t for span k,
and let N<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN> denote the number of spans containing
month t, i.e.,
<P>
<DL CLASS="equation"><DD>
<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><I>N</I><sub><I>t</I></sub> = {<I>k</I>: &#160;<I>span</I> &#160;<I>k</I> &#160;<I>contains</I> &#160;<I>month</I> &#160;<I>t</I> }</SPAN>
</DL>
<P>In the middle years of the series there is overlap
of all four spans and N<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN> will be 4. The last
year of the series will have but one span, while the beginning
can have 1 or 0 spans depending on the original length.
<P>Since we are interested in how much the seasonal factors
vary for a given month across the spans, a natural quantity
to consider is
<P>
<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="234" HEIGHT="74"
 SRC="images/x11eq8.gif"
 ALT="max_{k{\epsilon}N_{t}}S_{t}(k) - min_{k{\epsilon}N_{t}}S_{t}(k)"></DL>
<P>In the case of the multiplicative model, it is useful to compute
a percent difference; define the maximum percent difference (MPD)
at time t as
<P>
<DL CLASS="equation"><DD><IMG WIDTH="317" HEIGHT="99"
 SRC="images/x11eq9.gif"
 ALT="MPD_{t} = \frac{max_{k{\epsilon}N_{t}}S_{t}(k) - 
 min_{k{\epsilon}N_{t}}S_{t}(k)}{min_{k{\epsilon}N_{t}}S_{t}(k) }"></DL>
<P>The seasonal factor for month t is then unreliable if MPD<SPAN CLASS="mathfont"><SUB><I>t</I></SUB></SPAN>
is large. While no exact significance level can be computed
for this statistic, empirical levels have been established
by considering over 500 economic series (see Findley, et al. 1990
and Findley and Monsell, 1986). For these series it was found that
for four spans, stable series typically had less than 15% of the 
MPD values exceeding 3.0%, while in marginally stable series, 
between 15% and 25% of the MPD values exceeded 3.0%.
A series in which 25% or more of the MPD values exceeded
3.0% is almost always unstable.
<P>While these empirical values cannot be considered
an exact significance level, they provide a useful empirical basis for
deciding if a series is suitable for seasonal adjustment.
These percentage values are shifted down when less than 
four spans are used.
