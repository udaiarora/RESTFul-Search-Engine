To pick         just one example at the local level, ASU should take the lead in addressing         problems in our K-12 educational system. Beginning here in Phoenix, ASU         needs to find out what our local communities need, and ASU should be structured         to meet those needs. </p>      <p> But there is a much broader social obligation that must be met. As members         of an academic community, I believe we must share our expertise globally         to help alleviate the host of problems that beset our increasingly complex         world. We have a responsibility to consider not only the value and relevance         of our research, but also its outcome. We must seek to make certain that         the technologies we develop become available to the disadvantaged, and         not just the wealthiest corporations and nations. </p>      <p> Much university research is necessarily esoteric because we are involved         in the discovery of fundamental knowledge, a process that is arduous regardless         of the field. ASU must be a university in which scholars consider the         impact&#8212;the transformational effect&#8212;of their work on society.         ASU must be a community of scholars&#8212;scientists, engineers, philosophers,         artists, poets, historians&#8212;concerned with the impact of their work,         giving thought to its possible role in a better society. We must integrate         the advancement of knowledge with the transformation of society.</p>      <p> As members of an academic community, we must set an example of what         it means to be a community. If we do not set an example of what it means         to be a community, and lead the way to open discourse and the free exchange         of ideas, then who will? We must be a place that is open to diversity         of thought and culture and expression. In a sense, academic institutions         reflect society in a utopian microcosm&#8212;certainly we are as varied         and diverse, if not more so. And if we are not, we should be. </p>      <p> The university is a social incubator. We must engage the society evolving         before our eyes. We must find new ways to embrace difference, and move         ahead of social and intellectual currents. We must think through new ways         to govern, and promote evolution in democracy and all our institutions.         We must foster new conceptions in the arts and all spheres of culture,         and all these things must be done in an environment of openness and free         discourse. </p>      <p> What this means, then, is finding the mechanisms to think through the         issues and complexities associated with problems as seemingly intractable         as religious-based conflict, and fostering a social and intellectual environment         which would allow a subject of that complexity to be addressed. In this         sense, the university is a social incubator where all are free to speak,         and all are free to learn, and all are free to speak and learn together         in ways that could not elsewhere be imagined.<BR></p>       </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="61%" align="left" valign="bottom"><a href="c6.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td width="20%" align="right" valign="bottom" class="indent"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="c8.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="c8.htm"><img src="images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
