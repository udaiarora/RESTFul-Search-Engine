The ability to process information becomes a more desired skill, a key to powerful presentations at school, and the cornerstone of new forms of creativity. The students will be introduced to the fundamentals of &ldquo;touch typing&rdquo; which has its roots in basic business and communication skills. Although the typewriter is now virtually extinct, the computer keyboard is not, and the students will work in further developing their typing proficiency. The class will culminate with instruction on managing file structures and word processing competence. The students will learn to operate a keyboard and other common input and output devices, retrieve and save information remotely, and communicate independently via e-mail and the World Wide Web.</p></td>

                  <p>Ever wonder how to decipher the meaning of a painting or poem, or what a piece of music represents, or what the emotions in a dance are trying to say? The role of art in society is to represent the world's social and cultural changes. Art of all kinds can express a variety of themes such as emotion, political views, fantasy, or dreams. The art fields of visual arts, music, dance, and creative writing all have similarities in their representation of history and cultural change. Through this class students will learn history of the 20th century through the eyes of such artists as Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir&oacute;, Martha Graham, John Cage, Jackson Pollock, Frank O'Hara, Merce Cunningham, Salvador Dali and others. Students will learn to understand art, discover and try their methods, and learn how to express their own voice. </p></td>

                  <p>Humans have always looked up into the night sky and wondered if Earth is the only planet with life. How did life on Earth begin? Are there other thinking beings in the Universe? This course will introduce students to astronomical and biological topics related to the origin of life on Earth and the possibility of life elsewhere. Students will explore the formation of stars and planets, the life cycle of stars, the evolution of planets in our Solar System and the discovery of planets around other stars. From an exploration of the history of life on Earth, students will also uncover clues about what scientists expect to find in other places in the Solar System and on planets around other stars. The course will end with a hypothetical search for life on planets around another star. In this exercise, students will apply their knowledge of life on planet Earth to new and exciting possibilities on alien worlds!</p></td>

                  <p><br>
                    From Mark Twain to Toni Morrison, a powerful theme in literature has always been &ldquo;escape.&rdquo; Authors frequently write characters who must flee to save themselves physically and emotionally. More often than not, these characters end their journeys, not only in a different place, but as a different person. What makes literary characters take to the road in the first place? What happens out there? What do they learn and how does it shape who they are? In this course, students will study short works of fiction to explore these questions and others in order to make connections to the world around them. They will investigate themes attendant to escape, such as alienation, isolation, discovery, and developing identity or sense of self. The development of the ability to read, analyze, and synthesize ideas found in literature is an important higher-order thinking skill crucial to academic growth. In this course, students are not only expected to read literature produced by writers from a variety of backgrounds, but also discuss and write about the ideas they encounter.</p></td>

                  Computer generated images are everywhere. The ability to create computer images becomes a more and more desired skill, a key to powerful presentations at school, and the cornerstone of new forms of creativity. Throughout the course the students will be introduced to a variety of digital image and animation formats, the role sound plays in animation, design of a web page, setup of a web site and user navigation tools. The students will work with the latest digital imaging HTML, XHTML, and CSS code to develop their own web site and learn how to publish it when it is completed. This course is open to students who have the ability to operate a keyboard and other common input and output devices, retrieve and save information remotely, and communicate independently via E-mail and the Internet.</p>

                <p>When we think of every day life most of us take a lot of daily conveniences for granted. Take for instance the toaster you use to toast your bread in the morning. Have you ever thought about the electricity that makes it work or how it gets all the way to your house? Or what about the road you take to go to school in the morning? What about the car that you ride in? The music that you listen to in your CD or MP3 player, the airplane you fly on to go on vacation, sending an email to a friend and a myriad of other things that are just &ldquo;part of your daily life&rdquo; are all in some way or another associated with at least one field of engineering. When you think about it, engineers impact your life on a daily basis. Who are these Engineers? What do they do? How do they do it? How do I become one? In this course students will have the opportunity to explore the many different engineering disciplines, their applications, learn basic applied science and math principles used in the different fields and work on in-class projects that will reinforce the concepts learned from each field. At the end of the course, the student will have a better understanding about engineering, and the diversity that the field offers.</p></td>

Northern Skies provides students an opportunity to hone their inquiry skills while attempting to answer this question. In this course, students will observe the stars, sun, and moon through the eyes of other cultures and famous astronomers, as well as through instruments students devise themselves. In the STARLAB planetarium, students will gaze upon the stars in the same way ancient European, African, Asian, and Native American civilizations did. Then, beneath the rays of the Sun, students will make their own star observations. From telescopic tubes and optical lenses, each student will construct their very own Galileo-type telescope to measure the movement of sunspots. Based on their observations, students will have to conjecture and defend their own astronomical theories amid a famous 16th century debate on whether the sun circles around the earth or the earth circles around the sun. In the end, students will test their theories about movement of the earth and sun against lunar observations that they collect over a month long period.</p></td>
