	  <h2>Contemporary
        Islam conference provides insight on conflict
      </h2>
	  <p>Understanding the world of Islam has never been so important to Americans. </p>
      <p>With the tragic events of September 11th, 2001, subsequent wars in Afghanistan
        and Iraq, and now the reconstruction of those countries, the U.S. is
        ever more engaged with the Islamic world. A major question on everyone's
        mind lately is: do we have any idea of what we are agreeing to do?</p>
      <p>For more than a millennia, the Islamic and Western worlds have co-existed,
        yet remained largely foreign to each other. American military forces
        now find themselves occupying lands where ancient tribal differences,
        conflicts between the different branches of Islam, and complex political
        histories all serve to complicate an already thorny situation. Islam
        is also a growing religion within the U.S. In general, the Islamic world
        is strategically important to us, yet many Americans know very little
        about it.</p>
      <p>With this in mind, Arizona State University's new Center for the Study
        of Religion and Conflict is presenting "Faces and Voices of Islam in
        the Modern World", a public conference on April 29 and 30, featuring
        internationally known authorities in the field. Among the presenters
        will be scholars in Islamic religion, history, law, politics and contemporary
        affairs, including journalist, author and CNN terrorism analyst Peter
        L. Bergen, who will give the keynote address and moderate the conference's
        concluding panel discussion.</p>
      <p>Bergen's opening lecture is at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday, April 29 in the
        Carson Ballroom of ASU's Old Main. Conference presentations begin at
        8:00 a.m. and end at noon on Wednesday, April 30, also in the Carson
        Ballroom. Linell E. Cady, ASU Professor of Religious Studies and Director
        of the Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict will host the conference.
        ASU President Michael M. Crow will give the welcoming remarks on both
        days.</p>
      <p>"Major research universities, such as ASU, have an overarching responsibility
        to address some of the most pressing societal issues of our time," says
        Crow. "Our new Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict will be
        a model for a new kind of 'use-inspired' scholarship that can have great
        meaning and effect on the world around us. Its larger goal is to provide
        our community and our country with the comprehensive study of the interaction
        of religions, cultures, and societies," he said.</p>
      <p>The conference's opening lecture is likely to be of interest to anyone
        who wants to understand the motives and issues behind Islamic terrorism.
        For nearly a decade, Bergen has covered Osama bin Laden and the Jihadist
        terrorist network. He is one of only a few Western journalists to have
        interviewed bin Laden face to face. He is an internationally respected
        authority on global terrorism and has traveled extensively to the places
        where al-Qaeda has flourished - Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt and Pakistan
        - to learn the truth about bin Laden and those who work with him. Over
        the past four years, Bergen has interviewed scores of insiders, from
        bin Laden associates and family members to Taliban leaders, CIA officials,
        and former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. His expert commentary
        on Islamic terrorism is regularly seen and heard on CNN, ABC News, PBS,
        National Public Radio, The Daily Telegraph, The New Republic, The Washington
        Times, Vanity Fair, and The Times of London.</p>
      <p>Bergen's recent book, Holy War, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama
        bin Laden, has been a New York Times bestseller, and is considered by
        many to be the most authoritative analysis to date on the world of al-Qaeda.</p>
      <p>Other conference presentations include three lectures on the morning
        of April 30 by prominent scholars in the fields of Islamic religion,
        law and history. The first presentation is a lecture entitled "Conjuring
        Islam after 9/11" by Bruce B. Lawrence, Nancy and Jeffrey Marcus Humanities
        Professor of Religion at Duke University. His scholarship is especially
        concerned with the interplay between religion and ideology. His award
        winning monograph, Defenders of God: The Fundamentalist Revolt Against
        the Modern Age (1989/1995) is a seminal study of fundamentalism. His
        latest monograph, Shattering the Myth: Islam beyond Violence (1998/2000),
        focuses more specifically on fundamentalism in Islam. He is also the
        author of New Faiths, Old Fears: Muslims and Other Asian Immigrants in
        American Religious Life (Columbia University Press) and The Complete
        Idiot's Guide to Religions Online (Macmillan, 2000).</p>
      <p>The second presentation is "Conflicting Visions and Competing Voices
        of Islam After September 11, 2001" by Khaled Abou El Fadl, the Omar and
        Azmeralda Alfi Distinguished Fellow in Islamic Law at the UCLA Law School.
        The author of six books on Islam and Islamic law, including The Place
        of Tolerance in Islam, Rebellion and Violence in Islamic Law, and The
        Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses, El Fadl is a controversial
        scholar of Islam that U.S. News and World Report has called "a thorn
        in the side of reactionary Muslims around the world." His scholarly work
        concerns the relation of Islamic law to religion and daily practice.
        As a legal scholar, he is famous for questioning the accuracy of literalist
        interpretations of that law that are practiced by Islamic fundamentalists.</p>
      <p>The final lecture of the morning will be "Conflict and Controversy in
        Contemporary U.S. Islamic Trends" by Yvonne Haddad, Professor of Islam
        and Christian-Muslim Relations at Georgetown University. Haddad is an
        expert on twentieth-century Islam, including the intellectual, social
        and political history of the Arab world, and Islam in North America and
        the West. Her current research is on Islamic revolutionary movements
        and Muslims in the West. She has published 14 books and is a member of
        the Council on Foreign Relations, Middle East Policy Council, the New
        England Region of the American Academy of Religion, the American Council
        for the Study of Islamic Societies, and the Arab-American Anti-discrimination
        Committee.</p>
      <p>A panel composed of ASU Religious Studies scholars M. Sani Umar, Mark
        Woodward, and David Damrel will briefly respond to each presentation.
        The morning will conclude with a panel discussion, hosted by Bergen and
        featuring the conference presenters.</p>
      <p>"Faces and Voices of Islam in the Modern World" is free and open to
        the public, but reservations are requested, as space is limited. For
        reservations, call 480-965-1044. The event will also be webcast.</p>
      <p>ASU's Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict was established
        in January 2003. The Center's mission is to stimulate and support research
        and education on the role of religion in public controversies, from the
        civil to the violent, in a global context. Committed to the interdisciplinary
        and comparative study of religion, the Center will sponsor a broad range
        of programs and activities, engaging many audiences, that create a robust
        climate of inquiry and discourse within the ASU community, the Phoenix
        metropolitan area and, more broadly, nationally and internationally.</p>
      <p>The Center's location in Arizona, one of the fastest growing population
        centers nationally, provides a unique opportunity to address the religious
        heritage and beliefs from numerous communities characterized by recent
        immigration and historical representation. Faculty and students from
        across the university will be actively involved in broad-based activities
        that include: seed grant programs for collaborative research and curriculum
        development; scholarly and public conferences; visiting lecture series;
        faculty seminar series; visiting appointments; doctoral and post-doctoral
        fellowships; and undergraduate research awards.</p>
