      <h2>W. P. Carey School of Business Distinguished Achievement Award Meritage
        Executive Larry Seay honored at graduation</h2>
      <p>  Larry W. Seay, chief financial officer and vice president-finance of Meritage
    Corporation, will receive the Spring 2003 Distinguished Achievement Award
    at the W. P. Carey School of Business graduation May 15 at 7 p.m. in Wells
    Fargo Arena.</p>
      <p>Seay received a bachelor of science in finance in 1977 and in
      accounting in 1978 and a master of business administration in 1979 from
        the W. P. Carey School.
    Since 1996 he has been in executive leadership at Meritage Corporation, a
        homebuilder with over $1 billion in annual revenue that has experienced
        15 consecutive
    years of record revenue and net earnings. At the same time, Seay has been
        active at the W. P. Carey School through membership on the Accounting
        Circle, speaking
    in W. P. Carey MBA classes, judging at case competitions, and most recently,
    joining the department of finance advisory board.</p>
      <p>"Executives like Larry Seay
    make a real difference in the education of our students," said Larry E. Penley,
    dean of the W. P. Carey School. "They challenge
    faculty and students to live up to our responsibility as a professional school."</p>
      <p>A
    certified public accountant, Seay began his career as an audit manager for
    Deloitte &amp; Touche. His first position in the homebuilding industry was
    at Emerald Homes, where he was treasurer and chief financial officer. Beginning
    in 1990 he was vice president and treasurer of UDC Homes. In 1996 he assumed
    his present position at Meritage.</p>
      <p>Through the years Seay remained involved with
    Arizona State University. "If you are a successful individual should contribute
    not only monetarily, but
    with your most valuable asset, your time," he said. </p>
      <p>He was an active member
    of the Accounting Circle, a support and advisory group in the School of Accountancy
    and Information Management. For the past decade
    he has also participated in the W. P. Carey MBA case competitions, and has
    been a guest speaker in classes at the Del Webb School of Construction as
        well as the W. P. Carey School. <br>
    <br>
    Most recently he joined the department of finance advisory board. In addition
    he has been active in the Better Business Bureau and the Men's Art Council
    at the Phoenix Museum of Art.</p>
      <p>The W. P. Carey School of Business Distinguished
    Achievement Award is presented at the December and May graduations to an
        individual who has achieved success
    in business and who has contributed to the improvement of the W. P. Carey
        School and the community. Previous recipients include construction executive
        Robert
    Hardison of hardison/downey construction, inc., James E. Stowers III of American
