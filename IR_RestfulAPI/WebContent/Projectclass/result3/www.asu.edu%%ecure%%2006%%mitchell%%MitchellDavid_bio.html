<h4>Bio</h4>
<p>David W. Mitchell, CRM is Global Document Control Project Manager for Teleflex Medical, a surgical and medical device manufacturing firm located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. He assumed his new responsibilities after serving as University Records Manager at Duke University for two years, where he developed and implemented its first comprehensive records and information management program.</p> 

<p>Prior to coming to Duke in November 2003, he served as Assistant State Records Administrator with the North Carolina Division of Historical Resources, Archives and Records Section. In that role he administered records management programs for North Carolina's public agencies and served on the Electronic Records Task Force, Preservation and Access Task Force and the Disaster Response Team.</p>
<p>His records-related interests center on users' behaviors and demands and their affect on the management of electronic records, obstacles to developing and implementing electronic records management programs, and various issues surrounding electronic mail. In 1996, he attained the designation Certified Records Manager. Mitchell holds a Bachelor or Arts degree in Speech Communications from Wake Forest University and a Master of Public Administration degree from North Carolina State University.</p>

<h4>Presentation Abstract</h4>
<p>Confronted with the task of managing increasing amounts of web-based information, educational institutions like Duke University are adopting content management systems to manage these electronic records. The use of CMS in higher education presents institutional archivists with opportunities and challenges in ensuring that CMS- based web records are scheduled and preserved correctly. "Content Management Systems: Who Makes the Rules" is an NHPRC-funded project to examine the use of CMS at educational institutions around the country.</p>

<p>This session will provide an overview of the project and will review data gathered from information technology professionals and archivists on CMS usage, CMS applications that are being employed to control web records, rules that are in place to guide versioning of web records, and how those rules are established. The presenters also will review long-range goals for the management and preservation of electronic records and will discuss their methodology for gathering feedback on the use of CMS at Duke's peer institutions.</p>
