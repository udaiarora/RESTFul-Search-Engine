Both reaction types were directly observed at the atomic-level, including the first dynamic atomic-level observation of intercalation reaction processes. Three types of mechanisms were observed for the deintercalation of mercury from the TiS<sub>2</sub> layers in Hg<sub>x</sub>TiS<sub>2</sub>: ( 1 ) deintercalation of complete mercury-filled layers, ( 2 ) deintercalation of mercury via edge dislocations and ( 3 ) deintercalation of mercury islands. The intercalation of ammonia into 2HTaS<sub>2</sub> was observed in situ using an environmental cell. The intercalation reaction proceeded inward from the outer basal planes of TaS<sub>2</sub>. Partial intercalation of inner TaS<sub>2</sub> layers occurred, and these layers could be deintercalated by sufficient electron-beam heating. Both intercalation and deintercalation processes proceeded by the advance and retreat, respectively, of guest-edge dislocation fronts.<p><i>Solid State Ionics, 63-65 (1993) 369-377.
