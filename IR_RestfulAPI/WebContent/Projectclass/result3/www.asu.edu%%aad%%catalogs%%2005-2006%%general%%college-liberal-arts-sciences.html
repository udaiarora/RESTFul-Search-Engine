Purpose</b>
<a id="a27164"></a></h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Like all major research universities, Arizona State University provides the means for undergraduates to acquire a liberal education, an education that broadens students&#8217; understanding in the major areas of human knowledge while providing students with in-depth knowledge in their chosen areas of focus. While the professional schools and colleges can and do provide for important dimensions of a liberal education, the central academic setting for accomplishing this basic university purpose is the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS). The college provides a particularly rich and varied set of opportunities for students to gain the kind of liberal education that helps to prepare them for a lifetime of continued learning and application of knowledge in a diverse and ever-changing world.</p>
<p>
As a consequence of the wide range of subjects CLAS offers in the humanities, the natural sciences and mathematics, and the social and behavioral sciences, instruction is provided in a number of core areas for undergraduate students from all of the other colleges. Students with majors in business, education, engineering, nursing, and other professional colleges rely on CLAS for basic foundation courses. CLAS also offers the majority of courses meeting the General Studies requirement.</p>
<p>
CLAS initiated and continues to participate actively with the Barrett Honors College. It also offers advising to undergraduates who are working out their undergraduate programs or are planning for graduate studies.</p>
<p>
Most of the university faculty&#8217;s engagement in the discovery and creation of knowledge and its dissemination occurs in CLAS. As an integral part of this activity, CLAS offers a wide range of graduate training programs leading to a master&#8217;s or doctoral degree. For graduate degree application information, see the <i>
Graduate Catalog</i>
 and contact either the Division of Graduate Studies or the academic unit in which the degree of interest would be earned, the latter in order to receive detailed information on particular degree requirements.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Organization</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
CLAS consists of the School of Global Studies, the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication, the School of Justice and Social Inquiry, the School of Life Sciences, 20 academic departments, several interdisciplinary programs, 10 centers, and several research institutes and laboratories. The college offers 40 programs leading to a bachelor&#8217;s degree, 31 programs leading to a master&#8217;s degree, 22 programs leading to a doctoral degree, and interdisciplinary graduate programs in cooperation with other colleges. Undergraduate customized interdisciplinary degrees are also available.</p>
<p>
For more information, access the college&#8217;s Web site at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/clas">www.asu.edu/clas</a>.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Admission</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Any entering ASU student who has met the minimum university entrance requirements can be admitted to CLAS. Students with fewer than 50 earned hours of credit can, if they wish, be admitted as &#8220;exploratory/undeclared&#8221; prelaw or &#8220;exploratory/undeclared&#8221; premedicine. Students with 50 or more hours must declare a major to be accepted into the college.</p>
<p>
<i>
Note:</i>
 Students who wish to enter a program of study that has a rigidly structured curriculum should be aware that delay in choosing a major could result in added time and cost in the completion of requirements.</p>
<p>
Any student with a cumulative GPA of at least 2.00 who is currently registered in good standing in another college at ASU and who wishes to major in a subject offered by CLAS and to follow a program of study in the major may transfer into the college. (Students wishing to transfer into the major of Economics must have an ASU cumulative GPA of at least 2.50.) Current ASU students who are changing their majors to CLAS from another ASU college must first contact the advisor in the department they are moving to.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Transfer Students.</b> 
The university standards for evaluation of transfer credit are listed under 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a11716">Transfer Credit</a>. All students who meet the university standards are admissible to CLAS. Transfer students are urged to contact the relevant academic department or the Office of Undergraduate Programs in FOUND 1120, to ensure a smooth transition to CLAS. Students who have transferred courses from institutions other than Arizona community colleges must have their transcripts evaluated by an advisor in FOUND 1120. Students who have attended only Arizona community colleges have evaluations performed in the department of the major.</p>
<p>
Courses transferred from two-year (community) colleges are accepted as lower-division credit only. Students are urged to choose their community college courses carefully, in view of the fact that a minimum of 45 semester hours of work taken at the university must be upper-division credit (see 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a22093">Community Colleges</a>).</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Advising</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
All students are urged to seek advising in the appropriate college unit before registration. Students must follow the calendar published in the <i>
Schedule of Classes</i>
 each semester for information and deadlines pertaining to enrollment, adding/dropping classes, and withdrawals.</p>
<p>
In addition to information provided by an advisor, students must read the requirements for university General Studies, college graduation, and major degree requirements in their edition of the ASU <i>
General Catalog.</i>
 See 
<a href="general-studies.html#a88218">General Studies</a>, 
<a href="university-graduation-requirements.html#a29335">University Graduation Requirements</a>, 
&#8220;CLAS Graduation Requirements,&#8221; page <a href="college-liberal-arts-sciences.html#a51543">331</a>, and the section of the department offering the major. The ASU <i>
General Catalog</i>
 is the governing source for all degree requirements.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Regular Advising.</b> 
All students are strongly urged to seek advising in the appropriate college unit before registration.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Advising Locations.</b> 
CLAS students should seek routine advising at the locations shown in the 
<a href="college-liberal-arts-sciences.html#a60552">Advising Locations</a> table, on this page.</p>
<p>
The Office of Undergraduate Programs, in FOUND 1120, is the central resource center for academic information in the college. Requests from students, departmental advisors, and faculty for clarification of rules, procedures, and advising needs of the college and university should be directed to that office. </p></div>

Mandatory Advising.</b> 
The following categories of Liberal Arts and Sciences students <i>
must</i>
 receive advising and <i>
must</i>
 be cleared on the Mandatory Advising Computer System (MACS) before their classes are scheduled:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
students in their first semester at ASU;</li>
<li>
students on probation;</li>
<li>
students with a cumulative GPA of less than 2.00;</li>
<li>
students who have admissions deficiencies;</li>
<li>
other students with &#8220;special admissions&#8221; status; and</li>
<li>
students who have been disqualified (these students are allowed to attend ASU summer and winter sessions only and must be advised in the Office of Undergraduate Programs in FOUND 1120).</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Students in the above mandatory advising categories should consult an advisor in the appropriate advising location listed in the previous section. Students with admission deficiencies are carefully monitored to ensure that they take courses that eliminate their deficiencies. Students are encouraged to check their mandatory advising status each semester before attempting registration transactions.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Advising for Preprofessional Programs.</b> 
Special advising is available for students planning to enter the fields listed in the 
<a href="college-liberal-arts-sciences.html#a48603">Advising for Preprofessional Programs</a> table, on this page. The professional programs shown in the table are not majors in themselves; that is, there are no majors called &#8220;premedical,&#8221; &#8220;prelaw,&#8221; etc. In each program, the student must eventually select an established major in CLAS or in one of the other colleges. </p></div>

<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Pre-Health Professions.</b> 
Students pursuing professional schools in the health professions must choose a major offered by ASU. However, specific courses must be taken to prepare the student to take the MCAT or other entrance examinations and to succeed in postbaccalaureate training. Therefore, students who plan to pursue a health profession should meet regularly with the Pre-Health Professions office for guidance. While this guidance does not replace the need to meet with an advisor in the department of the student&#8217;s major, pre-health advising is a necessary supplement. To schedule a meeting with Pre-Health Professions, located in LSC 206, call 480/965-2365.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Prelaw.</b> 
The American Bar Association does not recommend any specific major for students who wish to apply to law school upon graduation. ASU does not have a &#8220;prelaw&#8221; degree program. Therefore, students should select a major that interests them. Recent surveys of law school graduates indicate that students would be well advised to take one or two semesters of accounting as a supplement to their major curriculum. In addition, the American Bar Association recommends a variety of courses in the classics, in economics, and in mathematical reasoning. Courses that engage the student in intense critical analysis and a substantial amount of writing are also recommended. As the student approaches the second semester of his or her junior year, the student should contact the prelaw advisor in the college or department of his or her major to obtain information regarding the procedure to apply to law school.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Career Advising: CLASWorks.</b> 
A degree in the liberal arts and sciences prepares a student for careers that include but are not limited to business, government/public service, nonprofit organizations, the arts, science and research, and most corporate environments. By the time of graduation, CLAS students have developed the ability to solve problems, analyze data, communicate ideas, and execute complex plans. To identify career paths that best fit a student&#8217;s interests and talents, the Office of Undergraduate Programs offers individualized career advising. To make an appointment, call 480/965-6506.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Internships.</b> 
All students are encouraged to complete at least one internship before graduation. Many CLAS disciplines have well-established internship programs, so students should begin with their academic departments. Contact information may be found on the Web at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu/clasworks">www.asu.edu/clasworks</a>. To develop a successful internship experience, students are encouraged to meet with the director of CLASWorks for a career advising session soon after arriving on campus.</p></div>

<b>
Degrees</b>

<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Majors.</b> 
Programs leading to the BA and BS degrees are offered by CLAS, with majors in the subjects listed in the 
<a href="college-liberal-arts-sciences.html#a12115">College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Baccalaureate Degrees and Majors</a> table. Each major is administered by the academic department indicated. </p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Concurrent degrees and second baccalaureate degrees.</b> 
Students who wish to pursue a concurrent degree in CLAS may not double count courses from one major to the other. Each major must consist of a minimum of 30 semester hours unique to that major. Similarly, students who earn one baccalaureate degree may not earn a second baccalaureate degree in the same major or in a major that does not contain 30 core hours unique to that major. For example, a student may not pursue a degree in two life science fields (with the exception of Clinical Laboratory Sciences).</p></div>

Minors.</b>
<a id="a95303"></a> 
Although not required for graduation, special college-approved minors are available in most departments. Check department program descriptions for details. Minors must have at least 18 hours of designated courses, including at least 12 hours of upper-division work. The college requires a grade of at least &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00) in all upper-division courses in the minor. Some departments have stricter requirements. A minimum of six upper-division hours in the minor must be taken in residence at the Tempe campus.</p>
<p>
University policies prohibit the &#8220;double-counting&#8221; of courses from the major for the minor. Specific questions concerning double-counting, as well as general questions about the approval processes for minors, should be taken up with an academic advisor in the department offering the minor or the Office of Undergraduate Programs in FOUND 1120.</p>

University Graduation Requirements</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
In addition to fulfilling college and major requirements, students must meet all university graduation requirements. For complete information, see

<h3>
<b>
General Studies Requirement</b>
</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
All students enrolled in a baccalaureate degree program must satisfy a university requirement of a minimum of 35 hours of approved course work in General Studies, as described in 
<a href="general-studies.html#a88218">General Studies</a>. Note that all three General Studies awareness areas are required. Consult an advisor for an approved list of courses.</p>
<p>
General Studies courses are listed in the

College Degree Requirements</b>
<a id="a16128"></a></h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
CLAS degree requirements are more extensive than the General Studies requirement. Additional course work in the humanities, natural sciences and mathematics, and social and behavioral sciences is required. Students are encouraged to consult with an academic advisor in planning a program to ensure that they meet all necessary requirements.</p>
<p>
To graduate from CLAS, a student must satisfy college requirements in addition to university General Studies requirements. These requirements consist of <i>
major requirements</i>
 which involve concentrated course work in a selected field; and CLAS <i>
graduation requirements</i>
 which ensure that the student demonstrates proficiency in a second language while exposing the student to other liberal arts and sciences outside the major field.</p></div>
<p class="level1">
<b>
  I.	Major Requirements</b>
<a id="a80621"></a></p>
<p class="level1-tbc">
Each student is required to select a major from among the fields of study offered by CLAS. The requirements for completion of the major are described under departmental listings.</p>
<p class="level2">
A.	The major department may require up to 45 semester hours of course work. The minimum is 30 hours. A maximum of 15 additional hours may be required in related courses and prerequisites. No more than 60 semester hours of course work may be required to complete the major, related courses, and prerequisites. Some departments require calculus-level mathematics; up to five of these semester hours may be excluded from the 60-hour maximum because they satisfy the mathematics proficiency requirement. A minimum of 12 upper-division hours in the major must be taken in residence at the Tempe campus.</p>
<p class="level2">
B.	No credit is granted toward fulfilling major or minor requirements in any upper-division course in that subject field unless the grade in that course is at least a &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00). In CLAS, the assignment of a grade of &#8220;Y&#8221; indicates a level of performance that would have resulted in a grade of at least &#8220;C&#8221; (2.00) had the normal grading scheme been used.</p>
<p class="level2-tbc">

The purpose of the CLAS graduation requirements is to ensure that the student is introduced to disciplines outside the division of the major. A list of major fields and their respective divisions is given in section I, subsection C.</p>
<p class="level1-tbc">
Unless the major field notes otherwise in section I, subsection C, students are considered to have fulfilled the CLAS graduation requirements in the division of the major.</p>
<p class="level1-tbc">
Students majoring in African and African American Studies or Chicana and Chicano Studies satisfy the CLAS graduation requirements in either the humanities or the social and behavioral sciences, depending upon their concentrations; that is, these students fill the CLAS requirements within the concentration of their major only. They may not use courses in the department to fill the CLAS requirements outside their major concentration.</p>
<p class="level1-tbc">
Students majoring in Women and Gender Studies may complete the CLAS Social and Behavioral Sciences distribution area using courses within the major.</p>
<p class="level1-tbc">
Students majoring in Anthropology, Geography, or Psychology may not use ASM courses in the case of Anthropology majors, GPH courses in the case of Geography majors, or PSY courses in the case of Psychology majors to satisfy the CLAS graduation requirements in the natural sciences and mathematics.</p>

Students who wish to obtain concurrent degrees must realize that there are certain combinations that would not be approved because there is too great an overlap between the courses required for each major. For example, students may not obtain concurrent degrees in two life sciences. Students who wish to obtain concurrent degrees may not double-count courses from one major to the next, but must have at least 30 different semester hours in each major.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Course Load.</b> 
The normal course load is 15 to 16 semester hours. First-semester freshmen and entering transfer students are not permitted to register for more than 18 semester hours in the initial semester. Other students who wish to register for more than 18 hours must have a GPA of at least 3.00 and must file a petition in the Office of Undergraduate Programs, in FOUND 1120, before registration. Any petition for an overload in excess of 21 hours must be presented to the Standards Committee of the college. No student should assume that his or her petition for overload will be granted.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Special Credit Options</b>
</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Pass/Fail Grade Option.</b> 
The pass/fail grade option is intended to broaden the education of Liberal Arts and Sciences undergraduates by encouraging them to take advanced courses outside their specialization. A mark of &#8220;P&#8221; contributes to the student&#8217;s earned hours but does not affect the GPA. A failing grade is computed into the GPA.</p>
<p>
Only CLAS students with at least 60 semester hours may take courses under the pass/fail option. The option may be used under the following conditions:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
enrollment for pass/fail needs the approval of the instructor and the college;</li>
<li>
enrollment under this option must be indicated during registration and may not be changed after the late registration period; and</li>
<li>
a maximum of 12 hours taken for pass/fail may be counted toward graduation.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Students may not enroll under the pass/fail option in the following courses:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
those taken to satisfy the second language or First-Year Composition requirements;</li>
<li>
those in the student&#8217;s major, minor, or certificate program;</li>
<li>
those counted toward or required to supplement the major;</li>
<li>
those counted as 499 Individualized Instruction;</li>
<li>
those taken for honors credits; or</li>
<li>
those counted toward satisfying the CLAS graduation requirements or the General Studies requirement.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Audit Grade Option.</b> 
A student may choose to audit a course in which he or she attends regularly scheduled class sessions but earns no credit. The student should obtain the instructor&#8217;s approval before registering for the course. For more information, see 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a20673">Grading System</a>.</p>
<p>
Note: This grade option may not be changed after the drop/add period.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent">
<b>
Independent Learning.</b> 
Study by Independent Learning is not a normal part of a degree program; special circumstances must exist for a degree-seeking student to take Independent Learning courses. Any enrollment in such courses must have the prior approval of the college. </p></div>

Academic Standards</h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The standards for GPA and the terms of probation, disqualification, reinstatement, and appeal are identical to those of the university as set forth under 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a27839">Retention and Academic Standards</a>, except that the disqualified student in CLAS is suspended for at least two regular semesters at the university. When students are placed on probation, one of three things can happen:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
the student may raise his or her cumulative GPA to academic good standing (see 
<a href="undergraduate-enrollment.html#a61512">Academic Good Standing</a>) by taking new classes and be removed from probation after the fall or spring semester;</li>
<li>
the student may receive the required semester GPA, but not raise the cumulative GPA to academic good standing, in which case, the student may continue on probation, earning the required semester GPA, for as many semesters as it takes to raise the cumulative GPA to good standing; or</li>
<li>
the student may fail to achieve the required semester GPA and be disqualified.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
Students with cumulative GPAs of less than 2.00 who leave the university for a semester or more are not automatically readmitted. Such students, as well as all disqualified students, should contact the Office of Undergraduate Programs in FOUND 1120, regarding procedures and guidance for reinstatement and returning to good standing. By following recommendations and meeting established standards for summer school work or course work at other institutions, the possibility of successful reinstatement is enhanced. Academic discipline is one of the functions of the Office of Undergraduate Programs. All students having academic difficulties of any kind should contact this office. Also available in this office is information on policies and procedures of the college on academic honesty, student grievances with respect to grades, and various petitions regarding college standards and graduation requirements. </p>
<p>
Academic honesty is expected of all students in all examinations, papers, academic transactions, and records. The possible sanctions include, but are not limited to, appropriate grade penalties, loss of registration privileges, disqualification, and dismissal.</p></div>
<h2>
<b>
Student Responsibilities</b>

<b>
Integrated Studies.</b>
<a id="a32087"></a> 
An Integrated Studies major leading to the BA or BS degree provides students of outstanding ability in the humanities, natural sciences and mathematics, and social and behavioral sciences opportunities to pursue courses of study that cut across departmental boundaries and focus on specific topics or problem areas.

The Latin American Studies Certificate program is designed to give students an understanding of culture, economies, political structures, and the history of Latin American nations. The Departments of Anthropology, Economics, Geography, History, Languages and Literatures (Spanish and Portuguese), and Political Science and the W. P. Carey School of Business offer courses that combine to make up the interdisciplinary certificate. Students must complete 30 semester hours of upper-division courses from the above departments/colleges with a concentration in Latin America&#8212;15 semester hours in the major subject and 15 semester hours in other disciplines. The certificate requires Spanish or Portuguese proficiency through the 313 level of conversation and composition. Only language courses above 313 in literature and civilization count toward a major or interdisciplinary areas of preparation. Spanish and Portuguese courses above 313 in grammar and phonology do not count toward the major requirements. The Latin American Studies Center offers the area of emphasis for students who do not wish to attain a high level of language proficiency. </p>
