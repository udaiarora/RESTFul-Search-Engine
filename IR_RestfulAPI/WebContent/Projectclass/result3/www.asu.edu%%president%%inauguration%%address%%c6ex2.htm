Historically housed         in three departments&#8212;biology, microbiology, and plant biology&#8212;ASU         will launch a new School of Life Sciences. No longer encumbered by the         artificiality of disciplinary boundaries, this new school will merge the         talents of more than 100 life scientists, engineers, philosophers, social         scientists, and ethicists in a new kind of teaching and research enterprise,         one focused on advancing our understanding of nature while at the same         time using that understanding to build better lives. The reorganization         represents the collaborative effort of hundreds of faculty members from         the three departments. <br>      </p>      <p>In the new School of Life Sciences, faculty will self-organize around         the great questions of the day, students will move between faculty of         various disciplinary backgrounds, developing research topics and learning         in new types of inter- and transdisciplinary settings. Our enhanced new         fusion structure will allow the Arizona State University School of Life         Sciences to expand dramatically the range of problems and questions that         our institution is able to address. </p>      <p><br>      </p></td>    <td align="center" valign="top"> &nbsp;<BR> </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
