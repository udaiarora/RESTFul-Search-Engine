      <h2>ASU earns two U.S.AID grants </h2>
      <p>ASU has been awarded two U.S.AID grants, totaling $600,000. These grants ($300,000 each) awarded to the College of Architecture &amp; Environmental Design (CAED) and the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, set a new precedent for ASU, says Jorge De los Santos, executive director of the Office of Pan American Initiatives. </p>
      <p>"We rarely receive funding of this magnitude from U.S.AID," says De los Santos, who was instrumental in establishing ties with representatives of the U.S. Agency for International Development. "When we first began working with both colleges, we didn't realize that they were, in essence, competing for the same funds. It's great to hear that both partners were awarded well-deserved grants." </p>
      <p>The grants were submitted in partnership with Instituto Tecnolgico de Sonora-ITSON (Architecture) and Tec de Monterrey (Engineering), both located in Mexico. </p>
      <p>In the history of ASU, the university has only received two U.S.AID grants, according to De los Santos, who hopes this will serve as an example for other colleges to follow. </p>
      <p>A $300,000 grant was presented to the CAED, through a partnership with ITSON-Sonora Institute of Technology. Their proposal, "The Bi-National Partnership Consortium for Desert Environmental Development," endorses the need to develop alternative, environmentally friendly energy systems, furthering ecotourism, and enhancing environmental protection while promoting sustainable micro-enterprises for the Sonoran desert region. </p>
      <p>Team members for this proposal are David Pijawka, director of CAED's Ph.D. Program; Harvey Bryan, professor in the School of Architecture; and Linda Oviedo, graduate research associate. Pijawka says the grant was presented under the U.S.-Mexico Training, Internships, Exchanges and Scholarships (TIES) initiative, developed by the U.S.AID and is implemented under the broader U.S.-Mexico Partnership for Prosperity Initiative of U.S. President George W. Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox. </p>
      <p>Pijawka says this grant will be used to develop a three-year program to support several masters and Ph.D. awards for students from ITSON in such programs as planning, recreation and management, geography, design and the Ph.D. in environmental design and planning. The grant will support joint research efforts in a real world environmental laboratory located in the coastal areas of Sonora, in addition to faculty exchanges and an interdisciplinary seminar located in the Center for Environmental Studies. </p>
      <p>"It will further integrate our efforts in partnership and alliance building which will hopefully bring in other partners, private and public sector, to build upon this recent grant and establish programs and opportunity for new grants that focus on this region and sustainability," De los Santos says. </p>
      <p>A $300,000 grant was presented to the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering at ASU, through a partnership with Tec of Monterrey. The grant proposal, "U.S. - Mexico Partnership on Education and Technology Transfer for the Aerospace Industry," endorses the need to train professionals for the aerospace industry in global logistics and productivity improvement via project-based, dual M.S. degree programs. </p>
      <p>Team members for this proposal are Mark Henderson, professor of industrial engineering; Rene Villalobos, associate professor of industrial engineering; and John Fowler, professor of industrial engineering. Henderson says this grant will go toward developing a program to help multi-national students learn from each other and become globally aware and, "consequently be in demand by industry upon graduation." </p>
      <p>"Both of our universities have unique offerings, and combining the two gives the students a great advantage," De los Santos says. "The students will take courses together, some at ASU, some at Monterrey Tech and some online. Global engineering education is essential these days because companies who hire our graduates are global. The experiences we can give our students interacting with other countries and cultures helps them not only in their jobs, but also in their lives." </p>
      <p>De los Santos says he hopes this will serve as an example for other ASU colleges to follow. </p>
      <p>"We hope this will encourage more professors to seek partnerships and funding in the Americas," he says. "It's part of the global effort." </p>
