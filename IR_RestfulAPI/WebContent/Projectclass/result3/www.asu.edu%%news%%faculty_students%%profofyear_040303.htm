April 3, 2003</p>
      <h2>Groups celebrate teaching excellence of ASU faculty</h2>
      <p>        ASU students, faculty, staff and community members are invited to attend
          "A Celebration of Teaching and Learning Excellence" on April 8. The
          event will honor the ASU Parents Association 2003 Professor of the
          Year, the Associated Students of ASU Centennial Professorships and
          all faculty members nominated for the awards. The free event will begin
          with a small reception scheduled at 5:15 p.m., in the Old Main Carson
        Ballroom. </p>
      <p>Last year's Professor of the Year George Watson, ASU professor
            of journalism and mass communication, is serving as the chairman
        of the selection committee
          this year. Watson says the 22 finalists for this award go beyond excellence
          in their own teaching, influencing positively the teaching of others
          and fostering learning beyond their own students, reaching not only
        other students but often the broader community as well.</p>
      <p>"It goes without saying
          that all of the nominees are excellent teachers, esteemed by their
        students and colleagues alike," he says. "The Professor
          of the Year, however, will be one who has exhibited the most substantial
          contributions to teaching as a profession over the years."</p>
      <p>Twenty-two
          full-time tenured and tenure-track ASU faculty members were nominated
          for the Parents Association Professorship, based on their outstanding
          contributions to undergraduate education. Watson says this event serves
          as acknowledgement of the relationship between professors and parents.</p>
      <p>"Teachers
          care for their students; parents care even more for their children,"
          he says. "For the parents to step forward with the Parents Association
          Professorship, the functional equivalent of a teaching Regents Professorship,
          is a testament to their concern for the quality of education received
          by their children. It also represents their commitment to ASU and the
          faculty to promoting and recognizing quality undergraduate education.
          In this way, the parents help us all remember what our new president,
          Michael Crow, has affirmed, 'Teaching is our prime directive.'"</p>
      <p>The Associated
        Students of ASU Centennial Professorships will also be presented at the
        April 8 event to two associate professors considered
        "rising stars" in the ASU faculty. The two recipients of the 2003 Centennial
        Professorships are Shannon Ringenbach, of the kinesiology department
        in the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences (CLAS) and Kyle Longley,
        of the CLAS history department. Each winner will receive an award of
        $20,000, half of which is to be used for the betterment of students.        </p>
      <p>The faculty member awarded the Parents Association Professorship receives
          a cash award of $10,000 and the lifelong designation of Parents Association
          Professor. The Parents Association will also provide $10,000 ($5,000
          per academic year) to fund an undergraduate student assistant for the
          professor. </p>
      <p>In addition, the recipient will be invited to become a fellow
          in the ASU Distinguished Teaching Academy. Finalists will receive a
        $1,000 award.
          The winner will be announced at the April 8 event.</p>
      <p>ASU Parents Association
          2003 Professor of the Year nominees are: <br>
        Madelaine Adelman, School of Justice Studies; Edward Castaneda, psychology
          department; Alice Christie, ASU West College of Education; Shannon
          Dirksen, College of Nursing; Nancy Eisenberg, psychology department;
          Randel Helms,
          English department; Robert Ismeurt, College of Nursing; Merrill R.
          Karp, ASU East Aeronautical Management Technology; Douglas T. Kenrick,
          psychology
          department; <br>
        Kraig Knutson, Del E. Webb School Of Construction; Manfred Laubichler,
          biology department; Barry Leshowitz, psychology department; Neal Lester,
          English department and African American Studies Program; Vera Lopez,
          School of Justice Studies; Kevin McHugh, geography department; Susan

      <p>Judy Pickens, College
          of Nursing; Armando Rodriguez, electrical engineering department; Frank
          Sackton, School of Public Affairs; P. VanderMeer, history
          department; Rose Weitz, sociology department; and Matthew Whitaker,
        history department.</p>
      <p>"For faculty, the opportunity to see the teaching commitment,
          skills, and methods of their colleagues," Watson says, "and to see
        that students
          and parents do care is an affirmation of that basic decision to become
          a teacher."</p>
      <p>Those who wish to attend "A Celebration of Teaching and Learning
          Excellence," should R.S.V.P. by April 4 at (480) 965-7501. Reservations
          are required.</p>
