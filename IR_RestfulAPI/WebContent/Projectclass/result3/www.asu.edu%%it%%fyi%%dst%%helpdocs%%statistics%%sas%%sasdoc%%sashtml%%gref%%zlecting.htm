<P><A name="z0747987">&#13; Although
SAS/GRAPH software
usually selects an appropriate device driver for displaying graphics output
on your display device, you may need to select a different device driver if
you want to direct your graphics output to another destination.</A>
<P>When you select a device driver, it must be one that
is appropriate for your device. The device driver must 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>send commands to the device that the device understands.
 For example, if you are using an X Windows display, the SAS/GRAPH device
driver sends the appropriate data stream that can produce graphics output
on the display device.<P>

<LI>contain values of device parameters that are appropriate
for the device. For example, if you are using a color PostScript printer and
you select a device driver for a black and white PostScript printer, your
graph will not print in color.<P>
</UL>

<P>Occasionally the device driver you use is not the one
that bears your device's name.  This can happen when 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>your graphics device uses a common graphics language
(for example, PostScript).<P>

<LI>your graphics device emulates a different graphics
device. (For example, there is no SAS device driver for your plotter, but
the plotter can be set up to emulate a Hewlett-Packard 7550 plotter.)<P>
</UL>

<P>In this case, you use the device driver that matches
the language that your device understands.  For example, if your Hewlett-Packard
LaserJet II printer has a PostScript card installed, you would use one of
the PostScript device drivers rather than HPLJS2.  Similarly, you could use
an HP driver for a plotter (for example, HP7550A) when your plotter emulates
a Hewlett-Packard 7550 plotter.
<P>You cannot force a device to act as a device with different
capabilities by choosing a different device driver.

<P><A name="z0747996">&#13; You
can view the list of device entries in SASHELP.DEVICES or
in any other device catalog in the following ways: </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>use the SAS Explorer window to display the contents
of the device catalog.<P>

<LI>use the GDEVICE procedure to open the GDEVICE
DIRECTORY window, which lists all of the device drivers in the current catalog.
By default the current catalog is SASHELP.DEVICES. To specify a catalog, include
the CATALOG= option, as shown in the following statement:  



<PRE>proc gdevice catalog=sashelp.devices;</PRE>
<P>See <A href="ze-using.htm#zwindows">Using the GDEVICE Windows</A> for details.<P>

<LI>use GDEVICE procedure
statements to write the
list of device drivers to the Output window:  



<PRE>proc gdevice catalog=sashelp.devices nofs;
  list;
run;
quit;</PRE>
<P>The <A href="zce-stmt.htm#z0776552">NOFS</A> option in the PROC GDEVICE statement causes the procedure not
to use the GDEVICE windows.
<P>If you want to write the list of devices to an external
file you can 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>save the contents of the Output window.<P>

<LI>use the PRINTTO procedure to redirect the GDEVICE
procedure output to an external file. See <B>SAS Procedures Guide</B> for a description of the
PRINTTO procedure.<P>
</UL>
<P>
</UL>

<P>Once you have generated the list of available device
drivers, you can search the list until you find the description that matches
your output device.  The corresponding name is the name that you specify as
the device driver.

<P><A name="z0748006">&#13;
You can also use any of the viewing methods to browse the contents
of a device entry. From the GDEVICE Directory window, select the device name
to open the GDEVICE Detail window.  From there you can move to the other GDEVICE
windows for the entry, using either the menus or commands. For details, see </A><A href="ze-using.htm#zwindows">Using the GDEVICE Windows</A>.
<P>You can
display the contents of a device entry in the
Output window by selecting the entry from the Explorer window or by submitting
GDEVICE statements. The following statements list in the Output window the
contents of the PSCOLOR device entry:  



<PRE>proc gdevice c=sashelp.devices nofs;
   list pscolor;
run;
quit;</PRE>
<P>See <A href="zice-con.htm#zlisting">Sample Device Entry Listing Generated in Program Mode</A>
 for an illustration of the device listing.

<P><A name="z0748009">&#13; You can specify a
device driver in these ways: </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>use the DEVICE= option in a GOPTIONS or OPTIONS
statement. For example,  



<PRE>goptions device=pslepf;</PRE>
<P>For details, see <A href="zonschap.htm">GOPTIONS Statement</A>.<P>

<LI>change the device in the System
Options window.
To do so, type the OPTIONS command on the command line, and in the Graphics
group, choose "Driver settings." You can then enter a Device value. Use the
window's Help button if you need help editing values.<P>

<LI>enter the device name in the DEVICE prompt window.
The DEVICE prompt window opens automatically if you submit a SAS/GRAPH program
that produces graphics output, no device has been specified, and you are running
outside of the SAS Display Manager environment.<P>
</UL>

<P>If you specify a device driver in more than one way,
the most recently specified device driver is used.  The device driver stays
in effect until you specify another device, submit the graphics option RESET=GOPTIONS
or RESET=ALL, or end your SAS session.
<P>If you use the same device driver for most or all of
your SAS/GRAPH programs, you can put
the GOPTIONS DEVICE= statement in an AUTOEXEC file. See the SAS companion
for your operating environment for details on setting up an AUTOEXEC file.
<P>You can also specify a device for previewing or printing
your output with the TARGETDEVICE= graphics option.  For details, see <A href="zardcopy.htm">Printing Graphics Output</A>.
