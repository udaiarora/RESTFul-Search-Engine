      <h2>State's 'snowbird' count estimated at 300,000 or more</h2>
      <p>An estimated 300,000 or more winter residents - popularly known as "snowbirds"
        - were living in Arizona at the height of the 2002-03 winter season,
        according to a study by the Center for Business Research at Arizona State
        University.</p>
      <p>The Center has conducted an annual survey of mobile home/RV/travel trailer
        parks in the Phoenix area for the past 19 years. In 1990-91 the study
        was expanded to include areas outside the Phoenix/Apache Junction area.
        Since then, the survey has included parks in an 11-county region (previous
        research indicated few winter residents in the four northern/eastern
        counties of Apache, Coconino, Navajo, and Greenlee).</p>
      <p>The purpose of the annual winter resident study is to estimate the size
        and the economic contribution of the large number of part-time residents
        who spend the winter season in Arizona, says Dr. Timothy Hogan, Center
        director. "We know that snowbirds also stay in single-family homes, townhouses,
        condominiums, apartments, hotels and motels, with friends and relatives,
        and on public lands. Unfortunately, no equivalent reliable estimate exists
        for the number of Arizona snowbirds staying in accommodations other than
        mobile homes and RV/travel trailer parks."</p>
      <p>Among the findings of this year's survey:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> An estimated 84,000 winter residents lived in Phoenix area
            RV/ travel trailer/ mobile home parks at the height of the 2002-03
          season. An additional 68,000 were living in similar parks outside the
          Phoenix/Apache
            Junction area during the same period.</li>
        <li>The typical seasonal household stayed
              four months and spent an estimated $2,000 per month while in Arizona.
              Based upon these figures, seasonal
              residents staying in area RV/travel trailer/mobile home parks in
          the state spent approximately $340 million during the 2002-03 winter
          season.</li>
        <li> Using the same assumptions, consumer spending by snowbird households
            living in parks in the rest of the study area would have been about
          $270 million. Overall, park snowbirds throughout the state injected
          more than
            $600 million into the Arizona economy during the 2002-03 winter season.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Emerging trends are making it more difficult each year to pinpoint a
        winter visitor population total. There is anecdotal information that
        more snowbirds have apparently moved into second homes, condominiums,
        and apartments in large numbers. Nationwide there are now 3.6 million
        seasonal homes - up from 3.1 million in 1990 and 1.7 million in 1980,
        according
        to 2000 Census figures - and second homes comprised 6 percent of home
        sales in 2001. In the Phoenix area the proportion is much higher - local
        real estate analysts estimate that as many as one-fourth of home sales
        in 2001 were not primary residences.</p>
      <p>Purchases of motor homes and other RV's also have increased in recent
        years, according to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association. Evidence
        of this trend on the Arizona snowbird industry may be the jump in the
        proportion of short-term stays reported in this year's park census.</p>
      <p>"For these and other reasons, estimates of the total snowbird population
        based upon the methodology used in the past are suspect," said Dr. Stephen
        Happel, professor of economics and co-author of the study. "Without much
        more extensive survey work, an accurate count of the total number of
        winter residents is impossible, but taking these kinds of anecdotal information
        into account, a guess of 'more than 300,000' might be a speculative but
        reasonable estimate of the overall snowbird population."</p>
