Carey School of Business is requesting to establish a late processing fee to provide additional services necessary when working professional students apply for MBA programs after the stated deadline of May 1 (for admission to fall classes).&nbsp; When students are admitted after May 1, their materials must be expedited through the processing system, creating a need for temporary clerical workers.&nbsp; The existing program fees in working professional programs cover the costs of books and other materials.&nbsp; Book orders and other materials must be expedited for late applicants so they are prepared when classes begin.&nbsp; A late processing fee would provide a way for students to enroll even if they apply late, and cover additional costs of expedited services. </p><p><strong>W.P. </strong><strong>Carey School </strong><strong> of Business </strong></p><table width="99%"  border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>MBA Program (Working Professionals) <em></em><em></em></td>    <td><em>current</em></td>    <td><em>requested </em></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td><em>Deposit fee </em></td>    <td>$300</td>    <td> $500 </td>  </tr></table><p>The W.P. Carey School of Business is requesting an increase in the deposit amount for the MBA programs to create uniformity by applying it to all students admitted to working professional platforms.&nbsp; It is important to note that the proposed deposit fee for working professional MBA platforms is intended to be applied to tuition payments during the first year of study and will not raise the total cost of the program to students and their employers.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>DIFFERENTIAL TUITION/PROGRAM FEES </strong></p><p><strong>College </strong><strong> of Teacher </strong><strong> Education and Leadership<br></strong>Graduate Program: Master's in Education with Arizona Certification (MAC)<br><em>New Program Fee: $3,000 ($1500 per semester over two semesters)</em></p><p>The College of Teacher Education and Leadership is proposing a new program fee for the Master&rsquo;s in Education with Arizona Certification (MAC).&nbsp; Students receive a master&rsquo;s degree and are eligible for state certification as a teacher after completing this two-semester and one summer session program.&nbsp; The intense nature of the program requires additional instructional costs for accelerated courses, close advising, strong program coordination, and extra supervision in clinical experiences.&nbsp; The program is designed to employ a substantial technology component, which requires the purchase and updating of computers and other hardware as well as appropriate technology training and support for program participants.&nbsp; This will also be used to provide a 15% set aside for financial aid to assist students.</p><p><strong>School of Global Management and Leadership </strong></p><p>Master of Accountancy and Applied Leadership<br>  Master of Applied Leadership and Management<br>  <em>New Program Fee: $10,000 ($1,000 per 3 credit hour course)</em></p><p>The School of Global Management and Leadership is proposing a new program fee for the proposed Master of Accountancy and Applied Leadership and the proposed Master of Applied Leadership and Management.&nbsp; It is anticipated that most students in the graduate programs will be employed in career positions, will have significant work experience, and will receive financial assistance from their employers. &nbsp;The cost of a 30 credit hour Master&rsquo;s program is significantly less than a traditional 48 credit hour MBA program.</p>Funds generated by the program fees will be used to support many initiatives including:&nbsp; investing in emerging classroom technologies and connectivity, increasing student and faculty access to global business, expanding facilities and technology for team-based learning, providing gold-standard psychometric and organizational development instruments, providing managerial behavior laboratory facility for leadership development activities, improving career management placement and advising, scholarships, and to provide a 15% set aside for financial aid to assist students.<p><strong>Sandra Day O'Conner College of Law </strong></p><table width="99%"  border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>Juris Doctorate program</td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td><em>Existing Program Fee Increase</em></td>    <td><em>current</em></td>    <td><em>requested</em></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td>$7250</td>    <td>$8250 </td>  </tr></table><p>The Sandra Day O'Conner College of Law is requesting an existing program fee increase from $7250 to $8250.&nbsp; In April of 2002, ABOR established a three-year range (2003-04; 2004-05; and 2005-06) for further increases for the J.D. programs at Arizona State University and the University of Arizona.&nbsp; The current special program is $7,250, which is $1,000 less than what is permissable in the range established in April of 2002. The College is proposing to increase the special fee $1,000 for all students beginning in 2007-08.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would result in a new special program fee totaling $8,250.</p><p>Funds will be used to make new investments in faculty and programs, to further enhance its basic educational infrastructure including classrooms and information technology, and to market and promote the college to ensure maximum benefit and attention from its renaming.&nbsp;&nbsp; By raising the profile of the college and improving its programs, the college seeks to further elevate its national reputation and standing thereby increasing the earning potential of its graduates.</p><p><strong>W.P. </strong><strong>Carey School </strong><strong> of Business </strong></p><p>Undergraduate Programs<br>  <em>Differential Tuition/Expansion of existing Program Fee to all students admitted directly to the major: $250 per semester</em></p><p> The W.P. Carey School of Business is requesting an extension of the existing undergraduate business professional program fee to include all students admitted to the professional program.&nbsp; In fall 2006, the school began admitting highly qualified freshman directly to the major (Carey Direct).&nbsp; Students will have expanded access to regularly scheduled events for all business students at all class levels, such as speakers from the local and national business community.&nbsp; This will also be used to provide a 15% set aside for financial aid to assist students. </p><p><strong>Walter </strong><strong>Cronkite School </strong><strong> of Journalism and Mass Communication </strong></p><p>Undergraduate Programs<br>  <em>Differential Tuition/New Program Fee: $250 per semester</em></p><p> The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication proposes a new undergraduate program fee.&nbsp; This fee will replace individual class fees currently assessed by the school.&nbsp; The fee will enable the school to keep pace with the accelerating changes in journalism by investing in the technical and digital equipment necessary to give students greatly expanded opportunities to develop their skills.&nbsp; The new program fee would not be used for faculty or general school operations. Resources for that should continue to come exclusively from a combination of university funds and private investments.&nbsp;&nbsp; This revenue source would ensure that the state-of-the-art building and its digital multimedia technologies will be maintained, upgraded and replaced and that students will always have easy access to that critical equipment &ndash; including nights and weekends. No current students would be charged the fee.&nbsp;&nbsp; This fee will apply to new students entering the Cronkite School starting in Fall 2007.&nbsp; The program fee revenue will be used specifically in the following three areas: to maintain, repair, update and replace over the long-term the multi-million dollar state-of-the-art media equipment investment the university is making in the Cronkite School with the opening of the new building in Fall 2008; to pay for additional technical and support staff to maintain the equipment inventory and to make the technology accessible to students at night and on weekends; and to provide a 15% set aside for financial aid to assist students.<strong> &nbsp; </strong></p><p><strong>College </strong><strong> of Science </strong><strong> and Technology </strong></p><p>Air Traffic Management Program <strong></strong>(undergraduate)<br>  <em>New Program Fee: $300 per semester</em></p><p> The Department of Aeronautical Management Technology in the College of Science and Technology is requesting approval for a program fee for the Air Traffic Management program.&nbsp; These fees will be used to acquire and support air traffic enroute simulation devices this equipment will enhance our instructional capabilities enabling the ASU aviation program to prepare its graduates for entry into the community of aviation professionals with all of the knowledge and skill required to meet industry job demands and critical responsibilities.&nbsp; These fees will help to put ASU&rsquo;s Aeronautical Management Technology program in a competitive position unparalleled by any existing university aviation program nationally.&nbsp; This will also be used to provide a 15% set aside for financial aid to assist students. <strong>&nbsp; </strong></p><p><strong>W.P. </strong><strong>Carey School </strong><strong> of Business </strong></p><p>Executive Education programs (non-degree)<br>  <em>Waive non-resident tuition</em></p><p> The W.P. Carey School of Business is requesting a waiver of non-resident tuition for students in the Executive Education non-degree programs.&nbsp; Many working professionals are unable to make a two-year commitment to obtain the MBA degree, and instead desire certificates or blocks of specialized courses for graduate credit.&nbsp; The Arizona Board of Regents has approved waiver of non-resident tuition for working professionals in MBA programs such as the Evening MBA and Executive MBA. This step was taken in response to intense competition from MBA programs in neighboring states where non-resident tuition was waived to attract students regionally. Similarly, the W. P. Carey Executive Education programs serve national markets.&nbsp; The Board has approved a special program fee for non-degree students in W. P Carey Executive Education programs of $500 per graduate business course if the course is taken for academic credit.&nbsp; The program fee covers special services, faculty, and technology for these courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The W.P. Carey School is in an excellent position to be more active in the national Executive Education market, except for the non-resident tuition that non-Arizona working professionals must pay for Executive Education courses taken for non-degree credit. </p><p><strong>Special Class Fees over $50</strong><strong>&nbsp;

Flight instruction is provided by an outside vendor and the cost of flight instruction is over and above ASU tuition. The current Airline Bridge Training program is offered through and agreement with Mesa Airlines.&nbsp; This program is unique in that there is no other program in the country in which students are being trained by an airline (Mesa Pilot Development, our flight provider, is owned by Mesa Air Group, who also owns Mesa Airlines). </p><p>Flight instruction is divided into 6 modules with each module associated with a particular course. It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine a fixed cost that the student will pay for each flight training module, partly because of variables such as fuel costs but mainly because of the variability of the individual student&rsquo;s ability to complete each module successfully. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable --><div id="contactInfo"></div> <!-- end contactInfo div --></td>          </tr>        </table>          </td>        <td width="1%" background="../images/vertical_line_bgd.gif"><img src="../images/spacer_transparent.gif" width="2" height="10" alt=""></td><td width="27%"><div id="readMore"><span class="colheads">READ MORE </span><ul>
