<p><strong>Christopher Sanchez<br>
</strong><em>Assistant Professor, Department of Applied Psychology </em></p>
<p>Dr. Sanchez is originally from Chicago , IL , and completed his undergraduate degree in applied psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2001. He completed his M.A. at the University of Illinois at Chicago in the cognitive psychology program in 2003. Dr. Sanchez completed his Ph.D. entitled, ?Dynamic Spatial Ability and Comprehension of Complex Scientific Topics,? in 2006. Dr. Sanchez's research explores the interaction between cognitive abilities and features of the learning environment in an effort to better understand how people learn. For example, he is interested in how spatial and attention abilities influence how people learn about scientific topics, such as volcanic eruptions. He uses this information to determine different ways to present information to learners of different abilities, to optimize their understanding. Dr. Sanchez is also interested in how learners reconcile and integrate spatial information in general, and how this might cause certain pieces (or types) of information to be prioritized when it comes to developing understanding. He believes that cognitive abilities not only dictate what, but also how we learn, and are integral to the process of designing learning environments that maximize all individuals' learning potential. While pursuing these lines of research, he has employed several different methodologies, including think-aloud protocols, standard behavioral paradigms, advanced statistical modeling techniques, and eyetracking. </p>
