The colleges and departments in assigning faculty duties should recognize that laboratory supervision, direction of <A HREF="acd002.html#student" TARGET="New">student</A> research and independent study, administrative assignments, and approved research and curatorial service in the interest of the university are legitimate partial equivalents of class instruction and legitimate demands upon a faculty member&#146;s time.  Committee assignments, advisement, and university service are assumed as a normal complement of university work, above and beyond regular teaching loads.<P>Under normal circumstances faculty may be absent from the campus for an extended period of time only if they are on an approved leave.  Such leaves are limited to leaves of absence without pay and sabbatical leaves. The policies and procedures governing these leaves are set out in this section of ACD.  Except for leaves for health reasons, ASU does not recognize any other extended leave status.<P>Consistent with this policy, <A HREF="acd002.html#departmentchair" TARGET="New">department chairs</A> and deans have the responsibility for faculty assignments.  It is clear that research, instruction, university service, committee work, and advisement are the responsibilities of faculty.  Variations in assignments between faculty members in a unit is within the authority of the department chair with approval by the dean.  Deans and chairs may allow faculty to limit their involvement in these functions; however, full-time assignment must provide for faculty availability on campus for committee work, student advisement, and other professional duties which may emerge during a semester or academic year.  Assignment to only one function in a way that would permit a faculty member to leave campus for an extended period of time is not consistent with the above policy and would be permissible only on an extraordinary basis and only after prior approval by the chairperson, the dean, and the executive vice president and provost of the university.<P><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Cross-References</B></FONT></CENTER><IMG SRC="acdhr.gif" ALT="[horizontal rule]" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="2"><P>For information on approved leaves, see:<P><OL><LI><A HREF="acd705.html">ACD 705</A>, &#147;Sabbatical Leave&#148;<P>and</LI><P><LI><A HREF="acd707.html">ACD 707</A>, &#147;Leave of Absence without Pay.&#148;</LI></OL><P>&#160;<P><HR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</FONT><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#666666"><A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_top">ACD</A>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">manuals</A> | <A HREF="../search.html" TARGET="_top">Search</A>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<A HREF="acd001.html">contact</A> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<A HREF="provost.html">site</A><P>&#160;<P><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></FONT></CENTER><P>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
