<h1 class="storyhead">President's Professor: Randall Cerveny</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="storyContent" --> 
<p><em><strong>Expert says geography involves more than looking at maps </strong></em></p>
<p>When Randall Cerveny was growing up on a farm in Nebraska, he recalls climbing onto his roof and watching the mighty thunderstorms of the Midwest roll by. His keen interest in storms was an early indication of his precocious intimacy with the heavens, and the sky remains the limit for Cerveny, a professor with ASU's Department of Geography. </p>

        <p><strong>Regents' and President's Professors </strong></p>
        <p>Randall Cerveny is part of the  first class of ASU President's Professors. This new prestigious award, is designed to reward enthusiasm and innovation in teaching, the ability to inspire original and creative work by students, mastery of subject matter and scholarly contributions.</p>
        <p> Inaugural awardees are <a href="../200603/20060309_cerveny.htm">Randall Cerveny</a>, professor of geography; <a href="../200604/20060420_presidents_christie.htm">Alice Christie</a>, associate professor of technology and education; <a href="../200604/20060414_presidents_gould.htm">Ian Gould</a>, professor of chemistry and biochemistry; and the late <a href="../200604/20060427_presidents_rothstein.htm">Paul Rothstein</a>, associate professor of industrial design.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/feature/includes/spring05/readmore/presprof.html">ASU selects inaugural President's Professors</a></p>
        <p>ASU is also honoring six ASU faculty members who have been awarded Regents Professor appointments for 2006. Regents&rsquo; Professors are marked by excellence in teaching, exceptional achievements in research or other creative activities, and national and international distinction in their fields. Named by the Arizona Board of Regents, they serve as advisers to the university president and take on a broader role as consultants and teachers throughout the university.</p>
        <p> The members of this year's Regents' Professor class are: <a href="../200602/20060209_regents_candelaria.htm">Cordelia Candelaria</a>, Chicana and Chicano Studies; <a href="20060323_regents_chavez.htm">Carlos Castillo-Chavez</a>, Mathematics and Statistics Department; <a href="../200602/20060202_regents_montgomery.htm">Douglas Montgomery</a>, Industrial Engineering Department; George Poste, Biodesign Institute and School of Life Sciences; <a href="../200602/20060216_regents_prescott.htm">Edward Prescott</a>, Economics Department, <a href="20060331__regents_windhorst.htm">Rogier Windhorst</a>, Physics and Astronomy Department. </p>

<p align="left">Last April, Cerveny was named as a President's Professor, which recognizes tenured faculty for outstanding contributions to undergraduate education. </p>
<p align="left">Cerveny came to ASU in 1986 after receiving his bachelor's and master's degrees, as well as his doctorate, from the University of Nebraska. While working on his master's degree, Cerveny's adviser was now-ASU geography professor Bob Balling. When Balling heard that a position was opening in the geography department, he contacted Cerveny and asked him if he was interested in filling it. </p>
<p align="left">At the same time, Cerveny received a job offer from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. After some soul searching, he decided it would be best for him and his family to stay in the United States and accept ASU's offer. </p>
<p>&#8220;Our department was much smaller then,&#8221; Cerveny says. &#8220;We were just starting up the meteorology program, and I had a chance to get in on the ground floor and help develop the program.&#8221; </p>
<p>During Cerveny's tenure, the Department of Geography has shifted to a more interdisciplinary focus. Geography expertise often is needed in archaeology, climate analysis, geographical information systems and other related fields. In that vein, Cerveny has witnessed an influx of expert professors and researchers within the department. </p>
<p>A broad array of knowledge is crucial in geography, because geographers never know where the next problem will take them. </p>
<p>&#8220;Geography research changes from day to day,&#8221; Cerveny says. &#8220;For example, a few years ago the Nuclear Regulatory Commission contacted me because it needed a weather forecast to determine whether Yucca Mountain, Nev., would be a suitable repository for nuclear waste. The catch was they needed a forecast for the next 10,000 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The facility has been built, but whether it will be implemented is still being debated in Congress. Cerveny said that it is likely that, at some point, Congress will request that the forecast be expanded to 1 million years. </p>
<p>For Cerveny, the only thing less predictable than the weather is his students, but he welcomes to challenge of helping them explore the world of geography. A year and a half ago, Cerveny worked with a group of graduate students to look at whether various weather-related databases contained concurring data on heat- and cold-related deaths. The students found that many databases gave opposing information, which could have huge consequences for policy making. The group recently published their paper in the <em>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. </em></p>
<p>&#8220;It was wonderful to help with a student project that reached such important conclusions,&#8221; Cerveny says. </p>
<p>Students who have worked with Cerveny have gone on to making their mark in a number of highly competitive positions with the National Weather Service, including two with the Phoenix office, Cerveny says. Others have gone to work for various state agencies or have become professors themselves, but all have been successful in their craft. </p>
<p>The next big step for Cerveny will be assisting in the growth of the geography program as it changes from a department into a school. Tentatively named the School of Geographical Sciences, the new school will remain a part of ASU's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The change will offer students more opportunities and will allow researchers to develop new avenues of investigation, Cerveny says. </p>
<p>Cerveny's goal is to educate people on the significance of geographical sciences who might otherwise misinterpret the field as just looking at maps. To that end, Cerveny recently published a book of weird weather occurrences named &#8220;Freaks of the Storm: From Flying Cows to Stealing Thunder.&#8221; The book aims to get people interested in geography through a topic familiar to everyone: weather. </p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people don't really know what geography is,&#8221; Cerveny says. &#8220;It's studying interaction between people and their environment, so it's a science that is important to everybody.&#8221;</p>
