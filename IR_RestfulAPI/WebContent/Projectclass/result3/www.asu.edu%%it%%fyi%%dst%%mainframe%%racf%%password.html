FUNCTION
          5740-XXH  (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 1987

  The PASSWORD command allows you to change your own current password
  and password change interval.

 In addition, you may reset another user's password if you are the
 owner of the other user, have the SPECIAL attribute, or group-SPECIAL
 authority in the group owning the the user.  If you have the SPECIAL
 attribute or group-SPECIAL authority in the group owning the user,
 you may also change another user's password interval or set a
 password interval that never expires.


SYNTAX

          PASSWORD   PASSWORD(current-password new-password)
                     INTERVAL(change-interval) |
                       NOINTERVAL
                     USER(userid...)

   REQUIRED - None.
   DEFAULTS - If interval is specified with no value given, the
              interval will default to the installation-specified
              maximum.
   ALIAS    - PW
   NOTES    - 1) If the PASSWORD keyword is specified with no values
                 given you will be prompted for the passwords in print
                 inhibit mode.
              2) If the USER operand and the PASSWORD operand are
                 specified together, the password is reset (rather than
                 being changed).
              3) Password changes will not be done for users with the
                 NOPASSWORD attribute.


OPERANDS

  INTERVAL(change-interval)
      Specifies the number of days that your password is valid.  The
      number of days must be 1 or more, with the upper limit specified
      by the installation, less than or equal to 254.

  NOINTERVAL
      Specifies that the specified userid will have a password that
      does not expire.  In order to specify this keyword, you must
      have the SPECIAL attribute or group-SPECIAL authority in the
      group owning the user.

  USER(userid...)
      Specifies one or more userids.  The user's current password is
      set to the user's default group name and the password set
      expired.  In order to specify this operand, you must be the
      owner of the user, have the SPECIAL attribute, or have the
      group-SPECIAL attribute in the group owning the user.  Do not
      specify this operand when you are changing your own password.

  PASSWORD(current-password new-password)
      Specifies the current value of the password and the new value to
      become the password.  Each must be 1 to 8 alphanumeric or
      national characters.  This operand only updates your password.
      PSWD is an alias for this keyword.  The syntax requirements on
      the password may be further qualified if the installation has
      specified special syntax rules.

  ICH08001I userid NOT DEFINED TO RACF

            Explanation:  The indicated userid was not found in the
            RACF data base.

  ICH08002I NEW PASSWORD CANNOT EQUAL CURRENT PASSWORD

            Explanation:  The new password specified must be different
            than the current password.

            System Action:  The password is not changed.

  ICH08003I INTERVAL NOT IN RANGE 1-nnn

            Explanation:  The password change-interval must be greater
            than 0 and less than nnn which is the
            installation-specified maximum.

            System Action:  The interval is not changed.

  ICH08004I COMMAND ENDED DUE TO ERROR

            Explanation:  A RACF manager error occurred.  This message

  ICH08007I NOT AUTHORIZED TO CHANGE PASSWORD/INTERVAL FOR userid

            Explanation:  You cannot change a password or a password

            password unless you have the SPECIAL attribute.

            System Action:  The password is not changed.

  ICH08008I userid NOT DEFINED TO USE A PASSWORD

            Explanation:  The indicated userid is defined to RACF but
            does not require a password to enter the system.

            System Action:  No command processing is performed.

  ICH08009I PASSWORD OPERAND IGNORED

            Explanation:  This is the first part of a two-part message
            that indicates that the installation password exit
            (ICHPWX01) has rejected the character string you specified

  ICH08013I PASSWORD AND INTERVAL CHANGES FOR id REJECTED BY

            Explanation:  This is the first of a two-part message that

            and PASSWORD keywords (on the PASSWORD command).

            System Action:  RACF terminates the command.  Message
            ICH08012I follows this message.
