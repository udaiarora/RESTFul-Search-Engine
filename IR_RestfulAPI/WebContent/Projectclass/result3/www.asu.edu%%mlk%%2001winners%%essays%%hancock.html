&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Stephanie, I'd like you to meet someone.  His name is Darren and he's my new friend, &#147; my brother said while prying a young sandy haired boy from behind him who had been tangled between his legs.  I followed my brother's lead and introduced myself to Darren as Tyler's sister.  I'd get the explanation behind the little boy later.  I watched in awe as my brother took Darren by the hand and showed him our backyard trampoline.  Little did Tyler know that he was showing a young life the world.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother is by no means a renowned genius, a hilarious comedian, or a gorgeous model, but there is one thing he necer ceases to be&#133;an amazement to everyone he encounters.  I've always known that my brother had a huge heart, but I never knew he was this incredibly special.  One day when my brother was playing basketball at the local YMCA, he passed by the community service baord. Although Tyler never had stopped to notice the flyers before, the paper with the picture of the sad little boy holding his basketball caught Tyler's attention.  Taking his already soiled towel and wiping his sweaty face to get a better look at the flyer, Tyler read about Darren.  Earlier in the year, Darren had lost his father to a heart attack, and his mother wanted some sort of male role model in his life.  Tyler hurriedly ripped the flyer from the board and took it home, leaving a trace of the paper stuck to the staple which held it in place.  Tyler soon began to pick up Darren four times a week, taking him to places like goofy golf and Peter Piper Pizza.  The once mysterious and shy boy soon became lively and  cheery.  My brother never failed to take him places, talk to him about his father, make him laugh, and just be there for him.  At only 17 years of age, Tyler even took Darren to a father/son sleepover at Darren's friend's house, which was difficult for both of them.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first month had passed Darren's mother opened her shaky yet grateful hands and handed Tyler 400 crumpled dollars.  &#147;Thank you for everything.  Thank you for brinning my little boy back.  Thank you for setting such a wonderful example for him,&#148; she said.  Without hesitation, my brother handed the small fortune back to her.  After a year of being friends with the little boy, my brother turned down every payment.  &#147;It's my pleasure, &#147; he always repeated, &#147;It's my pleasure.&#148;</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
