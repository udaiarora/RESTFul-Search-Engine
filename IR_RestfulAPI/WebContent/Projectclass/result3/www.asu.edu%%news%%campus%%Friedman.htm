          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Friedman to lead College of
            Public Programs</h2>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            ASU President Michael Crow has announced that Debra Friedman, a senior administrator at the University of Washington, has been named dean of ASU&rsquo;s College of Public Programs.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            Friedman, who will lead the college&rsquo;s effort to enhance its academic excellence and achieve far-reaching social relevance, has been at Washington since 1994, where she served as director of special projects, development and alumni relations.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><img src="campus_images/Debra_Friedman.jpg" width="180" height="260" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"><br>
&quot;Debra has a deep belief in the power of university education and research,&rdquo; Crow says. &ldquo;She is entrepreneurial and innovative, and has great interest in helping solve the social problems of the surrounding community. Those qualities make her a perfect fit for ASU and the ideal person to lead our College of Public Programs.&rdquo;</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            Friedman previously served as associate provost for academic planning (1998 &ndash; 2003) and associate and assistant dean, office of undergraduate education (1994 &ndash; 1997). Since 1995 she also has been affiliate associate professor of public affairs and sociology at Washington.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            In explaining why she was eager to accept this appointment, Friedman says, &ldquo;ASU is undertaking a grand experiment, one that I think is essential for the future of higher education. The traditional basis of public higher education has changed profoundly and few universities understand this. ASU, under President Crow, is one of the few that does understand. Being a part of this grand experiment is one of the most important things anyone with an interest in the future of higher education could be doing now.&rdquo;</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
            She also sees a clear mission for the College of Public Programs in this experiment.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
&quot;The college has a connection to urgent social issues and has a rapidly expanding body of trans-disciplinary expertise in these areas,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Communities also are advancing their knowledge and better articulating their concerns. Public Programs has a special responsibility to bring these concerns and expertise together. The college&rsquo;s new location at the Downtown Phoenix campus will help transform the relationship between the university and community.&rdquo;</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
              At the University of Washington, Friedman managed university planning and vision initiatives, administering two innovation funds that had a transformational impact on education and research across the university.<br>
              One center she helped launch brought five colleges together to examine social problems, such as poverty and health care disparities, with new analytical methods and databases. Under her leadership, a digital arts and media center was established, offering the first doctorate in the world in that field, and a center for nanotechnology that capitalized 20 times over its initial investment.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
              She also directed strategic analyses for the president and provost, was responsible for university enrollment management and managed a number of units, including academic advising and educational assessment. <br>
              As associate dean for undergraduate education, she increased by a factor of 10 the participation of undergraduates in faculty research. As director of special projects, development and alumni relations, Friedman directed the public launch of a $2 billion fundraising campaign and coordinated campaign communications.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
              Friedman, who taught at the University of Arizona and the University of Iowa, received her bachelor&rsquo;s degree from Adelphi University (1976), and her master&rsquo;s and doctorate from Washington (1979 and 1983), all in sociology.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0;"><br>
              She is the author of numerous scholarly articles and the book, &ldquo;Toward a Structure of Indifference: The Social Origins of Material Custody&rdquo; (New York: Aldine de Gruyter 1995), and she also has won distinguished teaching awards at the University of Washington and the University of Arizona. She was a National Fellow at the Hoover Institute at Stanford University. She has also been a visiting scholar at the Australian National University and the Russell Sage Foundation. </p>
