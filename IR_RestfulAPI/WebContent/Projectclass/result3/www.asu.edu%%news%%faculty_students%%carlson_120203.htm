      <h2>Book collaboration comes as surprise to ASU professors</h2>
      <p>When Professor Ron Carlson received his latest book, "A Kind of Flying,"
          from W.W. Norton Publishing House, he did what he normally does with
        it, gave it to his wife, to whom most of his books are dedicated.</p>
      <p>When
            Regents Professor Mark Klett received his copy he immediately sent
            his old acquaintance Carlson an e-mail congratulating him on the
        book and letting Carlson know that he was pleased to have his photo on
        the
          cover.</p>
      <p>"I don't really look at the book when I received it and definitely
          not the fine print on the back of the book," says Carlson, "so when
        I got
          the e-mail from Mark I was totally surprised."</p>
      <p>Last spring Norton's Editor-at-Large
          Carol Houck Smith sent Carlson a possible image selected by an art
        director for the cover of the book. </p>
      <p>"It was very funny but not right at all for me, it was too broad." says
          Carlson.</p>
      <p>Norton's art director selected two more images for Carlson
          to review, both of which were photographs. One was Klett's work, though
          Carlson
            did not know it at the time.</p>
      <p>"I put both images up in the living room
          at home, and my family voted on which of the two they liked," says
        Carlson. "Mark's won, unanimously.
          We wanted the cover to be quirky with some elegance. Mark's photo just
          worked."</p>
      <p>"It's nice to know it was a 'blind' selection, that is, he wasn't
          being partial because we know each other," says Klett.</p>
      <p>Carlson and Klett initially
          met in 1988 on the softball field when some of the faculty from the
        then College of Fine Arts invited some of the
          English Department faculty to play on a team. </p>
      <p>"All these years later,
          I never thought we would be collaborating with each other on a project,
          and of course we did not even know it until
        after the fact," says Carlson.</p>
      <p>Klett's images of the American West have
          appeared in countless magazines and covers of books, including another
          book by an ASU professor. </p>
      <p>"My
          panorama of the Grand Canyon was used as the cover of Professor Stephen
          Pyne's book 'How the Canyon Became Grand,'" Klett says. "Stephen was
          not aware it was my photo that the publisher chose until after the
        fact."</p>
      <p>Carlson's
          books are usually in the literary fiction genre. One of his works,
        "The News of the World," was described by Alida Becker of The
          Washington Post, as "An exuberant, wise and wonderfully inventive evocation
          of the kinds of love and longing that never go out of style.It's a
        story like 'Life Before Science' that conveys best the blend of tragicomedy,
          sheer optimism, sharp perception, and almost manic energy that makes
          Carlson's works so distinctive - and so appealing." </p>
      <p>"A Kind of Flying,"
          Carlson's eighth book of fiction, is a compilation of three of his
        earlier books of short stories - "The News of the World,"
          "Plan B for the Middle Class," and "The Hotel Eden." </p>
      <p>A book signing is
          planned for noon, Dec. 2, at the ASU Bookstore. For information, call
          (480) 965-7928.</p>
