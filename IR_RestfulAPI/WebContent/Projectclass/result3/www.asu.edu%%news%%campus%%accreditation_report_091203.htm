      <h2>ASU receives high praise, continuing accreditation for 10 years </h2>
      <p>More
          than two years of effort - capping a decade of careful planning, attention
          to priorities and excellent leadership - have paid off in a
          big way for the university. ASU Main and East have received continuing
          accreditation until 2013 from the Higher Learning Commission of the
        North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA). </p>
      <p>A glowing report by
          the evaluation team that visited last spring commended ASU for many
        things, including its student development, outreach to the
          community, improved external support, attractive campuses, cooperative
          relationships to other Arizona institutions and its strength.</p>
      <p>"ASU has
          a strong sense of itself as a major metropolitan research university.
          Its plans for the future rest on this secure base," according to the
          report.</p>
      <p>ASU received accreditation without further follow-up progress
          reports or focused visits, unlike 70 percent of NCA institutions throughout
          the
          country. NCA accredits colleges in 19 states.</p>
      <p>"The outcomes of the institutional
          review are extraordinary. We didn't just barely make it over the bar
          for accreditation, we leaped over the
          bar," says Sarah Lindquist, assistant dean for academic accreditation
          in the Graduate College. "This report gives high accolades for the
        way the university has been managed over the last 10 years, and shows
        we
          are on a sharp trajectory upward under President Crow's leadership."</p>
      <p>The
          commission also indicated ASU may open new international sites without
          prior approval, a rare authorization given to few institutions. </p>
      <p>"This
          shows that the evaluation team found convincing evidence that ASU has
          built an extensive internal review process that works to sustain
          quality assurance in its programs, and that it has confidence in our
          ability to sustain this quality in the future," says Milton Glick,
        executive vice president and provost of the university. "It is a vote
        of confidence
          in the health and direction of the university and a tribute to the
        hard work of the steering committee, headed by Self-Study Coordinator
        Dan
          Jankowski."</p>
      <p>Much of the success can be attributed to planning and preparation,
          says Maria T. Allison, interim dean of the Graduate College and university
          accreditation officer. A 40-member steering committee and more than
        200 people on 10 working teams oversaw a comprehensive and candid self-study,
          and held open forums for input from faculty, staff, students and community
          leaders.</p>
      <p>"ASU's commitment to its students is evident in the myriad of
          programs it has developed to serve its various student populations,"
          the report
          said. "The team was impressed by the support that ASU enjoys among
        its minority graduates, and suggests that they might serve as mentors
        to
          encourage students to enroll and persist."</p>
      <p>The report addressed strategies
          of increasing quality while also increasing size. Having a larger student
          body can help, not hinder, the increase
          in quality among the faculty, since the size of the student body will
          provide the base on which to expand the expertise of the faculty, the
          team said. </p>
      <p>"ASU has wisely tailored its aspirations to the environment
          for higher education within the State of Arizona," the report said.
        "For example,
          it seeks to cooperate with the University of Arizona in building up
        the health care education and research capabilities of the state, rather
          than embarking on a path to create duplicative programs. ASU's urban
          location means it can bring to the table other resources that are not
          available to the other two state universities."</p>
      <p>Other noteworthy accomplishments
          and progress over the past decade cited in the report were:</p>
      <p>. Achieving Carnegie "doctoral/research universities
          extensive" status, increasing grant expenditures and expanding philanthropic
          activities.<br>
        . Committing to students through student development, living and learning
          communities.<br>
        . Impressive growth at the downtown campus, which will continue through
          joint biotechnology enterprise with UA.<br>
        . Community outreach - faculty and staff are active in a broad array
          of regional programs.<br>
        . Being a leader in developing cooperative relationships with UA and
        NAU.</p>
      <p>The evaluation team found evidence of innovative or exemplary practices
          as far as morale and collegiality, effective technology, data warehouse
          for planning and policy making, Native American programs, Honors College
        and self-supporting international programs.</p>
      <p>The team was made up of 12
          chancellors, deans and professors from several universities, including
          UCLA, Ohio State, University of Illinois, Purdue,
          University of Colorado and University of Wisconsin. The final evaluation
        team report and the ASU self-study report are available online at (http://hlc2003.asu.edu).</p>
