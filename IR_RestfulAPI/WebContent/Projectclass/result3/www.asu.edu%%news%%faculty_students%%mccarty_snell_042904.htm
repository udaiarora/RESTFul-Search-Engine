      <h2>McCarty becomes first Snell Professor of Education Policy Studies </h2>
      <p>Teresa L. McCarty has been appointed the Alice Wiley Snell Professor of Education Policy Studies within ASU's College of Education. McCarty, currently professor of language, reading and culture at the University of Arizona (UofA), is the first to be appointed to this endowed chair, which was created for a scholar with a distinguished record of research in policy studies related to the education of underserved populations. </p>
      <p>"Dr. McCarty's credentials as a researcher in this important area of study are impressive," says Eugene E. Garcia, vice president for university-school partnerships and dean of the College of Education. </p>
      <p>McCarty has dedicated her work to language planning and policy affecting Native Americans, and more broadly, to issues of bilingual/multicultural education and minority language and education rights. She has set for herself a research agenda that most recently has centered on her service as co-principal investigator on a major grant through the Institute of Education Sciences to study the educational impacts and policy implications of native language loss and revitalization. She will complete this work at ASU and, as Snell Professor, anticipates expanding her work on minority education and language rights to include a broader international context. </p>
      <p>In addition to her contributions to the field of education as a scholar, McCarty is an experienced administrator who has held several leadership positions including interim dean of the College of Education, co-director of the American Indian Language Development Institute and department head of the Department of Language, Reading and Culture at the UofA. </p>
      <p>"Dr. McCarty's record as a researcher and university administrator speaks to her ability to work with diverse stakeholders around educational issues, including practitioners, policy makers, elected officials and diverse communities," Garcia says. "Clearly, she will be an invaluable asset to our college and university when she assumes her new position in August." </p>
      <p>"Over the past several years, I've watched the development of ASU's College of Education with growing admiration. It's clear that this is a college with visionary leadership and a strong commitment to excellence and diversity," McCarty says. "The Snell professorship offers a tremendous opportunity to grow professionally, to work with the many outstanding scholars here, and to engage with Native American Communities in the Southwest, an area that has been the focus of my work in language planning policy for more than 20 years," McCarty adds. </p>
      <p>"I hope to contribute to ASU's role as a pre-eminent program in American Indian education, and to work with colleagues here on an educational anthropology initiative. The people, resources, and opportunities are all here, and it's a very exciting time to be at ASU." </p>
      <p>McCarty's decision to join ASU as the Snell Professor is a homecoming of sorts. She holds master's and doctoral degrees in social-cultural anthropology from ASU. Her bachelor's degree in anthropology with a minor in child development was earned at Ohio State University. </p>
