Written for designers, programmers, and users of SAS applications, this    book shows how to build client/server database applications through
table-driven technology. Each chapter addresses these three                different audiences, detailing ways to construct high-quality, reliable
applications that are easy to maintain. The "code-free" approach offers    you flexibility in design, reduces development time, and provides the
advantages of integrated data dictionaries, user-defined integrity         rules, and trigger-message mechanisms that implement and manage data
processing. With the many realistic examples included here, experienced    users who build or regularly use SAS applications can master techniques
of application development and data analysis that are straightforward      and powerful.
