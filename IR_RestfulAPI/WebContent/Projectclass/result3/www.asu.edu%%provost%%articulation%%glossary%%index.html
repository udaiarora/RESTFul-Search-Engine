			<p><a name="ABC"></a><strong>AGEC</strong> - See <em>Arizona                 General Education Curriculum</em> </p>
			<p> <strong>AGEC in Progress</strong> - A student classification or status defined by the Academic Advising  Articulation Task Force to exist when a student's completed courses,  plus the courses in which the student is currently enrolled, together  will satisfy AGEC (see Arizona General Education Curriculum)  requirements. Upon successful completion of the final courses,  certification of the AGEC, and submission of final transcripts from all  institutions attended, students will be given an unconditional admit  status to ASU. </p>
			<p> <strong>Acceptability</strong> - The process of determining which higher education courses will                 transfer to ASU. </p>
			<p> <strong>Applicability</strong> - The process of determining how community college coursework applies  to degree requirements in specific programs of study at ASU. </p>
			<p> <strong>Arizona General Education                 Curriculum</strong> - Arizona public community colleges and universities have agreed upon a  common structure for a transfer general education curriculum. This  curriculum provides students attending any Arizona public community  college with the opportunity to build a general education curriculum  that is transferable upon completion without loss of credit to another  Arizona public community college or university. Arizona resident  students attending an Arizona community college who are identified to  ASU as nearing completion of an AGEC will receive an exemption from  normal admissions standards and be given conditional admit status to  ASU. </p>
			<p> <strong>Articulation</strong> - The process of  determining the transfer and applicability of courses from one  institution of higher education to another. </p>
			<p><strong>Associate in Transfer                 Partnership Degree (ATP)</strong> - It is an associate degree offered by an Arizona Public Community  College based on a transfer Articulation agreement with Arizona State  University (ASU). It is for students who have identified a major and  plan to transfer to ASU. It parallels the program of study for the  Freshman and Sophomore lower division degree requirements at ASU. The  Associate in Transfer Partnership degree provides for exemption from  ASU admission requirements for students who complete the degree with a  minimum 2.0 on a 4.0=A for Arizona residents and a minimum 2.5 for  non-residents. The ATP degree does not assure admission to any specific  program at ASU. </p>
			<p> <strong>ATP</strong> - See <em>Associate                 in Transfer Partnership degree</em> </p>
			<p> <strong>CAS</strong> - See <em>Course                 Applicability System</em> </p>
			<p> <strong>CEG</strong> - See <em>Course                 Equivalency Guide</em> </p>
			<p> <strong>Common Courses</strong> - Common courses are lower-division courses that will apply toward your  selected degree at an Arizona public university. These common courses  provide you with the option of taking classes that will apply toward  your degree even if you are unsure which AZ public university you will  attend. </p>
			<p> <strong>Course Applicability                 System</strong> - CAS is a web based tool designed to assist you in selecting courses  and in monitoring your progress toward completing any of the "blocks"  or transfer degrees. By entering the courses you have taken at the  community colleges or the courses you plan to take, you can: determine  the course that is equivalent to your community college coursework at  the university; monitor your progress toward completing the AGEC for  your community college; determine how the courses you have taken will  apply toward the completion of a particular bachelor's degree at the  universities; plan ahead and choose courses that will take apply toward  a Bachelor's Degree from one of the public universities in Arizona </p>
			<p> <strong>Course Equivalency                 Guide</strong> - The Course Equivalency Guide (CEG) shows how Arizona public community  college coursework is accepted at ASU, NAU, and U of A as well as  General Studies areas satisfied by the courses. It does NOT indicate  how a course transfers to a specific degree program. (If you need to  know how coursework transfers to specific degree programs, see Transfer  Guides.) Course equivalencies are "year specific" meaning that in order  to see if coursework will transfer, you must review the Course  Equivalency Guide for the year in which you took the course at the  community college. </p>
			<p> <strong>Curriculum Checksheet</strong> - A document listing courses required for graduation from a specific                 degree program. <a name="DEF">&nbsp;</a><br>
            </p>
			<p> <strong>DARS</strong> - See <em>Degree                 Audit Reporting System</em> </p>
			<p> <strong>Degree Audit</strong> - A degree audit is an automated record which matches courses a student  has completed with the requirements of a particular academic degree  program. </p>
			<p> <strong>Degree Audit Reporting                 System</strong> - DARS stands for Degree Audit Reporting System. DARS is a degree audit  system developed by Miami University in Ohio. DARS is one of many  degree audit systems, but was selected for ASU because it includes  transfer work (transfer articulation) and allows us extensive  flexibility in designing audits. </p>
			<p> <strong>Equivalent</strong> - Equivalency means that a course is regarded as fulfilling the  requirement of the corresponding course at the university. It does not  mean that a community college course is identical to the university  course. <a name="GHI">&nbsp;</a><br>
            </p>
			<p> <strong>General Studies Requirements</strong> - All undergraduate students must complete a minimum of 35 semester  hours of approved General Studies courses. Some colleges, departments,  or majors have distribution or other requirements which may influence  students' course selections. Check with an advisor before selecting  courses to fulfill the General Studies requirement. <a name="JKL">&nbsp;</a><br>
            </p>
			<p> <strong>Lower Division Courses</strong> - Courses numbered 100-299. <a name="MNO">&nbsp;</a><br>
                <a name="PQR">&nbsp;</a><br>
            </p>
			<p> <strong>Pathways</strong> - See <em>Transfer Pathways</em> <a name="STU">&nbsp;</a><br>
            </p>
			<p> <strong>TG/XR</strong> - One of                 the <a href="http://az.transfer.org/cgi-bin/WebObjects/ATF.woa/wa/DegreePathwayQuery">Transfer                 Pathways</a> available to Arizona Public Community College students. Stands for  "Transfer Guide - Exceptional Requirements." There are six different  pathways you may follow, depending upon the degree you choose to  pursue. Pathways are designed so that all credits included in the  pathway will apply toward graduation in the baccalaureate majors with  which the pathway articulates. </p>
			<p> <strong>Transfer Pathways</strong> - For each university baccalaureate degree, there is a pathway you  should follow while attending the community college. Each pathway may  be comprised of four components: </p>
			<ul>
              <li>
                <p>AGEC </p>
              </li>
			  <li>
                <p>Transfer degrees </p>
		      </li>
			  <li>
                <p>Language proficiency:                     Some degrees require proficiency in a language other than English. </p>
		      </li>
			  <li>
                <p>Common  courses: the lower division courses that would apply or be required for  the baccalaureate degrees. <br>
                  Following a pathway will ensure  transferability and applicability of your AZ community college courses. </p>
		      </li>
		    </ul>
			<p> <strong>TPD</strong> - See <em>Transfer                 Partnership Degree</em> </p>
			<p> <strong>Transfer Partnership                 Degree</strong> - Each of the AZ community colleges will offer Associate Degrees  appropriate for transfer to Arizona's public universities. These  Associate Degrees are generally 60 - 64 semester credits and have four  basic "blocks" upon which they are built. These blocks include: the  Arizona General Education Curriculum, Common Courses, Special  Requirements, and Electives. If you complete the degree, you will be  guaranteed to enter the university with Junior status. </p>
			<p> <strong>Transfer Guide</strong> - Transfer Guides show how Arizona public community college coursework  applies to specific degree programs at ASU. Transfer value of a course,  including general studies value, is "term specific" meaning that in  order to see if coursework will apply, you must review the transfer  guide for the term in which you took the course at the community  college. </p>
			<p> <strong>Transferable</strong> - The ability of a course to transfer to ASU. </p>
