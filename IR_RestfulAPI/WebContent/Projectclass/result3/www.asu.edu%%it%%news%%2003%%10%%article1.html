                <h2>The State Of <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> At 
                <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym></h2>

<p>From the recently-completed multi-ton, multi-million dollar supercomputing system, to a 
$22 million campus technology upgrade, measurable changes are happening now and on 
the horizon for <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym>.  The 
<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> department is moving ahead in 2003-04 with several 
projects to strengthen the campus communications and computing structure, according to 
Dr. William Lewis, <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym>'s Chief Information Officer and Vice Provost.</p> 
 
<p>Lewis spoke to the Computer Consultants Cooperative and the Windows Networking 
Users Group in September regarding <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym>'s present 
and future technology plans. The "State of <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> at 
<acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym>" speech is an annual tradition for the 
<acronym title="Computer Consultants Cooperative">CCC</acronym> networking group.</p>

<p>Lewis described the proposed campus infrastructure changes as including an upgrade of 
telecommunications wiring. On the Main Campus, old network cabling would be upgraded to current
specifications, and additional duct banks would be added to acommodate campus expansion. The project 
will be paid by bond issuance.</p>

<p>Recently completed by <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> 
<acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> was the installation of a massive new parallel processing 
computing system for <acronym title="Translational Genomics Research Institute">TGen</acronym>, the 
Translational Genomics Research Institute, and the International Genomics Consortium 
(<acronym title="International Genomics Consortium">IGC</acronym>). Lewis said because of the size and 
complexity of the system, it was immediately ranked among the world's top 500 most 
powerful supercomputers. The system will be used in research on the human genome in 
support of developing new treatments for diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's 
disease.</p>

<p>The Arizona Board of Regents now requires a review process for technology project 
funding. Lewis said an advisory committee reporting to him is expected to take an active 
role in the process. Approval requirements will vary in four steps, based on the dollar 
levels of expenditure. Exceptions to the approval requirements are expected to include campus 
construction, projects funded by Proposition 301, and technology purchased as part of 
grant-funded research. However, notification to the <acronym title="Chief Information Officer">CIO</acronym> 
of technology projects would be appreciated even when reviews are not required.</p>

<p>The <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> administrative advisory committees 
are being restructured. The restructure will eliminate inactive groups and combine others, leaving 
three committees including a newly-formed <acronym title="Chief Information Officer">CIO</acronym> 
Advisory Committee.  The changes will not affect campus computer networking groups such as the 
<acronym title="Computer Consultants Cooperative">CCC</acronym>.</p>

<p>Lewis said he wants to encourage continued communication from faculty regarding 
classroom concerns. He praised the work of the Classroom Support teams, saying that 
with preventative maintenance the teams have dramatically reduced the number of 
complaints compared to previous years. He said <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> 
faculty are pleased with the responsiveness on calls for service, but he added that receiving no complaints would have 
him worried, as  "no one is that good, that there are no problems."</p>

<p>Questions from the audience prompted discussion on several topics. Asked whether 
Internet connection speeds would increase after the cable upgrade, Lewis cautioned that 
the speed of the computer being used would still be a limiting factor, however fast the 
network system becomes. Regarding recent computer virus outbreaks, Lewis said they 
have been a problem at <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> as well as 
elsewhere, but the university has not had as much difficulty containing them as some private 
corporations. He mentioned there would be increased focus on business continuity and security planning, 
and these topics would be of concern not just in central <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> 
but across the university. "Security is everyone's concern at 
<acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym>," Lewis said.</p>
