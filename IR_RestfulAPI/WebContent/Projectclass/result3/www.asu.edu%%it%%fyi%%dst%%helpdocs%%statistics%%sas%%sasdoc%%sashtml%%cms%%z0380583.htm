<P>SAS provides the CONTENTS, COPY, and DATASETS procedures
to facilitate the management of SAS data libraries and files.  Host-specific
aspects of these procedures are described in <A href="z0395506.htm">Procedures in the CMS Environment</A>.  For complete discussions of these and
other SAS utility procedures, see  



<B>SAS Procedures Guide</B>.  The SAS procedures are described briefly
in this section and are compared to the CMS commands that perform similar
functions.

Both the CONTENTS procedure and the CONTENTS statement in the DATASETS procedure
can list all SAS files in a SAS library. The CONTENTS procedure can also retrieve
the descriptor information at the beginning of a SAS data set.</A>
<P>To compare the file information that is generated by
the CMS FILELIST command with the information that is generated by PROC CONTENTS,
see <A href="#zlsas-o1">Sample Output from the CMS FILELIST Command</A>
and <A href="#zlsas-o2">Sample Output from the CONTENTS Procedure</A>.
Output 4.1 on page 34 illustrates the file information that is displayed by
issuing the following CMS FILELIST command 





<PRE>filelist * mylib a</PRE>
<P>This command, issued in CMS subset mode, requests a
listing of all files on the A disk that have the filetype MYLIB.

<P>
<P>Compare the CMS filenames that are listed by the CMS
FILELIST command with the SAS filenames that are listed by the CONTENTS procedure.
 For example, look at the information for SAS file RANCH in <A href="#zlsas-o2">Sample Output from the CONTENTS Procedure</A> 



.  You see that its memtype is VIEW.  Now look at the information in <A href="#zlsas-o1">Sample Output from the CMS FILELIST Command</A> 



.  You see an entry for a CMS file with a filename of 3RANCH.  CMS recognizes
the SAS file RANCH as 3RANCH because SAS added the prefix 3 to the filename
so that it could recognize the file's SAS filetype. (See <A href="z0380868.htm#z-prefix">SAS Filename Restrictions</A> 



for more information about prefix characters.)
<P>When you use SAS utilities to manage your SAS files,
you do not need to be concerned about the prefix.  But when you use CMS commands,
you must use the prefix.

<P><A name="z0592736">&#13;
The best ways to copy SAS files are with the SAS COPY procedure or with the
COPY statement of the DATASETS procedure.  However, sometimes it is possible
to use CMS commands.  CMS commands cannot convert SAS files to and from tape
format; they cannot read DDnames that begin with TAPE. But you can use CMS
commands to copy SAS files in the following ways: </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>The COPYFILE command can copy SAS files from minidisk
to minidisk.<P>

<LI>The MOVEFILE command can copy SAS files from minidisk
to minidisk, from tape to tape, from minidisk to tape, or from tape to minidisk.
 If you move a disk-format SAS file to tape with the MOVEFILE command, the
SAS file cannot be accessed until it is moved back to a minidisk with the
MOVEFILE command.<P>

<LI>The DISK DUMP command punches a SAS file to the
virtual card punch. The DISK LOAD command restores a file that was punched
with the DISK DUMP command to its original form.<P>

<LI>The TAPE or VMFPLC2 DUMP command dumps disk files
to tape. The TAPE or VMFPLC2 LOAD command restores disk files that were written
to tape by the TAPE or VMFPLC2 DUMP commands.  If you dump any SAS file to
tape with the TAPE or VMFPLC2 DUMP commands, the SAS file cannot be accessed
until it is restored to a minidisk with the TAPE or VMFPLC2 LOAD commands.<P>
</UL>

<P>If you use a CMS command, remember to include any prefix
characters in the CMS filename. (See <A href="z0380868.htm#z-prefix">SAS Filename Restrictions</A> 



for information about prefix characters.)  For example, to copy the SAS data
view PROJCTS MONTHLY into another SAS data view using the CMS COPYFILE command,
you can issue the following command:    

<PRE>copy 3projcts monthly a 3rhouse monthly b</PRE>
<P>When you use the CMS COPYFILE command to copy a SAS
data set that has an index file associated with it, be sure to copy the index
file as well.

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">Deleting SAS Files</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P><A name="z0592743">&#13; The SAS DATASETS procedure deletes and renames
disk-format SAS
files. You can also use the CMS ERASE command to delete some or all members
of a SAS data library.  For example, suppose you create a catalog called MYLIB.DATASCR
(CMS file 0DATASCR MYLIB) that contains FSEDIT screens as entries. In a PROC
FSEDIT statement you specify the SAS name for the file, which is the CMS filename
without the prefix 0. For example, you can issue the following statement:
   
</A>
<PRE>proc fsedit data=mylib.houses screen=mylib.hscreen;</PRE>
<P>But if you want to use the CMS ERASE command, specify
the CMS filename 0HSCREEN, as in the following example:    

<PRE>ERASE 0HSCREEN MYLIB A</PRE>
<P>(See <A href="z0380868.htm#z-prefix">SAS Filename Restrictions</A> 



for more information about prefix characters.)

<P><A name="z0592746">&#13; You can rename a disk-format SAS file with the CHANGE,
EXCHANGE,
and AGE statements in the DATASETS procedure or with the CMS RENAME command.
 If you use the RENAME command, remember to include any prefix characters
in the filename.</A>
