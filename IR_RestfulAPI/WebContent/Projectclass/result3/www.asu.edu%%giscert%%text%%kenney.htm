        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>ABSTRACT</u></b></font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The purpose of my research and my presentation is to map income change in the City of Phoenix between the 1990 and 2000 Census.  In some preliminary research, I discovered that census tracts throughout the city had radically diverse income change (adjusted for inflation) and the spatial distribution of the change did not seem to follow any particular patterns.  There were tracts that changed as much as 100 percent, and in the same geographical area, tracts that had negative change.  Therefore, I wish to identify possible reasons for this change throughout the city.<br>
        <br>
        In trying to explain the change, I will utilize several factors.  I will be looking at socio-economic indices, such as change in ethnicity, education, and age among others.  I will also be looking at environmental factors such as proximity to factories, landfills, or other causes of potential environmental damage.  Included in this aspect will be noise and automobile pollution.  This includes proximity to freeways, freeway on and off-ramps, major thoroughfares, and airports or airparks.  The final component I will be looking at is network distance to the four major employment centers in the Phoenix Metro area, downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale Airpark, Luke AFB, and ASU.  This last component will be the average distance along the road network taking in account speed limits, rather than the direct distance.<br>
        <br>
        I will first use GIS to identify the census tracts that are within a yet to be determined proximity to the environmental factors.  Then, I will also use Network Analyst extension in ESRI ArcGIS to identify the average distance from any one census tract to the four employment centers.  From there I will identify the key characteristics by running a principle components analysis on all the variables.  This will eliminate the noise and allow me to plug these variables into a multiple regression equation where I can explain the income change.  Once I have identified the census tracts and possible reasons for the change I will map these census tracts using GIS to show patterns spatially.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
