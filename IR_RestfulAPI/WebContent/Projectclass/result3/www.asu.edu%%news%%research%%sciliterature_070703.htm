      <h2>Science historians ponder naming "enemies" in science literature </h2>
      <p>In a perspective article published in the July 4, 2003 issue of the
        journal Science, Arizona State University biologists and historians of
        science Matthew Chew and Manfred Laubichler discuss a fundamental problem
        in the science of ecology - its use of metaphorical language. </p>
      <p>In the process, they are asking a question that has even greater consequences:
        can the way scientists communicate their findings warp or even dangerously
        mislead our perspective on science's meaning?</p>
      <p>Chew and Laubichler argue that scientists' pervasive use of metaphors
        to encapsulate and express scientific ideas (for example, the use of
        literary metaphors such as "translation," "editing," "reading" for describing
        molecular processes), while necessary and powerful, also can carry with
        it the danger of adding false or misleading connotations to the concepts.
        The article, entitled "Natural Enemies - Metaphor or Misconception?"
        focuses in particular on ecological science and its use of war and conflict
        metaphors to describe ecological dynamics involving introduced species.</p>
      <p>In particular, the authors were struck by the pervasive and often casual
        use of the metaphorical phrase "natural enemies" to describe predator/prey
        and other similar inter-species ecological relationships. Though the
        metaphor is limited in its accuracy and carries with it unscientific
        connotations of conflict and antagonism, Laubichler notes that it is
        heavily used in ecological literature, often without explanation or definition.</p>
      <p>"Though we didn't expect the term to be common, in the last four years
        we found about 60 references to 'natural enemies' in Science and Nature
        alone," Laubichler said. "It's a use of language that I find highly problematic.
        A scientist first uses 'natural enemies' as a metaphor for a particular
        ecological interaction but then it gets used in a different context and
        it doesn't take long for the idea to take hold that the category "natural
        enemy" actually exists out there in nature, which is utterly nonsense."</p>
      <p>"Scientists claim that they are continually misunderstood, but we should
        examine how much they contribute to potential misunderstanding. Using
        this as an example, it seems disingenuous for them to complain."</p>
      <p>In the article, the authors note that ecology is filled with terms derived
        from human social interaction: </p>
      <p>"many, if not most ecological concepts reflected familiar cultural experience.
        Terms such as alien, assembly, cascade, colonize, community, competition,
        consumption, contest, defense, disturbance, efficiency, enemy, equilibrium,
        flow, founder, gradient, hierarchy, interaction, invasive, native, niche,
        node, productivity, sink, source, stability, succession, territory, web
        are all commonly used to define and communicate ecological ideas among
        specialists. They have gained at least tacit acceptance by authors, reviewers,
        editors, and readers of the scientific literature, who no longer question
        their metaphorical origins."</p>
      <p>In particular, Laubichler objects to the overly rhetorical use of metaphors
        of human conflict because they add a strong bias to scientific discussions.</p>
      <p>"When ecology uses metaphors that are drawn particularly from the social
        experiences of warfare and strife and conflict, it becomes problematic.
        In some cases the rhetoric in ecology is such that if you translate some
        of the speeches of Goebbels - where he was being general and not talking
        just about Jews -- you could almost publish it as an ecological treatise
        and everyone would agree that it is a very reasonable statement about
        the problem of invasive species. The metaphors are rhetorical to that
        level, and it is very frightening to me," he said.</p>
      <p>Weighted down by descriptive metaphors laden with such emotional connotations,
        the language of ecology has become culturally biased and is drawing scientists
        and the public towards views that may be at odds with fundamental biological
        principles.</p>
      <p>"The kind of rhetoric that is used in the context of invasive species
        is completely ghastly. No one thinks very much about what all the metaphors
        mean. Haven't species moved around the globe all the time? Isn't it a
        prime example of evolution at work when a 'invasive' species comes in
        and actually out-competes a so-called 'native' species? Isn't this the
        competition that we teach everyone about in introductory biology that
        leads to adaptation?" Laubichler said. "Yet the metaphors lead us to
        assume that this is 'unnatural.' This can easily turn into something
        that gets completely out of hand."</p>
      <p>Laubichler recognizes that the article's argument may be challenging
        to many ecologists, but he hopes it will spark a debate and an examination
        of the influence that metaphors and their cultural context have had on
        all of science.</p>
      <p>"Looking at scientific metaphors is an interesting way to demonstrate
        how tightly interwoven the connections between science and culture are,"
        he said. "What kind of metaphors get chosen depends heavily on current
        cultural and political climate. This is a serious issue that all the
        sciences should examine," he said. </p>
      <p>"In this particular context it is especially interesting that one finds
        almost no references to 'natural allies' in the literature, yet symbiosis
        is also a very common ecological phenomenon. Have we become so fixated
        on war, that we can only perceive nature through that lens?" Laubichler
        and Chew wonder.</p>
