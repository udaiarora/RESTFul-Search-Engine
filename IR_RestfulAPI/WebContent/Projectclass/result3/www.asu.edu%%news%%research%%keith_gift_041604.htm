      <h2>Special delivery: Former paperboy delivers $1.6 million to center </h2>
      <p>Alec Keith hasn't been a paperboy for more than 50 years, but that doesn't mean he has stopped delivering. Most recently, Keith delivered two gifts totaling $1.6 million to the Cancer Research Institute (CRI) at ASU. </p>
      <p>The gifts have enabled the institute to purchase new equipment crucial for evaluating potential anti-cancer drugs. </p>
      <p><img src="research_images/Cancer-Res-Bldg.jpg" width="252" height="172" align="right">"This is a most extraordinarily helpful gift," says G. Robert Pettit, director of the Cancer Research Institute. "We've been able to upgrade our scientific equipment to greatly improve efficiency and productivity to further develop key anti-cancer drug discoveries toward clinical trials." </p>
      <p>Pettit says the institute's 30 to 35 research chemists sometimes waited up to a month to use one of only two high performance liquid chromatography instruments. With the purchase of six more instruments, the chemists no longer have to wait to advance their research. </p>
      <p>A biophysicist and chemist, Keith has a special affinity for places like the Cancer Research Institute. He has spent many hours laboring inside research laboratories, working on new discoveries to advance health care and improve quality of life. </p>
      <p>"Having been in the pharmaceutical business, I know the most difficult area is finding effective anti-cancer drugs," says Keith. "Dr. Pettit and his colleagues are the single most productive group in the world in the discovery of structurally unique anti-cancer drugs, from plants, marine organisms and microorganisms. It's a reminder that we know extremely little about the chemistry of the world." </p>
      <p>Keith's career has been rich, with numerous successes as an academic, scientist, entrepreneur, and corporate executive. He has registered about 150 domestic and foreign patents, and is one of the inventors of the nitroglycerin patch used to control chest pain. </p>
      <p>He was an assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a professor at Pennsylvania State University. He was vice president of Research and Development at Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and held the positions of chairman and director of Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. Today, at age 71, he is chairman of Gray Star Inc., a company that makes food irradiators. </p>
      <p>Keith currently is a resident of Hilo, Hawaii, but he still has strong ties to Arizona. He moved to Phoenix with his family in the 1940s and took a job delivering the Arizona Republic at the age of 12. Following his stint as a paperboy, Keith went on to greater things, earning a B.S. degree in zoology from Long Beach State University and a Ph.D. in genetics from the University of Oregon. </p>
      <p>In addition to visiting his brother and other family members who still live in the Phoenix area, Keith now has another reason to make frequent trips back to his former home. He has taken on a new role as adjunct professor in the Cancer Research Institute, where he will bring his expertise in biophysics to further advance the cancer research under way. </p>
      <p>"Dr. Keith's gift and his personal involvement are the most marvelous contributions the university could receive," says Pettit. </p>
