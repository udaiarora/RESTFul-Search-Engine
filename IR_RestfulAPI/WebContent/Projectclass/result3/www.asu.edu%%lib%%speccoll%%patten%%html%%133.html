 This is not a new work in any sense but is, instead, a combination of an
 earlier version of <i>Der Gart der Gesundheit</i> and Brunschwig's
 <i>Das Buch zu Distillieren</i>.  The first edition appeared in 1533, and
 was edited by Dr. Eucharius Rosslin.  After Rosslin's death, the
 herbal portion was edited by Theodore Dorsten and entitled the
 <i>Botanicon</i>.  Both of these publications were then brought together,
 re-edited, and combined with Lonicer's own contributions in 1557
 to form the <i>Kreuterbuch</i>.  Most of the illustrations were pirated
 from other sources, including herbals of Brunfels and Fuchs. 
 There is no "standard" edition of this work, since through its
 many editions the order of entries has been rearranged repeatedly.
  Fact is not always distinguished from fiction because publishers
 learned that the mention of fictitious animals and plants appealed
 to the masses and bolstered book sales.  For 20th century readers
 the text provides quaintness and medieval charm, but those who
 followed some of the misleading advice must have suffered greatly.
  However, what might seem to us to be outrageous remedies were
 usually harmless because no one could procure the exotic ingredients. 
 Some of the medications mentioned were based on ancient remedies
 dating back to Egyptian papyrus records; for example, the healing
 properties advanced for Ricinus, the castor bean, were almost the
 same in ancient papyri as in works printed 3,000 years later. 
 One remedy mentioned here is the Bezoar stone, made up of lime
 and magnesium phosphate, which was found in deer stomachs and
 intestinal tracts.  These stones reputedly provided a miraculous
 antidote to poison, so they were often placed in goblets to protect
 against poisoned wine.  They were in vogue in Europe from the 12th
 century on.  There was a good market for them at the time of Louis
 XIV when such stones might sell for 50 times the price of an emerald
 of equal size.  Patients who could not afford to purchase them
 outright could rent them by the day.  Elizabeth I owned a large
 one which was set in gold and became a part of the crown jewels.
  The Shah of Persia presented four Bezoar stones to Napoleon I,
 hoping they might help cure his many ailments.  This book caught
 the popular fancy and sold many copies.  It was considered a real
 money-maker.  Printed repeatedly, it remained a best seller for
 250 years.  One of the most recent editions was issued in 1783.
