    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In June 1990 disk archiving was
    implemented on the Academic MVS system. Archiving consists of
    moving &quot;inactive&quot; disk files to archival storage (tape)
    where they are retained for a specified period of time. If archived
    files are not accessed and restored to disk before the end of
    the retention period, they are automatically deleted from the
    archives.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Initially, an inactive file was
    defined as a file which had not been used within the past six
    months, and the archival retention period was two years. Later,
    on April 25, 1993, the inactive period was reduced from six months
    to 90 days, and the retention period for archived files was extended
    to five years. Subsequently, on January 12, 1995, the retention
    period for archived files was extended indefinitely.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Currently, the Academic MVS disk
    archiving program is run once per weekend, and any disk file
    not opened for read or write access in the in the prior 90 days
    are archived.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">To determine which of your files
    are archived, logon to TSO and use ISPF 3.4 to display a list
    of your files. Any file for which the volume is listed as &quot;ARCIVE&quot;
    has been archived.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">To restore an archived file,
    logon to TSO use ISPF 3.4 to display a list of your files. Then
    try to edit or browse the file of interest. If the file is archived,
    TSO will prompt you with three questions: 1) do you want to restore
    the file, 2) do you want an immediate or deferred restore, and
    3) do you want to wait. You should answer &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;I&quot;,
    and &quot;N&quot; for each respective question.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Another method of restoring an
    archived file is to reference the file on a DD statement in a
    batch job. When the batch job begins execution, the archived
    file will be automatically restored.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">NOTE: The act of restoring an
    archived file does not open the file for reading or writing.
    If you do not open the newly restored file for reading or writing
    prior to the next time the system looks for inactive files, the
    file will be rearchived.</FONT>&nbsp;</TD>
