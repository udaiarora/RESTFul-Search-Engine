                  <br>

                  <p>The Review Committee also asked Personnel to look at handbook sections used by probationary librarians to create their annual reviews, in particular the sections that emphasized employee contributions and the sections that emphasize service. The sections examined were: E.2: Criteria, E.3: Requirements, G.2.1: Probationary Evaluation, G.2.2: Continuing Appointment/Promotion. Last month, Personnel Committee asked council to look at the revised sections and be prepared to discuss and vote on the revisions. Personnel Committee asked to withdraw last months suggested revisions in favor of revisions presented at this meeting. Council passed motion to introduce revisions. Scott introduced and described the revisions to each section.</p>
                  <br>
  <p>For section E.2, under the SERVICE heading, the committee added a few sentences in the second paragraph. There was a vote and council did carry the motion to accept the revisions to the section. Personnel will make the change, and update the handbook.</p>
                  <br>
  <p>For section E3, Scott mentioned that the committee moved paragraphs within the section, and they added subheading to make the section easier to read overall. In the first paragraph, a sentence was added to the first paragraph. There was a vote. The group accepted the changes and council did carry the motion to accept the revisions to the section. Personnel will make the change, and update the handbook.</p>
                  <br>
  <p>For section G.2.1, under the heading, THE PROBATIONARY ACADEMIC PROFESSIONAL, the committee added three additional paragraphs. The committee also added links to the, "Marion Librarian&hellip;" section of the handbook. There was also a suggestion from the floor to add an introductory bullet to the Marion the Librarian section. The introductory bullet would be at the top of the list and it would provide an overview of the Marion the Librarian section. The group accepted the suggested revisions. A vote was cast. The group accepted the changes and council did carry the motion to accept the revisions to the section. Personnel will make the change, and update the handbook.</p>
                  <br>
  <p>For Section G.2.2, under THE ACADEMIC PROFESSIONAL heading section D, the group added a few clarifying sentences were added for clarification. The group accepted the suggested revisions. A vote was cast. The group accepted the changes and council did carry the motion to accept the revisions to the section. Personnel will make the change, and update the handbook.</p>
                  <br>
           <h2>VIII. New Business</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Revisions to Librarians' Handbook sections G.2.1, G.2.2, (Personnel Committee)</h3>
                  <br>
                  <p>Executive Committee asked Personnel Committee to add some further revisions to the handbooks sections G.2.1: Probationary Evaluation and G.2.2: Continuing Appointment/Promotion. The revisions address and clarify the primary evaluators role and responsibilities.
                  </p>
                <p>Scott handed out the revisions to the floor to read and consider. He explained that the committee added a few sentences to unify language consistency between different sections of the handbook. Annie moved that we suspend the rules so council could discuss the proposed revisions at this meeting, and if accepted the changes could be added to the handbook. A discussion followed on whether council should suspend the rules for this meeting in order to hasten the revision process. The group agreed to suspend the rules.</p>
  <br>
<p>A discussion on the revisions followed. There was a suggestion from the floor to remove a comma in the following sentence in section G.2.1 under the heading, THE PRIMARY EVALUATOR, "&hellip;.with an emphasis on job performance, from the date of hire." Leaving the comma in the sentence does not convey the PE's purview to comment on a librarians' comparable past work history. The group agreed. A vote was cast for revisions to G.1.1 and G.2.2. The group accepted the changes and council did carry the motion to accept the revisions to the sections. Personnel will make the change, and update the handbook.</p>
