          <h2>500-year-old book fuels ASU researchers&rsquo; project</h2>
          <p>A book of liturgical chants, illustrated with geese, foxes, bears, dogs and cats, sounds like a Dr. Seuss creation &ndash; but &ldquo;The Geese Book&rdquo; actually is a 500-year-old liturgical manuscript that once was used in Nuremberg, Germany.</p>
          <p>Two ASU faculty members are using the historic book to change the way some scholarly research is presented. Their project is called &ldquo;Opening the Geese Book.&rdquo;</p>
          <p><img src="../research/geese_022805.jpg" width="360" height="235" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">Instead of reading a printed book about &ldquo;The Geese Book,&rdquo; students can just pop a DVD-ROM into their computer and see the art in high resolution, hear the music and read essays by prominent specialists.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;The goal of the &lsquo;Geese Book&rsquo; project is to provide a critical model for re-integrating the arts and recontextualizing them historically,&rdquo; says Corine Schleif, associate professor of art history.</p>
          <p>She and her project partner, musicologist Volker Schier, a visiting adjunct professor from Germany, have spent the past four years laying the groundwork and producing the first parts of the project.</p>
          <p>The project is based at the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies at ASU, supported by the School of Art, the Herberger College of Fine Arts, with substantial funding from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities and several corporate sponsors.</p>
          <p>Schleif discovered &ldquo;The Geese Book&rdquo; when she was a doctoral student in Germany.</p>
          <p>When she and Schier decided to team up on a project to integrate technology and scholarship, &ldquo;The Geese Book&rdquo; seemed to be the perfect vehicle.</p>
          <p>The book was created by artists and craftsmen in Nuremberg to preserve the complete liturgy used in the parish of St. Lorenz, as it was sung by the choir of young adults and schoolboys.</p>
          <p>The book survived World War II and came came into the hands of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, whose founders trace their roots back to a patrician family in Nuremberg.</p>
          <p>The Kress Foundation helped the church rebuild after Nuremberg was bombed. In return, the church presented &ldquo;The Geese Book&rdquo; to the foundation.</p>
          <p>Eventually, the foundation gave the two-volume book to the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York &ndash; where, at 30 inches by 50 inches, it is the largest book in the library&rsquo;s collection. But it had to be large; when it was used in the church five centuries ago, the St. Lorenz choir members had to share it.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;It is the only surviving complete liturgical book from Nuremberg, and it&rsquo;s one of the nicest and best ever made,&rdquo; Schier says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a prominent manuscript.&rdquo;It is known that the cleric Friedrich Rosendorn was responsible for the writing, and it is thought that Jakob Elsner painted the incredibly detailed illustrations, but scholars can only guess at the meaning of the whimsical drawings.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;The book takes its name from an enigmatic, self-referential, bas-de-page illustration that shows a choir of geese and a fox singing from a large chant manuscript with a wolf as their choirmaster,&rdquo; Schleif says.</p>
          <p>Why geese and a fox in the choir, with a wolf directing?&ldquo;</p>
          <p>Perhaps comic relief, a warning against authority, or an open-ended drawing that provokes people into thinking,&rdquo; Schleif says.</p>
          <p>The richly illuminated manuscript, lavished with gold leaf, is of interest to scholars in many disciplines, as well as ordinary people who simply love music, art and history.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;The DVD-ROM explains how a medieval manuscript works from social, historical, musical, liturgical and political viewpoints,&rdquo; Schier says. &ldquo;There are many elements to this project.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>As they have invited others to join them in the project, Schleif and Schier say they have looked for the best scholars in each field of investigation. The project has become international, with participants in North America, in several European countries and even in Asia.</p>
          <p>Bavarian Radio, one of the collaborating institutions, aired a radio program about the project in November. Their newest partner is the University of Applied Sciences in Cologne, Germany, which will do a detailed physical analysis of all the inks and paint used in the book to ascertain what materials were available in the 1500s.</p>
          <p>This semester at ASU, Schleif and Schier are co-teaching a class on the book. Their students, ironically, mirror the disciplines it represents.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;We have a musicologist, a media designer, a technical writer, a student of German and several art historians,&rdquo; Schier says.</p>
          <p>Their hope is that these students will be the first to think about using today&rsquo;s multimedia technologies in their work, then go on to be leaders in the field.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;We want to animate the students, to teach them that there are new ways of publishing their scholarship,&rdquo; Schier says. &ldquo;We want to train the students.&rdquo;</p>
