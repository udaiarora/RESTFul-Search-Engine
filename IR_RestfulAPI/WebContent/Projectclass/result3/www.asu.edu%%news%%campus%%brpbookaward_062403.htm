      <h2>Two Bilingual Review/Press books receive awards</h2>
      <p>        Two books published by ASU's Bilingual Review/Press were honored with
          awards on June 6 at BookExpo America in Los Angeles, the largest annual
        book trade show held in the United States.</p>
      <p>"Contemporary Chicana and
          Chicano Art," compiled and written by ASU professors Gary D. Keller
          and Mary Erickson in addition to other scholars, won the
        Fine Art category in the 2003 Independent Publisher Book Awards. The
        two-volume set is a comprehensive compendium of Chicana and Chicano artists
        that has been characterized as "the absolute bible of Chicana and Chicana
        art" by actor and noted Chicano art collector Cheech Mar&iacute;n. Gilberto
        C&aacute;rdenas, executive director of the Inter-University Program for
        Latino Research, has called it "the most comprehensive and lavish that
        has been conceived." </p>
      <p>"Moving Target: A Memoir of Pursuit" won Best Biography
        in the Latino Literary Hall of Fame 2003 book awards. In this memoir,
        People magazine
        correspondent Ron Arias recounts his father's emotional distance after
        spending time as a prisoner of war in World War II and Korea, his eventual
        disappearance from their home, and Arias's 14-year search for him, during
        which he learned that his father might have been a spy. <br>
        Bilingual Review/Press has given a start to authors who have later signed
        with major publishing houses or have won prestigious awards. Phoenix
        author Stella Pope Duarte, who eventually signed with publishing giant
        Harper Collins, had her first short story collection published by Bilingual/Review
        Press. Poet and novelist Demetria Mart&iacute;nez also got her start
        at the Bilingual Review/Press before signing with the large book publisher
        Ballantine Books.</p>
      <p>While the Bilingual Review/Press has earned a number
          of awards over the years, it is a major event to win two at one time.
          Currently affiliated
          with ASU under the umbrella of the Hispanic Research Center, the Bilingual
          Review/Press has been publishing the works of Hispanic writers since
          1974. </p>
      <p>Bilingual Review/Press has more than 150 titles in its backlist
          and will publish eight to 10 titles a year. Most of the books are by
          or about
          U.S. Hispanics and most are written in English, though the press does
          feature bilingual and Spanish-only titles as well. Since its founding
          30 years ago, the press has pledged to forego the world of purely commercial
          entertainment and to focus instead on works of weight and significance. </p>
      <p>In addition to new works, classics of Chicana and Chicano fiction are
        being kept alive and available through the Press's Cl&aacute;sicos Chicanos/Chicano
        Classics imprint. As the Bilingual Review/Press begins its fourth decade
        of business, it solidifies its mission to make available the wealth that
      is to be mined from Hispanic writing. </p>
      <p>Isasi, with the Hispanic Research
          Center, can be reached at (480) 965-3867 or (cristina.deisasi@asu.edu).<br>
