Multiple-year appointments may be for a fixed period or may be for a rolling appointment period:  <p><ol><li>A fixed-term appointment is for a fixed period of two or three years.</li><p><li>A rolling appointment is for three years, which may be renewed annually.</li></ol><p> The unit specifies the type of academic work, the position description, performance expectations, the evaluation and review process, and salary range.  The university&#146;s academic freedom policy applies to academic professionals, regardless of their appointment period. <p>Academic professionals on multiple-year appointments must have a position description that articulates standards for position effectiveness; professional contributions; and institutional, professional, and/or community service.  Individual academic professionals will have different percentages of effort in each category; it is not necessarily the case that all academic professionals will have responsibilities in each category.  It is the responsibility of the colleges and the unit that such a job description exist for each academic professional. <p>The performance by academic professionals on multiple-year appointments shall be evaluated at least once annually by the immediate supervisor and, where appropriate, the administrator to whom the supervisor reports.  Unit policies shall be consistent with <a href="acd507-08.html">ACD 507&#150;08</a>, &#147;Annual Performance Evaluation.&#148;   <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Ranks of Appointment</b></font><p><b>Assistant </b><p>All academic professionals appointed at this initial rank must meet the minimum standards for appointment as defined by the unit. Ordinarily, academic professionals have earned an advanced degree or have acquired a high level of the particular skills needed for a position. As assistant academic professionals gain experience, they are expected to improve in their performance categories as outlined by position descriptions and unit guidelines.<p><b>Associate  </b><p>Academic professionals appointed at/promoted to associate rank must exceed the standards for initial appointment at assistant rank, and meet the standards for appointment to the associate rank as defined by the unit. They must have attained considerable expertise in the areas of competence required of their positions. Associate academic professionals must demonstrate excellence in their performance categories as outlined by position descriptions and unit guidelines.<p><b>Full or Senior </b><p>Academic professionals appointed at/promoted to full or senior rank must exceed the standards for associate rank, have substantial professional experience, and meet the standards for appointment to the full or senior rank as defined by the unit. Academic professionals at this rank must demonstrate a high level of effectiveness and should be considered experts in their chosen fields. At this rank, both professional contributions and service activities, if required, must involve sharing knowledge and experience with others by providing substantial guidance and leadership in areas of professional or academic interest. <p>Although there is no prescribed timeline for promotion from associate to full, it would be unusual for a person to accumulate the record of accomplishment expected for this rank without working for several years at the associate level. <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Eligibility for Other University Employment </b></font><p>Academic professionals on multiple-year appointments are not eligible for continuing appointments.<p>Academic professionals on multiple-year appointments are eligible to apply for other positions within the university.  Should a multiple-year position be reclassified, the incumbent is eligible to apply. <p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Procedures</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p><b>Promotion</b><p>Academic professionals on multiple-year appointments are eligible to apply for promotion.<p><b>Renewal</b><p>Academic professionals on multiple-year appointments have no expectation of employment beyond the end of the current appointment period. Renewal of multiple-year appointments is conditional upon satisfactory job performance, the continued availability of funds, and the needs of the unit and the university.  There is no limit to the number of times multiple-year appointments may be renewed.<p>An individual appointed to a fixed-term appointment must be evaluated annually at the unit level in accordance with established criteria; this evaluation is forwarded to the dean for review. <p>Academic professionals on rolling appointments must be evaluated each year at the unit level in accordance with established criteria; this evaluation is forwarded to the dean for review. If performance is satisfactory, the existing contract will be replaced annually by a new three-year contract conditional upon availability of funds, the needs of the unit and the university, and approval of the provost. <p><b>Notification of Non-Renewal</b><p>For both fixed-term and rolling appointments, if overall performance is unsatisfactory at the time of the annual evaluation, the academic professional will be placed on a nine-month performance improvement plan, effective immediately, with quarterly reviews.  At the next regular annual evaluation, if overall performance remains unsatisfactory, the appointment will terminate at the end of the current fiscal or academic year, as appropriate. Terminations must be approved by the provost.
