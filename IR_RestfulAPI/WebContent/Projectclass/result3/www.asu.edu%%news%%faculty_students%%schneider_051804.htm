      <h2>Schneider to retire as Public Programs dean, return to faculty </a></h2>
      <p align="left">After 15 years of building innovative, relevant and collaborative connections within the university and the community, Anne Schneider, dean of ASU's College of Public Programs since 1989, will step down at the end of June. </p>
      <p align="left">Schneider will take a year's sabbatical, and return to the faculty. Jeff Chapman, director of the School of Public Affairs, will serve as interim dean during a national search for a permanent replacement. </p>
      <p align="left">"I know the ASU community joins me in thanking Dean Anne Schneider for her excellent work in building a strong foundation for the college. Anne has been a leader in engaging ASU with the community and encouraging scholarship coupled to engagement," says Milton Glick, ASU executive vice president and provost. "Jeff's experience and leadership skills will continue to move the college forward and be particularly valuable with the transition of the College of Public Programs to the Capital Center campus." </p>
      <p align="left">Schneider came to ASU from Oklahoma State University where she served as a professor, director of Research for the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and head of the Political Science Department. She holds a B.A. and M.A. from Oklahoma State University and a Ph.D. from Indiana University, all in political science. </p>
      <p align="left">At the College of Public Programs, Schneider says her goal has always been to build strong programs, which serve a vital role both academically and also in the community as a whole. </p>
      <p align="left">"It has always been a top priority to enable each program to be successful, both nationally and locally. We have tried to invest in and support each of our programs, and I think we have been successful as many of our programs are highly ranked," she says. "We've also tried to connect with the community in our teaching and research. We have a college that brings the community into the university and the university into the community, and we are doing it at a high level." </p>
      <p align="left">During her sabbatical, she will take a trip to Moscow to participate in the International Women's Forum conference. She serves as president of the Forum's Arizona chapter. After the event, she plans to travel in Siberia for several months. </p>
      <p align="left">Once she returns, she plans to work on several research projects with the Center for Urban Inquiry, including an in-depth look at how faculty members approach use-inspired research. </p>
      <p align="left">Chapman will lead the college during a time of immense change and transition. The college is slated to become ASU's Public College and will move to the proposed Capital Center campus in downtown Phoenix. Several units currently within the college also will change affiliations - the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication will become a stand-alone school while the School of Justice Studies, American Indian Studies, Asian Pacific American Studies and the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication will join the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. </p>
      <p align="left">"The college will be the anchor of the downtown campus; it's a real opportunity," Schneider says. "Jeff has a lot of work ahead of him in budgeting and long-term planning. He's an economist with experience in public policy, so he should do very well." </p>
      <p align="left">Chapman has been with ASU since 1999. Prior to that, he held numerous academic positions at the University of Southern California, including director of the Sacramento Center School of Public Administration. He holds an A.B. from Occidental College and an M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley, all in economics. </p>
      <p align="left">"This is an opportunity to be in on the beginning of a remarkable project," says Chapman. "In my role as interim dean, I am going to be helping build something profound." </p>
      <p align="left">Frederick Corey, associate dean with the college, will continue to serve and assist Chapman in the transition. </p>
      <p align="left">Glick is accepting nominations for a search committee for the permanent dean position through May 21. Contact Glick's office at (480) 965-4995. All committee nominations should also be forwarded to Linda Van Scoy at (lvs@asu.edu). </p>
      <p>Campbell, with Media Relations &amp; Public Information, can be reached at (480) 965-7209 or (garycamp@asu.edu). </p>
