 choosing a key for PF8
  What was printed on the key you just pressed?
</pre></samp>
<br><br>

<p>In the above figure, your reponse to the prompt would be to type the 
letters which physically appear on the key you pressed in response to 
the previous screen. For example, if the key you pressed on the previous 
screen was the pc key F8, the letter "F" and the number "8" in response 
to this question and then press enter. Alternatively, you could type 
some other short phrase in response the the question and then press 
enter.</p>

<p>Your response to this question is used as documentation only. The SET 
KEYBIND statement generated in this key mapping process will contain the 
documentation text at the end of the statement. After the keyboard 
mapping file is created, you can list or display the mapping file to 
view the SET KEYBIND statements. You can even use a text editor to 
change the file. The documentation entered in response to the above 
prompt will aid you in case you've forgotten which pc key was mapped to 
which 3270 key.</p>
