<h1 class="storyhead">Waissi to lead School of Global Management and Leadership</h1>
<p>  ASU has named Gary Waissi dean of the School of Global  Management and Leadership. He begins his appointment in August.</p>
<p>  For the past seven years, Waissi served as dean of the  School of Management at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Waissi will provide the academic and organizational  leadership and judgment needed to make our management programs as strong as  they can possibly become,&rdquo; says Mark Searle, vice president and provost of  ASU&rsquo;s West campus. &ldquo;He shares our vision of strengthening our research and  scholarship base, positioning the business faculty to influence the development  of the field, and preparing students to succeed in a global, multicultural  marketplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  Before his appointment as dean at UM-Dearborn, Waissi served  as chair of the Department of Management. Before that appointment, he worked  with Philipp Holzmann AG in its headquarters in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and  in Nigeria. More recently, he has consulted with higher-education institutions  in developing countries such as Rwanda and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am honored to serve as dean of the School of Global  Management and Leadership, and I am excited about the opportunity to work with  faculty, students, staff, alumni and business supporters in leading the school  to its next stage,&rdquo; Waissi says. &ldquo;The school has a strong portfolio of academic  programs, faculty members who are nationally recognized scholars and teachers,  a collegial culture that embraces constant innovation, and a supportive network  of alumni and friends in the business community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  During his tenure as UM-Dearborn&rsquo;s dean of the School of  Management, the school experienced a significant programmatic and enrollment  growth. Under his leadership, Waissi directed the development of five new  graduate degrees, 12 new program concentrations and international partnerships  with universities in Italy, Spain, France and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see ASU&rsquo;s School of Global Management and Leadership as  uniquely positioned to meet the growing demand for business leaders,&rdquo; Waissi  says. &ldquo;We face the challenge of developing innovative academic programs  supported by leading-edge research. The successful people and organizations of  tomorrow will invent the future. It is very exciting to be involved in that  process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  Waissi speaks five languages &ndash; English, Finnish, German,  Russian and Swedish &ndash; and is a member of the board of trustees for Finlandia  University, located in Hancock, Mich. He serves as Michigan&rsquo;s Honorary Consul  of Finland.</p>
<p>  Waissi earned his doctorate in engineering, with an emphasis  on operations research, from the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor.<br>
  In 2005, Waissi taught at the International Business School  in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. During this time, he also participated in an executive  education general management program and delivered faculty workshops on such  topics as online learning and interactive teaching techniques. Other  international and domestic projects include assessing degree program curricula  for Tampere University of Technology, Finland; conducting online teaching and  learning sessions for Bankworld Inc. executives in Washington, D.C.; and  statistical evaluation and modeling of defaulted Discover, VISA/Mastercard, and  private-label credit-card accounts for Asset Acceptance Corp. in Troy, Mich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Waissi brings exceptional academic and management  background to this position,&rdquo; Searle says. &ldquo;He is a creative and strong leader  who is well-positioned to lead the School of Global Management and Leadership  to achieve its goals &ndash; and, through that, those of the New American  University.&rdquo; <br>
