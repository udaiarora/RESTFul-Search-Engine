<p><b>1. Call to Order.</b>


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting was called to order at 3:17 p.m. by


Senate President David Burstein.


<p><b>2. Acceptance of Previous Minutes of December 6, 1999.</b>


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minutes of December 6, 1999 were approved by


voice vote as published electronically on the Academic Senate Web Site


and distributed by email to senators. If there are further editorial corrections,


please contact Darby at the Senate Office.


<p><b>3. Announcements and Communications.</b>


<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.A. Senate President's Report</b> (David Burstein).


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three different task forces on which I


am currently serving: the Curriculum Streamlining Task Force is one. We


have not had a meeting this semester although we met several times last


year. Andy Jackson, ASUE Assembly President, is also serving on that task


force. One of our jobs is to develop standardized curriculum check sheets


for the university, which we hope will make the streamlining issue more


transparent to students as they transfer from area to area. In addition,


we are trying to see how we can get all the academic units into compliance


with the 79/86 hour rule, or provide them with a form that they can use


to declare their exemption proposal.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Task Force on Promotion and Tenure is examining


the current promotion and tenure policies of the university, and will try


to make them either more consistent with post-tenure reviews than they


currently are and/or make them more consistent with the rhetoric that the


university has been using over the past few years in terms of the importance


of teaching and research. As a part of our work, Provost Glick has asked


us to review many policies provided to us by email from outside universities.


I have read most of these policies over the weekend. We are doing very


well in comparison from what I have read. One university starts its Promotion


and Tenure policy by defining that tenure is good and then it lists the


four different ways you can lose tenure. Another one avoids defining tenure


completely and says that they will define tenure in terms of what their


10 university peers define it to be--it would be amusing if all of the


peers said the same thing. In terms of our policy, here we are doing pretty


well. There are some changes we can make and should make but overall our


policy is very good.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Task Force on Non-permanent Faculty (Lecturers


and Instructors), the problem is that not one shoe fits all. There are


different kinds of lecturers and instructors (for example in Honors, Math,


and English). There are even more types positioned throughout the university.


Our task force is gathering information at this point.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would hope all of you received the January 2000


<i>Academic Senate Newsletter</i> in the mail in your departments by now.


It is also posted on the Academic Senate Web Page. I hope you have read


my column entitled "Call to Action." The response that we have received


so far has been a deafening silence. One person has emailed us so far.


This is not something that I want to give you a guilt trip on--if you are


going to engage in this kind of political action over the long term, you


will take the action if you really motivated to do so. We get the legislature


that we work for. We as a faculty -- even if we get one hundred faculty,


one hundred staff, and fifty administrators (a small drop in a big bucket)


-- we can by our participation further energize the alumni to participate,


and they are many in number, probably a good 30-40% of the voters in this


state. Not just our alumni but the alumni of UofA and NAU. Over the long


term if we do not elect legislators that understand what a university should


be in terms of importance to the state, we are hurt, our students are hurt


and the economy will be hurt. To those of you saying that you cannot participate


because you are a public employee, I say to you, yes, you can. You cannot


do it with your computer at work; you cannot use your office telephone


but you can do it from your home telephone, from your home computer and


on your own time. That is what we need done. Please take this message back


to your respective departments and schools.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to announce to you and reinforce what President


Coor announced at the faculty breakfast last Thursday. As a part of the


current ASU Capital Campaign, ASU is launching a campaign for contributions


from faculty and staff. I want to clarify to you and you can clarify this


for your constituents--no one is twisting anyone's arm. If you feel you


want to give, then please do so in the way in which you feel most comfortable


-- both the amount and to whom. All gifts to the university in any shape


or form will be counted. The emphasis is on maximizing participation, rather


than the amount given. We want to say to the rest of the state that yes,


we as a faculty and staff do support our university.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we are going to reopen the issue of the Intellectual


Property Management Implementation Policy -- IP-squared is what I will


call it. To reopen it will take three steps and may be held over until


the next meeting. We tabled it in December, and we must vote to untable


this document by untabling Senate Motion #4 (1999-2000). We have distributed


to each of the senators via email the policy dated October 14, 1999 (S.M.


#4) and the copy dated January 31, 2000 (proposed amended language from


the General Counsel's Office). These are the changes that will conform


the document to the Arizona Supreme Court ruling on the Kimball Case (ref:


A.R.S. 41-1062). We can vote on the amended policy today, or we can carry


over the vote until next meeting on February 21.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President-elect Doug Johnson could not be with us


today. He is attending a Learner-Centered session on campus at the same


time the Senate meets.


<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.B University Provost's Report</b> (Milton Glick).


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I promised originally that I would bring topics


to you at each meeting but this time my announcements will be about what


is happening here and at the legislature. Please feel free to email me


with topics that you want to hear about at our next Senate meeting or give


them to me today if you wish.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merit Pay. As you know last year the legislature


appropriated funds for a 2% merit raise, effective April 1. Governor Jane


Hull in her state of the State message recommended that this amount be


increased by 1% to 3%. There is legislation being considered but nothing


is final yet. The JLBC did not make any recommendation. It is our hope


that the Governor will make it a "going home issue" that is she will not


let them adjourn without making that decision. We are only speculating


that she will do this. We are not allocating to our Deans internally until


we know for sure what the legislature decides. Having a 3% pool would be


better. It will probably be retroactive.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gift to the Honors College. You may have read in


<i>Insight</i> and in the newspapers about the generous gift bestowed on


the Honors College by Craig and Barbara Barrett (10 million dollars). Those


funds will be divided into 1/2 for scholarships for outstanding students,


and the other half will be used for thesis scholarships, funds to develop


more Honors courses throughout the university, foreign travel and scholarships


and a variety of things that will enhance the already fine education system


the Honors College already provides. Having the CEO of Intel wanting his


name on one of our colleges is nothing but good for us. At a meeting of


the Higher Education Task Force last week, a ten minute video done by Craig


Barrett was presented to members of the task force in which he explained


that good universities create the work force that is necessary for economic


prosperity, but great universities provide the ideas that energize the


economy. If Arizona wants to participate in the new economy, Arizona needs


to substantially increase the funding available for its universities, so


they can create and participate in the new economy.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a less positive note, there is yet another bill


being considered at the legislature on phonics. It will require us to offer


ninety hours of instruction in phonics to every teacher. Two three-credit


courses are involved (HB 2082 Teachers; phonics).


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: Forty-five hours of classroom


instruction are involved which means one three-credit course. However,


I read the bill and it says, "Ninety hours OR six credits," which we could


interpret as an "either or."


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Glick: Just from my own position, I believe


that any employer has the right to set what they expect their new employees


know and that we respect the right of the Board of Education to set certification


standards. But it does not seem to me that they should be telling us how


to make those students graduate. They have the right to say if you want


us to hire your students, they must know the following things, but we are


the professionals that should decide how to make our students qualified.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also another bill that will require faculty


to include in their syllabus any material/activities that will be a part


of instruction which might be considered potentially offensive to students.


(HB 2023 University courses: content; extracurricular activities). It must


contain an accurate description of your course (examples include but are


not limited to required religious observances, community service, sexual


content, political philosophy). We have told the legislators that we are


prepared to put into policy, and in fact we did this last year, that every


instructor provide students with an accurate syllabus of his or her course.


I think to go further than that is not necessary. NAU is intending to have


their Senate consider a disclaimer that would appear in the syllabi at


their campus. We will not do that.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, one of the initiatives in our College of


Education has really paid off. It was put into effect last year, a million-dollar


gift from Bank of America. They are preparing teachers throughout the state


(limited numbers) to pass the new National Board Certification which costs


$2,000 per individual approximately to complete. It has been designed at


the National level to certify Master Teachers. Two years ago, there were


only two such individuals in the state of Arizona. We have used these funds


to both prepare teachers for this certification and to pay their fee as


well for the process. I believe 40 teachers were certified this year. Our


pass rate was almost double that for any other state in the nation. Kudos


to the College of Education for really stepping up and trying to find ways


to not only identify good teachers but to help them become recognized for


their contributions.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the numbers became final for National Merit


scholars, we are 12th in the nation, one less than MIT and one more than


Princeton. I can provide you the whole list if you want, including our


sister universities.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Brooks: With respect to the Honors College


-- there is talk that the Graduate College programs are receiving funding--is


there a way that graduate students can also benefit.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Glick: We are advocating for graduate assistance


in state and out of state above the automatic tuition waivers. That proportion


of waivers comes from the amount that the Arizona Board of Regents authorizes


us to grant to all students. Therefore, if there are 40,000 students--30,000


are undergraduates and 10,000 are graduates, that does in fact mean some


reduction for graduate students. I would like to say that because of the


Barrett gift, we will not have to do this, but the Barrett gift provides


only a small piece of that program.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: Before I introduce our


student president Jenny Holsman, I wanted to introduce our new student


employee at the Senate Office, Kristie Ellison, a senior in the College


of Public Programs.


<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.C ASASU President's Report</b> (Jenny Holsman).


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are right in the middle of the student regent


selection process to add a second Student Regent. That student will be


a voting member of the Arizona Board of Regents next year. Selection will


be held on February 8. We have sent out flyers and email messages en masse.


We have dropped off hundreds of applications to residence halls, advising


sites, and the campus apartment complexes. Please let all your students


know about this opportunity. That student will represent all students that


come from all Arizona State Universities on the AZ Board of Regents. We


are excited that someone from ASU will be selected for that position.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some legislative issues are positive for students,


such as the Aspire Program, the appointment of a second Student Regent,


the AFAT bill (HB 2424 Financial aid trust fund; match) that will take


away the whole old funding formula for tuition rates and give opportunities


to increase student funding. We are a bit worried about the things that


Dr. Burstein and Dr. Glick have already mentioned: the phonics bill and


the funding for merit increases this year. We at ASASU have rather gone


on the rampage in making calls and emails on those types of issues that


we are concerned about at the legislature. On Monday, Thursday and Friday


of last week, we called members of the appropriations board and many others


on the building renewal proposal and spoke to them about an increase in


faculty and staff salaries. We support your position on those issues.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the student body presidents from all the


PAC-10 Schools attended a leadership conference recently. I learned two


important ideas at that conference about teacher evaluations and about


the internship program that will help us get more students involved and


more successful on our campus.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are developing the Mentoring/Shadowing Program


for freshmen that live off campus. Studies have shown that the students


who get more involved on the campus with things other than their academic


studies become more successful in college. We are trying to get as many


students as we can involved with ASASU and other beneficial activities


on campus.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elections 2000 are underway. As soon as our new


officers are elected, I will bring them to the Senate and introduce them


to you and you can ask them about their plans for the next semester.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through our Coaches' Connection program, we have


made a partnership with women's athletics to provide forums of discussion


on women's issues on campus, specifically women's athletics. We began this


program to help with the diversity on this campus. We are hoping to get,


within the next two weeks, a resolution from the PAC-10 regarding diversity


on campus.


<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. D ASUW Senate President's Report</b> (Jane


Carey).


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: Jane Carey cannot be


with us because of a class scheduling conflict. Richard Knopf will attend


for her in the spring but he is not present today.


<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.E ASUE Senate President's Report</b> (Andy


Jackson).


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sit on one task force in addition to the one that


David mentioned earlier. Both are in the final stages of completing their


reports. The Technology Policy Advisory Council (TPAC) was charged with


reviewing and updating the ASU policies governing the use of university


computer and technology resources. The TPAC, in consultation with the Office


of General Counsel, reviewed existing policies, identified concerns and


developed a draft policy, which is available at <u><font color="#0000FF">http://www.asu.edu/it/vpit/tpac/</font></u>.


We are publishing this draft to solicit input from faculty, staff, students


and others who use our information technology facilities. We have worked


on this project for the last 8 months. Please take the time to look at


it and provide feedback to either Paul Ward or Bill Lewis, co-chairs of


the committee, or to me and I will bring them to the committee. We hope


to have all the senates at East, West, and Main vote on this document before


July of this year so that we can all operate under a common policy.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also sit on the Work Life Task Force (based on


the Commission on the Status of Women charter last spring). There should


be a survey in your hands in early January from this task force. When you


see your copy there will be two parts. One is for students only and should


take 10 minutes to complete. We ask that those of you who receive the survey


by a process of random selection please complete and return it. The first


part of the survey, the staff/faculty portion should take 15-20 minutes


to complete.


<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.F Past Senate President's Report</b> (Bill


Davey).


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legislature is in session. Because they do not


have a budget to deal with, they are doing others things with higher education.


They have taken on a very active agenda in this area. As has already been


said, there are bills being considered that will make us pay attention


to everything we do on the Internet and what is done in the dormitories.


We are opposing some of them and supporting others. What we have done in


the Sun Devil Legislative Advocacy Council, a group put together to provide


representation on important issues at the legislature (I serve on it as


past president of the faculty; there are members of the Parents Association,


members of student government, the government affairs group of the administration,


and the Retirees Association) has been working on developing what we call


a grass roots type of strategy to influence the legislature. There are


two types of influence we can do 1) institutional influence--the issues


that the university has decided are important, for example, building renewal


funding, salary increases, the conversion of our current TV system to a


digital system which is mandated by the federal government and 2) personal


issues that you should be aware of and that you may want to take a stand


on yourself. For me, the phonics bill (House Bill 2082 Teachers; phonics)


is an issue which I violently oppose as a linguistics professional, but


as your advocacy coordinator I will tell you this bill is on the agenda


and you need to look at it and make your own decision. That is not an institutional


goal but it certainly is a issue that you as a professional have the right


to be aware of and communicate with your legislators on.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday morning I sent 770 email messages to faculty


and staff on all three campuses that completed an action card at the Fall


Breakfast. Some people completed one at the Spring Breakfast. We asked


you to contact your legislators concerning the institutional goals if you


have signed up to participate. What we have found is that we will still


have to go with supporting supplemental appropriation bills, because it


is likely in this first year of the two-year budget cycle, there will not


be additional substantial amounts added in to the university budget. If


you did not receive an email on that, you are not on my list. I think that


every member of the Academic Senate ought to be on that list because you,


as faculty leaders, should take an active part in at least knowing what


are the significant legislative issues. Please communicate these points


to your department, so that members of your department may then take an


active part in the advocacy too. I have yellow legislative action forms


with me which I will leave with Kathie Freiday if you desire to fill out


a form. If you have not filled out one previously you can be added to my


email list tomorrow. You should be receiving two or three further messages


from me. It does not identify me as a university person but as an individual


citizen and I am exercising my right to influence the legislature. I will


also leave with Kathie a statement of the Alumni Association's Year 2000


Priorities. The universities only have three lobbyists: Allan Price, Steve


Miller and Blake Anderson. What the Alumni Association on our behalf does


as a community agency is to help us to identify and communicate with the


legislature and help us identify our institutional issues. They summarized


the issues that were in the email that I sent to the 770 people this morning


which also provide talking points that you can discuss with your legislators,


including some facts and figures that you may not be aware of.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 21st, we will participate in the Annual


Statehood Picnic that the Arizona Alumni Association has done traditionally


at Wesley Bolin Plaza next to the State House. I understand we have done


this every year for almost twenty years now. What we are doing this year


will vary a bit from last year. We are having our legislators spread out


to have lunch among 40 tables that will also have several informed staff


and faculty there to discuss the institutional issues. If you can join


us at this event, the commitment will be from approximately 11:30 - 1:00


p.m. on February 21. You will enjoy lunch and conversation with our legislators


at an assigned table. Email me at william.davey@asu.edu and tell me your


will attend. We will then send you a map and directions on where to go.


We will also send our upcoming email messages inviting you to talk to our


friends in the legislature.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Ferraro: Has the syllabus bill that Dr.


Glick mentioned been held up?


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past President Davey: I heard it was held in caucus.


That is a pretty good sign. But you do not know for sure. I heard that


the dormitory bill was also held in caucus. I will try to keep you updated.


When it gets to a critical point, we will get an email out to you asking


you to immediately respond and contact your legislator.


<p><b>4. Open Forum.</b>


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Rose: As chair of the Task Force on Health


Insurance, I report that the new questionnaires are out. We are getting


much better staffing help this time through the University Evaluation Service.


We are resurveying faculty and academic professionals. The surveys have


been distributed for a week now. If you received one please fill it out


and return it. I know this has taken much longer than we hoped originally


but we are on track and will get our data processed.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Landers: I would like to express my views


on centralized scheduling. One of the things that I constantly overhear


when I host for some of the campus sneaker tours, and when we are trying


to promote our university to entering freshmen is that we are a very large


campus with 40,000 students but that we create small communities within


this very large university. This sounds good and I think this has been


true in the past, in my department (Exercise Science). In my building,


we have an area where students congregate and the faculty cross that common


area to check their mailboxes, which gives students the opportunity to


ask questions and interact. In addition, within this common area, we are


able to post bulletin board notices about jobs and advising and other things


our undergraduates need to know about. Then along came centralized scheduling


and now our students are all over campus and, of course, the students in


our building are not our majors. I just want to point this out as an unanticipated


consequence of centralized scheduling. I bring it up because if it occurs


in my department and perhaps it occurs in yours. I understand that we are


doing this to have greater occupancy in terms of our buildings but at the


same time I don't think this educationally is the best thing, at least


if we still want to create smaller communities.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: I wanted to bring this


up myself under open forum. I will be meeting with Vice Provost Walter


Harris and David Techau and Kathy Tibbetts (who head the University Scheduling


Office). Now would be a good time to bring up any problems that your unit


has experienced this semester. Please give me some particulars. I will


not use your name.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator X1: In one of our recent faculty meetings,


although not it is not happening to our department, the issue was brought


up about classes that are being scheduled in rooms that are simply too


small to give elbow space and that there is some benefit in having additional


room for some classes.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator X2: In past years classrooms were assigned


to buildings but now, it is just the number of students that determines


the location of a class.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator X3: The problem is that classrooms are being


scheduled in a manner that is totally inconsistent with the needs technologically


and otherwise of professors--there seems to be no relationship--there needs


to be some way to get around this.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: Has this information


been conveyed to the scheduling office last semester?


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator X3: I do not know about that.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator X4: I know of specific classes the require


flexibility in grouping students. If they are stuck in a room like JWSC


210 (here), it is impossible to arrange for small group circles. People


with extensive proxima mandates are stuck in rooms where they are told


to bring in their own proxima machine, but those don't seem to have adequate


lumens to accomplish this feat. Some are frequently not working, so that


you must transport a proxima across campus on one of those carts. If you


have a course that is grounded in 5,000 hours of effort in power point


programs, and then you are denied the opportunity to use this instruction


in an optimal setting, we have in effect sabotaged that presentation. Those


are the kinds of things that I believe are critical to get resolved at


this time.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator X5: Another lack of technology is that some


of the media equipment we have on campus is dilapidated. If you are transporting


equipment across campus for instruction and a bulb blows in your overhead,


what are you going to do? Whom do you call? There is no coordination between


the equipment we have and the people that are available to service it.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator X3: We know whom to call. They just do not


respond.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: The question I will bring


up tomorrow is, to what extent are we going to be bound by the Regents


desire to maximize classroom usage vis a vis our own needs, both in terms


of the use of the rooms and in terms of the equipment that we use the room


for.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator X6: At the very least, this should not be


a crapshoot. The departments should be able to make clear to scheduling


and have guarantee that they will be assigned rooms that were designed


for building and construction by that department, and built or remodeled


with building funds expended by that department, for classrooms fitted


with the proper technological resources or are in close proximity to lecture


preparation areas. We must consider what equipment and lecture preparation


apparatus can be transported to that area. I think it destroys the idea


of teaching a science course with lecture preparation materials. We have


gone around and around with scheduling on this issue and they still do


not seem to understand the special needs of this type of class.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator X7: I have had a pleasant reversal of this


situation. I used to teach my class in the Education Lecture Hall. It was


a technological nightmare there and then I was moved to a classroom in


the Business College. I had never known how badly off it was in the lecture


hall until I moved to COB. Much laughter here.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator X8: On the low-tech end of this scenario,


we need to have classrooms for History classes that have bars and map hooks.


We use a lot of maps. We have our own hooks if bars can be provided. There


should be some coordination of map hooks. More laughter here.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: Thank you for your comments


and those and others that have been given me, I can say that something


has to give, and I think (to Provost Glick) you would agree with me. How


it will give is not clear. Apparently, we cannot have this situation continue


for many more semesters. It would be bad to have it continue even one more


semester.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing no further business, the open forum was


completed.


<p><b>5. Unfinished Business (Motions from Committees) (SECOND reading).</b>


<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.A Executive Committee</b> (David Burstein).


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.A.1 Untabling Senate Motion #4 (1999-2000).


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ASU IP-squared has been revised by Mary Stevens


of the General Counsel Office to conform with the recent Arizona Supreme


Court ruling on the use of full counsel in hearings and the right of subpoena


in producing documents and calling witnesses (given to the administrative


official invested with decision making authority for the Intellectual Property


Committee) (ref: A.R.S. 41-1062). We have provided to senators copies of


both the original document dated October 14, 1999 and the revised language


version dated January 31, 2000.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first order of business to entertain a motion


to untable Senate Motion #4. So moved by Senator Mayer and receiving multiple


seconds by voice vote. Hearing no discussion, we will move to vote. The


motion to untable passed unanimously by voice vote.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second order will be to amend the policy that


was untabled, dated October 14, 1999 to the current draft policy language


dated January 31, 2000. The changes due to the Arizona Supreme Court ruling


are included in all capital letters.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Mayer: So moved. The motion then received


multiple seconds by voice vote.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: I will tell you that


I did work with Mary Stevens in the General Counsel's office on this wording


and you will note the language is more legal than academic.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Jacob: That being the case can you give


us the highlights as to what has happened here?


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: Two things occurred.


Given that this policy provides that an "inventor" may ask for review of


the intellectual property official's decision regarding contract for an


invention, it has to give that inventor the right to have full attorney


representation, full counsel. The changes come to permit full counsel representation,


which our policies did not permit previously. Given that a person does


pursue such a course of action (a faculty member for instance) they are


given three choices with the amended language: 1) to proceed with full


counsel representing them; or 2) advisory counsel representation; or 3)


no representation by counsel. The decision is for the person bringing the


complaint to make; the university will then act in kind. If the person


selects no representation, then no representation will be given the IP


Committee or the IP official. If the person elects advisory counsel then


advisory counsel will be given to the both the IP Committee and the IP


Official. The IP Committee's counsel will be hired outside the campus.


If the person elects full counsel, then the IP official will be given full


counsel by the university, and the IP Committee will be given full counsel


from outside the university. In addition, the IP-squared has to permit


the IP Committee and any other grievance committee we have to issue subpoenas.


Those are the two things that the Arizona Supreme Court ruled. We must


inform the grievant of their right to use full counsel and the right of


subpoena. That is now given to us by the courts.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Jacob: Did they interpret an Arizona State


Statute to indicate that we must do this?


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: Yes. They say we must


be under a given revised Arizona Statute (A.R.S. 41-1062) and in that it


says we must follow the same rules as other state employees. Other state


employee' processes do permit subpoenas.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Jacob: What are the sanctions for ignoring


these subpoenas?


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: I do not know.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Glick: "You must spend a day in the Physics


Department." Much laughter here.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Jacob: "You must spend another year on the


Academic Senate." More laughter.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: In your case Senator


Jacob that means four more years on the Academic Senate.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Mayer: My understanding is that the document


is set up so we do not get that far.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein read from the revised


draft document "...compel either party to produce documents if either party


refuses to do so without a subpoena...."


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Rose: I want to clarify Dr. Jacob's question.


The case this arose in involved a state employee (not a faculty member).


The University claimed that it was exempt from the state whistleblowing


policy because it had its own whistleblowing policies (equivalent policies).


It also claimed that it was exempt from the State Administrative Procedures


Act, which is a longstanding statute that governs all administrative hearings


and the university lost on that issue. There was a suggestion that there


were constitutional claims lurking in the background...so the court didn't


make any new laws, it simply interpreted the statute and rejected the university's


claim that they were exempt from the State Administration Procedures Act.


The procedures that you are talking about are the standards that apply


to any state agency under this act, which has existed for a long time and


is common in virtually every state in the United States. I do not know


if this applies to all universities within those states.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: The Arizona Supreme Court


applied it specifically to the universities. I think I mentioned that before,


it becomes complicated when you realize that there a great distinction


between "provisions of law" and "provided by law." That is where if I read


that ruling correctly, the whole decision hung on.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Rose: It deals with how the statute defines


those terms and what they mean.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: Hearing no further discussion


we will move to vote. The amendment was passed by voice vote. Now we will


return to the amended policy and discuss it (January 31, 2000). We can


hold this over if you wish.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Jacob: I want to press my question. When


we have internal policies (albeit it mandated by state law) where such


a thing as a subpoena is mentioned, and the sanctions for ignoring or rejecting


it are not there, this is very serious. Who is in the position to apply


this sanction and from what sanctions may they choose? I have no problem


with a person being required to produce information in a case that specifically


is evidentially linked to that information. It seems like this is a dangerous


loose end the way it stands.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: My understanding is that


you are then in violation of the law if you do not comply with the subpoena.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Jacob: Do we then call in the Arizona Department


of Public Safety?


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: Or our ASU Department


of Public Safety?


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Glick: I assume that if I for example am


in a court case, I must show some justification, I can't subpoena all of


a person's documentation just because I am interested in seeing what it


is about. I must have to appear in court or go before some official to


convince them that this is relevant to view. If that is true, then who


makes the decision as to what is appropriate to subpoena?


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: That is stated in the


policy in item #9 "In the interest of fair treatment, it is expected that


any member of the university community called to testify shall testify


and that any university community member or university office that has


access to relevant documents will produce them for the requesting party


or the IP Committee. In the event such cooperation is not forthcoming,


the IP Committee has subpoena power to do one or more of the following:


a) compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses who are called by the


parties or the IP Committee who refuse to appear without a subpoena. b)


Compel either party to produce relevant documents if the party refuses


to do so without a subpoena. c) Compel a university office representative


who is in possession of such relevant documents desired by a party or the


IP Committee to produce such documents to the IP Committee if the office


representative refuses to do so without a subpoena. If the party needs


a subpoena the party will request the subpoena from the IP Committee chair


and complete the form for the signature of the IP Committee chair. The


party will then give the signed subpoena to the appropriate witness or


the university representative. The chair may also serve subpoenas on the


initiative of the chair.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Glick: Then the answer is the IP Committee


chair has the power to issue a subpoena.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Jacob: That does not answer my question.


Obviously, if a subpoena is issued someone has failed to cooperate and


they may have in their own mind a very good reason for doing that. Is this


a case where an individual who still refuses to cooperate-- will a policeman


come and take that individual before a court somewhere and then that individual


may even end up doing time?


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Rose: (To Dr. Burstein) It would be useful


if you would have Mary Stevens produce a statement that clarifies better


than I can on the issues of subpoenas. Number one, off the top of my head,


this has nothing to do with the Department of Public Safety of the State


or at ASU. This is an example like the radiation licensing review committee


hearing applied to the university setting. There could be a subpoena for


personal testimony or documents. If the person whose testimony or documents


is subpoenaed feels it is inappropriate, they can make a move in the court


to say why this is the case. They can present their side. They are not


just subject to the whims of a party, the board itself or the person who


is running the hearing. If they win, that is the end of it. If they lose


and then refuse to comply, there can be a variety of sanctions ranging


from contempt or sanctions against the party who would be helped by the


testimony of someone who refuses to cooperate. I cannot say whether the


Administrative Procedures Act has sanctions or it relies on the discretion


of the judge to pick sanctions. It would be useful if Mary Stevens would


write a brief statement to be circulated to the senators on the process


of issuing and resisting the subpoena and then sanctions for failure to


obey.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Jacob: I thought that there would be things


like sequestering of pay, threatening of loss of a tenured position, but


I would like to know what those would be.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Bird: I move to table at this time.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: I will entertain a motion


to table until the next Academic Senate meeting.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Bird: So moved.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: We will move to a vote.


The move to table the revised document was passed by voice vote.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will ask Mary Stevens to attend our next meeting


(February 21) and I will request that she give us a statement as requested.


This is an implementation policy and you must refer back to the ABOR policy


6-908 for certain terms. Al Poskansar is present today and he is the designated


official for the ASU Intellectual Property Committee. His position is defined


in that policy.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vice Provost Poskansar: The term IP official is


really an abbreviated term for the official designated by the university


to be in charge of intellectual property.

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.A Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee</b>


(Jack Fouquette).


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.A.1 <u>Information Items</u> (do not require a

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.A.2 <u>Action Items.</u>


<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate Motion #11 (1999-2000) was introduced


for FIRST reading:</b> Request from the College of Public Programs to Establish


a Certificate Program in Nonprofit Leadership and Management "The Curriculum


and Academic Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of


a proposal submitted by the College of Public Programs to establish a graduate


certificate program in Nonprofit Leadership and Management. Rationale:


This certificate will strive to give students an understanding of the nonprofit


sector's role as steward of the public good and to provide the skills necessary


for effective leadership and management of these organizations. The program


is strengthened because of a variety of disciplines that would contribute


to its success.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The certificate will also provide a complementary


area of study for students pursuing graduate degrees in other disciplines.


Students graduating with a background in Nonprofit Leadership and Management


are well situated, regardless of their primary discipline of study, to


integrate theory and research and to become leaders in a variety of nonprofit


settings.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Senate Motion #12 (1999-2000) was introduced


for FIRST reading: </b>Request from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences


to Establish a Certificate Program in Ethics: " The Curriculum and Academic


Programs Committee recommends Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted


by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to establish an undergraduate


certificate program in Ethics. Rationale: The Department of Philosophy


seeks approval of a Certificate in Ethics. Many students have a primary


interest in ethics and complete concentrations of courses in that area.


The new certificate will provide a way of recognizing their efforts. These


items are before you for a first reading.


<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.B Personnel Committee</b> (Kathleen McCoy)<b>.</b>


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: We are in the process


of naming a new chair for this committee because Senator McCoy has a class


schedule conflict for spring Senate meetings.


<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.C Student Faculty Policy Committee</b> (Michael


Mayer).


<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.C.1 Senate Motion #10 (1999-2000) was introduced


for a FIRST reading: </b>" This motion is in reference to Senate Motion


#6 (1996-97), approved by the Senate on 01/27/97--The ASASU Course Evaluation


Program (jointly proposed by ASASU and the Senate Student-Faculty Policy


Committee). Under the section: "Future Mechanisms for Student Access: 1.


The possibility of publicating the evaluation results on the internet will


be analyzed, including only allowing access to the results from the ASU


campus." The SFPC recommends substituting a new section one: 1. "ASASU


has faculty support to use the latest available technology to post teacher


evaluation results."


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are asking that a substitution be made in one


small section to indicate that they will be able to publish the results


of the student evaluations on the Web with whatever current technology


that is available. This will save them considerable money. Jenny Holsman


will explain why.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASASU President Holsman: As our example, we use


one model the University of Southern California's Teacher Evaluations Guide,


and we asked them to tell us how much it costs them per semester to publish


the 4,000 copies that they distribute on campus (between 12-15,000 dollars).


That is the cost that we would be saving if you support our publication


of these data on the Web. We will still publish fewer copies of the booklet


as well as publishing it on the Web.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Burg: I suggest selling them for a nominal


fee to the students to help offset the cost of printing them.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator McNeill: There is another change in the


wording--talking about publishing a booklet. If it is published on the


web, they are opened up to the entire world rather than just this campus.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: That booklet could in


fact be published by anyone who gets his or her copy on campus.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator McNeill: We should not be publishing our


evaluations nationally.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we do not publish our grades to the world.


I think that access should be limited only to students at this campus.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: In my department, there


is a book available for anyone to look at in the department.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASASU President Holsman: We investigated and all


major schools, in the majority, are making their results of student evaluations


public on the web.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Senator: We should not make this available without


the use of an ID.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Jacob: Your point is made. We may not have


good reason to be paranoid, but I ask if this is the first reading. Next


meeting we can discuss the item further.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator O'Grady: Surely there is technology to limit


this data to only ASU Students for review.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Jacob: Net surfing is common to everyone


who is curious on any issue.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: The likelihood of a bad


evaluation appearing on the Web is not worth missing out on the savings


to ASASU realized by publication on the Web. Is there an amendment to be


offered at this time?


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator McNeill: Yes. I move that the evaluations


be made only available on the web to the ASU community.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: Is there further discussion


on the motion on access to the information on the Web? A point of order


was called by Secretary Bates that this was a first reading and decisions


cannot be made at this time.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: We should only address


informational questions on first reading. We will get the information asked


for and make it available for our discussion on February 21.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator O'Grady: The issue is the faculty support


for publication on the Web. ASASU can do what they want.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Crawford: Most of the material is complimentary


to the faculty that is contained in the student evaluation results.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Burg: Why must we approve this at all?


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate President Burstein: It is a good idea that


the students seek our approval.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Mayer: Earlier in the process, we had more


participation in the development of the format of the information on the


survey. Right now, we are at a juncture where we have already approved


the original document in 1997, but we now realize we need to change a small


part of the document to reflect the use of modern technology.


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Jacob: In as much as this is first reading,


I move to adjourn.
