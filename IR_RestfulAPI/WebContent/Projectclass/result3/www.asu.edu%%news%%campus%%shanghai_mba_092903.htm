      <h2>Beyond Borders: Shanghai welcomes ASU MBA for executives</h2>
      <p><em>Editor's Note: Beyond Borders is an ongoing series highlighting ASU's
        international programs.</em></p>
      <p>        <img src="campus_images/shanghai_mba_092903.jpg" alt="W. P. Carey delivers a speech at the opening ceremonies in Shanghai, recognizing the partnership with the government of the People's Republic of China and ASU's W. P. Carey School of Business to offer an MBA program." width="252" height="168" align="right">ASU's W. P. Carey School of Business can lay claim to being
        the first U.S. business school to partner with the government of the
        People's
          Republic of China (PRC) to offer the new W. P. Carey MBA Shanghai.
          The program will be key to China's efforts to prepare senior executives
        and government officials for global business competition.</p>
      <p>In contrast
          to the proliferation of online degrees offered by U.S. schools in China,
          the W. P. Carey MBA Shanghai will be delivered face-to-face
          in Mandarin, pairing some of the world's most brilliant scholars with
          a representation of China's economic leadership.</p>
      <p>The first W. P. Carey
          MBA Shanghai class, which kicked off Sept. 20, includes many of the
        most senior executives and government officials
          in Shanghai. Two-thirds of the class of 65 hold the position of chairman,
          chief executive officer, or executive/senior vice president in China's
          largest state-owned enterprises. The program has attracted senior officials
          of government agencies who oversee Shanghai's financial markets and
        state-owned companies.</p>
      <p>The faculty is equally impressive. Internationally renowned
          W. P. Carey scholars will lead a teaching team that includes professors
          from other
          major U.S. business schools, including MIT, New York University, Stanford
          and Yale. W. P. Carey faculty who will teach in Mandarin include Professors
          Buck Pei, YuChang Hwang, Lin Zhou and former W. P. Carey faculty member
          Kalock Chan. Other W. P. Carey faculty who will teach with the assistance
          of a translator include Professors Jeffrey Coles, James Boatsman and
          former W. P. Carey faculty member Michael Hitt.</p>
      <p>"Shanghai is not only
          the economic and financial center of China, but also the future powerhouse
          for its tech, bio-tech, auto and software
          engineering sectors," says Pei, associate dean for Asia Pacific Programs
          at the W. P. Carey School. "The leaders in Shanghai will most likely
          lead China in the future - and many of them are enrolled in the W.
        P. Carey MBA."</p>
      <p>Pei says the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic
          of China looked to the W. P. Carey MBA for this degree program program
          because ASU is
          already regarded as one of the best of the highly-prized American management
          programs. The W. P. Carey MBA Beijing program launched its first class
          five years ago to prepare high-potential Chinese managers for advancement
          within Motorola China.</p>
      <p>"The W. P. Carey School of Business and Motorola
          China have enjoyed a great partnership on management training and development,"
          says Ruey-Bin
          Kao, executive director and acting president of Motorola China. "The
          W. P. Carey MBA Beijing provided in cooperation with Tsing Hua University
          has been an important cornerstone of our management localization strategy
          here in China. We believe the Shanghai program will have an even greater
          impact."</p>
      <p>ASU Executive Vice President and Provost Milton Glick says that
          the impact of the program will be positive and substantial, and "will
          be felt for
          years to come."</p>
      <p>"ASU and the state of Arizona will gain valuable recognition
          as global players in education and the regional economy," Glick says.
          "Bringing
            this program to China's business and economic center, directly to
        the country's most prestigious executives, is an outstanding achievement
            for the W. P. Carey School and ASU."</p>
      <p>In November 2001, China succeeded
          in being admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Realizing
        the potential impact of WTO accession on
          global collaboration and competition, the business leaders and government
          officials in Shanghai have made it a priority to invest in human capital. </p>
      <p>"The true source of the competitive edge of a firm is its managerial
          talent and ability to learn," says Zhang Guangsheng, chairman of the
          board of Pudong Development Bank and an incoming student. "By enrolling
        in this program I am setting an example for my colleagues." </p>
