      <p>NOTE TO EDITORS: The 100th anniversary of the Wright Brothers first
      flight is December 17. </p>
      <h2>Arizona State University launches Flight Research Center</h2>
      <p>TEMPE, Ariz. - The 100-year anniversary of Orville and Wilbur Wright's
        first powered human flight is a reminder of how discovery, technology,
        and perseverance can come together to change the world. In the spirit
        of the Wright Brothers' advancement of scientific research, Arizona State
        University is launching the ASU Flight Research Center to embark on the
        next century of aerospace advancements. </p>
      <p>The new ASU Flight Research Center (FRC) is the nation's only fully
        dedicated flight research enterprise in the country aligned with a major
        research university. Within a year, the center will deploy a fleet of
        three unique aircraft to be employed in interdisciplinary research on
        such issues as the control of air flow and the resulting turbulence across
        the surface of a wing as well as air quality measurement. Currently only
        large government labs are performing this type of research. </p>
      <p>The new center is led by ASU Aerospace Engineering Professor William
        Saric. Part of the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering at ASU, the center
        includes experimental and computational researchers in aerospace engineering
        and air quality monitoring, with expected evolution over time to include
        other faculty researchers as new opportunities present themselves. The
        initial start-up cost for the center will be $1.5 with an additional
        proposed $3.6 million facility at the ASU East Campus to be shared with
        other programs.</p>
      <p>&quot;This new Flight Research Center enhances an already outstanding
        aerospace research program at ASU,&quot; says ASU President Michael Crow. &quot;The
        center's open and accessible design will enable researchers from other
        disciplines to collaborate on research projects that would benefit from
        access to the center's aircraft as well as a broad base of scientific
        expertise.&quot;</p>
      <p>Experiments on the planes will be conducted on specially designed models,
        wing gloves or extensions that enable researchers to observe their characteristics
        in flight, but do not compromise the performance of the aircraft.</p>
      <p>Saric says one of the key research focuses for the new center will be
        "boundary-layer stability and transition to turbulence with continued
        emphasis on the control of laminar-turbulent transition." As air flows
        over a wing during flight, it forms small vortices, which flow smoothly
        across the wing. The vortices, much like smoke billowing from a candle,
        begin as tight columns and later become more turbulent as they dissipate,
        causing drag on the wing and reducing efficiency. By controlling this
        flow, turbulence can be prevented, creating greater efficiency and range
        for the aircraft.</p>
      <p>Saric's long-term research in this area, previously performed in ASU's
        Unsteady Wind Tunnel, focuses on reducing fuel consumption and extending
        the range of military and commercial airplanes. It has received NASA,
        Air Force and DARPA support. The research requires low free stream turbulence
        and is limited to either a very special wind tunnel or flight. </p>
      <p>&quot;We received a lot of encouragement to expand our capabilities
        to flight testing," Saric says. "This will really build on many of the
        projects we are working on."</p>
      <p>The center will also build on collaboration between Saric and other
        researchers at ASU and the University of Arizona. The ASU wind tunnel
        will be transferred to the University of Arizona and be re-oriented for
        flow control research. Flow control deals primarily with stall (or flow
        separation) on the wing. Micro-actuators and micro-jets can prevent flow
        separation and hence increase the performance envelope of the aircraft.
        Professor Israel Wygnanski at UA has demonstrated important concepts
        in this arena in previous flight tests, and also has additional research
        ready for flight-testing at the ASU Flight Research Center. </p>
      <p>The third key area to be explored will be environmental pollution, particularly
        in the Phoenix area. ASU's Environmental Fluid Dynamics group has a long-established
        program of monitoring the air properties in the Phoenix Metropolitan
        Area, based on the use of ground-based remote sensors. The research aircraft
        would provide an ideal platform to take the sensors directly into the
        airflow and thereby provide a wealth of unique real-time data.</p>
      <p>The new Center will catalyze strong new ASU internal end external partnerships.
        The Flight Research Center is in discussions to share a new facility
        with the university's Aeronautical Engineering Program at the ASU East
        Campus, which is located in Mesa, Ariz., on what was formerly Williams
        Air Force Base. The privately owned Mesa Air Group (MAG) also will share
        the facility, providing pilots and maintenance for the Flight Research
        Center fleet.</p>
      <p>Saric says the Flight Research Center also has a preliminary agreement
        with the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards AFB in California
        for use of its pilots. The center in turn, will provide the Air Force
        pilots with much-needed opportunities for research projects.</p>
      <p>Saric, has been at ASU as an aerospace professor since 1984. He is a
        fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Society of Mechanical
        Engineers. He received the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics
        Fluid Dynamics Award in 2003, the Scientific Achievement Award from the
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Advisory Group for Aerospace
        Research and Development in 1996, the G.I. Taylor medal from the Society
        for Engineering Science in 1993 and the Alumni Research Award from VPI&amp;SU
        in 1984. He has conducted theoretical and experimental research on stability,
        transition and control of two-dimensional and three-dimensional boundary
        layers for aircraft and reentry vehicle applications. </p>
