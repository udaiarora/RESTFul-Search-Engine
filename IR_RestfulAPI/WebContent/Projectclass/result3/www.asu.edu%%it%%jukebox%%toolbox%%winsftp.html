                  <h2>Windows and Secure-FTP</h2>
                  <p>This page will guide you through the steps you need to follow to upload, or transfer, your files from a Windows (9x, NT, or 2000) PC to your AFS account's "www" directory. You upload files using an FTP program. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol and the letters "F-T-P" sometimes are used as a verb in describing the process of uploading such files. Thus, when someone says you "need to FTP your files to the server," they mean you will be uploading them to a server by means of an FTP application.</p>
                  <p>This tutorial describes the method of uploading using a type of FTP software known as Secure-FTP sometimes referred to by the acronym SFTP. The difference between &quot;regular&quot; FTP and Secure-FTP is that all communication and files that are passed between your local computer and the remote server are protected by encryption with Secure-FTP while they are not protected in any manner with regular FTP.</p>
                  <p>Secure-FTP is a component of a program called &quot;Secure Shell&quot; or SSH-Client which has features similar to Telnet but offers the same encryption protection that Secure-FTP offers. Secure Shell (and Secure-FTP) can be downloaded from Information Technology at from within the <a href="http://www.asu.edu/it/security/software/html/ssh/index.htm">IT Computer Security Website</a>.</p>
                  <h4>Instructions for using Secure-FTP to upload or transfer your files:</h4>
                  <h5>Note: these instructions were created using SSH Secure Shell SFTP version 3.1.0.</h5>
                  <p>1. First, click on Start Menu &gt; Programs &gt; SSH Secure Shell &gt; <strong>Secure File Transfer Client</strong>, see graphic below. The Secure-FTP program will open.</p>
                  <p><img src="./images/ssh-sftp1.gif" alt="Screenshot of SSH/SFTP Start Menu location."></p>
                  <p>2. Select File &gt; Connect. A <strong>Connect to Remote Host </strong>dialog box will appear.</p>
                  <p>3. In the Connect to Remot Host dialog box, fill in the name of the server to which you want to upload your pages (most users will want to upload to general.asu.edu) and your <strong>ASURITE UserID</strong>. See graphic below. Click <strong>Connect</strong> and enter your password when prompted.</p>
                  <p><img src="./images/connect.gif" alt="Screenshot of Secure-FTP Connect to Remote Host dialog box."></p>
                  <p>4. You may be prompted with a warning dialog box titled <strong>Host Identification</strong>, if you are prompted, click <strong>Yes</strong> to answer the question: &quot;Do you want to save the new host key to the local database?&quot;. The host key is what makes encryption of the communication between your local computer and the server possible.</p>
                  <p>5. If you entered the information correctly and clicked the Connect button, you should see the Connection Window after a few moments. See graphic below. The connection window gives you information on your information on your current remote directory (your AFS webspace on the server general.asu.edu), a listing of the files in that space, and buttons to perform basic file transfers. The animation in the graphic below points out the basic features of the Connection Window. If you see "www" in a list of files in the box to the left, you should double click on the "www" so your window will match the one below.</p>
                  <p><img src="./images/sftp-connection.gif" alt="Screenshot of SFTP Connection Window."></p>
                  <p>The <strong>Connection Window</strong> has two main buttons and an additional set of three smaller settings. The <strong>Up Arrow</strong> button allows you to upload files from a disk or hard drive you choose to the space indicated. The <strong>Down Arrow</strong> button allows you to download selected files from a chosen directory in web space to your disk or hard drive. You should make sure that the method of transfer is set to <strong>Automatic</strong>.</p>
                  <p>5. Now that you're ready, you you can upload your files to your web space. <strong>Here's how to upload a single file:</strong>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Make sure you are in the web space directory you want to upload the file to.</li>
                    <li>Click on the <strong>Up Arrow</strong>, you will receive an upload dialog box (see graphic below).</li>
                    <li>Select the file from your local (hard drive or floppy disk) drive.</li>
                    <li>Finally, click <strong>Upload</strong> to transfer the file.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><img src="./images/upload-dialog.gif" alt="Screenshot of SFTP upload dialog box."></p>
                  <p><strong>Congratulations!</strong></p>
                  <p>You now know how to do basic uploading of your files to your web space using SFTP. You'll want to review the other options in SFTP's menus like deleting, renaming, and performing other operations on files you'll upload in the future. As you become more comfortable with the use of SFTP, your experience will grow.</p>
