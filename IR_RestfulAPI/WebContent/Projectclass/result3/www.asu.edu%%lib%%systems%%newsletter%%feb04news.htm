            LIST's Newsletter<br>
            February, 2004 </p>
          <div align="left"> 
            <h3><br>
              Virus Alert</h3>
            <p> A couple of new viruses are on the loose in cyberspace again. 
              Identified as W32/Bagle.b@MM and W32/Netsky.b@MM, both are propagated 
              through email attachments and the &#8220;From:&#8221; address is 
              spoofed, so don't be surprised if you receive failed delivery notifications 
              indicating that you sent an infected message but you didn't send 
              it. If so, ignore it, delete it, and get on with your life. And 
              again, the standard warning: never, NEVER, EVER open an attachment 
              without 100% certainty that it is safe. It's the only way your computer 
              can get infected with either of these viruses, even if your antivirus 
              software doesn't have the latest .dat file. </p>
            <p>If you want to manually update your antivirus software rather that 
              waiting for the automatic update to take place, here's how:</p>
            <p>If you have VirusScan 4.5.x, double-click on the VirusScan Console 
              <img src="untitled.jpg" width="41" height="28"> (looks like a magnifying 
              glass in lower right of screen), double-click Auto Upgrade, then 
              click on Run Now.</p>
            <p>If you have VirusScan v.7, right-click on the shield icon <img src="untitled2.jpg" width="40" height="30"> 
              in the lower right and go to Update Now.</p>
            </div>

            Catalog Adds Link to Center for Research Libraries</h3>
          <div align="left"> 
            <p>We have added an additional feature to the online catalog pages. 
              Users now have the opportunity of repeating a catalog search in 
              the Center for Research Libraries database. The button for this 
              function appears after the NAU and U of A buttons at the top of 
              the catalog search results page. </p>
