<h3>
ASU Electronic Resources Collection Management System Nears Full Implementation</h3>

The LIST department, Collection Development and Technical Services are about to put into production the locally-developed electronic resources collection management system traditionally referred to as the Database of Databases (DBDB). The DBDB wasoriginally developed to centralize and create a single access point for information about electronic resources accessed via the ASU Libraries web site. Since its initial design, it has been enhanced to provides full authorization control and database management of electronic database titles. It includes a licensing and technical information repository and searchable user interface. It has been revised from its original metadata search engine in 1997 to a more powerful and versatile BRS search engine.  
<p>
The database has three views: public, collection development, and technical support. The public view provides dynamic generation and also static generation of title holdings information through several searchable interfaces including web, z39.50 and windows. It also provides an update interface and content management system for the web page development used by the LIST instruction department. The static web pages contain metadata allowing the information to be indexed easily by other web sites and index search engines such as yahoo, ASU web or Innopac systems. The technical support view includes a searchable interface used to access technical support information and communications relevant to the database use and support. The collection development view provides a searchable interface and authorized update interface to collect, report and display holdings and licensing information. It also provides access to the same information views available in the public and technical views for authorized users.   
<p>
The original project team consisted of Annie Platoff and Pam Dunlock(LIST), Tina Shrader (Cataloging), and Lisa Moen (Collection Development), and was developed in response to an initiative developed by the Electronic Users Interface Committee (EUIC). The maintenance and upgrades development project team consists of Lisa Moen (Collection Development), Diane White, Yuwu Song and Pam Dunlock (LIST) with design support and user testing within the framework of the libraries' web management group. Training is currently being scheduled for the Collection Development staff, as the next phase of implementation for this system.

<h3>Streaming Video to Replace Off-Air Taping</h3>

Beginning this fall, Distance Learning courses that used to be recorded on videotape will be converted to streaming digital video. This means that instead of coming to the library to borrow tapes, students will be able to view their course videos online, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! 
<p>
LIST will begin converting to streaming video with the first summer session. During this time, tapes will still be made for affected courses, while we begin educating patrons and faculty about our new streaming video service with printed flyers and e-mail notices. Access to streaming videos will be very similar to online course reserves.

<h3>More Improvements to the Lower Concourse!</h3>

By mid-summer it will be obvious to all of us that there are big changes happening in the lower concourse area of Hayden Library.   One that has directly involved the LIST staff will be the reconfiguration of the public workstations in the area across from ILL.  Physical Facilities will be removing all of the existing permanent millwork and re-cabling the area to accommodate the installation of Multiple Application Table System (MATS) made by Falcon, shown at left.

<p>
LIST currently supports 24 PCs at this location; with the new MATS there will be the capability of installing 16 additional workstations as funding becomes available.  Please view this <a href=lowercon.htm>scale drawing</a> to get a perspective on how 40 workstations will all fit within the area shown.
