          <h2>ASU&rsquo;s Zah helps ABC&rsquo;s &lsquo;Extreme Makeover&rsquo; honor fallen Arizona soldier </h2>
          <p> The design team from ABC-TV&rsquo;s &ldquo;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&rdquo; will help restore a dream of fallen Army Pfc. Lori Piestewa by building a new house this week in a mere seven days in Flagstaff &ndash; on land donated by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians. </p>
          <p> <img src="facstudents_images/Peterson-Zah.jpg" alt="Peterson Zah" width="144" height="217" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">An ABC camera crew was at ASU last week filming Peterson Zah, ASU counselor to the president on American Indian affairs, who traveled to Flagstaff to bless the site on April 14. </p>
          <p> When Piestewa was in Iraq, she told her roommate and best friend, Pfc. Jessica Lynch, that her dream was to return to her home in Tuba City and build her parents a house in which they could retire. But in March 2003, Piestewa became the first American woman killed in the Iraq war. She died while trying to save the lives of her friends, Lynch and Shoshannah Johnson, as she navigated her Humvee through gunfire and debris when it was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. Piestewa also is believed to be the first Native American woman to die in a foreign war. </p>
          <p> The 23-year-old divorced mother left behind two young children, Brandon and Carla Whiterock, who are 6 and 5 years old, respectively. They are being cared for by grandparents Percy and Terry Piestewa. </p>
          <p> The family lives in a small, rented mobile home on a reservation in Tuba City. </p>
          <p> Zah, who is the former president of the Navajo Nation, has known the Piestewa family for many years and helped set up a bank account for the children after Piestewa&rsquo;s death. Her father, a junior high school administrative assistant and his wife, who works as a maintenance worker at the same junior high school, would like to move to Flagstaff, where they can be closer to family. </p>
          <p> With the help of the design team from &ldquo;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,&rdquo; the Piestewas will be able to raise their grandchildren in a new home. They also will have a place to put all of the many mementos that they&rsquo;ve received from people all over the world who wanted to honor their fallen heroine daughter. </p>
          <p> In addition to the building of the new home in Flagstaff, the design team, workers and volunteers from the ABC program also will be building a Veteran&rsquo;s Memorial Center on the Navajo Reservation in Tuba City, on land belonging to the Navajo Nation. The building will the first of its kind and is for Native Americans who belonged to the armed services. Piestewa was the daughter of a Vietnam veteran and the granddaughter of a World War II veteran. </p>
          <p> Lynch will be on board for the build. In 2003, the nation was captivated by the story of POWs Lynch and Johnson, and how Piestewa lost her life trying to save them. Of her beloved friend, Lynch said: &ldquo;We were not similar in size, frame, race, religion or origin, but in our friendship, only one heart existed with two people connected.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> While the building takes place, the elder Piestewas and their grandchildren will be on vacation at Walt Disney World. The home unveiling will take place April 19 and will be shown on television later this season. </p>
