<a id="a49174"></a>Elementary Education&#8212;BAE</h2>
<h3>
Program Overview</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The Elementary Education program at East campus is unique in its focus on intensive field experiences, practical application of current theory, and emphasis on technology. The curriculum is also focused on and directly aligned with Arizona&#8217;s standards for teachers. Courses are arranged sequentially and taken with peer cohorts in four semester-long blocks. Each semester Elementary Education students are immersed in field experiences that directly link with course discussions and assignments. Course instructors have taught in a variety of K-8 settings and can therefore augment class experiences with practical applications. Current educational technologies are incorporated into course delivery and assignments. Additionally, students have the opportunity to choose between the daytime Elementary Education program at the East campus or participate in one of the campus&#8217;s district-based evening cohorts. </p></div>
<h3>
Graduation Requirements</h3>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
A total of 120 semester hours is required for graduation with a minimum of 45 semester hours of upper-division credit. As part of the undergraduate degree program, students will complete ASU General Studies (see 
<a href="general-studies.html#a88218">General Studies</a>) requirements. In addition, Elementary Education students are required to complete 18 semester hours in an academic specialization, which is tailored to an individual student&#8217;s academic strengths (e.g., math, science, social studies, English). The remaining program hours, which specifically focus on the teaching profession, are outlined below. Students must first be admitted to the East Elementary Education program before enrolling in the Professional Preparation Program courses (Blocks I-IV).</p></div>
