                  <p align="left">Some considerations: </p>

                      <div align="left">Like anybody, students with vision impairments appreciate being asked if help is needed before it is given. Ask a student if he or she would like some help and then wait for a response before acting. </div>

                    <li>
                      <div align="left">Words and phrases that refer to sight, such as "I'll see you later," are commonly used expressions and usually go unnoticed unless a speaker is particularly self-conscious. Students with vision loss can still "see" what is meant by such expressions.</div>

                      <div align="left">When talking or greeting a student with a vision impairment, speak in a normal voice; most people with vision impairments are not deaf. Speak to the student, not through a third party or companion, and use the student's name when directing the conversation to him or her. When entering a room, identify yourself to the student. </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <div align="left">When giving directions, say "left" or "right", "step up" or "step down." Convert directions to the vision-impaired student's perspective.

                      <p align="left"><b><a name="Hearing"></a>HEARING IMPAIRMENTS</b></p><br>

                      <p align="left">The causes and degrees of hearing loss vary across the deaf and hard of hearing community, as do methods of communication and attitudes toward deafness. In general, there are three types of hearing loss: </p><br>

                      <p align="left"><b>Conductive loss</b> affects the sound-conducting paths of the outer and middle ear. The degree of loss can be decreased through the use of a hearing aid or by surgery. People with conductive loss might speak softly, hear better in noisy surroundings than people with normal hearing, and might experience ringing in their ears. </p>
                      <br>
<p align="left"><b>Sensorineural loss</b> affects the inner ear and the auditory nerve and can range from mild to profound. People with sensorineural loss might speak loudly, experience greater high-frequency loss, have difficulty distinguishing consonant sounds, and not hear well in noisy environments. </p>
                      <br>
<p align="left"><b>Mixed loss</b> results from both a conductive and sensorineural loss. </p>
                      <br>
<p align="left">Given the close relationship between oral language and hearing, students with hearing loss might also have speech impairments. One's age at the time of the loss determines whether one is prelingually deaf (hearing loss before the oral language acquisition) or adventitiously deaf (normal hearing during language acquisition). Those born deaf or who become deaf as very young children might have more limited speech development. </p>
                      <br>
<p align="left">Some considerations:</p>
                      <p align="left">
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <div align="left">The inability to hear does not effect an individual's native intelligence or the physical ability to produce sounds.</div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <div align="left">Some deaf students are skilled lip-readers, but many are not. Many speech sounds have identical mouth movements, which can make lip-reading particularly difficult. For example, "p," "b," and "m" look exactly alike on the lips, and many sounds (vowels, for example) are produced without using clearly differentiated lip movements.</div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <div align="left">Make sure you have a deaf student's attention before speaking. A light touch on the shoulder, a wave, or other visual signal will help.</div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <div align="left">Look directly at a person with a hearing loss during a conversation, even when an interpreter is present. Speak clearly, without shouting. If you have problems being understood, rephrase your thoughts. Writing is also a good way to clarify. </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <div align="left">Make sure that your face is clearly visible. Keep your hands away from your face and mouth while speaking. Sitting with your back to a window, gum chewing, cigarette-smoking, pencil biting, and similar obstructions of the lips can also interfere with the effectiveness of communication. </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <div align="left">Common accommodations for deaf or hard of hearing students include sign language or oral interpreters, assistive listening devices, TTYs, volume control telephones, signaling devices (e.g., a flashing light to alert individuals to a door knock or ringing telephone), priority registration, early syllabus, note-takers, and captions for films and videos. </div>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p align="left">Models of Communication </p>
                      <p></p><br>

                      <p align="left">
                      <p align="left">Not all deaf students are fluent users of all of the communication modes used across the deaf community, just as users of spoken language are not fluent in all oral languages. For example, not all deaf students lip-read; many use sign language - but there are several types of sign language systems. <b>American Sign Language</b> (ASL) is a natural visual language having its own syntax and grammatical structure. <b>Fingerspelling</b> is the use of the manual alphabet to form words. <b>Pidgin Sign English</b> (PSE) combines aspects of ASL and English and is used in educational situations often combined with speech. Nearly every spoken language has an accompanying sign language.</p>
                      <p></p><br>

                      <p align="left">In addition to sign language and lip-reading, deaf students also use sign and oral language interpreters. These are professionals who assist deaf or hard of hearing persons with understanding communications not received aurally. Interpreters also assist hearing persons with understanding messages communicated by deaf or hard of hearing individuals. <b>Sign language interpreters</b> use highly developed language and fingerspelling skills; <b>oral interpreters</b> silently form words on their lips for speech reading. Interpreters also voice, when requested. Interpreters will interpret all information in a given situation, including instructor's comments, class discussion, and environmental sounds. </p><br>

                      <p align="left"><b><a name="Psych"></a>PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITIES </b></p><br>

                      <p align="left">Students with psychiatric disabilities have experienced significant emotional difficulty that generally has required treatment in a hospital setting. With appropriate treatment often combining medications, psychotherapy, and support, the majority of psychiatric disorders are cured or controlled. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that one in five people in the United States have some form of psychiatric disability, but only one in five persons with diagnosable psychiatric disorder ever seeks treatment due to the strong stigmatization involved. Below are brief description of some common psychiatric disabilities. </p>
                     <br>
 <p align="left"><b>Depression</b> is a major disorder that can begin at any age. Major depression may be characterized by a depressed mood most of each day, lack of pleasure in most activities, thoughts of suicide, insomnia, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. </p>
                      <br>
<p align="left"><b>Bipolar disorder</b> (manic depressive disorder) causes a person to experience periods of mania and depression. In the manic phase, a person might experience inflated self-esteem and a decreased need to sleep.</p>
                      <br>
<p align="left"><b>Anxiety disorders</b> can disrupt a person's ability to concentrate and cause hyperventilation, a racing heart, chest pains, dizziness, panic, and extreme fear. </p>
                     <br>
 <p align="left"><b>Schizophrenia</b> can cause a person to experience, at some point in the illness, delusions and hallucinations. </p>

                      <p align="left">Mobility impairments range in severity from limitations on stamina to paralysis. Some mobility impairments are caused by conditions present at birth while others are the result of illness or physical injury. Injuries cause different types of mobility impairments, depending on what area of the spine is affected. <b>Quadriplegia</b>, paralysis of the extremities and trunk, is caused by a neck injury. Students with quadriplegia have limited or no use of their arms and hands and often use electric wheelchairs. <b>Paraplegia</b>, paralysis of the lower extremities and the lower trunk, is caused by an injury to the mid-back. Students often use a manual wheelchair and have full movement of arms and hands. Below are brief descriptions of other causes of mobility impairments. </p>

These include the respiratory, immunological, neurological, and circulatory systems. There are many kinds of systemic impairments, varying significantly in their effects and symptoms; below are brief descriptions of some of the more common types. </p>
                      <br>
<p align="left"><b>Cancer</b> is a malignant growth that can affect any part of the body. Treatment can be time-consuming, painful, and sometimes result in permanent disability. </p>
                     <br>
 <p align="left"><b>Chemical dependency</b> is considered a disabling condition when it is documented that a person has received treatment for a drug or alcohol addiction and is not currently using. Chemical dependency can cause permanent cognitive impairments and carries with it a great deal of stigma. </p>
                     <br>
 <p align="left"><b>Diabetes mellitus</b> causes a person to lose the ability to regulate blood sugar. People with diabetes often need to follow a strict diet and may require insulin injections. During a diabetic reaction, a person may experience confusion, sudden personality changes, or loss of consciousness. In extreme cases, diabetes can also cause vision loss, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, stroke, or necessitate the amputation of limbs. </p>
                     <br>
 <p align="left"><b>Epilepsy/seizure disorder</b> causes a person to experience a loss of consciousness. Episodes, or seizures, vary from short absence or "petit mal" seizures to the less common "grand mal." Seizures are frequently controlled by medications and are most often not emergency situations. </p>
                     <br>
 <p align="left"><b>Epstein Barr virus/chronic fatigue syndrome</b> is an autoimmune disorder which causes extreme fatigue, loss of appetite, and depression. Physical or emotional stress may adversely affect a person with this condition. </p>
                      <br>
<p align="left"><b>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV+)</b>, which causes AIDS, inhibits one's ability to fight off illness and infections. Symptoms vary greatly. People with HIV or AIDS are often stigmatized. </p>

<p align="left"><b>Lyme's disease</b> is a multi-systemic condition, which can cause paralysis, fatigue, fever, dermatitis, sleeping problems, memory dysfunction, cognitive difficulties, and depression. </p>
                     <br>
 <p align="left"><b>Lupus erythematosis</b> can cause inflammatory lesions, neurological problems, extreme fatigue, persistent flu-like symptoms, impaired cognitive ability, and connective tissue dysfunction, and mobility impairments. Lupus most often affects young women. </p>
                    <br>
  <p align="left"><b>Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)</b> often results from prolonged exposure to chemicals. A person with MCS becomes increasingly sensitive to chemicals found in everyday environments. Reactions can be caused by cleaning products, pesticides, petroleum products, vehicle exhaust, tobacco smoke, room deodorizers, perfumes, and scented personal products. Though reactions vary, nausea, rashes, light-headedness, and respiratory distress are common to MCS. </p>
                      <br>
<p align="left"><b>Multiple sclerosis (MS)</b> is a progressive neurological condition with a variety of symptoms, such as loss of strength, numbness, vision impairments, tremors, and depression. The intensity of MS symptoms can vary greatly; one day a person might be extremely fatigued and the next day feel strong. Extreme temperatures can also adversely affect a person with MS. </p>
                      <br>
<p align="left"><b>Renal disease/failure</b> can result in loss of bladder control, extreme fatigue, pain, and toxic reactions that can cause cognitive difficulties. Some people with renal disease are on dialysis and have to adhere to a rigid schedule. </p>

                      <p align="left">While ADHD is a separate condition, students with ADHD use some of the same accommodations and instructional strategies as those with learning disabilities. ADHD is a persistent pattern of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity manifested in academic, employment, or social situations. It is marked in school settings by careless mistakes and disorganized work. Students often have difficulty concentrating on and completing tasks, frequently shifting from one uncompleted activity to another. In social situations, inattention may be apparent by frequent shifts in conversation, poor listening-comprehension, and not following the details or rules of games and other activities. Symptoms of hyperactivity may take the form of restlessness and difficulty with quiet activities. ADHD arises during childhood and is attributed neither to gross neurological, sensory, language or motor impairment nor to mental retardation or severe emotional disturbance. </p>
