      <h2>Greater Phoenix resale market hotter than ever as rates begin to climb </h2>
      <p>Home buyers continue setting a record pace to satisfy their housing desires - whether it is to own, improve or invest in housing. With 9,845 sales recorded in May, the Greater Phoenix resale home market surpassed the previous monthly record of 8,780 sales set in March. The May total was well above the 7,250 sales in April and 5,890 a year ago (May 2003). This has brought the year-to-date total to 36,555 sales, a huge increase over 26,990 last year and 23,955 in 2002. </p>
      <p>Since the beginning of 2004, the average 30-year mortgage rate has risen from 5.3 to 5.9 percent. Thus, some of the current market activity can be attributed to home buyers rushing to act before interest rates move even higher. Although the home-buying appetite seems insatiable, there are some concerns, including a struggling job market that could impact the future income of owners and buyers alike. Since some of the current purchases are being financed by adjustable rate mortgages, higher interest rates could adversely affect the ability of some of these home buyers to retain their homes. </p>
      <p>The median home price was a record $169,000 in May, compared with $164,000 in April and $154,000 a year ago. Higher prices can be a double-edged sword that benefits owners with higher values and appreciation, while effectively discouraging new homeownership. Higher interest rates, combined with stable income and higher home prices, will adversely impact the affordability of housing and lead to a slower level of activity. Further, people with low-interest mortgages have little incentive to move and thus provide some additional stimulus to the market. </p>
      <p>Since the Greater Phoenix area is so large, the median price can range significantly from $423,000 in North Scottsdale to $85,970 in the Sky Harbor area of Phoenix. In May, 46 percent of all recorded sales were for homes priced from $125,000 to $199,999 and 17 percent for homes priced over $300,000. </p>
      <p>The resale townhouse/condominium market followed a comparable pattern, with a record 1,940 sales for May, up from 1,535 sale for April and 1,240 a year ago. The year-to-date total was 7,240 sales, compared to 5,880 in 2003 and 5,480 in 2002. The median price increased to a record $114,000, a significant increase over $104,900 a year ago. </p>
      <p>The median square footage for a single-family home recorded sold in May was 1,690, larger than the 1,665 square feet reported a year ago. In the townhouse/condominium sector, the median square footage was 1,165, smaller than last year's 1,175 square feet. </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; Compared to May 2003, recorded sales in the city of Phoenix increased from 1,640 to 2,695, while the median price rose to $135,000 from $126,000. Since Phoenix is a geographically large city, the median prices can range significantly: for example, $85,970 in the Sky Harbor area and $227,500 in the Union Hills area. The townhouse/condominium sector improved from 285 to 460 sales, while the median price increased from $90,000 to $103,750. </p>
