While many students prepare for careers in research, the professions, and the arts, others study for personal enrichment. Both part-time and full-time students are enrolled in a wide range of master&#8217;s and doctoral degree programs encompassing hundreds of concentrations and specialties. Other students explore new areas of interest or prepare for career advancements apart from formal degree programs.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690082"></a>The size, strength, and diversity of the graduate community reflect the university&#8217;s commitment to high-quality education. As a major center for graduate education, ASU supports cultural and intellectual activity as well as research in a broad range of arts, sciences, and professional disciplines; in addition, the university conducts research addressing the social, cultural, and economic growth and development of Arizona and the Southwest.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690083"></a>One distinctive project that magnifies the Division of Graduate Studies&#8217; dedication to graduate students is the <a name="marker-1690084"></a><a name="marker-1690085"></a>Preparing Future Faculty program, which is designed to educate students about faculty roles and prepare doctoral students specifically for faculty positions in colleges and universities across the nation.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690086"></a>Typically a large number of ASU graduate students are awarded prestigious fellowships and scholarships funded by the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Ford Foundation, the Fulbright program, and other public agencies and private foundations.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690087"></a>Funded programs, together with more than 30 research centers and institutes, provide assistantships and training for many graduate students; further, the centers coordinate conferences, colloquia, and special seminars to heighten the learning experience. The Office of the Vice President for Research and Economic Affairs provides seed money to enable ASU faculty and students to work at the frontiers of knowledge. Such activities continually encourage the creative embrace of change and experimentation.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690088"></a>ASU provides numerous choices in student life, for personal enrichment as well as cultural interaction. Many internationally known speakers present lectures here, bringing together faculty, graduate students, and the community to engage in stimulating dialogue.</p><div><h6 class="FM-D-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1690089"></a>Intellectual Environment</h6><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690090"></a>More than 11,000 students from all 50 states and more than 100 nations are enrolled in graduate study at the university. Such size and diversity contribute to a cosmopolitan setting that is ideal for intellectual discourse and stimulation. As a balance to this large grouping of students, individual graduate programs conduct small colloquia and seminars where students and faculty discuss their work in an intimate, intellectual environment supportive of student development. The result is a spirited, lively atmosphere in which students and faculty members get to know each other through collaborative research and intellectual exchange.</p><p class="FM-B-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1690092"></a><a name="88875"></a>GRADUATE PROGRAMS</p><p class="FM-C-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1690093"></a>Degree Programs</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690094"></a>Although graduate degree programs differ in many ways, they all share two important characteristics. First, in comparison to baccalaureate programs, they demand a deeper and broader understanding of a body of knowledge in a recognized discipline or profession. Second, especially in doctoral programs, graduate students prepare to make original contributions to their fields through research and other creative activities of a high order. ASU offers several types and levels of postbaccalaureate degrees. For admission information and procedures, access the Web site at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions" class="URL"><a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions" class="URL">www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions</a></A>.</em></p></div><div><h6 class="FM-D-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1690097"></a>Master&#8217;s and Doctoral Work</h6><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690098"></a>Many students pursue a master&#8217;s degree to satisfy their own quest for learning. In some disciplines, such as dance or architecture, the master&#8217;s degree is frequently the terminal or final degree. In other fields, students enter master&#8217;s programs as a step toward more advanced work, such as doctoral studies, that prepares students for a lifetime of intellectual inquiry and creativity or for the application of knowledge to professional practice.</p></div><div><h6 class="FM-D-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1690100"></a><a name="marker-1690099"></a>Research Degrees</h6><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690101"></a>Students at ASU may pursue research-oriented or practice-oriented degrees. Research-oriented degree programs&#8212;including the Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MS), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)&#8212;prepare students for careers in research and scholarship in governmental, business, and industrial organizations or in university or college teaching. Students in these programs develop the ability to evaluate existing knowledge critically and to extend it into fresh areas of inquiry and scholarship.</p></div><div><h6 class="FM-D-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1690103"></a><a name="marker-1690102"></a>Professional Degrees</h6><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690104"></a>The professional or practice-oriented degree programs have slightly different names and distinct academic missions. The names of the degrees are commonly tied to the academic unit offering the program, for example, Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Music (MM), Master of Social Work (MSW), and Doctor of Education (EdD). With the objective of preparing students for professional practice, such programs require rigorous preparation in the fundamental literature and scholarship of the field. Some degrees require demonstrated expertise through an internship, an exhibition (art), a performance, or a recital (music). Examples of ASU fields in which academic units offer professional programs include architecture and design, business, education, engineering, health services administration, law, nursing, public administration, and social work.</p><p class="FM-C-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1690107"></a><a name="marker-1690105"></a>Nondegree Postbaccalaureate <a name="marker-1690106"></a>Study</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690108"></a>Many students enter postbaccalaureate studies without intending to obtain a new degree but rather to enhance personal or professional knowledge. These students may want to advance in their present career, acquire the background to make a career change, or make up academic deficiencies before entering a degree program. All postbaccalaureate students, degree or nondegree, enjoy the benefits of cultural and intellectual activities at the university, such as colloquia, seminars, and conferences focusing on the latest scholarship in the field. By consulting with appropriate academic units, students can learn which courses are suitable to their needs.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690109"></a>For admission information and procedures, access the Web site at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions" class="URL">www.asu.edu/graduate/admissions</a>.</p><p class="FM-C-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1690111"></a>Graduate Studies and the University Environment</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690112"></a>The Division of Graduate Studies spans the university in supervising graduate studies. Since more than 1,600 ASU faculty members teach graduate students in more than 100 instructional units, the Division of Graduate Studies works closely with the university&#8217;s colleges and academic units. In most cases, graduate instruction is offered by units that also provide related undergraduate programs.</p><p class="FM-C-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1690117"></a><a name="19287"></a>Inter<a name="marker-1690114"></a>disci<a name="marker-1690115"></a>plinary Study<a name="marker-1690116"></a></p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690118"></a>Although most graduate programs are offered by academic units, diverse <a name="marker-1690119"></a>interdisciplinary programs cross academic disciplines. Many majors are in fields that are still emerging as recognized academic disciplines and, therefore, do not customarily form the academic basis for departments. Other fields of study are inherently interdisciplinary and do not fit well with conventional disciplines around which departments are formed. Curricula reflect intrinsically broad disciplinary affinities, and faculty are drawn from more than one academic unit.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690121"></a><a name="marker-1690120"></a>Examples of interdisciplinary programs include</p><p class="List-Num-1-lead"><a name="pgfId-1690122"></a>&nbsp;1.

Provisional admission provides an academic unit with more evidence on which to base its decision. Normally the academic unit reviews the student&#8217;s status following completion of 12 semester hours of approved graduate study. At that time, the academic unit recommends to the Division of Graduate Studies a change in status to either regular admission or withdrawal from the program. When students have completed their provisional requirements, they should check with their advisors to make sure that the change of status has been recommended.

A minimum of 45 hours of work by each student is required for each unit of credit. An hour of work is the equivalent of 50 minutes of class time (often called a &#8220;contact hour&#8221;) or 60 minutes of independent study work. For lecture-discussion courses, this requirement equates to at least 15 contact hours and a minimum of 30 hours of work outside of the classroom for each unit of credit. Even though the values of 15 and 30 may vary for different modes of instruction, the minimum total of 45 hours of work for each unit of credit is a constant. Since the unit of credit as defined by the Arizona Board of Regents is the cornerstone of academic degree programs at ASU, degrees granted by other institutions that are recognized by ASU should be based on a similar unit of credit.</p><p class="FM-B-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1690479"></a><a name="25818"></a>DIVISION OF GRADUATE STUDIES PROCEDURES</p><p class="FM-C-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1690480"></a>Change in Graduate Degree Program</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690481"></a>A change from one graduate degree program to another requires a new application to the Division of Graduate Studies.

The number of members serving on this committee depends on the degree program. Generally, graduate supervisory committees must consist of a minimum of three individuals.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690864"></a>Academic professionals (e.g., research scientists, research engineers), nontenure-track faculty (e.g., adjunct professors, research professors), and individuals granted affiliated faculty status through established university procedures may serve as cochairs or members of thesis and dissertation committees upon approval by the Division of Graduate Studies. Individuals who are recommended by an academic unit as eligible to serve as a cochair must meet the criteria established by the academic unit and be approved by the Division of Graduate Studies.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1690865"></a>Qualified individuals outside the university, upon the recommendation of the head of the academic unit and approval of the Division of Graduate Studies, may serve as members of thesis and dissertation committees; however, such individuals generally may not serve as chairs or cochairs (unless they have affiliated faculty status).
