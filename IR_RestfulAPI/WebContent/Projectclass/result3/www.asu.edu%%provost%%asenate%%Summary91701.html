<p><b>3.&nbsp; Announcements and Communications.</b>
<p><b>3.A. Senate President's Report</b> (Morton Munk).
<p>In addition to welcoming returning senators to this meeting, I would
like to give a warm welcome to the new members of the Senate.&nbsp; Thank
you for your service and your time spent with us today.
<p>We meet at a time of great sorrow on our campus, and in our nation,
as we mourn the innocent victims of a heinous crime of almost incomprehensible
magnitude. But we must carry on and do our part to insure that the environments
for learning on our campus are not compromised because of this event.
<p>We also mourn the loss of one of our own senators, Dr. Georgia Smith,
from Biology.&nbsp; She gave good service to us here in the Senate and
as a member of our Student Faculty Policy Committee. She will be missed
by all.
<p>I would like to begin by bringing you up to date on the Presidential
search.&nbsp; At a full search committee meeting on September 6, Regent
Don Ulrich outlined his agenda for the next President. I would like to
summarize his points.&nbsp; 1) AAU membership 2) solidify ASU?s Role as
a major research university 3) Strengthen the undergraduate experience
4) Provide the necessary assistance so that less well off, less well prepared
students can attend the university 5) Deepen ties to the community 6) Fund
and implement a major expansion of our campuses (pl.) and 7) plan and implement
the next Capital Campaign.&nbsp; The committee?s initial task was to develop
the qualities the next President of the University must have.&nbsp; Each
member was asked to submit some ideas.&nbsp; I turned to the faculty advisory
committee that I mentioned at the assembly breakfast for help this task
and that is a work in progress.&nbsp; Two other things that will be happening
with regard to the search committee.&nbsp; In order to better inform members
of the search committee as to where Arizona State University is today,
we have arranged a couple of sneaker tours to showcase some of the important
teaching, research and service programs that we have. To better inform
the university community about the search, we have asked Regent Don Ulrich
if we could interview him to discuss the presidential search and he has
agreed to do that.&nbsp; As soon as that is completed that will appear
as a special edition of the Academic Senate Newsletter.&nbsp; As you know
that I mentioned at the Assembly Breakfast there will be an open forum
arranged for faculty and staff and again, I want to encourage you to participate
and for you to urge your colleagues to participate in that.
<p>We are fortunate to have with us today the Manager of the Employee Assistance
Program, Charlene Gooch.&nbsp; I do not know if you have made use of this
program but they do provide a very useful and beneficial service should
the need arise and you ought to be very pleased to hear about it.
<p><b>3.B&nbsp; Manager of the ASU Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</b>
(Charlene Gooch).
<p>I am pleased to have the chance to introduce myself and to tell you
a little bit about the program.&nbsp; I will try to answer any questions
you may have.&nbsp; The Employee Assistance Program was established in
1990 on this campus.&nbsp; It is a program for employees and their families
for consultation?I really think that best describes why we are here, consultation
on a number of reasons?resource, referral and education.&nbsp; Some of
the people that see us are consulting on organizational development, some
about things that are going on in the workplace, and some about personal
issues.&nbsp; The EAP has a small staff who are skilled and experienced.&nbsp;
In addition to myself there is Joan Allen, an MSW and a certified social
worker, and we have Debbie Schutta, our administrative assistant, who has
been with us since the doors of the EAP opened on campus.&nbsp; Our program
is completely confidential.&nbsp; We really like to have people know that
what you tell us will not go anywhere, and the only exceptions to that
are if there is violence going on in the home or children are being neglected,
or if there is any danger to self or others.&nbsp; We do offer the service
of one-time assessment and referral.&nbsp; However there some clients that
need more time to fully assess what is going on.&nbsp; We can assess and
then connect that person with other resources in the community.&nbsp; We
have a large network within the Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa area and that reaches
all over the state.&nbsp; We are connected professionally to the greater
United States as well with our other colleagues at university campuses.&nbsp;
During the trauma on the East Coast last week we were able to contact colleagues
at other universities to discuss what happened.&nbsp; If we can be of any
assistance to you if you were affected by this event directly, please call
us; we have our network to help you.
<p>I want to share a little about myself today.&nbsp; In my first career
I was Nurse and I have a Masters in Nursing.&nbsp; I believe in the mind
and body connection and that many of us do not take care of ourselves when
under duress.&nbsp; We deal with these issues at EAP.&nbsp; My PhD is in
Family Studies and Family Therapy.&nbsp; That is my background that I bring
to EAP.&nbsp; We do look at organizations, the university, and how things
work within that system, including families.&nbsp; Many stresses occur
in the teaching profession and in our everyday life.&nbsp; We want to help
you find options when problems arise.
<p><b>Senator Dwyer:</b> What kinds of people present themselves and what
issues do they bring?
<p><b>Charlene Gooch:</b> Some of the difficulties talked about are related
to supervising other employees.&nbsp; We have a supervisory model and we
are skilled in writing evaluatory material.&nbsp; We are extremely skilled
in how to talk to people.&nbsp; I created a process called care-frontation
that supervisors can use with employees having particular problems that
are being difficult in the work place and their performance is being affected.&nbsp;
Your job as supervisor is not to counsel, but to let them know you care
and refer them to the EAP program for assistance.&nbsp; We urge you to
tell them it will be confidential and we will see the supervisor if needed
as well.&nbsp; There are employees who have trouble working with others,
there are employees who are challenged by alcohol and other addictions,
and there are employees who are having troubles within their families at
home.&nbsp; We can deal with that and we have a large network of resources.&nbsp;
We also do mediation and conciliation work between employees in the workplace.&nbsp;
There are many ways we can help.&nbsp; We can even do a unit assessment
to discover and change and problematic structure of the workplace.&nbsp;
We interview all the members of a unit.&nbsp; We deal with financial troubles
and emotional illness.&nbsp; We are not a psychiatric unit but we do have
psychiatric interns.&nbsp; We also have a psychology intern this year.&nbsp;
We do some marital therapy and family therapy and work with troubled teens.&nbsp;
We work with depression.&nbsp; This is our list of services.
<p>Brochures are available at the back of the room before you leave.&nbsp;
Thank you for your time and interest.
<p><b>3.C&nbsp; Senate President-Elect?s Report</b> (George Watson).
<p>Today we have new technology, a roving mike, which I will pass to anyone
that has to speak from the audience today.&nbsp; We are meeting in the
newly refurbished Education Classroom EDU C117.&nbsp; It contains special
fixtures that encourage collaborative learning, so you can turn around
and face one another as well as the audience.
<p>Mort explained the plan for an interview with Don Ulrich to you and
we have developed the questions together and I will be doing the interview.&nbsp;
We will let you know more when we hear back from Regent Ulrich.&nbsp; We
are working on setting up the sneaker tours and are seeking volunteers
for that.&nbsp; I have only two other things to report, I met with the
graduate students at ASU and they are interested in doing a project with
the campus environment.&nbsp; Not only the external environment but also
the classroom environment, to clean things up and to have the campus look
better.&nbsp; I brought that idea to the Executive Committee and will pass
that item on to the University Affairs Committee.&nbsp; If you have any
suggestions you can talk to the members of the University Affairs Committee.&nbsp;
Also, I have told the Chair, Betsy Burns, of the Committee on Committees
that I will be resigning as Faculty Ombudsperson due to taking on being
President-elect of the Senate.&nbsp; If you have any recommendations for
a new ombudsperson please let Dr. Munk or Betsy Burns know.&nbsp; There
are four new cases I have accepted this week that will need dealt with
in the near future so I hope to find a replacement very soon.
<p><b>3.D&nbsp; University Provost?s Report </b>(Milt Glick).
<p>Usually the first meeting of the year is kind of a high because we get
to start all over again and pretend that we will do it all right.&nbsp;
This year obviously none of us feel like starting on a high.&nbsp; We have
just experienced a horrible tragedy.&nbsp; I wished we were through, but
none of us have gone through it yet.&nbsp; I want to make a special plea
to take special care with your students, your colleagues and your students
because sometimes some of the reactions are delayed.&nbsp; We need to have
a special sense of community this year.&nbsp; I am told that Mort Munk
represented the faculty in a wonderful way at the student-sponsored event
on the plaza the other day and I want to thank him for that.
<p>We have a community here of between 40 to 50,000 administrators, faculty,
staff, and students who are concerned for others and what has happened.&nbsp;
But we do not hear about those people, we hear about the few on the fringe
who decide to take out their anger on others who do not dress, look, or
talk like them.&nbsp; It is a very small minority.&nbsp; I would like you
as faculty to make yourself available to anyone who may want to talk and
particularly foreign students, many of who are caught between a rock and
a hard place about how they will exist on a campus with the mood being
what it is right now.&nbsp; I want to ask you and I know many of you would
without asking, take that extra time to make sure that we a safe community,
both physically and emotionally.&nbsp; To be a great university we must
respect people as individuals.&nbsp; I urge you to urge your colleagues
to keep this in mind.&nbsp; To those of you that do have unacceptable issues
of behavior that you are aware please let Dawn Bates, chair of the Campus
Environment Team this year, or Vice President for Student Affairs Christine
Wilkinson know about it, or who ever is the appropriate authority on the
campus helps us deal with those issues as we need to.
<p>While I almost do not want to talk about moving forward, I must.&nbsp;
It is the beginning of the year and we do need to go on with our jobs,
because they are important to the university and to our own sanity.&nbsp;
I have a couple of issues to discuss.&nbsp; We have been asked Governor
Hull to cut this year?s expenditures by 11 million dollars.&nbsp; That
will not be easy.&nbsp; We will be meeting with Jeremy Helper, as head
of the student body, with Morton Munk, head of the faculty and academic
professional assembly, and with Mitchell Harris, head of the classified
staff to discuss how we are going to do this.&nbsp; One is always torn
about making a statement about how catastrophic it will be for the state
if we make those cuts, and wanting to make those cuts to do the least harm
to the enterprise.&nbsp; I feel that our first responsibility is to do
the least harm to the enterprise, even if it is not the politically strong
thing to do.&nbsp; There genuinely is a budget fall.&nbsp; It was caused
by a series of tax cuts, which did not hurt us until the economy went south.&nbsp;
It is real nonetheless.&nbsp; Any calculations become random number generators
with the events last week.&nbsp; We will try to be as responsible as possible.&nbsp;
I have a set of principles that I will go by as we try to make reductions
at the main campus.&nbsp; 1) Try to protect student progress.&nbsp; We
have to continue to know that is the first thing the state expects of us.&nbsp;
2) Protect our research, particularly our funded research because we are
very fragile in nature as an emerging Research I institution and we have
to continue moving our agenda along.&nbsp; We set out three years ago to
double our funding in five years.&nbsp; After three years we are actually
on track but it has been an extraordinary undertaking.&nbsp; I worry that
if we do not continue to push that envelope as far as we can we will not
be among the Research I universities ten years from now.&nbsp; 3) We have
to protect revenue generators.&nbsp; If someone cuts a million dollars
out of their budget, and the university loses 1.2 million dollars that
is a very artificial reduction, it is actually an expenditure increase
of 200,000 dollars.&nbsp; We have to protect our revenue base.&nbsp; 4)
As always we will try to protect our academic programs, preferentially
to our administrative programs. As we have for a decade now.&nbsp; During
that decade we have shifted the share of the university?s budget that was
in administrative programs by 6 points downward.&nbsp;&nbsp; We moved what
is essentially six percent of the universities administrative budget to
academic programs and many of you are feeling the consequences in your
academic programs of the deep reductions many of our administrative units
have taken.&nbsp; Mean while we will continue to try to protect your academic
programs, we cannot continue to starve our academic programs and take the
cuts there.&nbsp; We will be balanced in our reductions.&nbsp; We will
share with your academic leaders our plans for reduction, but meanwhile
we will be making the strongest possible case as to why those cuts should
not be as great as we have been targeted for.&nbsp; We have not been targeted
for evil reasons.&nbsp; What has happened is that the Governor has set
aside part of the budget, made off limits for cuts, the biggest thing is
K-12 and I will not make arguments against that.&nbsp; But when you take
K-12 off the table, that is half the state budget and in addition there
are things that are court ordered that cannot be touched. We have already
taken cuts in the sense that the governor line item vetoed our building
renewal and other things.&nbsp; We intend to make the strongest case, not
for us not doing our share, but for us doing our fair share, which we hope
is less than what is on the table.&nbsp; We are going to at every opportunity,
led by Jack Pfister who is serving as Vice President for Institutional
Advancement, making the case why the target we have been given for the
universities in general is too high but we will not do it by putting the
statute of liberty on the cutting block.&nbsp; It is a very delicate balance
needed.&nbsp; We need to make the case as to how damaging this will be
to the state?s long-range future, especially in a state where the voters
just approved a special sales tax to invest in education.&nbsp; We will
try to do it responsibly at the same time.
<p>At our deans? retreat this summer, we spent a good deal of time on two
things. One was the issue of how we position the university in relationship
to the entire state--our relation to the financial well being of the future
of the state.&nbsp; On the second day we looked at undergraduate success
at our university.&nbsp; For years and years and year we were losing 31
percent of our students in good or bad years.&nbsp; We have now moved that
number to 25% and our persistence number has risen from 69 to 75 %.&nbsp;
We should all be proud of that big jump. But if we look at the universities
that we should compare ourselves with, and which we should become like,
that number is not near high enough.&nbsp; I have asked Tom Trotter to
take the lead working with the entire campus to strategically move that
agenda even further.&nbsp; We had a long discussion led by of the Vice
Provost for the University of Washington. They have somewhat better students
but more importantly they have a 90% persistence rate in the second year.&nbsp;
I could be easy to rationalize why we are different but the most cogent
message we got from that discussion was that if you try to treat all your
students the same way, you are doomed to failure.&nbsp; They don?t all
want or need the same things.&nbsp; Your very best students want research
opportunities, they want lots of service opportunities; they want lots
of one on one opportunities.&nbsp; The large part of our better students
are more interested in clear pathways to graduation, good courses, ease
of movement.&nbsp; Obviously the best students want that also.&nbsp; She
argues compellingly that if you try to force what the best students want
on all students they will not accept it.&nbsp; You will find them dissatisfied.&nbsp;
That is one of the things we want to be able to understand how to do, to
sector our student body differently, in ways that must address not only
their wants but their needs.&nbsp; Which brings me to my next topic.
<p>We have a very large but very visible Honors College on our campus.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thanks to that Honors College and a lot of effort provided from this room
as well by other people on campus we are attracting greater and greater
numbers of outstanding students.&nbsp; But we have to make sure that we
give them what we marketed to those students, that they get the quality
of education if they had decided to go to some other elite university.
One of the things I want to talk to you about is that there are about four
courses per typical Honors student taught to them in the Honors College.&nbsp;
The rest are taught out in your departments in that student?s major.&nbsp;
One of the things we will be talking about this year to you is how to take
on more ownership of these students.&nbsp; The original agenda mailed out
to you there was an agenda item that asked you to approve the hiring of
one tenure track faculty member in the Honors College.&nbsp; I asked that
be pulled and be a part of a greater discussion on how do we make serve
each of these sectors of students and how does the Honors College best
relate to the greater university because standing alone the Honors College
will not serve successfully, they do not own the students, you own the
students, they own a little piece of those students.&nbsp; That will be
on the agenda next month.
<p>I already mentioned our three-year goal of being on target with research
funding and that is a very ambitious goal but we have been moving forward
on it.
<p>We are committed to increasing the number of our technological classrooms
that are up to date.&nbsp; Let me ask you how many have been in this room
before it was remodeled.&nbsp; It was pretty bad wasn?t it?&nbsp; We have
removed many of the seats in this room but in doing so we have created
what we think will be a prototype classroom for what we hope to do with
new classrooms while we improve the old classrooms.&nbsp; There is a fully
equipped podium and at each table there is a black laptop power post with
outlets and Ethernet connections.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could bring in a laptop
or a set of laptops and distribute them.&nbsp; Gail Hackett told me to
notice that this was a highly steeped room before it was remodeled.&nbsp;
We have scaled back the number of tiers and there only two rows of tables
to each tier.&nbsp; Please notice that the front desk on the tier is of
a thinner construction than the second desk on the tier.&nbsp; The idea
being that within this large classroom you can turn around your seat and
collaborate with the row behind you.&nbsp; Your thoughts will be welcome
on this because we have on our agenda the construction of many such classrooms
like this one and part that of course is contingent on how deep the cuts
to our budgets will be.&nbsp; We will see how this one works.&nbsp; Having
technological classrooms that do not work will be the greatest drawback.&nbsp;
We have a new system in mind to divide the campus into geographical sectors
for technological maintenance help.&nbsp; We will have a phone in each
classroom that you can call for help with technology.&nbsp; We are positioning
people in these campus sectors for service, and our goal is that we are
committed to being there in five minutes or less.&nbsp; That is an ambitious
undertaking.&nbsp; We have hired a number of new people to maintain the
technology.&nbsp; They will also come in every couple of days to check
on how things are operating before classes begin in the morning.&nbsp;
I want all of you that use these rooms to check on how well they are stocked
not only with technology, but also with the simple things like chalk and
light bulbs for the overhead.&nbsp; It is a critical initiative to help
you do your job in the way we wish you to do it.
<p>Going back to what I said before, I want to thank you in advance for
reporting where we may have problems related to the events of this last
week.&nbsp; We must try to make it our role to see that this is a safe
campus for our faculty, students, and staff.
<p><b>Senator Garcia:</b> I have a question about budget. I was wondering
if in the discussion of all these cuts to our budget, will there be some
small pittance realized by raising classroom temperatures and in campus
buildings?&nbsp; Also in light of the events of this past week, can you
comment on how travel will be affected to out of state conferences, especially
for units that are funded by non-sponsored programs.
<p><b>Provost Glick:</b> I would be happy to answer your question.&nbsp;
We are saving money, and Mernoy Harrison can correct me on this if I am
wrong, by having changed the temperature but basically we have mitigated
the savings realized because it is offset by the cost of electricity, which
has gone higher.
<p>You have a good point about travel and we have started our budget people
looking at that.&nbsp; I think fewer of us will travel, but what I do not
know is what the price of travel will be.&nbsp; United Airlines and American
Airlines stock lost 40% today.&nbsp; I do not know what will happen to
travel or how much it will cost.&nbsp; What I hope will happen is that
we will replace travel with the use of some of our technology.&nbsp; I
am very concerned that we do not maximize the value of our technology.&nbsp;
I used to serve on the Educom Board but I resigned because we had to travel
to Washington, D.C. four times a year.&nbsp; But they said it is not the
same as using technology.&nbsp; They are always saying that we should use
more technology to teach more students.&nbsp; Why do you think we can teach
more students electronically than we can meet technologically?&nbsp; I
am going to meet with the technology types in the Big-10 in three weeks,
and I will ask them if they will consider using technology.&nbsp; Although
you have to teach a lot better when using technology.&nbsp; You can cannot
walk over to a student and ask why are they sleeping.&nbsp; We have to
look at things that will happen independently of our travel decisions.&nbsp;
We are trying to reduce our travel costs.&nbsp; Anything we reduce that
does not cause us some pain then illustrates why we had no business spending
that money in the first place.&nbsp; I want all of you if you have effective
suggestions such as Dr. Garcia did to send me an email.&nbsp; In our budget
exercise this Friday we will try to be as undefined as possible.&nbsp;
To the extent we have to cut unit budgets we want to leave as much discretion
to the unit as possible on how those cuts will be handled within the unit.
<p>In my time at the university, I have seen many wonderful things happen
and we cannot afford to stop the momentum because these are critical years.&nbsp;
I will try to leave off here but I want to add one more thing.&nbsp; Last
year I thought my most important help you provided was when you sent me
your ideas on what I should address at the Senate meetings.&nbsp; That
was effective for me in organizing my announcements, so email me your questions
that you want answered at Senate meetings throughout the year.&nbsp; Whether
it is Tom Trotter, or Gail Hackett, or someone else that answers the question,
I want to thank you all for your input and for making my job the best Provost
job anywhere in the country.
<p><b>3.E&nbsp; ASASU President</b> (Jeremy Helper).
<p>One of the biggest opportunities I have this year is participating on
the Presidential search committee on behalf of the students.&nbsp; We have
been pouring over all the applicant files.&nbsp; Soon we hope to know who
at least will be in the running and be able to report some progress back
to you.
<p>This year we are planning to restructure ASASU in that we are giving
more funding to college councils.&nbsp; We have already reallocated 1500
dollars back to the councils because we think our money can be better used
at that level.&nbsp; We have seen more service activities at the level
of the college councils happening, because we feel that more of the deans
are getting involved and the student organizations that are housed in the
colleges have been more participatory in campus activities such as the
Clean and Beautiful Campaign.
<p>Finally one of the things that we have started to work on lately, but
were interrupted by the tragedy of last week, is the Campus Recycling Program
and working with AZ Clean and Beautiful program.&nbsp; We have been having
more meetings to see what we can do in light of the recent tragedy in New
York, and when students feel better about that we will do more yet.&nbsp;
Thank you.
<p><b>3.F&nbsp; Past President?s Report</b> (Doug Johnson).
<p>You have already heard most of the news of the day but let me emphasize
a couple of points.&nbsp; We are not sure of how to deal with the budget
deficit, but we do know that we need to do a better job of describing our
contributions as faculty at the university and how that affects the future
of the state of Arizona.&nbsp; I may be contacting you for help in writing
about our workload.&nbsp; We need to reach out and tell our story better.&nbsp;
This is not an election year but we have to be in the political arena.&nbsp;
We need to have a presence and an ongoing relationship with the current
elected legislators in the state.&nbsp; We need to be more active in the
next election in the state.&nbsp; We need to influence the candidates that
are coming forward to run for governor of our state.&nbsp; We need to stabilize
financial funding for higher education in the state, not just so it is
good in one year, but in all years to come.&nbsp; We need a long term dedicated
funding source and it is not clear what that will be but our next governor
will have a lot to say about that.&nbsp; I will be asking you to participate
in our legislative outreach this year if you are not signed up for the
Sun Devils Advocate email account please contact me.
<p>Health Insurance is my second point.&nbsp; It is part of a national
phenomenon that the cost of health insurance is increasing, and we are
trying to deal with it in the best way we possibly can.&nbsp; The CIGNA
contract is a one-year contract.&nbsp; Things look fairly good now but
is possible that if things change radically from what we expect, we could
certainly reevaluate that process. I think our most critical focus at this
time should be on getting good service through CIGNA.&nbsp; Instances where
you feel like CIGNA may not be providing services that are promised we
need to be active in intervening.&nbsp; Our health insurance benefits people
will be our best advocates at ASU and the Department of Administration
has at least agreed in principle that they will lobby for us.&nbsp; Let?s
hope that CIGNA does deliver the level of care they intend to.
<p>Dr. Munk: I just want to add that given the constraints that DOA established
with regard to that bid process, I think that we came out as good as we
could have, and that we all owe Doug a debt of gratitude for his work in
that process.
<p><b>3.G&nbsp; ASU East Assembly Report</b> (Andy Jackson).
<p>I just want to mention a couple of things today.&nbsp; We have been
working all summer long on our Master Plan.&nbsp; It is in draft form and
we are going to publish it on a public web site.&nbsp; As soon as it is
posted I will let you know.
<p>Our Academic Assembly has its first meeting tomorrow with President
Coor and we have four more sessions set.&nbsp; You are all invited to attend.
<p>The official count for ASU East on the 21st day is 2,400.
<p>I have been asked to serve this year as the President of the Arizona
Faculties Council, which as many of you know is comprised of the leadership
of the three university senates, NAU, UofA and ASU as well as ASU East
and ASU West.&nbsp; We are represented and sit with the Board of Regents
meetings in open session.&nbsp; The main focus items from the Board of
Regents agenda this year are Learner Centered Education and the Arizona
Regents University.&nbsp; There will be others.
<p><b>4. Open Forum.</b>
<p>There were no items brought up for general discussion.
<p><b>5. Unfinished Business</b> (Second Reading).
<p><b>5.A&nbsp; Executive Committee </b>(Morton Munk).
<p><b>Senate Motion #13 (2000-2001)</b>.&nbsp; This item came up last spring
and will be voted upon today.&nbsp; Christina Stage wrote a letter to then
president Doug Johnson, requesting that the Bachelor of Independent Studies
Program be granted one academic senator.&nbsp; Dr. Munk read from the Academic
Senate minutes of April 30, 2001 ?Their unit is composed entirely of lecturers
and senior lecturers with multiple year contracts, who have been added
as voting members of the Academic Assembly this year.&nbsp; The BIS is
an academic program that grants degrees.&nbsp; There are nine faculty in
that unit not represented currently by other departments or colleges on
campus.&nbsp; The Executive Committee unanimously voted to bring this matter
before the Senate.?
<p>We have Christina Stage here today, as director of the BIS program and
she will answer any questions you may have.&nbsp; This is a second reading.&nbsp;
Is there discussion on this motion?&nbsp; Hearing none, we will move to
a vote.&nbsp; Senate Motion #13 was unanimously approved by voice vote.
<p><b>5.B&nbsp; Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee</b> (Michael
Mayer).
<p><b>Senate Motion #12 (2000-2001)</b>.&nbsp; This item was introduced
last year and the Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee recommends
Academic Senate approval of a proposal submitted by the College of Liberal
Arts and Sciences, to change the name of a degree program FROM: BS in Computer
Science TO BS in Computational Mathematical Sciences.&nbsp; The rationale
for this request: The Proposed CMS degree is the natural evolution of Computer
Science for students interested in C.S. within the framework of a rich
curriculum provided by a Liberal Arts and Sciences training.&nbsp; Under
the reformulation of the degree, students are able to combine strong quantitative
and computational training with the development of fundamental skills in
one or more areas of the life or physical sciences.&nbsp; In particular,
the ability to combine these skills with the life sciences responds to
the national need for scientists qualified for professions in the new technologies
and developments emerging in computational molecular biology, genetics,
protemics and biomaterials.&nbsp; Moreover, this refocus of the degree
to Computational Mathematical Sciences is accomplished by utilizing existing
facility resources and expertise in CLAS; specifically in the Department
of Mathematics.
<p><b>Dr. Munk:&nbsp;</b> If there is no further discussion, we will move
this motion to a vote.&nbsp; Senate Motion was approved unanimously by
voice vote.
<p><b>6.&nbsp; New Business (Committee Reports/New Motions)</b>.
<p><b>6.A&nbsp; Executive Committee</b> (Morton Munk).
<p>We will deal with at some point in the near future the Intellectual
Property Policy regarding the ownership of online works.&nbsp; That policy
has not come to the Senate yet but I anticipate that it will very soon.&nbsp;
It will be reviewed by a committee consisting of members of the University
Affairs Committee and also individuals with expertise in this area.&nbsp;
It will be an ad hoc committee and they will review this document before
we bring our recommendations to the President.
<p><b>6.B&nbsp; Committee on Committees</b> (Betsy Burns).
<p>You already have heard that we need a new Faculty Ombudsperson to replace
George Watson.&nbsp; I and other committee COC members may be contacting
you for an appropriate candidate.
<p><b>6.C&nbsp; Curriculum and Academic Programs Committees </b>(Michael
Mayer).
<p><b>Items of Information (does not require Senate action):</b>
<br>CAPC met on met on August 29, 2001 and approved the following information
items to present to the Academic Senate: Curricular Proposal from the College
of Liberal Arts and Sciences: Department of Mathematics:
<p>To Establish Undergraduate Minors in Computational Mathematical Sciences
and Statistics.
<p><b>Action Items (Introduced for First Reading):</b>
<br><b>Senate Motion #1 (2001-2002)</b>: ?Curricular Proposal from the
College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Department of Philosophy, to Establish
an Undergraduate Certificate ? Symbolic Systems.&nbsp; The rationale was
read: The certificate program in Symbolic Systems takes an interdisciplinary
approach to cognition, computation, and meaning.&nbsp; Course work is divided
evenly between Philosophy, Psychology, and Computer Science in order to
expose students to the subject matter from a conceptual, empirical, and
practical point of view.&nbsp; The Certificate would be of interest to
students generally, and would be of particular interest to majors in any
of the three disciplines that wished to add breadth to their degree through
work in other disciplines on topics of common interest.
<p><b>Senator Sharma:</b> How do certificates work, in the context of our
system in which students? academic work is organized around majors offered
by the various units?
<p><b>Brad Armendt</b>,<b> Chair, Philosophy</b>: Certificates offer a
way of recognizing concentrations of work students may do in various areas,
usually but not always interdisciplinary concentrations.&nbsp; There are
many certificate programs on the Catalog.&nbsp; I believe that students
receive recognition on their transcripts for completing the requirements
of a certificate program.
<p><b>Senator Mayer:</b> I realize that there will continue to be some
confusion between certificates and concentrations.&nbsp; Certificates do
tend to be interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary and this particular
certificate requires nine hours from each area.
<p><b>Senate Motion #2 (2001-2002):</b> ?Curricular Proposal from the College
of Liberal Arts and Sciences to Implement a New Degree Program ? MS in
Computational Biosciences.?&nbsp; The rationale was read: ?The implementation
of this new degree program, MS in Computational Biosciences recognizes
the demand to increase the supply of high-quality personnel who are trained
to enhance the utilization of computational an analytical techniques in
the biosciences, and are able to contribute to the growth of the Arizona
bioindustries.
<p>With planning authority by the Board of Regents in January 2001, a coherent
interdisciplinary curriculum consisting of courses available in the participating
departments, supplemented with key new curricular components, has been
organized to meet the needs of students interested in professional careers
in the application of computers to biociences.?
<p>Senator Hal Smith from Mathematics was present to answer questions about
this degree program.
<p><b>Senate Motion #3 (2001-2002): </b>?Request from the College of Public
Programs to Change the Name of an Academic Unit, Merge Two Degree Programs,
Disestablishment and Establishment of Concentrations.?&nbsp; The rationale
was read:
<p>?The name change of this academic unit is needed to provide a framework
that mirrors the convergent intent of the proposed curriculum revision.&nbsp;
Thus, the name change of the program from Walter Cronkite School of Journalism
and Telecommunication to Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass
Communication.&nbsp; The minor name change reflects the name of most academic
programs in the field and the name of the national professional association
(Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication).&nbsp;
In addition, in the converged world the term telecommunication has come
to mean telephone and computer networks, which does not accurately reflect
what is taught in the curriculum of the Cronkite School.
<p>In place of the School?s current two undergraduate majors (BA in Journalism
and Broadcasting) with a total of five concentrations, it is proposed that
the School of Journalism and Mass Communication merge our two majors into
one undergraduate major (BA in Journalism and Mass Communication) with
five re-constituted re-named concentrations that rearrange the School?s
current course offerings to better describe the emerging mass media fields
that are developing through convergence and the evolution of new media.?
<p><b>Senator Mayer</b>: The five new concentrations are: Journalism, Media
Production, Media Management, Media Public Relations and Media Criticism.&nbsp;
Professor Celine was present to answer questions about this motion.
<p><b>6.D&nbsp; Personnel Committee </b>(Doug Johnson).
<p>Perhaps there is no more important business in the university this year
than progress on the recommendations of the Task Force on Promotion and
Tenure.&nbsp; The Personnel Committee has been hard at work reviewing the
recommendations.&nbsp; We have been meeting each week on Mondays.&nbsp;
The recommendations try to place a greater emphasis on a broad range of
scholarship without demeaning scholarship.&nbsp; The emphasis is on doing
that in a way that is meaningful and which helps units across the university
reflect on their guidelines and the process they use for mentoring faculty.&nbsp;
That is our greatest challenge. The committee has been actively engaged
in beginning to use technology in our deliberations (using a threaded discussion
on the blackboard technology of MyASU).
