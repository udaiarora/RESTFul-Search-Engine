      <h2>Researchers build microfluidic devices using principles of electronic
        integration</h2>
      <p>Advances in development of lab-on-chip devices, which
        shrink and potentially simplify laboratory tests like DNA analysis, have
        largely been tempered by the inherent complexity of the systems they
        are trying to replace. DNA analysis usually requires a laboratory full
      of instruments and several days to obtain results. </p>
      <p>But now a team of researchers at Arizona State University report that
        they have made several advances in the area of microfluidic component
        design, fabrication and integration, bringing the technology to the point
        where DNA analysis could be done simply and in significantly less time
        than required today. The researchers are borrowing their ideas from what
        has become the king of small-scale integration - microelectronic integrated
        circuits (IC).</p>
      <p>"We've basically taken some of the primary ideas of electronic integration
        and applied them to microfluidic devices. This new platform is called
        microfluidic IC," said Robin Liu, project manager at the Center for Applied
        Nano-Bioscience (ANBC) at the Arizona Bio Design Institute. "The novelty
        here is instead of having electrons flow between electronic chips, with
        microfluidics we have very tiny amounts of fluid moving between chips."</p>
      <p>Liu and his colleagues detail their research findings in an article,
        "Development of integrated microfluidic system for genetic analysis."
        The article is the cover story of the October 2003 SPIE Journal of Microlithography,
        Microfabrication and Microsystems.</p>
      <p>Liu said the advantages of integrated microfluidic devices include being
        able to build sophisticated devices from relatively simple parts, modularity
        of components, standardization of microfluidic chips and the ability
        to plug in and unplug specific parts of an overall system. </p>
      <p>"Traditionally, every time you change the bioassay procedure in a microfluidic
        device, you have to redesign a whole chip," he explained. "This complicates
        everything, because then the fabrication process has to be changed, the
        integration has to be changed, the design has to be changed, everything
        has to be changed.</p>
      <p>"Using an integrated circuit approach, we can exchange one of the components
        simply by unplugging it and plugging in a different one to achieve different
        functionalities of the overall system," Liu said. "It is a very flexible
        platform and any time you need to change the assay (a specific test)
        or you need to change the reactions, you just unplug the module and plug
        in a different module."</p>
      <p>The article describes several approaches to the integration of complex
        functionalities in microfluidics. They include development of micromixers,
        microvalves, cell capture, micro polymerase chain reaction devices and
        new methods for making intricate, minute parts out of plastics. </p>
      <p>But it is the integration, the bringing together of these disparate
        parts, to work in one overall, yet minute operating system, that is the
        most important advance, Liu said. </p>
      <p>"From an integrations standpoint this simplifies assembly," he said.
        "Instead of putting every component onto a single device, one chip can
        be a microvalve, one chip can be a micropump. We actually build the overall
        system by assembling the pieces. </p>
      <p>"Hopefully, this will be the standard procedure for microfluidics in
        the future," he added. "Just like the integrated circuit is the standard
        for microelectronics."</p>
      <p>The end result would be a microfluidic device that can dramatically
        simplify some laboratory analysis procedures. For example, such a microfluidic
        device could be used to provide direct sample-to-answer analysis of DNA
        samples. That is, a lab technician would put a patient's blood in one
        end of the device and it would provide DNA data (in hours or minutes
        instead of days) showing if the patient has a certain disease, cancer
        or HIV. </p>
      <p>Such a fully integrated device would require no external pressure sources,
        fluid storage, mechanical pumps, or valves that are necessary for fluid
        manipulation, eliminating possible sample contamination and simplifying
        device operation. This device provides a cost effective solution to direct
        sample-to-answer genetic analysis, and thus has potential impact in the
        fields of rapid disease diagnostics, environmental testing and biological
        warfare detection.</p>
      <p>ANBC, led by Frederic Zenhausern, applies advances in microfluidic technology
        to integrate all the necessary steps of nucleic acid analysis to enable
        molecular diagnostic systems. For example, ANBC is partnering with the
        Mayo Clinic, and IBM Life Sciences and the Translational Genomics Research
        Institute, to develop an integrated "nano-genomic" device for melanoma
        studies. </p>
