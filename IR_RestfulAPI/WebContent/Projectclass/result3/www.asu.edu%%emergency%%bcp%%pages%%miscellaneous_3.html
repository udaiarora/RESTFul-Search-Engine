				Revision of the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Management Plan
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				Arizona State University has been tasked by the Board of Regents to prepare 
				a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Management Plan by August 31, 2003.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">

				The purpose of the plan is to preclude or minimize disruptions in the conduct of 
				the <a href="http://www.asu.edu">ASU</a> mission.  The fulfillment of this task 
				depends heavily on input from the colleges that are responsible for accomplishing the 
				academic mission.  Accordingly, I am requesting your organization's response to the 
				applicable questions contained in the areas shown below.  
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				We shall use your organization's input to identify those mission support elements 
				(electricity, water, equipment/systems, facilities, materials, personnel, etc.) 
				that are time sensitive to the continuation of the conduct of research projects, 
				teaching activities and business support operations.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				After receipt and evaluation of input from the colleges and support units, an internally 
				and externally coordinated plan will be developed which prioritizes the use of University 
				efforts and resources.  This will result in our protecting, hardening, replicating or 
				duplicating existing vital support capabilities so as to ensure a high probability of
				 mission continuation for most disasters that may occur.  Undoubtedly, there will always 
				 be imponderable catastrophes that may occur for which a plan such as this may not be 
				 effective.
			</p>
			
			<p class="body">

				We will be finalizing data requests but plan to address the following categories:
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Teaching Activities
					<br /><br />
						Is there anything about your college's activities, outside the normal 
						classroom and laboratory offering that are unusual or unique in that 
						they require special or timely support?
					<br /><br />
						Specifically, are there departmental teaching activities that should be 
						restored on a faster timeline than similar activities of another department 
						or college if disrupted by a disaster (extended loss of equipment/system, 
						use of facility, water or electrical power which includes lighting, heating, 
						cooling, digital telecommunications and computing, etc. for up to 72 hours).
					
					<br /><br />
						If so, give specific information on those activities that must be restored 
						within 24 hours, 72 hours and within 4-15 days.
						<br /><br />
				</li>
				
				<li>Research
					<br /><br />
						In research there are specific laboratories (wet, dry
						and live subjects)  which if disrupted by disaster (extended loss of a
						facility, equipment/system, 
						water and/or electrical power, etc.) that should be restored
						within: 24 hours,  72 hours, 4-15 days or 16-30 days. Please identify which
						laboratories fit into 
						each category.  For research projects involving live
						subjects separate into 	clinical research and non-clinical research.
					<br />
					<br />
						Additionally, focus on specific issues encompassing extremes and underlying 
						cause(s) which if materialize, would place the project at risk of permanent 
						damage or destruction.
					<br /><br />
						Provide specific identifying information on special requirements concerning 
						any research activities that must be restored within the first 24-72 hours.
					<br /><br />
				</li>
				
				<li>Business Operation<br /><br />
						In the normal business operation of your unit are there critical 
						activities/systems that must be protected to ensure the continuation of 
						mission support operations?  If disrupted for an extended period causing 
						a loss of a facility, system, water or electricity which includes heat, 
						cooling, communications and computing capability, etc. what activity/system 
						must be restored within 24 hours?  72 hours?  4-15 days?  Give specific 
						information on those activities/systems that must be restored within 24 hours 
						to 48 hours (eg. Payroll Services, SIS, Personnel Services, Procurement, 
						Records Management, Postal Services, Budget Services, Insurance/Risk Management, 
						etc.).
				</li>
			</ol>
