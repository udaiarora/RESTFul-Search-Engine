LIST's Newsletter<br>
December, 2002

</center>
<br>
We?re back from the October-November maternity hiatus (and proud to report that 
Heather had a healthy baby boy, Tate Wesley Knowles, on October 24th)! In this 
issue, we focus on the implementation of new authentication procedures for 
off-campus access, and share the results of the Communication Survey initiated in October.
<p><br>

<h3>Web Access Management Goes Live</h3>
<p>
The ASU Library is on the brink of taking a giant step forward, one which will 
improve patron access to electronic resources from off-campus. On December 20-24, 
LIST will be modifying the authentication and authorization procedures used by 
off-campus users to gain access to the electronic journals, indexes, abstracts 
and databases available through the library web interface. The ASURITE authentication 
method will be replaced by the more familiar library PIN method used by patrons of 
the online catalog to check their library accounts ("My Account").  Authorization 
will be provided by the library web access management (WAM) proxy interface. 
<p>
Many pages on the library?s site will need to have links updated to send users 
through the proxy server for off-campus access, so LIST is contacting all departmental 
pagemasters and ERRs to let them know what needs to be done. Old links will continue 
to work for 30 days after WAM goes into production, to allow time for the changes to 
be made. The Help page is also being updated to inform users of the new authentication 
process for off-campus access to electronic resources. Problems with WAM or access to 
electronic resources should be reported to SOS by calling 5-9093 or filling out a 
ticket at <a href=http://sos.lib.asu.edu>http://sos.lib.asu.edu</a>.
<p>
Instruction Librarian Yuwu Song will be presenting a workshop on Wednesday, December 
18th at 9:30 a.m. in Hayden C-6 to help familiarize Library staff with the new proxy 
service. In particular, reference librarians, instruction librarians, and staff 
members with instructional/troubleshooting responsibilities can benefit from attending.
<p><br>

<h3>Communication Survey</h3>
<p>
LIST thanks the 34 Library employees who responded to the communication survey. 
A majority of the respondents indicated that they use the web resources provided by 
LIST (the LIST website, SOS Website, and LIST Newsletter) and find relevant, useful 
information there. The majority of the respondents indicated they know who their ERR 
representative is and rely on their ERR to relay appropriate information. There were 
also some constructive comments and questions, as well as some compliments. 
<p>
In response to survey comments, LIST will try to give more context to the announcements 
sent out via the ERR distribution list, by being more specific about how each change, 
outage, problem, or development affects users. Also, the survey results indicated 
concerns about getting better information regarding problems with the network in 
general, so we have developed a resource list for whom to contact and where to get 
information on network health (see below). 
<P>
The majority of respondents want to continue ERR meetings on a quarterly basis. The 
next ERR meeting will be held January 16, 2003 in Hayden C6 from 10:30 to 11:30 AM. 
The following meetings will be held the 3rd Thursdays of April, July and October of 
2003 from 10:30 to 11:30 AM in Hayden Room C6.
