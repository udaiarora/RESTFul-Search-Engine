      <h2>Barrett Honors College names associate dean for West Campus </h2>
      <p>Ramsey Eric Ramsey, an ASU West associate professor of communication studies, has been named to the new position of associate dean of the Barrett Honors College at ASU West. Since 2001 Ramsey has served as faculty director of the Barrett Honors College on the West Campus. </p>
      <p>Ramsey will continue to report to Mark Searle, ASU West's vice provost of academic affairs, who is responsible for the operation of the Barrett Honors College at ASU West. </p>
      <p>"This appointment, which creates a position analogous to the associate dean position on the Main Campus, demonstrates both practically and symbolically the parity of honors programming across campuses in keeping with President Michael Crow's vision for one world-class university in many places," says Mark Jacobs, dean of the Barrett Honors College. "It will strengthen the presence of the Barrett Honors College at ASU West, while engaging Dr. Ramsey to a greater degree in the leadership of the college as a whole." </p>
      <p>"This collaborative relationship across campuses gives us an exciting opportunity to strengthen the Barrett Honors College experience at ASU West," says Provost of ASU West Elaine Maimon. "In the context of honors college principles, ASU West's program will reflect the theme of metropolitan public service." </p>
      <p>In his new role, Ramsey will become more directly involved with university-wide issues and planning related to the college. </p>
      <p>ASU West initiated its Honors College offerings in 1995 under the direction of Joseph Ryan, director of ASU West's Research Consulting Center. Ryan provided leadership until 2001, when Ramsey became faculty director. Ramsey had participated since 1995 as a member of ASU West's Honors Faculty Council. </p>
      <p>"The willingness of ASU West faculty to serve on the Honors Faculty Council, teach honors courses, and oversee students' honors thesis projects has been critical to our success," says Ramsey. </p>
      <p>ASU West's Barrett Honors College enrollment has grown from approximately 20 students in 1995 to nearly 180 today. </p>
      <p>In May 2003, 27 students graduated from the Barrett Honors College at ASU West, the largest number to date. The campus's incoming freshman Honors College class in August 2003 included National Merit Scholars for the first time. Barrett Honors College students at ASU West fill many leadership positions in student organizations, and graduates have gone on to medical, law, and other graduate schools. </p>
      <p>In addition to his leadership role with the Barrett Honors College, Ramsey is active as a teacher and scholar. In 1999/2000 he received ASU West's campus-wide award for teaching excellence. He is the author of the books "The Long Path to Nearness" and the forthcoming "Leaving Us to Wonder: An Essay on the Questions Science Can't Ask," co-authored with Linda Wiener. </p>
      <p>Along with David James Miller, Ramsey is an editor of and a contributor to the book "Experiences Between Philosophy and Communication." He has lectured and delivered papers in the Czech Republic, Spain, Romania, Costa Rica, Mexico and Cuba. Ramsey is editor and the originator of the Philosophy/Communication Book Series from Purdue University Press. </p>
