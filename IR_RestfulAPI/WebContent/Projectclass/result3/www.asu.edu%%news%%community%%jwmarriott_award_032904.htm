      <p align="center"><strong><em>Presented by the </em></strong><strong><em>W. P. Carey School of Business:</em></strong></p>
      <h2 align="left"><strong>J.W. Marriott Jr. </strong><strong>Chosen for Global Services Leadership Award </strong></h2>
      <p align="center">J.W. "Bill" Marriott, Jr., chairman and CEO of Marriott International, Inc. is the first recipient of the Global Services Leadership Award, presented by the Center for Services Leadership at Arizona State University's W. P. Carey School of Business. </p>
      <p>"We can think of no better person than Bill Marriott to represent the embodiment of a commitment to the strategic use of service," said center Director Stephen Brown. "On a personal level, Mr. Marriott daily models the service culture that Marriott International represents by putting employee welfare first.&nbsp; On a corporate level, through his leadership, Marriott International is living proof that the consistent use of service as a differentiator leads to sustainable financial success and competitive advantage." </p>
      <p>The Global Services Leader of the Year Award was created to recognize business leaders of international stature who embody excellence in the strategic business use of service, and who have demonstrated extraordinary service leadership to his or her communities. It will be awarded annually by the Center for Services Leadership, the premier research and executive education organization in the services field. </p>
      <p>J.W. Marriott, Jr. in nearly 50 years of leadership expanded Marriott from a family restaurant business to global lodging company with 2,700 properties in 68 countries. Known throughout the industry for his hands-on management style, J.W. Marriott has built a highly regarded culture that emphasizes the importance of the company's people, and recognizes the value they bring to the organization.&nbsp; Marriott International's "Spirit To Serve" culture is based on a business philosophy articulated 76 years ago by J.W. Marriott's parents, J. Willard and Alice S. Marriott - "Take care of the associate, and they'll take care of the guest."&nbsp; </p>
      <p>J.W. Marriott, Jr. developed a passion for the family business at an early age, and worked in a variety of positions in the Hot Shoppes restaurant chain during his high school and college years.&nbsp; He joined the company full-time in 1956 and soon after, took over management of its first hotel. Marriott became executive vice president of the company, then its president, in 1964.&nbsp; He was elected chief executive officer in 1972, and chairman of the board in 1985. </p>
      <p>Today, Marriott International, Inc. includes franchise hotels and resorts under the Marriott, JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, Renaissance, Courtyard, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Fairfield Inn and Ramada International brands.&nbsp; Marriott International also develops and operates vacation ownership resorts, executive apartments and conference centers. </p>
      <p>Marriott International, Inc. is a member firm of the Center for Services Leadership.&nbsp; The center's reputation is grounded in the research excellence of pioneers such as Brown and colleagues such as marketing Professor Mary Jo Bitner, the PETsMART Chair in Services Marketing.&nbsp; Their research findings form the foundation of the center's executive education program, attended by managers and executives of leading firms.&nbsp; The center's member firms include AT&amp;T, Charles Schwab and Co., Ford Motor Company, Mayo Clinic, Southwest Airlines and others, who sponsor research, fund scholarships and participate in executive education. </p>
      <p>The Global Services Leadership Award will be presented at the Economic Club of Phoenix luncheon March 24, 2004 at the Ritz Carlton Phoenix from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Marriott' speech topic is "The Spirit to Serve." Reservations at $50 per seat or $500 per table of 10 are available through March 18. Contact Eileen Eddy by phone at (480) 965-3548 or by fax at (480) 965-1460. Complimentary media seating is available through Liz Farquhar, (480) 965-7774, or liz.farquhar@asu.edu . </p>
