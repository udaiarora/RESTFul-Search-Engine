Time may be reduced from a minimum of one pay period (one-half month) to a maximum of six pay periods (three months) with the approval of the appropriate administrative official.  An employee who is interested in enrolling should discuss this with his or her supervisor, complete a <A HREF="sppforms.html">Flexible Employment Conversion Application Program Agreement</A>, and obtain approval from the appropriate administrative official.<P>The salary and full-time equivalency (<A HREF="spp002.html#fte">FTE</A>) of an employee are reduced proportionately.  All benefit programs in which employees are enrolled can be continued uninterrupted.  However, some benefits, such as retirement contributions and vacation and sick leave accruals, will be reduced based on the proportionately reduced salary and/or FTE.  Employee and university contributions, where applicable, are made at the appropriate premium or percentage of the proportionately reduced salary.<P><HR><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Flexible Employment Program Conditions</B></FONT><P><OL><LI>Participation in the program must not reduce FTE below 50 percent.</LI><P><LI>The duration of non-work periods must be at least one pay period (one-half month) but not more than six pay periods (three months).</LI><P><LI>Non-work periods do not have to be consecutive.</LI><P><LI>Once an employee volunteers for and is enrolled in the program, he or she must remain in the program for a minimum of 12 consecutive months unless:<BR><P><OL TYPE="a"><LI>employment with ASU is <A HREF="spp002.html#termination">terminated</A><P>or</LI><P><LI>the parties agree in writing to terminate the program agreement before completion of 12 consecutive months in the program.</LI></OL><P><LI>Upon enrollment in the program, the employee&#146;s annual salary and FTE will be proportionately reduced based on the remaining number of pay periods to be worked during the following 12-month period.</LI><P><LI>Appropriate payroll changes reflecting reduced annual salary, pay rate, and FTE must be made.</LI><P><LI>The reduced salary will be paid to the employee in accordance with the agreement.</LI><P><LI>All benefit programs in which the employee is enrolled will continue uninterrupted throughout the 12-month period following enrollment in the program (including during non-work periods) unless employment is terminated or the employee waives participation in or becomes ineligible to participate in the benefit program(s).
