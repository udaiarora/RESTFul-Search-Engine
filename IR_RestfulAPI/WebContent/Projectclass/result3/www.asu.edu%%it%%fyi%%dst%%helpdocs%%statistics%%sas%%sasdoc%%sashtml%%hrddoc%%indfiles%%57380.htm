SAS/INSIGHT User's Guide, Version 8
</H1><P>
Look no further for your complete documentation source for SAS/INSIGHT     software, including a usage section that explains how to accomplish
particular tasks as well as a reference section that provides              comprehensive descriptions of data, graphs, and analyses.  You will
learn how to explore data through graphs and analyses; identify and        brush observations in multiple linked windows; fit models with
regression, analysis of variance, and the generalized linear model;        examine regression models with generated diagnostic variables and
residual plots; fit parametric and nonparametric curves; and reduce        dimensionality with principal component analysis.
