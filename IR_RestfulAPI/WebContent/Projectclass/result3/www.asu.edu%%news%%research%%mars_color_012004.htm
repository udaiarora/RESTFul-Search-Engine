      <h2><strong>That's a Mars of a different color - a new technology from ASU unlocks planetary secrets </strong></h2>
      <p>Looking at Mars in the colors visible to the human eye, the planet can be described best as monotone. The rusty red ochre that has characterized Mars in stories and in pictures is pretty much the only color one sees over the majority of the surface. But there is more in the spectrum of light than what the human eye can detect. In a range just beyond red, the infrared, is where some of the most interesting martian features hide. </p>
      <p>To unlock the geological secrets of Mars, ASU planetary geologist and Regents' Professor Philip Christensen has designed three instruments to study Mars in the infrared. The most recent being the mini-TES instrument onboard the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, the first of which is currently making history in the most exciting round of exploration of the martian surface yet. </p>
      <p>Christensen began studying Mars in the infrared when he was a graduate student at UCLA. In 1976, the first infrared instruments used to study Mars in the infrared - the Infrared Thermal Mappers (IRTM) - went into orbit around the red planet onboard the Viking Orbiters. Looking at surface temperatures in daytime and nighttime, Christensen used the data from the IRTM instruments to map the number and size of rocks on the martian surface - something that could not be done with visible images alone. </p>
      <p>From his research with IRTM data, Christensen was convinced that there was still more information that could be found in the infrared - information about the actual minerals present in the rocks and on the surface. Using what he learned by using IRTM data, Christensen, who accepted a postdoc at Arizona State University, designed his own follow-up instrument to IRTM, the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES). </p>
      <p>By expanding the number of wavelengths TES could detect, and by focusing on a part of the infrared spectrum that is particularly informative when it comes to mineralogy, thermal IR, Christensen hoped to once again map size and abundance, but now with information about the specific components deposited in Mars' rocky regions. Just as we can tell different wavelengths of visible light apart because they appear to us as different colors, different wavelengths in the thermal IR would appear differently to TES. Each spectrum would display characteristic absorption features which could be identified like mineral fingerprints. This would be thanks to a device called a Michelson interferometer and CCDs, the very same devices used in all digital cameras for collecting visible images. </p>
      <p>TES was selected by NASA and flown first onboard the ill-fated Mars Observer spacecraft, which disappeared while approaching Mars. After Observer was lost, TES was rebuilt and reflown onboard NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft which went into orbit around Mars in 1997. TES achieved what Christensen had hoped, mapping the entire surface of Mars in infrared spectra and determining the mineralogical differences of different regions of Mars. The two main surface components found by TES were both volcanic minerals called basalt and andesite. TES also found one small region of Mars that was mineralogically different, displaying a large deposit of a mineral called hematite, an iron oxide known on earth to most commonly form in association with water. More recently, Christensen and his colleagues used TES spectra to determine that carbonates, minerals also associated with water, were present in small amounts in the martian dust. In the dust, which the wind has swept around the planet for millions of years, these carbonates had been distributed all over the martian globe. </p>
      <p>TES' success led to a second IR instrument designed by Christensen, the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS). THEMIS was flown onboard NASA's Mars 2001 Odyssey spacecraft. THEMIS' mapping mission is not yet complete, but the instrument has already given scientists a new view of Mars - one of a planet that is far more dynamic than previously imagined. The exciting findings of the THEMIS instrument were recently showcased in an issue of National Geographic magazine. </p>
      <p>TES' success also helped to shape the Mars Exploration Rover missions currently under way. Not only did it point out the hematite site at which Opportunity will land in just over a week, it earned itself a spot on the rover itself. Mini-TES, in most ways an exact but miniature replica of the original TES instrument, is an integral part of the MER Spirit and Opportunity missions. In addition to the panoramic and 3D views provided by Cornell University Professor Jim Bell's PanCam instrument, Mini-TES provides thermal IR spectra that can be overlaid directly on top of these PanCam images. By having these two data sets together, decisions can be made about what rocks are most interesting from a scientific point of view and should be given priority for study. </p>
      <p>In MER Spirit's initial landing site, Gusev Crater, Mini-TES has detected mostly the thermal IR signature of dust, a layer of which seems to cover the landing site. Exciting for Christensen and for his ASU colleagues Josh Bandfield and Tim Glotch, the dust spectra collected on the ground corresponds with the dust spectra collected by TES in orbit. This confirmation includes the carbonates, which Christensen and his colleagues believe looks like magnesite, a carbonate formed with magnesium. </p>
      <p>Carbonates are an exciting part of the new story of Mars, as they seem to only form in water. The carbonate we are most familiar with on earth, (and especially in Phoenix) is calcium carbonate, commonly known as limestone. In the Valley, this carbonate is what gives our tap water its distinctive mineral taste. It's also the main component of the stubborn mineral deposits in our sinks and bathtubs. These very properties - illustrative of a carbonates ability to dissolve in and be precipitated out of liquid water - are exactly what makes the carbonates in the martian dust interesting to the MER project scientists. </p>
      <p>Some MER scientists believe that these carbonates may be evidence of the lakebed they believe Gusev Crater to once have been. However, Christensen and his ASU colleagues believe the carbonates may not have precipitated in standing water at all. Rather, they believe that through interacting with water vapor in the thin martian atmosphere for millions of years, the carbonates formed in the dust itself, never having been deposited anywhere in particular. </p>
      <p>Christensen, like the rest of the MER science team, looks forward to the second landing, that of the MER Opportunity at a site called Meridiani. He and his Mini-TES team are perhaps more eager than others since this is the site discovered by the original TES instrument. Christensen and his colleagues are eager to look at the hematite deposit that has been exposed on this surface, and he believes the surface at this site will be different from any surface ever seen on Mars. </p>
      <p>While the possible lakebed at Gusev Crater has most likely been buried under millions of years worth of windblown materials, the hematite deposit at Meridiani appears to be one that has been excavated by the wind, rather than buried. The team looks forward to taking spectra with Mini-TES once it has arrived, looking at these spectra on top of PanCam imagery, and unlocking the true history of the hematite deposit. </p>
