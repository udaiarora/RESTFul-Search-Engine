SAS/AF Software Procedure Guide, Version 8
</H1><P>
This detailed reference guide for SAS/AF software provides complete        descriptions of all statements, options, windows, and commands that can
be used with the BUILD procedure.  Application developers will find the    information they need to use the BUILD environment for building
applications and the AF environment for running them.  This title covers   all entry types that can be built with SAS/AF software except for the
FRAME entry and the components associated with it, which are documented    separately. This title is designed for SAS/AF application programmers who
have some knowledge of the SAS System.
