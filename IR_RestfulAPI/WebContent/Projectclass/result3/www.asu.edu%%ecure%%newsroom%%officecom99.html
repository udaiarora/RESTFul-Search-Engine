    An End to the Paper Chase
</h2>

<p class="byline">By Michelle Pearson</p>

<p>University record-keeping has reached a crossroads. Once upon a time, entire
basements of campus buildings were dedicated to the storage of hardcopy paper
records. Today, record archivists, working hand in hand with administrators,
are spending a great deal of time making the switch to virtual recordkeeping
and rewriting records policy to ensure the integrity, longevity, and security
of confidential university records.</p>

<p>There are many issues to take into consideration when rewriting policy for
an electronic record-keeping system&nbsp;&#8212; dealing with interactive Web
pages, determining what is an official record copy of an electronic record and
how many copies of that record need to be retained, what format to preserve the
record in, how long a record will be retained, and who will pay for the
preservation of documents. In addition, archival departments must also
determine who has the right to access the information and how it will be
distributed and/or reused.</p>

<p>Admittedly, it is a field with many questions that still need to be
answered. &#8220;I believe the organizations that can answer those questions
and preserve efficiency and creativity will be the most competitive in the
coming century,&#8221; says Rob Spindler, university archivist at Arizona State
University in Tempe.</p>

<p>Spindler also points out that the costs of maintaining electronic records
for the long term are as yet unknown. &#8220;We know some things about
short-term electronic retention in terms of hard-drive space used, but the real
costs for long-term retention will be the costs of migration from old to new
technologies and the costs of repairing or manually replacing data that has
been corrupted or lost in the migration process,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Spindler believes that the issue of security of electronic records, and the
entire issue of electronic preservation, for that matter, is a challenge that
can&#8217;t be implemented by any one group. &#8220;The solutions to electronic
preservation will be found by interdisciplinary teams who bring the
perspectives of the service provider, the technology professional, the
archivist or records manager, the librarian, the attorney, and the document
user to the table.&#8221;</p>
