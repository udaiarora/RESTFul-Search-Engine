			<h2>How to Join the Single Sign-on Community</h2>

			<p><strong>How to join the single sign-on community</strong> </p>
			
			<p>ASU enjoys the benefits of having a widely used individual unique identifier called ASURITE User 
			ID. The long standing goal has been to provide the ability for people affiliated with ASU to log 
			on to all their available services with a single log-on, using one ID and password. This is 
			welcomed by our affiliates because it makes things much more convenient than having multiple IDs 
			and passwords. This paper will share information so that providers of ASU Web applications can 
			offer single sign-on services in a manner that is secure and also consistent with ASU's Graphic 
			Standards and branding concerns.</p>
			
		 
			<p><strong>Approach and Rationale</strong></p> 
			
			<p>Information Technology recognizes the need to preserve the autonomy of Colleges and Departments 
			while IT simultaneously provides leadership to provide secure and appealing services over the ASU 
			network. To achieve a balance between autonomy and leadership, we strive to keep the mandated 
			requirements as minimal as possible. In return for this autonomy, the service providers take 
			shared responsibility and accountability for the security of the network.</p>
			
		
			<p><strong>Options and Responsibilities</strong></p> 
			
			<p>Information Technology provides a centrally maintained generic sign-on page for Web applications. 
			We believe that this page is an excellent option for most service providers. You can view the 
			current version of the page at <a href="https://weblogin.asu.edu/cgi-bin/login">https://weblogin.asu.edu/cgi-bin/login</a>.  
			It has a look and feel that is similar to the myASU login page, and is also similar to the centrally maintained credit 
			card information page. This familiarity may give the customer a visual reassurance that they are 
			in a secure environment. It also provides for a clear threshold of copyright violation if any 
			parties outside ASU choose to emulate the sign-on page.</p> 
			
			<p>In addition, the longer term idea is that IT will maintain a page that lists &quot;WebAuth authorized&quot; 
			services. This page will then be available to customers to verify that the service is a legitimate 
			ASU service.</p>  
			
			<p>Service providers have the option of developing their own sign-on page as long as they satisfy the 
			requirements below. In all cases, the service providers must recognize that they are a potential 
			point of vulnerability to the ASU network, and take all appropriate measures to ensure secure services.</p> 
			
		
			<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Providers of a password protected service should use ASU WEBAUTH version 2.</li>
			<li>Providers cannot use ASURITE User IDs for any purpose other than authentication and authorization.</li>
			<li>Providers must use a form &quot;POST&quot; to Weblogin.asu.edu for user authentication. Form data 
			must not pass through any other servers.  User passwords must not be stored or seen by providers.</li>
			<li>Providers must provide an ASURITE icon and a link to the URL: 
			<a href="http://www.asu.edu/somethingtobedetermined">https://www.asu.edu/somethingtobedetermined</a>
			which provides important information concerning usage of ASURITE User IDs and associated services.</li>  
			<li>Providers must register their single sign-on service with Information Technology.</li>
			<li>And, in the event they develop a page other than the centrally provided sign-on screen, providers 
			must comply with the ASU Graphic Standards Manual and the Web Standards and Guidelines Recommendations as 
			defined by the Web Advisory Group (WAG).</li>
			</ul>
