<h3>uni-XEDIT Commands</h3>

<p>Editing commands can be typed in two general areas: on the command 
line and in the prefix area. The command line is usually at the bottom 
of the screen. (You can change the location of where the command line 
appears.) The prefix area is usually the five columns immediately to the 
left of each data line on the screen. (You can change the location of 
the prefix area or can remove the prefix area entirely from the 
screen.)</p>

<p>Commands which can be typed on the command line are called line 
commands. Commands which can be typed in the prefix area are called 
prefix commands.</p>

<p>Refer to the reference manual for more comprehensive descriptions of 
the commands and for descriptions of commands not listed below.</p>

<h4>Prefix Commands</h4>

<dl>

<dt>a
<dd>Adds one line

<dt>a<em>n</em>
<dd>Adds 'n' lines

<dt>c
<dd>Copies one line

<dt>cc
<dd>Copies a block of lines

<dt>d
<dd>Deletes one line

<dt>dd
<dd>Deletes a block of lines

<dt>f
<dd>Indicates the line after which a copy (c) or a move (m) is to be 
inserted

<dt>p
<dd>Indicates the line before which a copy (c) or a move (m) is to be 
inserted

<dt>i
<dd>Inserts one line

<dt>i<em>n</em>
<dd>Inserts 'n' lines

<dt>m
<dd>Moves one line

<dt>mm
<dd>Moves a block of lines

<dt>"<em>n</em>
<dd>Replicates one line 'n' times

<dt>""
<dd>Replicates a block of lines

</dl>

<h4>Line Commands</h4>

<dl>

<dt>change /string-1/string-2/ <em>xx</em> <em>yy</em>
<dd>Searches for a string of characters and changes it to a different 
string, where "string-1" is a search string and "string-2" is the 
replacement string. "xx" specifies the number of lines in which the 
changes should occur relative to the current line, and "yy" specifies 
the number of occurrences of "string-1" to be changed in each line. "xx" 
can be an asterisk (*) to represent all lines from the current line to 
the end of file, and "yy" can be also an asterisk to represent all 
occurrences in a line. "xx" can be prefixed with a minus sign to work 
backwards from the current line to the beginning of the file.

<br><br>
In the following sample commands, the first command changes the first 
occurrence of "abc" on the next 10 lines including the current line. The 
second command changes all occurrence of "abc" on all lines from the 
current line to the end of the file:

<blockquote><code>
ch/abc/mno/ 10 1<br>
ch/abc/mno/ * *
</code></blockquote>

<dt>/text
<dd>Searches forward in the file e.g., "/sas" searches for the string 
"sas".

<dt>bottom
<dd>Scrolls to the bottom of the file.

<dt>top
<dd>Scrolls to the beginning of the file.

<dt>down <em>n</em>
<dd>Advances 'n' lines towards end of the file.

<dt>up <em>n</em>
<dd>Advances 'n' lines towards top of the file.

<dt>file
<dd>Writes the current file to disk and exists the editor.

<dt>ffile
<dd>Overwrites any other file with the same name even if that file 
changed since your edit session began.

<dt>save [filename]
<dd>Writes the current file to disk. If a filename is included on the 
command, the data will be written to the specified file instead of the 
current file.

<dt>ssave [filename]
<dd>Overwrites any other file with the same name even if that file 
changed since your edit session. If no filename is used, the current 
filename is used.

<dt>quit
<dd>Terminates the edit session if no changes have been made to the file 
since the last SAVE.

<dt>qquit
<dd>Terminates the edit session even if changes have not been saved.

<dt>left <em>n</em>
<dd>Shifts 'n' columns to the left.

<dt>right <em>n</em>
<dd>Shifts 'n' columns to the right.

<dt>get filename
<dd>Retrieves a file and places after the current line.

<dt>input string
<dd>Inserts a single line of text into the file or puts uni-XEDIT in 
input mode. In the following sample commands, the first command inserts 
a new line containing "string" immediately after the current line. The 
second command puts uni-XEDIT into input mode which permits multiple 
lines to be inserted into the file. To exit input mode, press the ENTER 
key twice.

<blockquote><code>
input string<br>
input
</code></blockquote>

<dt>help
<dd>Displays the help file.

<dt>recover <em>n</em>
<dd>Recovers 'n' number of deleted lines (last ones are recovered 
first). "rec *" recovers all the deleted lines.

<dt>shift right <em>n</em> <em>m</em>
<dd>Moves data 'n' columns to the right on 'm' lines. For example,

<blockquote><code>
shift right 5 *
</code></blockquote>

moves data five columns to the right on all (*) lines. "r" can be 
replaced with "left" if you wish to move the data to the left.

<dt>cfirst
<dd>Shifts the column pointer left to the leftmost column that you can 
edit.

<dt>zone <em>x</em> <em>y</em>
<dd>Limits the column scanning for target searches between starting 
(left) and ending (right) columns. For example,

<blockquote><code>
zone 5 *
</code></blockquote>

limits scanning between column 5 and the rightmost column and includes 
the column 5 and the rightmost column.

<dt>:<em>n</em>
<dd>Identifies 'n' as the current line.

<dt>?
<dd>Displays the last command.

</dl>
