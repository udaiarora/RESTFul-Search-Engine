Reasonable and properly supported interviewee expenses can be paid by the university. Interviewee expenses are prohibited on state accounts with the exception of agency/org FA1 1004 (see <a href="#academic affairs">&#147;Academic Affairs Procedures (Tempe Campus)</a>.&#148;  A request to reimburse an interviewee must be on a Quick Payment Voucher (PVQ) and must include the interviewee&#146;s name and home mailing address.<p>An <a href="finforms.html">Interviewee Expense Summary</a> form must accompany the PVQ. Interviewee expenses are charged to object/sub-object code 7390 31. The vendor code INTV1 must be used on the PVQ.<p>Standard interviewee expenses are indicated in the following table.<a href="fin421-02table.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">D</font></a><p><table border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1><tr><th colspan=2>Interviewee Expenses</th></tr><tr><th>Expense</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td valign=TOP>Air travel</td><td valign=TOP>Transportation by a scheduled flight is paid at the lowest airfare available on the date of the flight, excluding excursion or economy fares. If a candidate takes a side trip for another interview, ASU will divide the transportation cost with the other organization proportionally. If the side trip is personal, the candidate should assume a proportionate share of the airfare.</td></tr><tr><td valign=TOP>Mileage</td><td valign=TOP>Mileage incurred on the interviewee&#146;s personal vehicle to travel from home to the airport and back home is paid at the current mileage rate allowed by the Arizona State Department of Administration  (see the <a href="travel.html">Financial Services Travel Page</a> for the current rate).  Mileage reimbursement is in lieu of reimbursement for actual gas receipts.  An interviewee may also claim reimbursement for mileage if a personal vehicle is used for transportation to Tempe; however, the reimbursement can be no higher than airfare to Phoenix or mileage by the most direct route, based on least cost to the university.</td></tr><tr><td valign=TOP>Lodging and food</td><td valign=TOP>Room charges at single occupant rates are paid. Receipts for hotel charges must be attached to the Interviewee Expense Summary form.  Meals are reimbursed at actual cost.  Receipts are required for meals in excess of &#036;29.50 per day.  Interviewees should not claim reimbursement for meals provided at no cost. Total meal and lodging expenses in excess of $134 per day will require a written justification by the department authorizing reimbursement.</td></tr><tr><td valign=TOP>In-town transportation</td><td valign=TOP>Transportation costs such as charges for airport limousines and taxicabs are paid if hotel courtesy shuttle is not available. If costs exceed &#036;25, original receipts must be attached.</td></tr></table><font color="#FFFFFF"><a name="endtable">endtable</a></font><p>It is recommended that interviewees pay for expenses from personal funds and then request reimbursement.  If the interviewee is charging costs to a credit card, he or she will usually receive ASU&#146;s reimbursement before payment of the credit card is due.  Procedures for prepaid airline tickets and for direct payment of hotels/motels are presented below.  Payments in excess of the standard amounts listed above must be authorized in advance by the hosting department and may, at the discretion of Financial Services, require approval of the area&#146;s provost/vice provost/vice president.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Prepaid Airline Tickets</b></font><p>Interviewees may make their own airline reservations, pay for their tickets, and then request reimbursement from the university.  Departments may also use one of the university&#146;s contracted travel agencies for prepaid travel of interviewees and other university guests. (See the <a href="travel.html">Financial Services Travel Page</a> for a listing of contracted travel agencies.) To purchase a prepaid airline ticket, the university department must process an internal purchase order (PO), using object code 7390 31, interviewee expenses. Before the airline ticket can be issued, the internal ASU PO number must be furnished to the contracted travel agency. Since the traveler is not an ASU employee (i.e., interviewee or consultant), the department will need to complete the Pre-Paid Airfare for Non-ASU Travelers form. Copies of the form should be maintained by the department for audit availability. The dollar amount of the prepaid airline ticket should not be included on the interviewee&#146;s expense reimbursement claim. If the interviewee cancels the interview, it is the department&#146;s responsibility to make sure that the prepaid ticket is canceled and the money refunded.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Direct Payment of Hotel/Motel</b></font><p>Instead of the interviewee paying hotel charges personally, a department can request that the university pay the hotel directly for the interviewee&#146;s stay.  The department should request that the hotel bill ASU.  When the invoice is received, the department should process a PV to pay the hotel. The department can also use its ASU Purchasing Card to pay the hotel directly. The department is required to keep the hotel invoice on file and available for review for five years.<p>The PV document number or Purchasing Card number should be listed by the department on the interviewee&#146;s expense summary.  The dollar amount of hotel/motel charges is not, however, to be included on the interviewee&#146;s expense reimbursement claim.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Reimbursement Payments</b></font><p>Reimbursement checks normally will be mailed to the interviewee&#146;s home address after the interviewee has visited the campus; however, in an emergency, a check can be prepared while a candidate is on campus.  A minimum of four hours is required to process an emergency reimbursement.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Coding of Meal Reimbursement</b></font><p>The Interviewee&#146;s Expenses object code, 7390 31, is used only for the interviewee&#146;s own meals.  Expenses incurred by ASU faculty and staff to host an interviewee are coded to the food object code, 7390 06.  For example, if two faculty members take an interviewee out to lunch, the portion of the meal attributable to the two faculty members must be coded to the food object code, 7390 06.  (See <a href="fin420-02.html">FIN 420&#150;02</a>, &#147;Business Meals, Food, and Related Expenses,&#148; for more information.)<p><hr><font size=+1><b><a name="academic affairs"></a>Academic Affairs Procedures (Tempe Campus)</b></font><p>The following are special interviewee payment procedures for academic positions:<p><ol><li>Travel expenses for up to two candidates for an authorized position can be reimbursed from the university interviewee expense agency/org, FA1 1004, maintained by the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University.  An authorized position is one covered by an approved Authorization to Recruit form.</li><p><li>Reimbursements for expenses of interviewee spouses are not chargeable to the interviewee expense agency/org.</li><p><li>Charges for rental cars and long distance telephone calls included in hotel bills are not reimbursable from the interviewee expense agency/org.  If a rental car is required and long distance telephone calls are incurred, the charges need to be assumed by the department or college, unless special permission has been granted in advance by the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University.</li></ol><p>If a successful candidate has not been selected after two persons have been interviewed on campus, a request may be submitted to bring an additional interviewee to campus.  This request is to be submitted to and approved by the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University before the interviewee is invited to campus.  In considering such requests, all alternative funding possibilities, such as local funds and joint funding, will be explored.<p><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><hr><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">FIN</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | FIN&#160;manual&#160;<a href="fin001.html">contact</a> | Financial&#160;Services&#160;Web&#160;<a href="comptrollers.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center></body></html>
