      <h2>ASU community considers campus safe</h2>
      <p>As the ASU community returns for another exciting and busy academic year, ASU's Department of Public Safety reminds everyone that they are available to assist with emergencies and help assure the welfare of community members. </p>
      <p>The ASU Sociology Survey Research Laboratory (SRL) conducted a mail survey and a Web survey for ASU's Department of Public Safety from October 2003 to May 2004. The purpose&nbsp; was to measure faculty, staff and student perceptions of the Department of Public Safety and the department's presence on ASU's Tempe Campus. </p>
      <p>The Police Services Public Opinion Survey contained questions on personal safety and safety of personal property, police department response and professionalism, the importance of certain policy functions and demographics of the service population at ASU's Tempe Campus. </p>
      <p>John Pickens, director and chief of ASU's Department of Public Safety, said the survey results were positive and have provided feedback that will help DPS continue to serve the ASU community. </p>
      <p>"This survey serves as a tool for us," he said. "It helps us assess where we are meeting our goals and where we need to make adjustments to strengthen our efforts of serving the ASU campus." </p>
      <p>Of the responses received, 56 percent were female and 44 percent were male. The ASU Survey Research Laboratory drew from a list of all student e-mail accounts and randomly selected 6,261 students. A thousand faculty and staff were randomly selected from a list of all faculty and staff. The response figures are consistent with the survey conducted in 2000 in which 58 percent of the respondents were female and 42 percent were male. </p>
      <p>Student responses were high when compared to previous surveys conducted in 1997 and 2000. This year, 832 students responded to the survey compared to 293 in 2000 and 294 in 1997. Previous executive summaries suggested finding ways to increase student response in future surveys. That goal was successfully achieved this time. </p>
      <p>This year's survey was changed to give the respondents more choice in their answers, at the suggestion of the ASU Survey Research Laboratory. The changes were designed to portray a more accurate picture of existing perceptions than pervious surveys allowed. </p>
      <p>Pickens says the ASU community needs to feel they are working and living in a secure environment. According to survey results, 71 percent of the student responders reported feeling very safe or completely safe on campus, and 69 percent of faculty and staff reported feeling the same. Only 1 percent of all respondents reported feeling not safe at all. </p>
      <p>Individuals feel the least safe on campus between 8 p.m. and midnight and midnight to 4 a.m. Daylight hours from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. were considered to be the safest. </p>
      <p>Several questions were asked to obtain the public perception of safety of personal property. These included vehicles, bicycles and other personal property. Students, faculty and staff believe their personal property is somewhat safe, very safe or completely safe. However, this was not true when it came to bicycles - 50 percent of students and 52 percent of ASU faculty and staff believe their bicycles are not very safe or not safe at all. </p>
      <p>The survey indicated the public is generally satisfied with police presence on the streets, in common areas, in parking structures, parking lots, dorms and buildings. The majority of students, faculty and staff reported police presence to be somewhat safe, very safe or completely safe. </p>
      <p>"Overall, we're pleased with the results," Pickens said, "and we will continue to serve the community and make ASU a safe place for learning and educating." </p>
