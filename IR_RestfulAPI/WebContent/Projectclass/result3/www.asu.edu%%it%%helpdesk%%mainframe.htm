			<h2>Logging Into the Mainframe</h2>

			<p> There have been several changes to the procedure for logging into, or resetting a password in, Queensland since the implementation of the <acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym>/SecuRemote firewall authentication system.  Most notably, there are extra logins and unfamiliar screens.  On this page, we will try to provide an all-inclusive guide to logging in and resetting a password in the new system.</p>

			<p> The first login point is now the <acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym>/SecuRemote login.  This login requires your <acronym title="Arizona State University Rational Information Technology Environment">ASURITE</acronym> User<abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> and Kerberos password.  The Kerberos password is used for logging into computers in the public computing labs and classrooms; <a href="http://www.asu.edu/interactive/" target="_blank"><acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> Interactive</a>, and <a href="http://my.asu.edu" target="_blank">my<acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym></a> webpages; the <a href="../fyi/dst/servers.html#R">general (general.asu.edu), research/statistics (research.asu.edu and stats.asu.edu), and <acronym title="Silicon Graphics Incorporated">SGI</acronym> Origin 2000</a> (medusa.asu.edu) unix servers; or making a <a href="../tempe/comm/modem.html"><acronym title="Point to Point Protocol">PPP</acronym></a> dial-up connection.  It is NOT the same password that is used for logging into a Novell or Microsoft NT network or Microsoft Outlook for Exchange email, though the Kerberos password can be set to the same value as the passwords for those systems.</p>

			<h2><acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym>/SecuRemote</h2>

			<ol>

			<li>The <acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym>/SecuRemote window asks the user to authenticate to the site <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> <abbr title="Firewall">FW</abbr>.  Type your <acronym title="Arizona State University Rational Information Technology Environment">ASURITE</acronym> User<acronym title="Identification">ID</acronym> in the field labeled &#34;User Name&#34;.  Enter your Kerberos password in the field labeled &#34;Type in password now&#34;.  To view the window <strong><a href="img/racf/VPN.jpg" target="_blank">click here</a></strong>.<br /></li>

			<li>  If you enter an incorrect combination of User<abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> and password, you will receive an error &#34;Negotiation with firewall at site <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> <abbr title="Firewall">FW</abbr> has failed. Access denied - wrong user name or password.&#34;  To view the error message window <strong><a href="img/racf/VPN_Wrong_Username_Password.jpg" target="_blank">click here</a></strong>.<br /></li>

			<li>  If you have attempted every combination of User<abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> and password you believe possible, but you are still receiving that error message, contact the IT Help Desk at 480-965-6500 or <a href="/askit/">submit a question</a>.<br /></li>

			<li>  A successful login will display the message &#34;User xxxxxx authenticated by Radius authentication&#34;.  To view the window <strong><a href="img/racf/VPN_Success.jpg" target="_blank">click here</a></strong>.<br /></li>

			</ol>

			<h2>Queensland (the SOLVE screen)</h2>

			<ol>

			<li>  Once you have successfully logged in through <acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym>/SecuRemote, the Queensland program will open to the first login screen, commonly referred to as the SOLVE screen because that word is spelled out in big letters.  There are spaces to enter a UserID and a password.  To view the window <strong><a href="img/racf/Solve.jpg" target="_blank" title="Once you have successfully logged in through VPN/SecuRemote, the Queensland program will open to the first login screen, commonly referred to as the SOLVE screen because that word is spelled out in big letters.  There are spaces to enter a UserID and a password.">click here</a></strong>.<br /></li>

			<li>  The SOLVE screen requires you to login with your <acronym title="Resource Access Control Facility">RACF</acronym>/<acronym title="Customer Information Control System">CICS</acronym> password.  This is the same password you would normally use on the <acronym title="Arizona State University">ASU</acronym> screen if you had logged in using an access card.<br /></li>

			<li>  Entering an incorrect password on the SOLVE screen will result in a &#34;password incorrect&#34; error (in red text at the top of the screen). To view the window <strong><a href="img/racf/Solve_Password_Incorrect.jpg" target="_blank" title="Entering an incorrect password on the SOLVE screen will result in a "Password Incorrect" error (in colored text at the top of the screen).">click here</a></strong>.<br /></li>

			<li>  If the password you entered is correct but has expired, you will need to create a new password.  The new password must be 6-8 alphanumeric characters in length.  The system remembers the last nine passwords you have used, and it will not let you use any of those passwords.  If you receive an error, try again with a different new password.  On the first screen, type your new password and hit the Enter key.  The page contains fields labeled &#34;Command&#34;, &#34;User Name&#34;, &#34;User Location&#34;, &#34;Telephone Number&#34; and &#34;Time Zone Name&#34;.  Ignore all of those fields and only enter information in the &#34;New Password&#34; field.  To view the window <strong><a href="img/racf/Solve_Password_Expired.jpg" target="_blank" title="If the password you enter is correct but has expired, you will need to set a new one at the screen that pops up.  The new password must be 6-8 alphanumeric characters in length.

On the first screen, type your new password and hit the Enter key.  The page contains fields labeled Command, User Name, User Location, Telephone Number and Time Zone Name.  Ignore all of those fields and only enter information in the New Password field.">click here</a></strong>.<br /></li>

			<li>  The next screen will look the same except the &#34;New Password&#34; field will change to &#34;Re-enter New Password&#34;.  Type your new password again and hit Enter.  To view the window <strong><a href="img/racf/Solve_Password_Expired_Re-Enter.jpg" target="_blank" title="The page contains fields labeled "Command", "User Name", "User Location", "Telephone Number" and "Time Zone Name".

			<li>  If you create a new password that does not meet the password requirements of 6-8 characters and something you have not used as one of your last 9 passwords, you"ll receive a message saying &#34;Password Not Changed&#34;.  To view the window <strong><a href="img/racf/Solve_Password_Expired_Used.jpg" target="_blank" title="If you create a new password that does not meet the password requirements of 6-8 characters and something you have not used as one of your last 9 passwords, you'll receive a message saying &#34;New Password Invalid&#34;.">click here</a></strong>.<br /></li>

			<li>  Once you have successfully logged in or changed your password at the SOLVE screen, you will be taken to the Primary Menu.  The Primary Menu is where you choose which database you wish to access.  Examples would be #5 for the Administrative Database or #11 for Advantage.  To view the window <strong><a href="img/racf/Primary_Menu.jpg" target="_blank" title="Once you've successfully logged in or changed your password at the SOLVE screen, you will end up at the Primary Menu.
