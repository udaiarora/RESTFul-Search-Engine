	  <h2>Applying for Graduation</h2>
	  <p>Upon completion of the courses listed in the Undergraduate Program  of Study or the Declaration of Graduation and compliance with  university requirements, you will be eligible to graduate from Arizona  State University. The following steps are required to complete the  graduation process:</p>
	  <ol>
        <li> Register for your final semester (either pre-register, Sun Dial or online).</li>
	    <li> Meet with your advisor to check your Program of Study or Study of Declaration of Graduation.</li>
	    <li> Pay your graduation fee at the University Cashier's Office (Second  floor, Student Services Building) and bring the fee receipt and  completed graduation survey to the Graduation Section (first floor,  Student Services Building).</li>
    </ol>
	  <p>At that time, your Program of Study or Declaration of Graduation  will be reviewed and your eligibility will be verified. Students at  ASU's West campus may apply for graduation at the Admissions &amp;  Records Office - 602-543-8123. Students at ASU's Polytechnic campus may  apply for graduation at the OASIS Center - 480-727-1142. Students   at ASU's Downtown Phoenix campus may apply for graduation at the   Enrollment Services Office - 602-496-4372. The official  commencement program will only include the names of students who apply on or before the graduation filing deadline.</p>
	  <h2>Resources</h2>
	  <p><strong><a href="http://career.asu.edu/">Career Services</a></strong><br>
	    Resource centers at the Tempe campus, West campus and Polytechnic  campus provide information on career planning, employment and  occupational information and job search strategies. Graduating students  and alumni may register for free with Career Services via the web  giving them access to career education, interview opportunities and  career and job fairs.</p>
	  <p><strong><a href="http://www.asu.edu/graduate/">Graduate School</a></strong> <br>
	    It's not too late to take graduate school entrance exams. If you are  interested, please check with the university to which you are applying  for the appropriate test to take.

	  <h2><a href="http://www.asu.edu/alumni/">ASU Alumni Association</a></h2>
	  <p>Just because you're leaving campus doesn't mean you're leaving ASU.  You can stay connected to your alma mater through the ASU Alumni  Association.</p>
	  <p>Whether you stay in Tempe or move across the country, the Alumni  Association is your partner in maintaining relationships, becoming  active in your community and pursuing your professional goals. We can  help you get in touch with friends and clasmates, access career  services and counseling, and participate in local ASU programs, no  matter where you live. Our robust online community and extensive alumni  chapter network give each ASU graduate the opportunity to maintain a  real connection with ASU.</p>
	  <p>Active involvement in the association is your next step in  demonstrating a commitment to higher education and your alma mater,  while preserving and promoting the traditions and standards of  excellence that characterize ASU. As the leading support organization  for ASU, the Alumni Association relies on individuals like you to  provide volunteer leadership for its many programs.</p>
	  <p>The <a href="../index.html">Office of University Ceremonies</a> at Arizona State University  serves to present the formal dignity of academic traditions to faculty,  staff, students and the community in which the university operates.</p>
