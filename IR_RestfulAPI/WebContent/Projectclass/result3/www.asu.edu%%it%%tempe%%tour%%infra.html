      <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
      <h3>Architectural Overview</h3>
      <p>
      The architectural objective of the Computing Commons is to meet
      operational and functional change over the life of the building.
      We wanted as much flexibility as we could afford. The building
      has accessible floors throughout -- 6&quot; or 18&quot; raised
      floor on floors 1 and 2 where changes occur more frequently;
      cellular decking on floors 3 and 4. All furnishings are systems-based
      and movable. While some things are easier to change than others,
      nothing is fixed in place.  Lighting throughout the building
      is non-glare and flexible as well. Power and air-conditioning
      systems will easily accommodate increased occupancy and/or workstations
      over the life of the building.  
      </p>
      <h3>Data Communications</h3>
      <p>   
      There are over 1000 computer/print/workstation connections (twisted
      pair 10/100 mbps) in the building. In order to accomplish this
      high level of connectivity and to provide for future moves and
      changes, a number of design elements were included in the building
      infrastructure. For example, the first two floors (the building
      public spaces) are constructed on raised floor to provide almost
      limitless reconfiguration over the life of the building. The
      third and fourth floor office spaces are constructed with a cellular
      deck flooring that allows power and communication facilities
      to be installed on a grid that is about 5 feet by 5 feet on center;
      not quite the same as raised floor but extremely flexible for
      the slightly less dynamic office environment  
      </p>
      <p>
      Data, voice, and video capabilities
      can be provided anywhere; growth can be accommodated due to oversize
      conduits with pull strings, as well as cable trays which run
      vertically and horizontally. Each floor of the building has four
      communication equipment rooms located so that any workstation
      location is within 150 cable feet. This means that there is complete
      accessibility for all current and most anticipated forms of communication
      without needing to rewire the workstation locations.  
      </p>
      <h3>Video</h3>
      <p>
      By taking advantage of the same equipment rooms, cable-way and
      conduit system infrastructure, the building is able to support
      video to virtually any room. Satellite uplinks and downlinks
      are possible in several rooms. There is plenty of room for growth
      and change with respect to multimedia cability for years to come.  
      </p>
      <p> Today the main lobby provides
      a television running the SCOLA 24-hour foreign language news
      broadcast. CNN, C-SPAN I and II as well as other cable channels
      could be programmed.  
      </p>
      <p>
      The Commons Video Conference
      room, CPCOM 123A, is equipped with PictureTel compressed digital
      video conferencing equipment. This equipment is connected into
      the Tri-University system so that video conferences with ASU
      West, U of A, and/or NAU are easily scheduled. Video programs
      received via the several satellite antennae (both C-band and
      Ku-band) operated by Telecommunication Services can also be brought
      into this facility.  
      </p>
      <p>
      The Commons Auditorium is connected
      to the building and campus infrastructure so that any of the
      video programs mentioned above can be viewed in this 62 seat
      facility. The dominant projection device used in the classrooms
      and the auditorium are Promixa projectors.  
      </p>
      <h3>ADA</h3>
      <p>
      Throughout design and construction, Information Technology worked
      closely with ASU's Disability Resources for Students office to
      ensure that all accessibility issues were addressed with respect
      to building architecture and furnishings. Every classroom and
      the first floor computing site has electric, height-adjustable
      tables. All students, not just those who use a wheelchair, enter
      the first floor computing site via ramps. Likewise, adaptive
      technology hardware and software are provided. 
      </p>
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
      Building security is a big challenge, as it's difficult to keep
      an open, friendly environment and not compromise the security
      of equipment. In the Computing Commons, several approaches are
      taken: a proximity card access system, keys, Closed Circuit TV,
      tattle tale system for documentation, tie-downs, and visual security
      by IT staff. 
      </p>
      <h3>The Future</h3>
      <p>
      The Computing Commons represents technology for today and an infrastructure for the
      next 20 years.
