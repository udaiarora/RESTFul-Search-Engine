      <h2>ASU Mariachi groups aim to spread joy through music </h2>
      <p>Music has often been known to bring out emotional responses. But for many, Mariachi music stands apart. </p>
      <p>"Other types of music can cause emotional reactions, but mariachi music brings it all out," says Eddy Valencia, a member of Mariachi ASU. </p>
      <p>Since 1984 the Mariachi ASU Program has been helping audiences enjoy and experience mariachi music. The program consists of two ensembles - Mariachi ASU and Mariachi Diablos de Sol. </p>
      <p>Mariachi ASU, whose members are full-time students, has six violins, three flutes, two trumpets, guitarron, vihuela and guitarra. Mariachi Diablos del Sol is a community group with members from high school through retirement. </p>
      <p>Both groups, under the direction of Richard Haefer, associate professor of music and Katherine Lopez, faculty associate, have contributed to the program's success and have helped educate audiences about the mariachi music genre. </p>
      <p>"Mariachi is uniquely Mexican and 'of the people,'" Haefer says. "What started out as a regional music is today not only 'Mexican' but also recognized as Mexican throughout the world." </p>
      <p>Just as audiences enjoy listening to mariachi music, performers also share the same appreciation. </p>
      <p>Valencia, senior family studies major, is a violinist for Mariachi ASU. She first began playing violin in her elementary school orchestra class and says she was hesitant to perform mariachi, because she never saw herself performing this type of music. </p>
      <p>"I started with a group in middle school," says Valencia of Nogales, Ariz. "But after I performed it, I really enjoyed it. I like to perform, because I like to see the people's emotions that come out when they hear us." </p>
      <p>Haefer says much of the music performed by mariachis is also played by other regional groups such as Norte&ntilde;o or Banda and similar groups in the south and east of Mexico. He says mariachi music evolved into a symbol of Mexico, because it was "the" music that received the most exposure via radio and movies in the 1920s, 30s and 40s and worldwide since the 80s. </p>
      <p>Tatiana Pe&ntilde;a, junior bilingual education major, is one of the guitarists for Mariachi ASU. She says the unique thing about mariachi music is the manner in which it is performed. </p>
      <p>"There's a lot of technique," says Pe&ntilde;a, whose father, Manuel, first started Mariachi ASU. "It's a bit like classical music, but it's more edgy. The manner in which you express emotion through the instruments is unique and it goes beyond the boundaries of performing any type of music." </p>
      <p>Mariachi ASU has performed at the Las Cruces International Mariachi Conference in 2001 and 2003 and at the Tucson International Mariachi Conference since 1999. Mariachi Diablos del Sol has performed at the Tucson Conference since 1985. </p>
      <p>Despite the groups' performing experience, Haefer says there is one conference at which they have yet to perform. </p>
      <p>"We've been wanting to perform at the San Antonio International Mariachi Conference, held in November. We've never been able to afford it," he says. "If someone wants to sponsor us, great, we're ready to blow them away." </p>
      <p>In addition to their upcoming conferences, Mariachi ASU will present a public performance at 7:30 p.m., April 14, in the Smith Music Theater, room 126 located in the School of Music.
