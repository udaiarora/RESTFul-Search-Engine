Participating in the upper-division curriculum involves the creation of an honors thesis. In conceiving and completing this project, each student works closely with a faculty mentor to identify and develop an original concept.</p><p class="FM-B-Heading"><a name="pgfId-2464102"></a><a name="60145"></a>BENEFITS</p><p class="Body-4-above"><a name="pgfId-2464103"></a>Honors students working on the West campus enjoy the benefits of a smaller program and all the resources of the entire Barrett Honors community, including study abroad, research, and internship opportunities.
