      <h2>'Urinetown' musical stops at Gammage </h2>
      <p>It's simply the story of two kids who fall in love in a city in the middle of a water shortage. </p>
      <p>It has also become Broadway's most unexpected phenomenon, and the winner of the 2002 Tony Awards for best direction, best book and best music and lyrics. The First National Tour of "Urinetown: The Musical" will play May 4 - 9 at ASU's Gammage Auditorium. Tickets are on sale now at (<a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com">www.ticketmaster.com</a>), by calling (480) 784-4444 or by calling ASU's Gammage Auditorium Box Office at 480-965-3434 or by visiting (<a href="http://www.asugammage.com">www.asugammage.com</a>). </p>
      <p>The unlikely idea for this musical-comedy tale of greed, corruption, love and revolution in a city where water is worth its weight in gold, came to Greg Kotis during an under-funded backpacking trip through Europe. </p>
      <p>Doing whatever he could to not spend money, he wandered the Luxembourg Gardens debating with himself whether to use one of the city's pay-per-use toilets. This was the germ of the idea, which he later pitched to his friend and fellow Chicago fringe-theater alum, Mark Hollmann. Their collaboration produced "Urinetown: The Musical," a work which was resoundingly rejected by theaters, agents and development organizations, until finally, the New York International Fringe Festival added it to their 1999 roster. </p>
      <p>"Urinetown" was the hit of the festival and drew the attention of the Araca Group. With their backing and additional creative support, a commercial reading was mounted in 2000, whereby Dodger Stage Holding, Lauren Mitchell and TheaterDreams joined the group. May 6, 2001 saw the opening at the American Theater of Actors where it became an instant hit, and in September the show moved to the Henry Miller Theatre, becoming a Broadway phenomenon, and earning multiple Tony Awards. </p>
      <p>Kotis is a veteran of the Neo-Futurists, creators of "Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind," the long-running, ongoing attempt to perform 30 plays in 60 minutes. His play about fish, toast and a love stronger and grimmer than death, "Jobey and Katherine," enjoyed runs in New York and Chicago in 1997. As a member of Cardiff-Giant, he appeared in countless anarchic improvisations and co-authored six plays including "LBJFKKK," "Love Me" and "Aftertaste! (The Musical)." </p>
      <p>Hollmann is a former ensemble member of the Cardiff-Giant Theatre Company in Chicago. He played trombone for the Chicago art-rock band Maestro Subgum and the Whole, and played piano for the Second City national touring company and Chicago City Limits. </p>
      <p>Hollmann attended the Making Tuners Workshop at New Tuners Theatre in Chicago and the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop in New York. </p>
      <p>Starring in the Urinetown tour are: Tom Hewitt as the avuncular narrator, Officer Lockstock; Ron Holgate as Caldwell B. Cladwell, greedy corporate villain; Beth McVey as Penelope Pennywise; Christiane Noll as Cladwell's naive daughter Hope Cladwell; Charlie Pollock as Bobby Strong, the boyfriend-becomes-revolutionary; and Meghan Strange as Little Sally, the wise-beyond-her-years fellow narrator. </p>
      <p>Rounding out the cast are Jim Corti (Old Man Strong/Hot Blades Harry), Dennis Kelly (Senator Fipp), Jamie LaVerdiere (Mr. McQueen), and Richard Ruiz (Officer Barrel) along with Katie Adams, Anne Allgood, Frank Holmes, Todd A. Horman, Robyn Kramer, Michael Minarik, Patricia Ben Peterson, Leslie Kritzer, Richard White and Christopher Youngsman. </p>
      <p>The national tour is directed by John Rando (2002 Tony Award winner for best direction) with choreography by John Carrafa. Designers will be Scott Pask (set) Gregory Gale (costumes) Brian MacDevitt (lighting) Jeff Curtis and Lew Mead (sound design) Darlene Dannenfelser (wig/hair design) and Bruce Coughlin (orchestrations). All are from the Broadway production. </p>
      <p>The national tour of "Urinetown: The Musical" is produced by The Araca Group and Dodger Stage Holding with TheatreDreams, Lauren Mitchell and the American Conservatory Theatre. </p>
      <p>"Urinetown: The Musical" is presented by arrangement with ASU Public Events and Clear Channel Entertainment, Inc., and is an offering of the 2003 - 04 M&amp;I Bank Broadway in Arizona series. </p>
      <p>Medina, with Public Events, can be reached at (480) 965-1184 or (kariann.medina@asu.edu). </p>
