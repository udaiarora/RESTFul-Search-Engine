      <h2>Arizona Real Estate Center: Greater Phoenix resale market shows signs
        of slowing</h2>
      <p>In a possible response to continuing international and economic concerns,
        the greater Phoenix resale housing market showed some signs of slowing
        in May. Even if the slowing continues, however, other signs in the market
        point to underlying strength, according to data released by the Arizona
        Real Estate Center today. </p>
      <p>Since hitting 6,725 recorded sales in March, the resale market slowed
        to 5,890 recorded sales in May 2003. Recorded sales activity in May 2003
        represented .7 percent of the single family inventory, however, while
        the typical monthly share is .6 percent. Further, May 2003 was well above
        the 4,510 sales recorded a year ago. That brings the 2003 year-to-date
        to 26,990 recorded sales, compared to 23,955 sales for the same period
        in 2002. </p>
      <p>The median home price in May continued at a record pace with $154,000,
        in contrast to $152,400 for April 2003 and $145,000 for a year ago. Since
        the Greater Phoenix area is so large, the median price can range significantly
        from $362,500 in North Scottsdale to $89,750 in the central western areas
        of the city of Phoenix.<br>
          <br>
          "This recording activity represents the end point of a decision-making
          process that probably began in late 2002, when there was mounting concerns
          about the war in Iraq," said Dr. Jay Q. Butler, director of the center.
          "These concerns combined with continuing economic weakness probably
          contributed to the slowdown in the market activity. Since the activity
          is still relatively strong, it appears that people have not lost their
          belief in the housing market." </p>
      <p>Following a pattern comparable to the single-family market, the resale
        townhouse/condominium housing sector slowed from 1,460 recordings in
        March 2003 to 1,240 for May 2003, but is well ahead of the 1,010 units
        recorded sold a year ago. For 2003 year-to-date, the activity stands
        at 5,880 units, in contrast to 5,480 homes for 2002 year-to-date. </p>
      <p>As a source of affordable housing and investment opportunities, the
        median price in the townhouse/condominium sector has strongly increased
        from last year's $95,600 to the current $104,990. This market can also
        have significant range in median prices from $163,650 in North Scottsdale
        to $86,650 in North Mesa. </p>
      <p>The median square footage for a single-family home recorded sold in
        May 2003 was 1,665 square feet, which is larger than the 1,650 square
        feet reported a year ago. In the townhouse/condominium sector, the median
        square footage was 1,175 square feet, which is larger than the 1,170
        square feet reported a year ago. </p>
      <p>&middot; In contrast to May 2002, recorded sales in the City of Phoenix
        improved from 1,320 to 1,635 sales, while the median sales price increased
        to $126,000 from $119,000. Since Phoenix is a geographically large city,
        the median prices can range significantly such as $102,450 in the Maryvale
        area to $182,500 in the Union Hills area. The townhouse/condominium sector
        increased slightly form 270 to 285 sales, while the median price increased
        from $84,500 to $90,000.</p>
      <p>&middot; The Scottsdale resale home market increased from last year's
        510 recorded sales to 600 recorded sales. The median sales price continued
        its upward movement by increasing from $292,750 to $330,000. The median
        resale home price is $362,500 in North Scottsdale and $171,000 in South
        Scottsdale. The townhouse/condominium sector in Scottsdale improved from
        200 to 295 sales, while the median sales price increased from $150,000
        to $152,000.</p>
      <p>&middot; The Mesa resale housing market grew strongly from 555 to 700
        sales, while the median price increased from $133,500 to $140,250. The
        townhouse/condominium sector improved slightly from 155 to 170 sales
        and the median home price increased from $88,975 to $92,000.</p>
      <p>&middot; Glendale moved from 390 to 495 recorded sales and the median
        sales price increased from $137,000 to $142,500. The townhouse/condominium
        sector remained at 45 sales, while the median sales price increased from
        $69,990 to $79,900.</p>
      <p>&middot; In comparison to a year ago, the Sun City resale market increased
        from 120 to 155 sales, with the median sales price increasing from $98,000
        to $117,000. Resale activity in Sun City West remained at 90 recorded
        sales, but the median sales price increased from $134,900 to $138,000.
        The townhouse/condominium market in Sun City improved from 95 to 100
        sales and the median sales price increased from $74,500 to $77,500. In
        Sun City West, sales increased from 3 to 35 sales and the median sales
        price increased from $90,750 to $107,535.</p>
      <p>&middot; The resale market in Gilbert grew from 230 to 370 sales, while
        the median sales price increased from $164,650 to $175,000. The townhouse/condominium
        market was also stable at 15 sales, but the median sales price increased
        from $104,000 to $107,500.</p>
      <p>&middot; For the City of Chandler, the resale market improved from 325
        to 500 recorded sales, while the median sales price increased from $156,000
        to $159,900. The townhouse/condominium market also improved from 50 to
        75 sales and the median sales price increased from $99,000 to $110,000.</p>

        the median sales price increasing to $164,900 from $153,000. The townhouse/condominium
        sector improved from 75 to 105 sales, while the median sales price increased

      <p>&middot; The highest median sales price was in Paradise Valley at $750,000
      with a median square foot house of 3,425 square feet.</p>
