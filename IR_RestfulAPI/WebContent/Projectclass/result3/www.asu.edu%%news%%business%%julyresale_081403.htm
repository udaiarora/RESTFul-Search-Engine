      <h2>July resale market reflects economic uncertainty of early 2003</h2>
      <p>The Greater Phoenix resale housing market slowed in July - not unexpectedly,
        as the recorded activity reflected home-buying decisions made amid the
        economic and political troubles of early 2003. There were 6,320 sales
        recorded in July, down from the 7,890 sales of the previous month, but
        ahead of last year's 6,210 sales.</p>
      <p>"Typically, the combined recorded activity in the months of June and
        July account for slightly over 20 percent of the year's recorded sales,"
        said Jay Q. Butler, director of the Arizona Real Estate Center. "Even
        with the slowdown, 2003 year-to-date continues at a record pace, with
        41,200 sales in comparison to 36,190 for 2002 and 37,725 for 2001." </p>
      <p>The median home price continued strong with $160,000, up from $157,500
        in June and $147,000 a year ago. Since the Greater Phoenix area is so
        large, the median price can range significantly from $369,500 in North
        Scottsdale to $95,000 in the central western areas of the city of Phoenix.
        For July 2003, 51 percent of all recorded sales were for homes priced
        from $100,000 to $175,000 and 15 percent for homes priced over $300,000. </p>
      <p>"This recording activity represents the end point of a decision-making
        process that probably began in late 2002 or early 2003," Butler said.
        "During this timeframe, there were concerns about the continuing weak
        economy and concerns about the war in Iraq, so the slowdown in market
        activity should be expected. However, the continued strong levels of
        activity show that people have maintained a strong confidence in their
        live-in investment. Since rates continued to fall in the early months
        of 2003, many people were afforded the opportunity to economically satisfy
        their housing and/or investment dreams."</p>
      <p>The 1,125 resale townhouse/condominium housing transactions represent
        a slowing of market activity from the 1,505 units recorded sold the previous
        month, and the 1,225 in July 2002. For 2003 YTD, the activity stands
        at 8,505 units, an increase over 7,885 homes for 2002 YTD. "The strong
        increase in the median price from last year's $95,000 to the current
        $105,000 could be a reason for the slowdown in these sales," Butler noted. </p>
      <p>The median area for a single-family home recorded sold in July was 1,705
        square feet, an increase over the 1,660 square feet reported a year ago.
        In the townhouse/condominium sector, the median square footage was 1,175,
        which is larger than the 1,155 square feet reported a year ago.</p>
      <p>&middot; In comparison with July 2002 figures, recorded sales in the
        city of Phoenix fell from 1,785 to 1,645 sales, while the median sales
        price increased from $119,900 to $130,000. Since Phoenix is a geographically
        large city, the median prices can range significantly - from $87,500
        in the Sky Harbor area to $200,000 in the Union Hills area. The townhouse/condominium
        sector also declined, from 345 to 265 sales, while the median price rose
        from $84,000 to $92,550.</p>
