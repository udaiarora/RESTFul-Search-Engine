The decision to conduct an expedited tenure and/or promotion review is an exception to the regular tenure and promotion review process described in <a href="acd506-03.html">ACD 506&#150;03</a>, &#147;Probationary Appointments&#148; and <a href="acd506-06.html">ACD 506&#150;06</a>, &#147;Evaluation for Tenure and Promotion,&#148; and will be approved only in extraordinary circumstances, which could include, but are not limited to:<p><ol><li>the decision of the university to respond to an offer of other employment to a current faculty member whom ASU desires to retain</li><p><li>the receipt of an extraordinary award or honor by a faculty member that is likely to generate offers of employment or brings distinction to the individual and the institution<p>and</li><p><li>other circumstances that the dean and the provost determine warrants expedited tenure.</li></ol><p>ASU has no obligation to consider or approve an expedited review at the request of the faculty member or for any other circumstances, including the circumstances listed above.<p>If a college dean and the unit head desire to initiate an expedited review for a faculty member, the following procedures will be followed.<p><b>Initiation of Expedited Review</b><p>The dean will submit a request through the campus provost (if relevant) to the executive vice president and provost of the university for an expedited review. The dean will attach to the request the most current curriculum vitae of the faculty member and documentation establishing extraordinary circumstances to support an expedited review.  The executive vice president and provost of the university or designee will make every effort to respond, either approving or declining the request within 48 hours after receipt. The dean or designee will notify the unit head and the faculty member immediately of the provost&#146;s decision regarding the request. <p>If the provost approves the request for an expedited review, the unit head will request from the faculty member a current curriculum vitae, a personal statement that is no longer than four pages discussing his or her qualifications for tenure and/or promotion, and any supplemental material (e.g., copies of publications, evidence of teaching effectiveness).<p><b>External Review Letters</b><p>The unit head and the dean will provide a list of five names and the faculty member will provide a list of five names, for a total of ten names of external reviewers who are qualified to evaluate the faculty member&#146;s research or creative activities. The unit head and the dean will rank-order reviewers from this list, selecting three reviewers from each list. The unit head will contact these six reviewers to determine whether they can provide a written review to the unit head within ten calendar days following the request. <p>If an external reviewer cannot provide a review within ten days, the unit head will contact the seventh ranked external reviewer from the combined list and this process will continue in an effort to obtain six external review letters within the timeline. <p>The unit head will send the curriculum vitae, personal statement, and examples of the faculty member&#146;s research or creative activity, along with a copy of the unit/college criteria for personnel decisions after the reviewer agrees to provide an external review letter. <p>The external reviewer will be asked to evaluate such factors as the scholarly standards reflected in the work; its impact on intended audiences; the importance, innovativeness, and relevance of the work; or the quality of the journals, publishers, conferences, or other communicative outlets in which the work is presented; citations of the work; and other indicators appropriate to the discipline.  <p><b>Internal Review</b><p>Simultaneously with selecting external reviewers, the unit head will request the available representatives of the unit promotion and tenure review committee to provide an expedited review of the candidate&#146;s teaching, research or creative activities, and service, and the dean will request the available representatives of the college promotion and tenure review or advisory committee to provide an expedited review of the candidate&#146;s qualifications.  <p>The dean and the unit head will provide all available information on the candidate&#146;s qualifications to the respective peer review committees. Teaching materials must include student evaluations and course syllabi and may include the candidate&#146;s statement of teaching philosophy or other evidence of teaching effectiveness.  The unit head and the dean will also prepare their own independent reviews simultaneously or as soon as possible after receipt of the peer reviews from the unit and the college committees.<p>The unit head will provide copies of the external review letters to the dean as they are received.  The unit head and the dean will provide a secure location to review the external letters so that committee members may access the letters as the committees conduct their reviews.<p>The tenure portfolio with the unit level reviews and external review levels (&#147;materials&#148;) will be submitted to the dean as expeditiously as possible. The college level reviews will be added to the materials and forwarded to the university level. <p>The available representatives of the university promotion and tenure committee will review the case and provide a recommendation to the executive vice president and provost of the university. If the candidate is employed at the Downtown Phoenix, Polytechnic, or West campus, the campus provost will receive a copy of the university committee&#146;s recommendation and will provide his/her recommendation to the executive vice president and provost of the university. The executive vice president and provost of the university will review the entire package and forward a recommendation with the materials to the president for decision. <p><b>Decision</b><p>The president of the university will make the decision to award or deny expedited tenure and appropriate faculty rank and will notify the executive vice president and provost of the university and campus provost, if applicable, and dean orally as soon as possible after decision is made. The dean will notify the unit head and the faculty candidate as soon as possible thereafter.  The president will provide a written notice of the decision within ten days to the same university administrators and the unit head and faculty member. <p><b>Timing of the Review</b><p>Every effort will be made to conclude an expedited review within 14 calendar days following the initiation of the review or as soon as possible thereafter.  <p><b>Effect of Denial</b><p>If the president denies the expedited award of tenure, the faculty member will receive a regular probationary contract for the following year and will be reviewed under <a href="acd506-03.html">ACD 506&#150;03</a>, &#147;Probationary Appointments&#148; during probation and under <a href="acd506-06.html">ACD 506&#150;06</a>, &#147;Evaluation for Tenure and Promotion,&#148; for tenure and promotion.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>University-Level Review of New Hires with Tenure</b></font><p><b>Candidates with Tenure at Peer or Peer Aspirational Institutions</b><p>For candidates employed at universities defined as unit/college peers or aspirational peers and who currently hold the rank at which they would be hired, the campus provost (if relevant), the executive vice president and provost of the university, and the president will review the curriculum vitae and reference letters or notes from reference calls. <p><b>Candidates with Tenure at Non-Peer or Peer Aspirational Institutions</b><p>For candidates employed with tenure at a university that is not a peer or aspirational peer of the unit/college, and who would be hired at the same rank that they now hold, the curriculum vitae and reference letters (or notes from reference calls) will be reviewed by a subcommittee of the university promotion and tenure committee, the campus provost (if relevant), the executive vice president and provost of the university, and the president. The department chair/dean should provide a letter detailing the department/college vote and rationale for supporting the hire with tenure and contextualizing the candidate&#146;s curriculum vitae for university level reviewers.<p><b>Candidates without Tenure or Requesting Promotion at the Time of Hire</b><p>For candidates who are not tenured at their current university or who are requesting promotion to a higher rank, an expedited promotion and/or tenure review will be conducted, including faculty and administrative review(s) at all levels. To accommodate the need for prompt decision-making:<p><ol><li>the college personnel committee review may be bypassed so long as there is faculty review at the unit and university levels<p>and</li><p><li> the university faculty review may be conducted by a subcommittee of the university promotion and tenure committee. The review will include external review letters  solicited from the candidate&#146;s and the unit head/dean&#146;s lists.</li></ol><p>In all cases, the final decision on hire, rank, and tenure rests with the university president.<p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>For more information on evaluation for tenure and promotion, see: <p><ol><li><a href="acd506-03.html">ACD 506&#150;03</a>, &#147;Probationary Appointments&#148;</li><p><li>  <a href="acd506-05.html">ACD 506&#150;05</a>, &#147;Promotion&#148;<p>and</li> <p><li><a href="acd506-06.html">ACD 506&#150;06</a>, &#147;Evaluation for Promotion and Tenure.&#148;</li></ol><p>&#160;<p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
