      <h2>Regents approve ASU Foundation project</h2>
      <p>        The ASU Foundation received a boost Aug. 15 by the Arizona Board of Regents
          (ABOR), in their efforts to consolidate its operations and advance
        the interests of ASU.</p>
      <p>The ASU Foundation, the university's nonprofit,
            tax-exempt organization established in 1955, will undertake a major
            fundraising campaign for
          the benefit of ASU and other activities such as the formation of Arizona
          Science and Technology Enterprises, LLC.</p>
      <p>The foundation has assembled
          sizable assets and endowments that will need to be increased significantly
          to support the expanding programs
            of ASU. The $50 million gifts for the W.P. Carey School of Business
            and the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, are gifts representative
            of
            this growth potential.</p>
      <p>To carry out the foundation's mission to bring
          donors to campus and to involve donors and potential donors in campus
          activities, the foundation
          proposed the construction of an office building with ancillary retail
          and parking structure on ASU property. </p>
      <p>"The foundation has been doing
          a tremendous job," said ASU President Michael Crow at the Aug. 15 ABOR
          meeting in Flagstaff. "This will become
          the center of the university as it continues to grow."</p>
      <p>The development
          project will be part of significant redevelopment plan by the City
        of Tempe for the College Avenue corridor from University
          Drive to Stadium Drive. Other developments for the corridor now in
        the planning stages include mixed-used commercial and residential projects
          that will provide appropriate commercial services as well as "for sale"
          and "for rent" housing to students, graduate students and local professionals. </p>
      <p>The project includes a six-story office building of approximately 156,447
          square feet, a multi-story parking structure (approximately 1,200 spaces)
          and a retail component (approximately 15,400 square feet). The total
          estimated cost of the office/retail component is $28,230,000 and the
          estimated cost of the parking structure is $10,630,000. The ASU Foundation
          will occupy approximately 45,800 square feet in the office building.
          ASU will occupy approximately 90,000 square feet.</p>
      <p>"We are really excited
          about this project," said Grady Gammage Jr., chairman of the real estate
          committee for the project. "This is a new entrepreneurial
          endeavor for us. It's a complex transaction, but it is one that is
        positive to both us and the university."</p>
      <p>Regent Gary Stuart said President Crow's
          vision is clear and the foundation has a bright future.</p>
      <p>"Michael Crow said entrepreneurial does not necessarily
          mean operating like a business," Stuart said at the ABOR meeting. "He
          has shown that
          a not for profit can indeed be entrepreneurial by engaging with the
        community. I'm very proud of you."</p>
      <p>"I would like to personally thank the foundation
          for their work," said Regent Donald Ulrich, who echoed Stuart. "I am
          pleased that you got it
          done and it's a great project.</p>
      <p>The ASU Foundation project, which begins
          in January 2004 and should be completed by January 2005, follows ASU's
        five-year strategic plan, which was also
          reviewed and approved at the ABOR meeting. President Crow said ASU
        is using three factors for guidance in the university's strategic plan
        -
          to enhance the quality of ASU today; to build an entrepreneurial culture;
          and design and launch a program and construction effort.</p>
      <p>"All of our
          critical numbers are of record numbers," President Crow said to the
        ABOR. "Diversification of students, freshmen retention
            rates and
            the number of minority faculty members continue to guide us in our
            efforts to enhance the quality and access of ASU programs."</p>
      <p>In addition, President
        Crow said recent university hires Mark Jacobs, dean of the Barrett Honors
        College; Duke Rider, dean of the College of
        Architecture &amp; Environmental Sciences; Juan Gonzales, dean of Student
        Affairs; and George Poste, director of AzBio Design, all contribute to
        the university's effort of enhancing quality and access.</p>
      <p>The Arizona Board
          of Regents also approved the following items:</p>
      <p>. The
          establishment of the Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict
        and the Stardust Center for Affordable Homes and the Family at ASU. </p>
      <p>Provost
          Milton Glick, who presented the item to the ABOR said, "These centers
          bring people from different disciplines together to share ideas
          and come up with solutions." <br>
        The Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict addresses the problem
          of global conflict and religious conflict. I think this is one of the
          most important contributions the university could make to the state
          and the nation.</p>
      <p>The Stardust Center, which was funded through a $2.5 million
          grant from the Stardust Foundation, is focusing on community outreach
          as it relates
          to the Arizona community and the problems with affordable housing.</p>
      <p>. The
          renovation of Building 785 (Agribusiness Center) at ASU East. Approval
          of this project included a budget increase of $827,092 for the renovation
          of the Agribusiness Center's design, materials and industry-specific
          requirements to make the center a highly-technical, first class instructional
          facility.</p>
      <p>. the creation of a Tri-university ARU electronic library. The
          board approved a one-time grant of $1,301,456 to the Tri-University
        ARU Electronic
          Library Project to add significant resources to the electronic collections
          of the three Arizona university libraries. The grant is divided into
          two phases: Phase I involves the purchase of the Elsevier backfiles,
          a new digital product that will give the distance learner access to
        the same major serials that on-campus student can now use. Phase II involves
          the purchase of a collection of current books and scholarly electronic
          monographs (nearly 3,000 books) in focus areas that include business,
          economics, management, computers, engineering, K-12 teacher preparation
          and nursing.</p>
