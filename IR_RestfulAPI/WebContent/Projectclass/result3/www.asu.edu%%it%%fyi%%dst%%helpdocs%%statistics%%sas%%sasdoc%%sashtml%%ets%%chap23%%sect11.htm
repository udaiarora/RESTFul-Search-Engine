<P><A NAME="idxtf20042">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf20041">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf20043">&#13;</A>In the first forecasting example, you used the Automatic Model Fitting
window to fit and select the forecasting model for each series automatically.
In addition to this automatic forecasting process,
you can also work with time series one at a time
to fit forecasting models and apply your own
judgement to choose the best forecasting model for each series.
<P>Using the Automatic Model Fitting feature, the system acts like a &#34;black box.&#34;
This section goes inside the black box to look at the
kinds of forecasting methods that the system provides and introduces
some of the tools the system offers to help you find the best
forecasting model.
<P><H3><I>Introduction</I></H3>
From the Time Series Forecasting window, select the Browse button to the
right of the Data Set field to bring up the Data Set Selection window. 
Select the USECON data set from the SASHELP library.
This data set contains monthly data on the U.S. economy.
<P>Select OK to close the selection window.  
Now select the <TT>Develop Models</TT> button.
This brings up the <TT>Series Selection</TT> window,
as shown in <A HREF="sect11.htm#tfst28">Display 23.29</A>. You can enlarge
this window for easier viewing of lists of data sets and series.

<P>The <TT>Data Set</TT>, <TT>Interval</TT>, and <TT>Series</TT> fields
in the upper part of the Develop Models window indicate the
series with which you are currently working.  You can change
the settings of these fields by selecting the <TT>Browse</TT> button.
<P>The <TT>Data Range</TT>, <TT>Fit Range</TT>, and <TT>Evaluation Range</TT>
fields show the time period over which data are available for
the current series, and what parts of that time period will
be used to fit forecasting models to the series and to evaluate
how well the models fit the data.
You can change the settings of these fields by selecting the
<TT>Set Ranges</TT> button.
<P>The bottom part of the Develop Models window consists of a table
of forecasting models fit to the series.
Initially, the list is empty, as indicated by the message &#34;No models.&#34;
You can fit any number of forecasting models to each series
and designate which one you want to use to produce forecasts.
<P>Graphical tools are available for exploring time series and fitted models.
The two icons below the <TT>Browse</TT> button access the <TT>Time Series
Viewer</TT> and the <TT>Model Viewer</TT>.

You can switch back and forth between the Time Series Viewer window
and other windows.
For now, return to the Develop Models window.

<P>The Forecasting System provides several ways to specify forecasting models.
The seven choices given by the menu shown in
<A HREF="sect11.htm#tfst31">Display 23.32</A> are as follows:
<P><DL>
<DT>Fit Models Automatically
<DD>
performs for the current series
the same automatic model selection process
that the Automatic Model Fitting window applies to a set of series.
<BR><BR><DT>Fit Models from List
<DD>
presents a list of commonly used forecasting models
for convenient point-and-click selection.
<BR><BR><DT>Fit Smoothing Model
<DD>
displays the <TT>Smoothing Model Specification</TT> window,
which allows you to specify several kinds of exponential smoothing
and Winters method forecasting models.
<BR><BR><DT>Fit ARIMA Model
<DD>
displays the <TT>ARIMA Model Specification</TT> window,
which allows you to specify many kinds of autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA) models, including seasonal ARIMA models and
ARIMA models with regressors, transfer functions, and other predictors.
<BR><BR><DT>Fit Custom Model
<DD>
displays the <TT>Custom Model Specification</TT> window,
which allows you to construct a forecasting model by specifying
separate options for transforming the data, modeling the trend,
modeling seasonality, modeling autocorrelation of the errors,
and modeling the effect of regressors and other independent predictors.
<BR><BR><DT>Combine Forecasts
<DD>
displays the <TT>Forecast Combination Model Specification</TT> window,
which allows you to specify models that produce forecasts by combining,
or averaging, the forecasts from other models.
(This option is not available unless you have fit at least two models.)
<BR><BR><DT>Use External Forecasts
<DD>
displays the <TT>External Forecast Model Specification</TT> window, which allows
you to use judgmental or externally produced forecasts that have been
saved in a separate series in the data set.
</DL>
<P>All the forecasting models used by the system are ultimately specified
through one of the three windows: <TT>Smoothing Method Specification,</TT>
<TT>ARIMA Model Specification,</TT> or <TT>Custom Model Specification.</TT>
You can specify the same models with either
the ARIMA Model Specification window
or the Custom Model Specification window,
but the Custom Model Specification window may provide a
more natural way to specify models for those who are less familiar
with the Box-Jenkins style of time series model specification.
<P>The Automatic Model feature, the <TT>Models to Fit</TT> window,
and the <TT>Forecast Combination Model Specification</TT> window
all deal with lists of forecasting models previously defined through the
Smoothing Model, ARIMA Model, or Custom Model specification windows.
These windows are discussed in detail in later sections.
<P>To get started using the Develop Models window,
select the <TT>Fit Models from List</TT> item from the menu
shown in <A HREF="sect11.htm#tfst31">Display 23.32</A>.
This brings up the <TT>Models to Fit</TT> window,
as shown in <A HREF="sect11.htm#tfst32">Display 23.33</A>.

<P>You can select several models to fit at once by holding down the
CTRL key as you make the selections.
Select <TT>Linear Trend</TT> and <TT>Double (Brown) Exponential Smoothing</TT>,
as shown in <A HREF="sect11.htm#tfst33">Display 23.34</A>, and then select the <TT>OK</TT> button.

<P>The system fits the two models you selected.
After the models are fit, the labels of the two models and their
goodness-of-fit statistic are added to the model table,

<A NAME="idxtf20057">&#13;</A><A NAME="idxtf20058">&#13;</A>In the model list, the <I>Model Title</I> column shows the
descriptive labels for the two fitted models, in this case
Linear Trend and Double Exponential Smoothing.
<P>The column labeled <I>Root Mean Square Error</I>
(or labeled <I>Mean Absolute Percent Error</I>
if you continued from the example in the previous section)
shows the
goodness-of-fit criterion used to decide which model fits better.
By default, the criterion used is the root mean square error,
but you can choose a different measure of fit.
The linear trend model has a root mean square error of 1203,
while the double exponential smoothing model fits better,
with a RMSE of only 869.
<P>The left column labeled <I>Forecast Model</I> consists of check boxes
that indicate which one of the models in the list has been selected
as the model to use to produce the forecasts for the series.
When new models are fit and added to the model list,
the system sets the Forecast Model flags to designate the
one model with the best fit--as measured by the selected
goodness-of-fit statistic--as the forecast model.
(In the case of ties, the first model with the best fit is selected.)
<P>Because the Double Exponential Smoothing model has the smaller RMSE
of the two models in the list, its Forecast Model check box is set.
If you would rather produce forecasts using the Linear Trend model,
choose it by selecting the corresponding check box in the Forecast Model
column.
<P>To use a different goodness-of-fit criterion, select the button with
the current criterion name on it (Root Mean Square Error or
Mean Absolute Percent Error).  
This brings up the <TT>Model Selection Criterion</TT> window,
as shown in <A HREF="sect11.htm#tfst35">Display 23.36</A>.

<P>The system provides many measures of fit that you can use as
the model selection criterion.
To avoid confusion, only the most popular of the available
fit statistics are shown in this window by default.
To display the complete list, you can select the <TT>Show all</TT> option.
You can control the subset of statistics listed in this window through
the <TT>Statistics of Fit</TT> item in the <TT>Options</TT> menu on
the Develop Models window.
<P>Initially, Root Mean Square Error is selected.
Select R-Square and then select the <TT>OK</TT> button.
This changes the fit statistic displayed in the model list,
as shown in <A HREF="sect11.htm#tfst36">Display 23.37</A>.
