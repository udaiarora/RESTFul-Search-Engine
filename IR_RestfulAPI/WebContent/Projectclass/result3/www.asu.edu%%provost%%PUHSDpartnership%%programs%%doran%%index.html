          <h1><img src="../../images/logos/DCSPLogo.gif" alt="Doran Community Scholars Program" width="200" height="123" hspace="15" vspace="15" align="right">Doran Community Scholars Program </h1>
          <h3>Program Overview</h3>

			The Doran Community Scholars Program (DCSP) is the result of the generous donation given to the ASU Foundation from Wayne and Maureen Doran. Wayne Doran is alumnus from the Phoenix Union High School District (PUHSD) and Arizona State University (ASU).  In 1997, the DCSP was formed to target students from the PUHSD and both to encourage them to pursue higher education and to continue to support them on that journey. Now in its ninth year, the program has been remarkably successful not only in assisting students with their academic and professional careers, but in enriching their personal development and instilling in them a sense of social consciousness.
			<p>
			The DCSP assures academic and personal support to its scholars while preparing them to become strong community leaders. Through a systematic leadership development program, students engage in a four-year course of study that provides scholars with experiences that will further develop professionalism and leadership through opportunities in community service, career and professional development, civic engagement and program development. </P>
			<p>
			The Doran Community Scholars Program stands to become a national model. The program provides to its scholars critical financial assistance so that economic limitations will not prevent capable students from pursuing their dreams. Academic and personal services are provided to promote academic success leading to a bachelor's degree, and the low staff to student ratio ensures an extensive monitoring component of the program. If a student begins to struggle personally, professionally or academically, the DCSP is uniquely poised to assist the student, whereas most programs would let them slip away.</P>
			<p>
			The program is structured to provide a comprehensive leadership development component that prepares a generation of leaders who will understand the roots of social change and the importance of giving back to their communities through curriculum and service learning. </P>
			<p>
			Built into the program are various checks and balances to ensure student success. Scholars must meet specific requirements in four areas in order to continue receiving scholarship benefits for up to four years. These include achieving a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.7, completion of a minimum of 24 course credit hours per year, 40 community service/field hours per year, and regular attendance and participation in program classes and events. Should a scholar struggle with any or all of these areas, individual goal setting meetings with the Program Coordinators are employed to ensure that all students reach their potential.</P>
			<p>
			At the heart of the DCSP it is believed that leaders are not born, but made. It is our firm belief that by helping our scholars to succeed academically and professionally as well as developing them as pro-active and educated leaders in their communities, our scholars have the tools to create change for themselves, their families and their communities.  </P>

          <h3>Program Goals</h3>
