          <h2>National civil rights leader Yzaguirre bolsters ASU</a></h2>
          <p> When he was 15, Raul Yzaguirre began his civil rights career by organizing the American G.I. Forum Juniors, an auxiliary of the American G.I. Forum, a Hispanic veterans organization. </p>
          <p> Ever since, Yzaguirre has made a conscious effort to give a voice to people who need it. </p>
          <p> Now, Yzaguirre is pledging to strengthen ASU&rsquo;s voice with his recent appointment as Presidential Professor of Practice in Community Development and Civil Rights at ASU. </p>
          <p> Yzaguirre, former president and chief executive officer of the National Council of La Raza, will help create a center, to be located at ASU&rsquo;s downtown Phoenix campus, which will focus on community development, education for practitioners, and academic scholarship in the form of dissertations, lectures and seminars at the university. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;I hope to bring the culmination of my experiences to ASU,&rdquo; says Yzaguirre. &ldquo;For more than 50 years I have been an advocate for people who need someone on their side. I don&rsquo;t believe that I have all the knowledge and the experience, so I expect to learn as much as I expect to help others learn.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Yzaguirre is one of the most widely recognized national leaders in the Hispanic community. His involvement in many of the most critical legislative and public policy issues of the last three decades has made him a key national player on behalf of Hispanic Americans. As president and chief executive officer of the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), the largest constituency-based national Hispanic organization and a leading Hispanic &ldquo;think tank&rdquo; in Washington , D.C. , he followed his mission to improve opportunities for Hispanic Americans. </p>
          <p> Since joining NCLR in 1974, Yzaguirre has spearheaded its emergence as the most influential and respected Hispanic organization in the country. </p>
          <p> Yzaguirre&rsquo;s appointment, which began Jan. 23, follows ASU&rsquo;s practices of social embeddedness and global engagement through the principles under the model of the New American University . On Jan. 20, members of ASU&rsquo;s Hispanic community welcomed Yzaguirre during a reception that featured comments by ASU President Michael Crow; Regent Ernest Calder&oacute;n; Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon; Tom Espinoza, president and CEO of the Raza Development Fund; Guadalupe Carbajal, the director of strategic relations of the Del E. Webb School of Construction and president of ASU&rsquo;s Chicano faculty and staff; and Jeffrey Chapman, interim dean of the College of Public Programs. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;ASU is one of the premier metropolitan public research universities in the nation,&rdquo; Crow says. &ldquo;Raul&rsquo;s innovative thinking and strong connections with state and national Hispanic assemblies will continue to promote efforts and create numerous opportunities for collaboration. We are very excited to have Raul join ASU.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> Yzaguirre will work with many of ASU&rsquo;s programs that focus on the diverse community, including the Department of Chicano/a Studies, the College of Law, the Department of Psychology, the Center for Nonprofit Leadership and Management, and the College of Public Programs</p>
          <p> Yzaguirre also plans to engage faculty members from the Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict and schools under development by focusing on family and social dynamics, and community resources and development. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;I would like to work with foundations and corporate resources who can help meet people&rsquo;s needs,&rdquo; Yzaguirre says. &ldquo;Community development is making neighborhoods and cities more livable, it&rsquo;s making homes more livable and it&rsquo;s making more opportunities for everyone.&rdquo; </p>
          <p> NCLR was founded 36 years ago in Phoenix , and Yzaguirre was instrumental in making NCLR the leading Hispanic think tank in the country. As ASU continues to engage with state, national and international groups, Yzaguirre&rsquo;s expertise will be instrumental in guiding the university into the next level of higher education. </p>
          <p> &ldquo;Raul has the expertise to help establish ASU as the nexus of dialogue for Latino community development professionals, policy actors and academic experts,&rdquo; says Nancy Jordan, associate vice president of community development, ASU Office of Public Affairs. &ldquo;The development of ASU&rsquo;s downtown Phoenix campus needs to embrace its existing relationships with the Hispanic community and provide innovative ways to create new working relationships, and Raul provides the leadership we need to achieve this.&rdquo; </p>
