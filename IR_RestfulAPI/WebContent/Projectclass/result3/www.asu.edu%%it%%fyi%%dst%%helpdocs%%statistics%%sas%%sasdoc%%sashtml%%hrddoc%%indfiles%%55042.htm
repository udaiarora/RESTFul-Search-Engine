Getting Started with the SQL Procedure, First Edition
</H1><P>
Filled with code-based examples, this book is ideal for SAS programmers    who want to take advantage of the power of the SQL procedure. A part of
base SAS, PROC SQL is a powerful reporting tool that can often be an       alternative to the DATA step and other SAS procedures. PROC SQL also
provides a method for accessing data in external databases for those       users who have a SAS/ACCESS license. This book shows examples of how
you can use PROC SQL to create, update, modify, and combine SAS data       sets, generate reports and more. The last chapter introduces the SQL
Query Window in SAS/ASSIST software, which provides a point-and-click      interface to PROC SQL. The SQL Query Window chapter contains an example
of accessing data in another vendor's database management system.
