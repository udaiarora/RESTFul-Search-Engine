Beginning with Version

is included here for Version 6 users.&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG border="0" src="../common/images/cautend.gif" alt="[cautionend]" align="bottom"></DD></DL>

<P>Various errors may occur when you initially
try to establish a connection over a network with the SPX access method. Many
of these problems are related to the network. The following messages are a
few of the more common errors you may encounter:  



<PRE>ERROR: Network partner xxxx not found.</PRE>
<P>The network name that you specified as the value for the REMOTE= option
is invalid. The partner application is not running, is on a different network,
or is using a different packet type. Ask your system administrator for valid
names at your site.  



<PRE>ERROR: Communication request rejected by partner: 
security verification failure.</PRE>
<P>Permission to access the remote host was denied.  Verify that you specified
a valid userid and password for the remote system.  



<PRE>ERROR: Supporting access method initialization failure.</PRE>
<P>There is a configuration problem. Contact your systems personnel.  



<PRE>ERROR: Target application partner could not be located.</PRE>
<P>The remote SAS session could not be started by the spawner program.
There is a configuration problem.
<P>Besides network errors, you should also be aware of operating system-dependent
considerations, which are described in the next two sections. If you cannot
resolve a problem based on the information that is provided in the error message
and this document, contact SAS Technical Support for assistance.

<P>Under Windows NT, you must ensure that the IPX/SPX protocol is using
the same packet type as the other machines that you want to communicate with.
You must choose 802.2, 802.3, or similar packet types.

<TR valign="top"><TD><B><FONT size="5">SAS/SHARE</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>SAS/SHARE users and administrators can use the Novell Sequenced Packet
Exchange (SPX) access method to communicate with a server that is running
on a Windows NT machine on the same network. Specify SPX as the value for
the COMAMID=, the COMAUX1=, or the COMAUX2= option.
<P>The SPX access method used by SAS/SHARE sometimes issues generalized
messages to identify problems.  Some of the most frequently encountered messages
are described in this section.  



<PRE>Supporting access method initialization failure</PRE>
<P>There is a configuration problem.  SPX is not installed, or it is not
installed properly. Contact your systems administrator.  



<PRE>Network name <I>server-id</I> already in use</PRE>
<P>The server that was specified by the SERVERID= option is already being
used by another application on your network.  



<PRE>Network partner <I>server-id</I> not found</PRE>
<P>The server that was specified in the SERVERID= option was not found.
 The server was not started, or it is on a different network, or it is using
a different packet type.
