<P>
Members of the Academic Assembly will be asked to contribute information to the performance evaluations of their immediate supervisors (i.e., chairs, directors, and deans).  Such information will be requested by the next higher administrator, i.e., a dean will request the information for chairs and directors, while the executive vice president and provost of the university will request the information for deans.  The person whose performance is being evaluated will have the option of preparing a brief statement to be included with the request for feedback from <A HREF="acd002.html#facultymember" TARGET="New">faculty</A> and <A HREF="acd002.html#academicprofessional" TARGET="New">academic professionals</A>.  This statement should explain the individual&#146;s vision for the unit and outline recent accomplishments and goals so as to provide a background for the evaluation.

<P>
The administrator doing the performance evaluation will supplement the information from faculty and academic professionals with other information of his or her choice.

<P>
At least once every two years, faculty and academic professional input will be requested for chairs and directors and at least once every four years for deans.  Where appropriate in alternate years, <A HREF="acd002.html#departmentchair" TARGET="New">department chairs</A> and deans might request input into a performance evaluation of individuals filling such mid-management positions as associate/assistant deans or chairs and program or center directors.

<P>
Upon request, the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University will provide an evaluation instrument designed and approved by a joint committee of administrators and Academic Assembly Personnel Committee members.  The instrument has a machine scored section as well as two pages for open-ended comments, one page to go directly to the administrator being evaluated and one page to go to the supervisor.  A different instrument may be used if the supervisor conducting the performance review prefers.

<P>
Feedback on the results of the evaluation will be provided in an oral report from the supervising administrator who conducted the evaluation.  It is also suggested that where appropriate the person who was evaluated meet with the faculty members to discuss ways of responding to suggestions and setting goals for the future of the unit.  The reviews should be conducted in a timely fashion so that feedback can be provided and plans made before the end of the academic year in which the evaluation occurs.
