      <h2>ABOR approves program fees, reviews universities admission policy </h2>
      <p>As another school year came to a close, the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) continued to focus on the future and policies for providing accessible, affordable and quality education for students attending Arizona 's three universities. </p>
      <p>The ABOR meeting held April 29 - 30 at ASU, began with a moment of silence for ASU graduate Pat Tillman, who was killed in Afghanistan while serving his country with the Army Rangers. </p>
      <p>Board members approved the proposed special class fees for the Academic Year (AY) 2004 - 05; special program fees for AY 2004 - 05; special program fee ranges for AY 2005 - 07; and common surcharge fees for AY 2004 - 05 for Arizona's three universities. </p>
      <p>Mark Denke, ABOR assistant executive director for Academic and Student Affairs ,said, "These fees are essential for providing the quality programs to students attending any of the three universities." </p>
      <p>. Special class fees allow the universities to cover expenses that are necessary for successful completion of the class objectives. These expenses include off-campus field trips or specialized equipment/facilities uses; private instruction; expendable materials; technology expense; selected personnel expenses; and deposits. </p>
      <p>. Special program fees are costs not normally associated with the delivery of a program, which are added to regular tuition. Special program fees are usually earmarked for payment of specific costs, and fee revenues are retained by the program. However, special program fees may also be based on market factors such as competitive program pricing. </p>
      <p>. In March 1997, the board adopted criteria for assessing the appropriateness of increased special program fee ranges. The following criteria are used in evaluating a fee request for a selected professional program: access; affordability; benefits to the entire university; cost of the program; increased earnings potential of graduates; market pricing, and quality. </p>
      <p>. Common surcharge fees are used to support Web course development, maintenance, and offerings, and as appropriate, faculty incentives for innovation in teaching. </p>
      <p>Other items discussed and approved included: </p>
      <p>. The first reading of a proposal that would reaffirm access for home-schooled students to Arizona 's universities. The proposal would insert the word "fair" into a policy on the admission of home-schooled students. Currently, only high school students in the top 25 percent of their graduating class are guaranteed admission to Arizona universities. </p>
      <p>Because there is no ranking for home-schooled students, they have no similar admission guarantee. </p>
      <p>"This is an issue of fairness, and we need to give these wonderful students the reassurance they need," said Regent Gary Stuart. </p>
      <p>The Regents voted to continue the discussion at the next meting in June. </p>
      <p>. An approval to change the Regents High Honors Endorsement Program. The program was created in 1998 to reward high-performing high school students. The Regents voted that students receiving high honors would be considered for tuition scholarships from an Arizona university of their choice. </p>
      <p>"Education should be a seamless transition from preschool to doctorate. In order to produce more qualified graduates, we need to motivate students to do well," said Tom Horne, superintendent of public instruction at the Arizona Department of Education. </p>
      <p>The next ABOR meeting is scheduled June 24-25, at Northern Arizona University .
