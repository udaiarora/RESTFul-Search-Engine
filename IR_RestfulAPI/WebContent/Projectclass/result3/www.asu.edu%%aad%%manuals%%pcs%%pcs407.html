If equipment is not identified or <a href="pcs004.html#tag" target="new">tagged</a> within two weeks, the department should contact Property Control.<p>The ASU PC&#035; is applied to the unit unless the unit&#146;s size or nature makes it impractical.  The ASU PC&#035; is affixed to the front, or near the front, to be seen easily and to aid the inventory process.  Capital equipment is identified by scribing the ASU PC&#035; next to the serial number.<p><b>Retagging State Surplus Capital Equipment</b><p>Capital equipment shall remain identified as university- or sponsor-owned equipment as long as it is owned by or otherwise in the custody, possession, or control of the university.  Such marking and identification are removed or obliterated from the equipment only when sold, disposed of, or scrapped.  Should the ASU PC&#035; accidentally or mistakenly be obliterated, defaced, or removed, the equipment is retagged using the identical ASU PC&#035;.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Tagging State Surplus Noncapital Equipment</b></font><p>Property Control does not identify or tag equipment with an acquisition cost of less than &#036;5,000.  If the department has an interest in identifying and tagging equipment costing less than &#036;5,000, the department may use identification labels available from ASU Property Control. Also, the department may use Property Control&#146;s Web site to add noncapital property to the database.
