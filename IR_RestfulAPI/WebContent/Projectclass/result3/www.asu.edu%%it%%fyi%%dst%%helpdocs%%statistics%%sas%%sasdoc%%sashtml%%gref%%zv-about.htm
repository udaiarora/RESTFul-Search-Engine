<P><A name="z0747968">&#13;
To produce graphics output on a graphics output device, SAS/GRAPH software
uses a device driver.  <B>Device drivers</B> are the components of SAS/GRAPH software
that translate the device-independent output from SAS/GRAPH procedures
into the appropriate commands to produce graphics output on particular output
devices. Device drivers contain settings that determine the default appearance
of the output, such as dimensions and orientation, cell size, colors, and
hardware fonts. They can also contain host commands that are issued before
and after the driver produces output.</A>
<P> A device driver is composed of two parts: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>a device entry in a SAS
catalog<P>

<LI>an executable module.<P>
</UL>

<P><A name="z0747972">&#13;
The <B>device
entry</B> is a SAS catalog entry of type DEV. It is created and accessed
with the GDEVICE procedure and explicitly refers to the executable module.
 The device entry contains <B>device parameters</B> whose settings can
control </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>the appearance of the output<P>

<LI>the destination to which the output is sent (native
SAS/GRAPH drivers
only)<P>

<LI>communications between the operating environment
and the device<P>

<LI>how the device generates the output.<P>
</UL>

<P>You can change these settings either by
modifying the
device parameters using the GDEVICE procedure, or by overriding the parameter
settings using graphics options in a GOPTIONS statement. For details, see
<A href="zcontrol.htm">Controlling Output with Device Drivers</A>.
<P><A name="z0747978">&#13;The <B>executable
module</B> is a program that produces
the device-specific commands from the device-independent output of a SAS/GRAPH procedure.
The executable module uses the parameters specified in the device entry to
tell it exactly how to do so.</A>
<P> SAS/GRAPH software
provides device entries for your operating environment in the Institute-supplied
catalog, SASHELP.DEVICES.
<P> If your site has created custom device entries, they
may also be stored in SASHELP.DEVICES, although typically custom  devices
are stored in the catalog GDEVICE0.DEVICES. For more information about custom
device entries, see <A href="zice-con.htm#z-devcat">About Device Catalogs</A>
or ask your SAS Support Consultant.

<P><A name="z0747981">&#13;   Most of the device drivers
in SASHELP.DEVICES are SAS/GRAPH <B>native device drivers</B>, which are those SAS/GRAPH drivers
that produce output in the native language of the device.  For example, the
PS300 driver is a "native device driver" because it directly produces PostScript
output.</A>
<P>Some operating environments also use <B>host drivers</B>, which make generic calls to the print driver that the user has selected
in Print Setup.  The print driver is what writes out the output in the native
language of the device.

<P><A name="z0747983">&#13; Because many characteristics of
the graphics output depend on
parameter values that are stored in the device entry, SAS/GRAPH procedures
that produce graphics output must know which device driver to use before they
begin processing.</A>
<P>Usually SAS/GRAPH automatically
selects a device driver for you and you are not required to explicitly specify
one.  If you use the GRAPH window to display graphics output, SAS/GRAPH selects
a device driver that is appropriate for your device. The default device driver
for your site may also be selected by your SAS Installation Representative.
<P>If you submit a SAS procedure without specifying a device
driver and your display device does not support the GRAPH windows or you are
running outside the SAS Display Manager, SAS/GRAPH prompts
you for a driver name.
<P>Whether or not a default device is assigned, you can
always explicitly assign a device driver. See <A href="zlecting.htm">Selecting a Device Driver</A> for more information.
