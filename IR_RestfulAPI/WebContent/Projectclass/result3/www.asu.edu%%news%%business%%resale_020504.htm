      <h2>Greater Phoenix resale market gets a jump start in January </h2>
      <p>After its record pace in 2003, the Greater Phoenix resale home market roared ahead into the New Year, setting a record January with 5,100 homes recorded sold. Although this represents a sharp decline from the 7,525 recorded in the previous month, it was well ahead of last year's 4,220 homes sold and the previous record set in January 2001 (4,240 homes sold). </p>
      <p>As the annual housing counter was reset to zero, the motivations of homebuyers continue: the desire for ownership rather than renting; a move-up to a better home; real estate as rental investments. The recent signs of growth in the economy and job market may foretell further strengthening of the housing market in 2004. The main drawback to a stronger economy is that mortgage rates will begin to increase, further impacting the affordability of housing. The positive note is that rates are still very low and people have not lost faith in their live-in investment. </p>
      <p>Since the record median home price was set last August at $160,560, it cooled to $156,000 in January, compared to $147,900 in January 2003. Since the Greater Phoenix area is so large, the median price can range significantly - from $390,150 in North Scottsdale to $93,500 in the central-western areas of the city of Phoenix. In January of this year, 50 percent of all recorded sales were for homes priced from $100,000 to $175,000 and 15 percent for homes priced over $300,000. </p>
      <p>The 1,010 resale townhouse/condominium units recorded sold in January tied the record set in January 2000, but was down from the 1,430 recorded in December. The median price increased to a record $106,945 from the previous high of $105,000 established in July 2003. </p>
      <p>The median square footage for a single-family home recorded sold in January was 1,645, slightly smaller than the 1,650 square feet reported a year ago. In the townhouse/condominium sector, the median square footage was 1,155, just shy of the 1,160 square feet reported a year ago. </p>
      <p>Other highlights of January's resale report: </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; In comparison to January 2003, recorded sales in the city of Phoenix increased from 1,230 sales to 1,460, while the median sales price increased from $120,000 to $127,000. Since Phoenix is a geographically large city, the median prices can range significantly - for example, $90,000 in the Sky Harbor area and $187,000 in the Union Hills area. The townhouse/condominium sector also improved from 235 to 300 sales, while the median price decreased from $90,950 to $88,550. </p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp; The Scottsdale resale home market improved from 405 to 515 recorded sales. The median sales price continued its rising trend, from $294,000 to $350,000. The median resale home price is $390,150 in North Scottsdale and $170,500 in South Scottsdale.
