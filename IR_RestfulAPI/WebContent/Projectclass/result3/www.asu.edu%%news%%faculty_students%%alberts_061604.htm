      <h2>Alberts hands Hugh Downs School reins to Goodall </h2>
      <p>Janet "Jess" Alberts is stepping down as director of the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication after nine years in the position. Harold Goodall, professor and head of the Communication Department at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, will replace Alberts <br>
  effective July 1. </p>
      <p>Alberts looks forward to returning to the classroom and resuming her research on conflict and workplace bullying. "I am ready to move on to new challenges and opportunities, and I want to become more involved in the community," say Alberts. </p>
      <p>In the school, the director assignment historically has been two consecutive three-year terms. However, Alberts found herself being re-elected for a third term after the faculty amended the by-laws. "I have been very fortunate to have been able to work with wonderful, supportive faculty these past nine years," says Alberts. "They have made my job infinitely easier." </p>
      <p>Under Alberts' tenure, the school was renamed the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication in 1999 and secured funding of more than $2 million for professorships, scholarships and programs. </p>
      <p>Alberts admits that her biggest hurdle in managing the school was, "To create a nationally recognized communication program while managing an average semester enrollment of approximately 6,000 students." </p>
      <p>Alberts believes the school's faculty was successful at achieving the national recognition, and will know for sure when the National Communication Association releases its rankings in 2005. </p>
      <p>"I hope the next round of ratings are as good or better than the rankings released in 1995, which reflects my predecessor's leadership," she says. </p>
      <p>College of Public Programs Dean Anne Schneider has no doubt that Alberts has helped move the school's programs into the very top tier in the United States. "Alberts is a talented administrator with a strong vision and capacity to bring out the best in people," she says. </p>
      <p>Though Goodall officially takes the reins July 1, he started learning about his new role May 1. One of the biggest challenges he will face first is the transitioning of the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication into the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. </p>
      <p>"My largest challenge initially will be to reduce some of the uncertainty that occurs during organizational change by setting up transition and alignment processes, designed to keep us focused on creating a new - and shared - vision for the future," says Goodall, who is a communication ethnographer who studies organizational cultures. "I believe the changeover we are now experiencing will be one that benefits us in the long run." </p>
      <p>"Harold Goodall has an outstanding record as a scholar and administrator," says Schneider. "He will bring considerable creativity and new ideas to the program as it transitions to liberal arts." </p>
      <p>Alberts started her career as an assistant professor at California State University, Los Angeles. In 1989, she made the switch to ASU and has held various academic and administrative positions since. She earned a B.S. Ed. in English and an M.A. in English language and literature from Abilene Christian University, and her Ph.D. in communication from The University of Texas, Austin. </p>
      <p>Goodall has been with the University of North Carolina for nearly 10 years and prior to that has held academic and administrative positions at Clemson University, University of Utah and the University of Alabama. He received his B.A. in secondary education from Shepherd College, an M.A. in Speech Communication from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a Ph.D. in communication from Pennsylvania State University. </p>
