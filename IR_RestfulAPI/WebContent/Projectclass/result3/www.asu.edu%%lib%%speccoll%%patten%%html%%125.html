It took 74 years for Hernández's work to be published and due to
 the delay, much of the original text was sacrificed.  As the
 earliest natural history of Mexico this book provides a record
 of the first official scientific expedition to the New World.
  In 1570, Dr. Hernández was given the title of First Physician
 of the Indies and awarded 60,000 ducats for botanical research.
  The expedition was expected to last 5 years.  When he reached
 the New World he found the Aztecs had already devised a system
 of naming plants, which took into account their habitat and properties.
  Hernández enlisted native guides, artists, herbalists, and physicians
 to teach him about the materia medica of the country.  He was impressed
 with the fact that the Aztecs had developed extensive botanical gardens
 and zoos, and had created collections of natural oddities and minerals.
  As a result, Hernández was able to obtain a clear picture of Mexico's
 natural history.  Hernández records the names given to the plants in
 the native tongue of the region, whether it be Tarascan, Michoacan,
 or Aztec.  In the chapter describing jasper, or "bloodstone," he shows
 that it was used by the Indians just as Europeans used it, in powdered
 form to stop hemorrhages.  After his official funds were exhausted,
 Hernández stayed on in Mexico for two more years to complete his mission,
 paying his own expenses.  Before returning to Spain in 1577 he purposely
 had copies of his manuscript made to leave in Mexico, but none,
 unfortunately, survived.  When Hernández presented his work to the
 king, Philip had the manuscript sumptuously bound and then "buried it"
 in the Escorial's library.  Following Hernández's death, Philip finally
 agreed to publish portions of the manuscript that he considered more
 useful, hiring Dr. Nardo Antonio Recchi to extract noteworthy passages.
  After Recchi's death his nephew inherited his uncle's working
 manuscript and sold it to the Accademia Lincei.  The Accademia prepared
 it for the press, and a few copies were printed in 1628 before funds
 ran out.  The projects was shelved until 1651, when the Spanish government
 supported publishing the two volume edition.  Copies of this work continued
 to be made for many years, and an edition was published in Madrid as
 late as 1790.  Sadly, the original manuscript by Hernández, including
 all his drawings, perished in a fire in the Escorial in 1671.  Only a
 few fragments survived.
