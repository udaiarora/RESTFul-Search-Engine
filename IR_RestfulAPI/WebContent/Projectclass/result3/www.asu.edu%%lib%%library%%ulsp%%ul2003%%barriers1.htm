 <H2>Initiative Area I:  Remove Barriers</H2>
 </CENTER>
 <P><BR>
 <CENTER>
 <H3>Part 1:  External Customers</H3>
 </CENTER>
 
 <H4>Goal A:	Levels of Service:</H4>
 
 Reduce users' frustrations in getting their questions answered, regardless 
 of where they are located.
 
 <H4>Goal B:	Technical Services Review</H4>	
 
 <DL>
 <DD><B>Strategy 1:  Getting materials to the shelves faster</B>
 <BR><BR> <DL> <DD>A 1998 survey conducted by the Technical Services Review Team found 
 that turn-around time for acquiring, cataloging and processing library materials 
 was among the top three customer concerns.
 </DL> <BR>
 <DD><B>Strategy 2    Better tracking of materials</B>
 <BR><BR> <DL> <DD>The survey also indicated that accessibility to not-yet-processed materials is 
 source of frustration for customers.  Our daily experience with requests for 
 unprocessed materials bears out this finding.  
 </DL> <BR>
 <DD><B>Strategy 3: Increasing the scope and quality of bibliographic access</B>
 <BR><BR> <DL> <DD>The survey also showed that our customer's major gateway to library materials is 
 through the online catalog, and that lack of access through the catalog to materials 
 already owned by the library is a major concern.
 </DL> </DL>
 
 <H4>Goal C:	Wayfinding in Hayden Library</H4>
 Improve library users' success in finding needed materials in Hayden Library 
 by making it easier to find locations within the building.  Ways to implement 
 wayfinding in Noble, Architecture and Music will be explored after success with Hayden.
 <P>A 95/96 TQS study conducted by Hayden Reference Services to investigate why 
 users could not find the materials they needed in Hayden Library found that 
 major reasons related to users not knowing where to go within the building, 
 even though they had the correct call numbers.  
 <P>Two major causes appeared to be:  users are confused about how the floors 
 are numbered within the building; and poor/insufficient signage used to direct 
 people from the online catalog to the actual location.  
 <P>To address these, the Hayden Library will be included in the ASU Wayfinding 
 Sign Program which will address the need to renumber rooms/floors within the building 
 and update the signage within the building.   
 
 <H4>Goal D:	Noble Phase III Remodel</H4>  
 Completed Spring 2000.
  
 <H4>Goal E:	ADA</H4>
 Provide optimum access, including reasonable accommodations, to the diverse 
 community of customers with disabilities
 
 <DL>
 <DD><B>Strategy 1:</B>   
 <BR><BR> <DL> <DD>Improve the type and availability of assistive technology in the University Libraries:
 </DL> <BR>	
 <DD><B>Strategy 2:</B>	
 <BR><BR> <DL> <DD>Increase the number of customers with disabilities who can use library resources and services independently, even if they use the libraries remotely.
 </DL> <BR>
 <DD><B>Strategy 3:</B>  
 <BR><BR> <DL> <DD>Incorporate awareness of disability issues into Library policies and procedures.
 </DL> <BR>
 <DD><B>Strategy 4:</B>  
 <BR><BR> <DL> <DD>Promote the library and its services to community of disabled individuals.
