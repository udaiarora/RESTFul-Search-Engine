<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Authorization to Plan a New Degree Program</B></FONT>

<P>
The Academic Degree Program Inventory designates all academic degree programs which are approved for planning at the respective universities.  The <A HREF="acd002.html#board" TARGET="New">board</A> will review and update semiannually the list of programs approved for planning.  The state&#146;s need for a proposed program and the appropriateness of the university making the request as the best location for the proposed program are the primary criteria that will be considered in granting approval to plan a new academic degree program.  Planning authority granted by the board will expire three years from the date of initial approval unless extended by the board.

<P>
The board will consider the following criteria in reviewing a request for planning authorization for a new degree program that duplicates a degree program offered by another public university in Arizona.  It is not necessary for a degree program to meet all of the criteria.  However, the board expects substantial justification for all requests for authorization to begin planning a new program that duplicates a program offered by another Arizona public university.

<P>
<OL>
<LI>There is a long-term <A HREF="acd002.html#student" TARGET="New">student</A> demand for the program that cannot be met satisfactorily by the existing program.</LI>

<P>
<LI>The program would attract a large number of nontraditional, older, part-time students who are place-bound and who cannot move to the community in which the university offering the program is located.</LI>

<P>
<LI>The program is a basic academic subject normally taught in most universities.</LI>

<P>
<LI>The university currently offering the program cannot deliver the program off campus because of limited resources or because of the need for specialized equipment or library resources.</LI>

<P>
<LI>The establishment of the program will not adversely affect the existing program.</LI>

<P>
<LI>The resources necessary for the program such as courses, <A HREF="acd002.html#facultymember" TARGET="New">faculty</A>, equipment, and library resources are already available as part of an existing program and the incremental costs for implementing the program are negligible.</LI>
</OL>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Implementation of a New Degree Program</B></FONT>

<P>
A university may request, through the chief academic officers and the Programs Committee of the Board of Regents in January and June of each year, authorization to implement any degree program approved for planning.  The quality and cost of the proposed program and the university&#146;s readiness and ability to support the program are the primary criteria that will be considered.  The board will not consider any university&#146;s request for authorization to begin a new degree program which was not previously approved for planning except under extraordinary circumstances of clearly demonstrated urgency.
