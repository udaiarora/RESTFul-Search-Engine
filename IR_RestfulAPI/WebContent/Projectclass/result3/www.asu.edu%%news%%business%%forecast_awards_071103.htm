      <h2>Bank One Economic Outlook Center at ASU: Most accurate employment forecasters
        honored</h2>
      <p>        Anne Ramstetter Wenzel, founder of the San Francisco
          research firm Econosystems, and two other leading economists have been
          honored for their job growth forecasting accuracy by the Bank One Economic
          Outlook Center in the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State
          University.</p>
      <p>Also honored were Mike Daniels of the South Carolina Employment Security
        Commission, Columbia, S.C., and Rajeev Dhawan of Georgia State University,
        Atlanta, Georgia. The three are on a panel of 25 economists who contribute
        to the National Consensus Forecast of Labor Employment, Compensation
        and Productivity. </p>
      <p>&quot;This year the panel had a real challenge to forecast these particular
        indicators, with job growth sagging, productivity on the rise in many
        sectors, and private industry trying to hold the line on employment costs,&quot; said
        Lee McPheters director of the Bank One Economic Outlook Center.</p>
      <p>The National Consensus Forecast of Labor Employment, published quarterly
        in the Blue Chip Job Growth Update, is the only consensus forecast of
        job growth in the nation. The forecast was assembled three years ago
        by the Bank One Economic Outlook Center to provide key economic information
        to corporations, government, economic development agencies and the public.</p>
      <p>Awards were presented for accuracy overall, and accuracy in each of
        the forecast's component parts. Photos of the three honorees can be downloaded
        at wpcarey.asu.edu/newsroom:</p>
      <p>Most Accurate Forecast Overall<br>
        Most Accurate Forecast in Nonfarm Business Productivity<br>
        Anne Ramstetter Wenzel</p>
      <p>Wenzel, who was honored in two categories, worked for 14 years as an
        economist for the Chemical Economics handbook Program at SRI Consulting
        in Menlo Park, CA prior to founding Econosystems in April 1999. Specializing
        in environmental economics, she holds a bachelor's and a master's degree
        in economics from San Francisco State University.</p>
      <p>The Nonfarm Business Productivity forecast is the output per hour of
        all persons, as released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With public
        interest in productivity growing in recent years, increases in output
        per hour have been recognized as important indicators of economic progress
        and a means to higher income levels.</p>
      <p>Most Accurate Forecast of Total Nonfarm Employment<br>
        Rajeev Dhawan</p>
      <p>Professor Rajeev Dhawan has been the director of the Georgia State University
        Economic Forecasting Center for three years. Prior to that he had been
        the director of econometric forecasting at UCLA, authored the quarterly
        forecast for the U.S. and California economy and directed economic impact
        studies including those concerning the loss of aerospace jobs in the
        early 1990's on California economy. </p>
      <p>The Total Nonfarm Employment Forecast is typically referred to as job
        growth in media reports. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics works with
        state employment agencies to collect data each month on employment, hours
        and earnings from a sample of non-farm establishments.</p>
      <p>Most Accurate Forecast of the Employment Cost Index<br>
        James M. Daniels II</p>
      <p>James M. Daniels II is a research and planning administrator with the
        labor market information department of the South Carolina Employment
        Security Commission where he serves as the supervisor of special research.
        He oversees the production of the monthly labor force press release,
        the agency's quarterly consumer confidence survey and the monthly state
        economic indicators as published in South Carolina Economic Indicators,
        produced in conjunction with the University of South Carolina's Division
        Research.</p>
      <p>The Employment Cost Index is a forecast of quarterly changes in labor
        and benefit costs in addition to salary, based on the U.S. Bureau of
        Labor Statistics data.</p>
      <p><br>
        The Bank One Economic Outlook Center is part of the L. William Seidman
          Research Institute in the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona
          State University. The institute is an affiliation of eight research
          centers that serves as a link between the local, state, national and
          international business communities and the creative and intellectual
          resources of the nationally ranked W. P. Carey School.</p>
