                <p>SPAMming is to indiscriminately send large amounts of unsolicited
                  e-mail meant to promote a product or service.<br />

                  <br />
                  Spam in this sense is like the electronic equivalent of junk
                  mail sent to 'Current Resident'.</p>

                <p><strong>What Can Be Done?</strong></p>

                <p>The Web and Messaging Applications  Team (WMA)
                  cannot stop unwanted e-mail from reaching ASU's e-mail systems.
                  To do so would mean that ASU would need to cut itself off from
                  the Internet. It is much the same as your mailbox at home; as
                  long as you have an address, you will be sent junk mail. The
                  biggest difference is that at home it costs someone the price
                  of postage to send you the mail. The price is much less for
                  Internet junk mail.</p>
                <p>The use of SPAM (unsolicited e-mail advertisements) is at an
                  all time high and still rising. SPAMmers are becoming more sophisticated
                  and databases of e-mail addresses are growing. As long as SPAM
                  is viewed as a free form of advertising, its use will probably
                  continue to increase.</p>
                <p>ASU offers SPAM Filtering for your EPO Accounts (your primary
                  address and your aliases). To learn more and how to get started,
                  please read <a href="filtering.htm">here</a>.<br />
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>How Do They Get My E-mail Address?<br />

                  </strong><br />
                  If you give a company your e-mail address, not only can they
                  turn around and use it, but they can sell it to other companies
                  who will use it to. This applies to supplying your address verbally
                  as well as entering it online.</p>
                <p>If your e-mail address appears on a web page, then &quot;Spam-bots&quot;
                  that scour the Internet may find it. The ASU Web directory may
                  have your e-mail address on it, but it can not be scanned in
                  its entirety, so it is not likely a source for SPAMmers.</p>
                <p>Participation in online discussion groups, bulletin boards
                  or services like e-bay where your e-mail address is associated
                  with your account</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>What Can I Do To Reduce The Amount Of SPAM I Receive?</strong></p>


              1. Sign up for the <a href="filtering.htm">ASU SPAM
                Filtering</a> service. <strong>Be sure to check this service frequently
                while initially building your white list. <br />
                </strong><br />
                2. Go get a second e-mail account from one of the free providers,
                like Yahoo. Use that e-mail address whenever you are asked for
                your e-mail address by someone (or some form) that you do not
                completely trust.<br />

              3. Make sure your e-mail address doesn't appear
                on any web pages (e.g. search the web for your address)<br />


              4. Use the SPAM filtering available within your
                e-mail client. If you use Outlook, for example, you can start using
                the &quot;Junk Mail Filter&quot; that is built in. It is not very
                sophisticated, but it will detect some SPAM. As you get to know
                how the filter works, you should only have the filter move &quot;candidate&quot;
                SPAM to another folder (rather than delete it) until you trust
                it.<br />

              5. Delete it. Ultimately, this is your best
                weapon. Delete the message without reading it and minimize the
                time you spend handling SPAM.<br />



                <p><em>Spams</em> or <em>Chain Letters</em> originating or passed
                  on <em><strong>within ASU</strong></em> should be reported to <a href="mailto:email-q@asu.edu">email-q@asu.edu</a>                  immediately.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>What Is ASU Doing To Stop SPAM?<br />

                  </strong><br />
                  In the past, ASU used to attempt to &quot;block&quot; SPAM.
                  We would disallow (known as 'blacklisting') e-mail from certain
                  addresses, or block entire sites that did not try to stop SPAMmers
                  that originated there. The SPAMmers always found a way around
                  these blocks, and we would end up blocking legitimate e-mail;
                  so we no longer block addresses from being able to send to us.<br />
                  <br />
                  ASU attempts to keep its e-mail addresses private from Spam
                  bots.<br />
                  <br />
                  We now offer user initiated SPAM Filtering. ASU does not filter
                  for SPAM by default. If you would like to read more about ASU's
                  SPAM Filtering Service, please read <a href="filtering.htm">here</a>.<br />

                  <br />
                </p>
                <p><strong>Reporting Spams, Chain Letters or Other Annoying &amp; Abusive
                  E-Mails</strong></p>
                <p>Before reporting these types of e-mails to <a href="mailto:email-q@asu.edu">email-q@asu.edu</a>
                  or to the Postmaster of the originating node, you should <u><em><strong>ALWAYS</strong></em></u>
                  include the header information of the e-mail message in question.
                  Since e-mail addresses in spam e-mails are usually forged, the
                  header information is necessary in order to attempt to track
                  the source of the note. Without the header information,
				  <acronym title="Web &quot; Messaging Applications Team">WMA</acronym>
                  (or the Postmaster of the originating domain) cannot take any
                  action to deter future abuse.</p>

                <p>Header information will look something like the following:</p>
