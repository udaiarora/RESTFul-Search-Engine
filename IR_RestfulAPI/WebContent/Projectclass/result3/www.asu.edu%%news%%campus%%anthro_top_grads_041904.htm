      <h2><strong>Anthropology Continues Streak in Producing Top Grads </strong></h2>
      <p>The strength of a department at a university can be measured by many things - the prominence of its faculty, the national honors they win, or the amount of research money they bring in, to name a few. However, one really important benchmark is usually hard to measure until years have passed: the impact the department has had in shaping the future of its academic field. </p>
      <p>In the case of Arizona State University's highly ranked Department of Anthropology though,&nbsp; there is already some strong evidence that the unit is a top performer in producing major scholars. This year, for the second year in a row, a graduate student in the department has won one of the highest honors given to graduate students in anthropology-related disciplines. </p>
      <p>Ian G. Robertson, who received his doctorate from the department this year, has received the Society for American Archaeology's 2004 Best Dissertation Award.&nbsp; Robertson is the fifth graduate of ASU's Anthropology Department to win this prestigious award since its inception sixteen years ago. No other institution has produced more than two winners. </p>
      <p>  Robertson has recently accepted a tenure-track position in the Department of Anthropological Sciences at Stanford University. </p>
      <p>Robertson received his award in Montreal&nbsp; on April 2, at the 69th annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology (SAA), the leading professional organization of archaeologists in the Americas, with a membership of approximately 7000. </p>
      <p>The award has been given since 1988, skipping 1989.&nbsp; ASU Ph.D.s have won five of the society's last 10 awards: 1995, David Abbott; 1998, Mark Varien; 2001,Andrew Duff; 2003, Wesley Bernardini; and 2004, Ian Robertson. Only two other universities have won more than one of the awards - the University of Arizona and the University of Michigan, which have each won two. </p>
      <p>  According to SAA, the dissertation award is "presented to an archaeologists just entering the profession whose doctoral dissertation is judged to be particularly outstanding." Robertson won for a dissertation entitled&nbsp; "Mapping the Social Landscape of an Early Urban Center: Socio-Spatial Variation in Teotihuacan." Teotihuacan, located 25 miles north of Mexico City, is the Western Hemisphere's most ancient metropolis - a 2,000-year-old city created by a civilization that is still poorly understood. </p>
      <p>The SAA's description of the dissertation explains the significance of the author's contribution to archaeology: "Robertson used Bayesian statistical techniques and GIS analyses of a massive dataset (totaling several hundred thousand sherds from nearly 5000 spatial tracts) to explore spatial and temporal patterns at Teotihuacan. He documents changes in city-wide distributions of ceramics that relate to socioeconomic status, and uses these results to characterize types of neighborhoods and to explore ways in which the natural and social environments constrain and create opportunities for action. Robertson's dissertation is an exceptional contribution, both methodologically and theoretically, and it has made Teotihuacan the world's best-understood prehistoric city in terms of its spatial structure." </p>
      <p>Robertson's dissertation director was Professor of Anthropology George Cowgill, one of the world's leading authorities on Teotihuacan. </p>
