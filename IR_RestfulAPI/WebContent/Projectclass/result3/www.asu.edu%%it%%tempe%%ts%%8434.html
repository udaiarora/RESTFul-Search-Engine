			<h2>8434 Digital Set</h2>
			<img src="img/8434DX.jpg" width="132" height="165" border="0" />
			<p>$150.00 installation <br /><br />
				$32.00 per month <br /><br />
				
			<p>The 8434 voice terminals are multi-appearance digital voice terminals which offer 34 call 
				appearance/feature buttons, each with a red light and a green status light, four standard 
				fixed feature buttons (CONFERENCE, DROP, HOLD, and TRANSFER), a MUTE button, a SPEAKER 
				button which accesses either a 2-way speakerphone or a 1-way listen-only speaker, a TEST 
				button, a SHIFT button, a red Message light, personalized ringing, a built-in speakerphone 
				with a reset option, and a built-in 2-line by 40-character VFD display. The 8434 and 
				8434DX also have five softkeys and four display control buttons which allow the user to 
				access 15 features. These softkey features can be used in addition to the features on 
				the call appearance/feature buttons.</p>
				
			<h3>Features</h3>

			<p><strong>Eight Fixed Feature Buttons</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li>CONFERENCE (labeled CONF) button</li>
				<li>DROP button</li>
				<li>TRANSFER button</li>
				<li>A red HOLD button</li>
				<li>A blue SHIFT button</li>
				<li>MUTE button</li>
				<li>SPEAKER button</li>
				<li>TEST button</li>
			</ul>
				
			<p><strong>The SHIFT button</strong></p>

			<p>The blue SHIFT button can be used in two different ways: (The red light next to the SHIFT 
				button goes on steadily when the button is activated.)</p> 

			<ul>
				<li>Used with the HOLD button to select your own personalized ringing patterns from among 
					eight available patterns. </li>
				<li>Used with the SPEAKER button to perform an acoustic test of the environment and adjust 
				the speakerphone to the surrounding acoustic environment for optimal performance.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>Call Appearance/Feature Buttons</strong></p>

			<p>The 8434 and 8434DX voice terminals have 34 call appearance/feature buttons, each equipped 
				with a red and a green status light. Usually, at least three of these buttons are 
				administered as call appearances for the terminalâ??s primary extension number, where calls 
				are placed and answered. The rest of the buttons can be used for more call appearances 
				(including bridged appearances of other stationsâ?? extensions) and features. Buttons 
				administered for features have only their status lights active.</p>

			<p><strong>Message light</strong></p>

			<p>The red Message light goes on when a message is left for the voice terminal user. The light 
				goes off when the user retrieves the message or when the message is erased.</p>

			<p><strong>Speakerphone (Listen and Speak) Feature</strong></p>

			<p>The 8434 and 8434DX voice terminals are equipped with a built-in speakerphone. The 
				Speakerphone capability allows a user to engage in a hands-free 2-way conversation with 
				the far-end party. The speakerphone can be turned off or on with the SPEAKER button, can 
				be muted with the MUTE button, and the volume can be controlled with the VOLUME &#8220;arrow&#8221;
				button.</p>

			<p>The Speakerphone feature also allows the user to adjust the speakerphone for optimal 
				performance. By pressing the SHIFT button and then the SPEAKER button (if the voice 
				terminal is set for the Speakerphone feature), the user hears a set of tones as the 
				speakerphone performs an acoustic test of the environment. When the tones stop, the 
				speakerphone has finished adjusting itself and is ready for use. The user should reset 
				the speakerphone whenever the voice terminal is moved to another place (even in the same 
				room), whenever the red light next to the SPEAKER button is fluttering, and in the 
				unlikely event that the speakerphone is making a squealing sound (in this last case, 
				tones will not be heard during a call).</p>

			<p><strong>MUTE button</strong></p>

			<p>The MUTE button disables the transmitter of the speakerphone or the handset depending on 
			which is activated at that time. A red light next to the MUTE button goes on when the Mute 
			eature is activated.</p>

			<p><strong>VOLUME control button</strong></p>

			<p>The 8434 and 8434DX voice terminals have a VOLUME &#8220;arrow&#8221; button. This button 
				has several functions. When the user is on a call using the speaker or speakerphone, the 
				VOLUME button controls the volume of the speaker or speakerphone, whichever is being used. 
				When the user is on a call using the handset, the VOLUME button controls the handset 
				volume. When the voice terminal is idle, the VOLUME control button adjusts the tone 
				ringer. When the user sets the volume for the speaker, speakerphone, handset, or the tone 
				ringer, the display on the voice terminal shows a &#8220;bar array&#8221; that indicates 
				the volume setting.</p>

			<p><strong>TEST button</strong></p>

			<p>When the voice terminal is initially powered up, the green light next to the TEST button 
				flashes if the link with the 
				<acronym title="Private Branch Exchange">PBX</acronym> is not (or not yet) operational. 
				The light changes to 
				steady green when the voice terminal is able to communicate with the PBX. After the voice 
				terminal is powered up, you can press the TEST button to test the lights and the display 
				on your voice terminal.</p>

			<p><strong>Display</strong></p>

			<p>The 8434 and 8434DX voice terminals are equipped with a built-in, 2-line by 40-character 
				VFD display.</p>

			<p><strong>Display Control Buttons</strong></p>

			<p>These four buttons are labeled Menu, Exit, Prev, and Next. Menu is used to enter Softkey 
			Mode and access the 15 softkey features. Exit is used for exiting a display feature and 
			returning to Normal (call-handling) Mode. Prev and Next can be used to help you go back 
			and forth through the feature option screens.</p>

			<p><strong>Softkeys</strong></p>

			<p>The five buttons located below the display and labeled with arrows correspond to features 
				listed on the second line of the display screen. (There are five features on each feature 
				option screen.) The user can access any of the 15 features by pressing the softkey below 
				the feature abbreviation.</p>
