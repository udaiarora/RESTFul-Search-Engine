    This policy is not intended to address differences of opinion over grades issued by an instructor exercising good faith and professional judgment regarding a student's work. Before any action is taken under this Policy that may result in the withdrawal, suspension or expulsion of an international student, both the student and the academic program are advised to consult with the ASU International Student Office.</font></LI>

They may be modified in individual cases, so long as the student is provided an opportunity to respond to allegations of academic dishonesty within a reasonable time after those allegations have been made. An Advisor may accompany the student at any point in the process. The Advisor will not be permitted to participate directly or speak for the student, but may be present during meetings and hearings.</font></p>

If the Student submits a request for review at the end of a semester, or during the last semester of enrollment, the course grade may be withheld for a reasonable period of time (normally not to exceed six months) until the matter is decided.

If a grade or degree will be withheld for any period, the Initiator, Dean, Director, or designee must notify the Registrar's Office.<BR>
