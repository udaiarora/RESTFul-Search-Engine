      <h2>Navajo Nation continues funding successful program</h2>
      <p> A program for Navajo students at ASU is helping them fulfill the hopes 
        of their rural Native American community. Some are even surpassing their 
        parents' dreams.</p>
      <p>Thirty-three Navajo students in ASU's Native American Achievement Program 
        (NAAP) have successfully graduated, with dozens more in the pipeline. 
        One graduate is now studying at Harvard Law School. Another is a mechanical 
        systems engineer, helping design satellite systems for space.</p>
      <p>The innovative partnership with the Navajo Nation has led to an increase 
        in the freshman persistence rate for Navajo students at ASU from about 
        48 percent to an average 72 percent, the program's primary goal. </p>
      <p>Now the Navajo Nation has agreed to continue funding the NAAP at ASU 
        for five more years at $491,500 per year, providing scholarships for Navajo 
        freshmen and continuing sophomores who participate. </p>
      <p>The program requires them to meet with professors and advisers, take 
        study skills workshops and develop action plans to meet their goals. They 
        also work with the Multicultural Student Center and the American Indian 
        Institute.</p>
      <p>"Getting them through the first year, and coming back to ASU for the 
        second year, has been the hurdle," says Peterson Zah, adviser to the president 
        on American Indian affairs. "We also provide them with considerable support 
        in their sophomore year. Once they have made it through two years, they 
        are generally committed and want to finish."</p>
      <p>Native American freshmen coming to ASU face an uphill struggle, often 
        marked by homesickness, culture shock, inadequate high school preparation 
        and financial problems. For years they have been less likely to succeed 
        than any minority group on campus.</p>
      <p>Making the transition from a rural, primarily Native American high school 
        to a large urban campus can be difficult, says Michael Begaye, program 
        coordinator senior. Other barriers include a culture that emphasizes sharing 
        over competition and the experience of being the first in their family 
        to attend college. Almost a third declare an engineering major, an especially 
        demanding freshman curriculum.</p>
      <p>A total of 313 first-time Navajo freshmen have participated in NAAP during 
        its first five years, and during that time their persistence rates have 
        been higher than that of other Native American freshmen. A third of the 
        first group of freshmen have already graduated, and the six-year graduation 
        rate by May 2003 could approach 50 percent, almost double what it was 
        in the past.</p>
      <p>Zah, former chairman and president of the Navajo Nation, was instrumental 
        in crafting the initial agreement and in securing continuing funds, a 
        pact that was signed by the tribal council in the final hours of Dec. 
        31, 2002, before it expired. A transition to a new Navajo president in 
        January had created a delay.</p>
      <p>"The tribe is fully committed to Navajo youth and to giving as many of 
        them as possible the opportunity to get a degree," says Zah. "The hope 
        is not only to help them succeed, but to produce graduates who can go 
        back to their communities and have a major impact. </p>
      <p>"Indian tribes need help. They need a pool of resources to help them 
        run tribal governments. They need teachers, principals, superintendents, 
        doctors and lawyers to be role models, so young kids will look at these 
        people and realize they can be leaders, too."</p>
