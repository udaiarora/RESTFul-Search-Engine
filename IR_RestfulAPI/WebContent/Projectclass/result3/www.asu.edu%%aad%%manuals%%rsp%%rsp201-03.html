<p>
The IRB may use an expedited review procedure for research activities that present no more than <a href="rsp004.html#minimalrisk">minimal risk</a> to human subjects and involve only procedures in one or more of the categories listed below. 

<p>
<ol>
<li>Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when:<br>

<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application is not required

<p>
or</li>

<p>
<li>research on medical devices for which:<br>

<p>
<ol>
<li>an investigational device exemption application is not required

<p>
or</li>

<p>
<li>the medical device is cleared/approved for marketing and the medical device is being used in accordance with its cleared/approved labeling.</li>
</ol></li></ol></li></ol>


<p>
<ol start="2"><li>Collection of blood samples by finger stick, heel stick, ear stick, or venipuncture as follows:<br>

<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>not more than 550 ml in an eight-week period from healthy, nonpregnant adults who weigh at least 110 pounds; collection may not occur more frequently than two times per week

<p>
or</li>

<p>
<li>not more than the lesser of 50 ml or 3 ml per kg in an eight-week period from other adults and children considering age, weight, and health of the subjects, the collection procedure, the amount of blood to be collected, and the frequency with which it will be collected; collection may not occur more frequently than two times per week.</li>
</ol></li></ol>

<p>
<ol start="3"><li>Prospective collection of biological specimens for research purposes by noninvasive means including:<br>

<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>hair and nail clippings in a nondisfiguring manner</li>

<p>
<li>deciduous teeth at time of exfoliation or if routine patient care indicates a need for extraction</li>

<p>
<li>permanent teeth if routine patient care indicates a need for extraction</li>

<p>
<li>excreta and external secretions including sweat</li>

<p>
<li>uncannulated saliva collected either in an unstimulated fashion or stimulated by chewing gumbase or wax or by applying a dilute citric solution to the tongue</li>

<p>
<li>placenta removed at delivery</li>

<p>
<li>amniotic fluid obtained at the time of rupture of the membrane prior to or during labor</li>

Where medical devices are employed, they must be cleared/approved for marketing. Studies intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the medical device are not generally eligible for expedited review, including studies of cleared medical devices for new indications. Examples include:<br>

<p>
<ol start="5"><li>Research involving materials (data, documents, records, or specimens) that have been collected or will be collected solely for nonresearch purposes such as medical treatment or diagnosis. Some research in this category may be exempt; this category refers only to research that is not exempt.</li>

<p>
<li>Collection of data from voice, video, digital, or image recordings made for research purposes.</li>

<p>
<li>Research on individual or group characteristics or behavior (including, but not limited to, research on perception, cognition, motivation, identity, language communication, cultural beliefs or practices, and social behavior) or research employing survey, interview, oral history, focus group, program evaluation, human factors evaluation, or quality assurance methodologies. Some research in this category may be exempt; this category refers only to research that is not exempt.</li>

<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>the research is permanently closed to the enrollment of new subjects</li>

<p>

<p>
and</li>

<p>
<li>the research remains active only for long-term follow-up of subjects</li></ol>

<p>
or where</li>

<p>
<ol type="a">
<li> no subjects have been enrolled and no additional risks have been identified
