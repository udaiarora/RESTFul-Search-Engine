[See ACD 506-06 and 506-09] </strong></p>        <p>With changes in ACD policy, probationary reviews for assistant professors (hired 2003/04 or thereafter) have been moved to third-year reviews (midway in their promotion and tenure review cycle); untenured associate and full professors (hired 2003/04 or thereafter) will continue to have their probationary reviews (midpoint) in their second year. </p>        <p>&nbsp; </p>        <p>Be scrupulous in following the directions below for soliciting outside letters: </p>        <p>1. &nbsp;To the extent possible, select full professors from the unit's/college's approved peer/aspirational peer institutions to serve as reviewers or institutions ranked higher than the unit's aspirational peers. &nbsp; In comprising the list of external reviewers, half should be selected from the candidate's suggested reviewers and the other half from the chair/dean's suggested list of reviewers. &nbsp; <strong><em>The unit head must consult with the dean in developing this. </em></strong><em></em></p>        <p> 2. &nbsp;Please use Template Letter #1 (attached) in requesting external reviews. &nbsp; This will insure that all relevant information is requested and that standard language is used across cases. &nbsp; If you modify this letter to personalize it, make sure your request is written in neutral terms so as not to suggest that you are asking for either a positive or negative endorsement. &nbsp; <strong>Be sure to designate if the candidate is being reviewed for promotion only, tenure only, or both promotion and tenure. </strong></p>        <p>Also if there has been a good cause extension of the tenure clock, ask candidates if reviewers may be informed, with their written permission, that the clock has been extended and insert the statement bracketed in Template Letter #1. </p>        <p>3. &nbsp;You should include a statement that the recommendations are confidential and will be seen only by appropriate administrators and reviewing committees. &nbsp; If your reviewing committee is made up of a large group, e.g., all faculty at rank and above, then explain the situation so that the writer will not be surprised at how many people read the evaluation. &nbsp; <strong>This also means that internal recommendation letters should not identify the reviewers in any way (either by name, by description, by university affiliation, etc.). </strong></p>        <p>4. The packet of accompanying materials should be up-to-date and carefully prepared by the candidate (except for your letter) to present a well-rounded picture. &nbsp; It should resemble the packet i.e., a table of contents, an updated vita, a statement from the candidate putting past and future work into perspective, and samples of four articles/books, portfolios, or equivalent data. &nbsp; </p>        <p>5. &nbsp;If special circumstances surrounding the departmental context might be helpful to external reviewers in making judgments about the cases, e. g., relative productivity in units/departments where teaching/service demands may be higher or lower than average, we recommend that units/departments include relevant information. </p>        <p>6. &nbsp;Request a copy of the curriculum vitae of each reviewer and include the vitae in the materials sent forward. </p>        <p>7. &nbsp;Send a "thank you for reviewing" letter to those who take the time to make a review <em>after the final decision has been made. </em>&nbsp; [See attached template letter #3.] </p>        <p>Point #3 is extremely important. &nbsp; Current ACD policy allows faculty members or academic professionals to review their personnel file, with the exception of confidential references and external letters of evaluation. &nbsp; It is essential, therefore, that tenure/continuing status and promotion recommendations from personnel committees and others not include names, universities, or place of professional employment, nor descriptively identify the external reviewers in the letters of recommendation or reports. &nbsp; </p>        <p>Please ensure that names of external reviewers are listed ONLY on the grid entitled RECORD OF OUTSIDE LETTERS FOR ASU TENURE AND/OR PROMOTION. &nbsp; Please also provide additional narrative on the grid (Reason for Invitation/Professional Qualifications/Relationship to Candidate) as needed to contextualize the reviews. &nbsp; That is, for each evaluator, please describe the reviewer's qualifications, stature in the field, and area of expertise; provide enough detail so that reviewers outside of the discipline can make a fair determination about the weight to accord each review. &nbsp; All external reviewers should be listed on the grid even if they decline to review or do not respond with a review and note the declination or non response. </p>        <p><strong>Be sure that all information received after the file has left the unit/department is forwarded on through each review level to the University Vice Provost to be added as an Appendix to the candidate's file. &nbsp; A brief statement should be written at each review level stating whether or not the new material would change their earlier recommendation in any way. &nbsp; Also, please notify the University Vice Provost that additional materials are on their way to be added to the candidate's case file.</strong></p>        <p>For further information about tenure/continuing status and promotion processes, refer to the 506 or 507 section of the online ACD Manual at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals">www.asu.edu/aad/manuals </a> or contact Cecilia Hook if you have questions. </p>        <p>&nbsp;</p></td>    <td width="14%" valign="top"><p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/asunews/Insight/index.htm">         </a></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p></td>  </tr></table><BR CLEAR=ALL><!--Page Footer-->    <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->	      </div>	</td>	  </tr>      <!--Footer-->	  <tr>    <td width="220" align="left" valign="bottom" bgcolor="#000000"><p>&nbsp;</p> </td>    <td bgcolor="#000000">	<div id="superfooter">	    <p>		<a href="http://www.asu.edu/search/">Search</a> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <a href="http://www.asu.edu/copyright/">Copyright</a> &nbsp;| &nbsp;         <a href="http://www.asu.edu/accessibility/">Accessibility</a> &nbsp; | &nbsp;         <a href="http://www.asu.edu/privacy/">Privacy</a> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 		<a href="http://www.asu.edu/admin/">Administration</a> &nbsp; | &nbsp; 	    <a href="http://www.asu.edu/contactasu/">Contact ASU</a></p>    </div>	</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="220" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p>      </p></td>    <td><div id="footer">		<table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">          <tr>            <td width="84%" align="left" valign="top">				<p>Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University<br>		  Location:		  Foundation Building, Suite 420, 300 E.
