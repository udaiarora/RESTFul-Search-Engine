    <h4>Mission</h4>
    <div align="center">
      <h5>The mission of the Center for Asian Research is<br>
    to promote and support the study of Asia at Arizona State University, <br>
    in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and in the greater community.</h5>
    </div>
    <h5>Lecture Series and Conferences</h5>
    <p>The Center for Asian Research and its sister organization, the Program
      for Southeast Asian Studies, accomplish this mission in several ways. The
      Center encourages ASU faculty research by offering travel grants, funded
      by an endowment from the late A.T. Steele; as part of an annual lecture
      series, grant awardees report on their travel experiences and research.
      The Center also arranges lectures by ASU graduate students, providing them
      a forum for sharing their research findings with the ASU community. In
      addition, the Center helps bring guest lecturers to ASU from across the
      nation and around the world. Past speakers have included Oe Kenzaburo,
      winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize in Literature, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi
      of the University of Arizona, Donald Gregg, former ambassador to Korea
      and current president of the Korea Society in New York, and John W. Dower,
      Pulitzer-prize winning historian and professor, MIT. These lectures all
      play an integral role in faculty teaching and research. In recent years,
      the Center has also brought two national Sinology conferences to campus,
      and hosted the 2003 Western Conference of the Association for Asian Studies.</p>
    <h5>Undergraduate Certificate Program</h5>
    <p>The Center offers one of the most comprehensive and rigorous undergraduate
      certificate programs at ASU. Requiring language skills in Chinese, Japanese,
      Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Lao, Thai, or Vietnamese, the Asian Studies
      Certificate program also encourages students to gain area-specific knowledge
      of Asia
      by taking courses in anthropology, art, geography, history, humanities,
      literature, politics, and religion. During the 2002-03 academic year, students
      could choose from a total of 181 Asian-emphasis course offerings. More
      than 10 percent of ASU's undergraduate students take at least one such
      course. Beginning in the fall of 2003, the Center has offered a Graduate
      Certificate in Asian Studies. The Center and the Program for Southeast
      Asian Studies each have an Asian Studies advisor to assist certificate
      students.</p>
    <h5>Graduate Certificate in Asian Studies</h5>
    <p>
        The Graduate Certificate in Asian Studies will provide students with
          official transcript recognition of specialization in Asian Studies
          related to
          their major area of study. The certificate is offered in two tracks:
          East Asia (China, Japan, Korea) and Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Laos,
          Thailand and Vietnam). This certificate is open to any student pursuing
          an M.A. or Ph.D. degree in any school or division of the university.
    </p>
    <h5>Asian Film Series</h5>
    <p>In conjunction with our Asian Studies courses the Center shows a series
      of Asian films every fall and spring, featuring
      both
      new
      and classic
      films;
      all
      are shown
      in
      the
      original
      language
      (subtitled in English), and each one is introduced by a member of the Center's
      affiliated faculty. This film series provides access to critically acclaimed
      Asian films that are otherwise often unavailable to people in the greater
      Phoenix metropolitan community.</p>
    <h5>Video Collection</h5>
    <p>The Center maintains a sizeable Asian video and DVD/VCD collection, including
      feature films as well as documentaries, open for check-out to all ASU students
      and faculty. These films are frequently borrowed by ASU faculty members
      for their courses, as well as by individual students for both academic
      and personal use.</p>
    <h5>Library Resources</h5>
    <p>The Center and the Program for Southeast Asian Studies both provide reading
      rooms stocked with periodicals such as Far Eastern Economic Review, numerous
      scholarly journals, and Asia-focused newspapers in English as well as in
      Asian languages. The Center's Library Committee has been working to increase
      and improve the already impressive collection of Asian books and materials
      at Hayden Library, which to date contains over 75,000 volumes in Chinese
      and Japanese, 55,000 volumes about China and Japan written in English,
      a Southeast Asian language collection of nearly 20,000 titles, and a growing
      collection of volumes in Korean. The Center regularly seeks support for
      library acquisitions through grants and donations.</p>
    <h5>Assistance with Study-Abroad and Exchange Programs in Asia</h5>
    <p>The Center's Study Abroad Committee works closely with ASU's International
      Programs Office to advise and assist with study-abroad and exchange programs.
      Currently, ASU students have opportunities for studying in China, Japan,
      Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore. The Center's
      affiliated faculty also supervise summer programs in China and Japan, as
      well as a new winter study program to China and one to India.</p>
    <h5>Educational Outreach Resources for K-12 Teachers</h5>
    <p>Beginning in the fall of 2002, the Center was able to hire an outreach
      coordinator for the first time, thanks to a generous 4-year grant from
      the Freeman Foundation. Since then, the outreach program has become affiliated
      with the National Consortium for Teaching About Asia (NCTA) as the Arizona
      site for organizing annual professional development seminars in Asian Studies
      for secondary school teachers. The Center's outreach program has also won
      a grant from the Arizona Humanities Council to offer a professional development
      seminar in Asian Humanities in the summer of 2003. The outreach program
      publishes in electronic format the ASU Asian Studies in Arizona (ASU ASIA)
      Newsletter for educators several times each month. The newsletter alerts
      teachers to teaching resources, professional development opportunities,
      and student scholarships. It also provides a forum for intellectual exchange
      and a community network that connects teachers of Asian Studies from across
      the state. A goal of the outreach program is to develop a Curriculum Development
      Resource Library within the Center. The Program for Southeast Asian Studies
      is also actively participating in outreach activities to K-12 and community
      organizations including the Arizona Asian American Association, as well
      as Southeast Asian American communities, city officials, and business communities.
      The Program offers teacher-training workshops, traveling cases of Southeast
      Asian exhibits, cultural ambassadors, and professional growth workshops,
      and regularly sponsors performing arts events, museum exhibits, lectures,
      an annual TET Vietnamese New Year festival, and other cultural events.</p>
    <h5>Center Faculty</h5>
    <p>The Center has 70 affiliated ASU faculty members, all with expertise in
      Asia as a result of research, teaching, or other professional experiences
      related to the region, and with appointments in numerous departments and
      several colleges at ASU. The Center maintains a directory of these affiliates,
      detailing teaching and research interests as well as publications. </p>
    <p>The Center for Asian Research is part of ASU's <a href="http://www.asu.edu/clas" target="new">College
        of Liberal Arts and Sciences.</a></p>
