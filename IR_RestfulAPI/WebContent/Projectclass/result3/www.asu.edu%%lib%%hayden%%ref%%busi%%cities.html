                  <P>This Subject Guide will provide information on cities. While the primary focus is on cities in the United States, cities in other parts of the world are included. For those who are trying to relocate a family or business; to find a job or vacation spot; or to choose a city for a target market, conference site, or research, this guide will help you locate detailed information on cities. Some types of information provided will be on the quality of life, demographics, politics and government, economic conditions, housing, employment and income, climate, education, and crime. This is not intended for those involved in research in urban planning.<BR>

    The subtitle is "A Compilation of Current Information on Economic, Cultural, Geographic, and Social Conditions." It is just that, and very thorough, too. It includes a map, statistics, and addresses and phone numbers for additional information for each city; and a map and brief overview for each state. <BR>

    In this work, cities are grouped by countries within continents, so knowledge of geography is critical. For example, most of the cities of the Middle East are in countries that are considered part of Asia. The information in these encyclopedic style entries is predominantly cultural and political in nature. Country profiles and maps are also included, but there are no statistical tables. The majority of the information provided in this work is from the U.S. Department of State <U>Post Reports</U>, which means that, while useful, it is best used as background information for the general living conditions.<BR>

    Each of the 100 metropolitan areas covered has a short statistical summary and all the critical facts and contacts to make relocation simpler. Each metropolitan area is further divided into its sections/cities/ suburbs/counties. Separate profiles of each section are included. <BR>

    This trade journal is designed for the planning executives of corporations. It has articles, but its value is in the special index found in each issue, the "Free Area Data" section, and the special geographic section. The special indexes are worldwide in scope and cover such items as quality of life, economic development groups, and business/research parks. The "Free Area Data" is a list of agencies and businesses that will provide free detailed local/regional information that is useful for business site selections. The geographic sections can be anything from a detailed look at locating in the area to almost pure advertising/promotions for the area. This journal has changed titles a number of times. The call numbers provided cover all the various title changes.<BR>

    Only the first two volumes, which cover the United States and Canada, have been published. The arrangement is alphabetical by city within each country. The information provided is grouped by "Basic Data," "Location and Topography," "Layout of City and Suburbs," "Environment," "Climate," "Weather," "History," "Chronology," "Historical Landmarks," "Population," "Ethnic Composition," "Government," "Public Finance," "Economy," "Labor," "Education," "Health," "Transportation," "Housing," "Urban Development," "Crime," "Religion," "Media," "Sports," "Arts, Culture, and Tourism," "Parks and Recreation," "Sources of Further Information," "Additional Reading," and a map. The information can cover as few as five pages to over fifteen pages. The preface provides the source used for information in each section. This work provides a balanced picture of the cities included.<BR>

    If you want short, concise information, this is it. Each entry is just over a page long with statistical data about the crime, education, government, health, etc. of the city. A brief paragraph with a little information about the city is included. Major cities within U.S. commonwealths or protectorates are included. A bibliography of the source documents is included. <BR>

    All the guides provide the same categories of information for cities; it is the level of detail that varies. The regional guides provide the least information and cover only the "major" cities. The least information provided is a brief description and history and a list of hotels. Most cities have additional sections on "Restaurants," "Shopping," and "Nightlife." More detailed sections on "When to Go," "How to Get There," "What to Take," "How to Get Around," "Tours," "Sports," "Museums and Sights," and "Special Events," are added for the most important or frequently visited cities. The guides for an individual country will include more of the smaller sized cities. Fodor&thorn;s publishes separate guides to the most important/visited cities of the world. These have a tremendous level of detail for the tourist, but that information can also be useful in deciding what areas you might want to live in, or even if you would want to live there at all!<BR>

    Arranged by state within each region and then by city. The general data for the state is included in the beginning. For each city, a brief description, and lists of "What to See and Do," events, lodging by type, and restaurants. Road maps are included for each state, the larger metropolitan areas, and for airports. Special entries are included for major historic parks/monuments, recreational areas, and airports.<BR>

    This is one of the best travel guides. This provides more little details about the conditions and facts of life in South America than most guides. Arranged by country and then regions, there is an introduction, sections on climate, history, people, government, economy, communications, and music and dance. Imbedded in these written segments are a multitude of statistics. Under each region and city, more area specific information is found on these topics along with the usual tourism information. Additionally, such specifics as road conditions, apartments, film processing, and electronics repair are included. Every country, region and city has at least one map included with the entry. Since this is a British publication, watch out for some differences in terminology and spelling.<BR>

    The first half of this work is all about weather and its terminology. The second half is the weather of selected U.S. cities. Each city has a narrative page and three pages of statistics covering temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, and heating and cooling degree days, which provides an idea of the days that air-conditioning or heating are required. <BR>

    Arranged by state and then the name of the directory, this work provides the name, address, telephone number and a bit about the directory. Many of the directory names begin with a city name. To be thorough, use the keyword index in the back under the city name. The state name is included with the city name in the index to avoid confusion with other places with the same name. A great source for finding the name of cross reference style directories for cities. <BR>

    Covering 183 urban markets as defined by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, this work presents U.S. government data in a more usable format. Each market includes the major economic sectors, data from 1969-1988 in constant dollars, projections for 1995-2000, indexes of change, graphs of some of the data, maps, growth data for 1985-1988, and a summary of the area economics. While somewhat dated by business information standards, this is as up-to-date as possible until the complete release of the data from the 1992 economic censuses in 1996 or 1997.<BR>

    The economic censuses done by the U.S. cover every industry. The geographic volumes are arranged by state, but do have metropolitan area data. The largest metropolitan statistical areas will have the most complete information. The Bureau of the Census must suppress data if an individual company's information could be guessed by providing the information, so smaller cities will have a great deal of information suppressed in many industries. While the information provided in each census varies by the industry, usually the number of establishments, number of employees, sales/value of shipments, payroll and some expenditures are provided. A very good source for an idea of the number of potential competitors or employers an area has.<BR>

    Often referred to as the decennial census, this information is available with a geographic arrangement. Information is available at many geographic levels. For metropolitan areas, the most specific information is at the census block level. The information includes age, income level, occupation, household profile, educational level, racial/ethnic origin, marital status, religion, housing, and more. Population estimates for the years between the censuses are found in many population documents.

    While the national and state level economic indicators information in this work is valuable, more use will be made of the city level data. The information is culled from various U.S. sources, but much of the data is compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Department of Commerce. The time series covered can be as early as 1869, though most city level data starts in the early 1900s or after 1945. Almost all of the city level data is a detailed breakdown of the Consumer Price Index.<BR>

    Very similar to the <A href="#cpi">U.S. Consumer Price Index</A>, this covers 298 metropolitan areas in the United States. Section one is the index of the cost of living in a specific urban area (U.S. total = 100). The index number is also given for grocery items, housing, utilities, transportation, health care, and miscellaneous goods and services. This does NOT correspond to the data put out by the U.S. government because the sources of data and what is included are not identical. This work is also done only in current dollars as a snapshot in time, so cannot be used for inflation or time series analysis. The second section of each issue provides the actual price of a specified unit of goods for each city. This is very helpful to compare what your expenses are now and what they might be in a given city. One major item this work does NOT cover is taxes.<BR>

    This particular economic census focuses on government expenditures at all levels of government. The value of this census to city information is the basic balance sheet information for cities of 10,000+ in population. The information is much less detailed than the annual <U>City Government Finances</U> (Entry 2, this section), but may be the only source of this information for some cities.<BR>

    For those who care about the type of local government and who the major officials are, this work is a guide to the governments of municipalities with populations of 2,500+. Since this is designed for use by the government officials, the most useful information to most other people is the salaries ranges of municipal employees, elected officials and the major department heads; form of governance; names of officials; and the municipal telephone number. Lists of various governance associations are also included.<BR>

    This work is designed for those who need to research the assets and liens that are filed on real or personal property. Most individuals or families are not going to need this work when relocating, but many businesses will find this valuable in researching various properties or partners when planning relocations. This work covers the "4283 jurisdictions in the 50 states" where liens are filed. The jurisdictions covered include cities, counties, towns, parishes, and states. The first few chapters are explanation of how to do asset and lien searches and basic information about the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) and definitions. Several examples in the book are from Arizona.<BR>

    When businesses or individuals are interested in a business or individual as an employer or partner, this county court system of records can be most useful. County courts tend to cover state civil and criminal cases. Some states also have municipal or city courts, which are also included in this work. The work is arranged by state with the first part of each state being an overview of the court structure and a summary of the types of courts and cases heard in each. A listing of state repositories is also included. Individual court information is arranged first by county and then by court or type of case. Information on searches, copies and other fees are included. The Recorder and Assessor addresses are also provided. A city - county cross reference is provided at the end of each state's entry.<BR>

    This book will be more useful to businesses planning to expand or relocate than it will to most individuals planning a move to another city. The first chapter of this book is an overview of the Federal Court System and a how to do legal case research guide. This covers not only the record keeping items like case numbers, but also discusses the various methods of searching. A brief explanation is provided for each of the main electronic searching systems. The actual listing section is arranged by state with a state overview. Each of the courts listed include basic address, telephone, facsimile, and courier information. Also listed are the home county and the counties covered in the jurisdiction. The next section of the entry provides the basics about the indexing and case record information of this court. The last part of each entry is the "Specific Search Information." This covers the four basic methods of searching: Telephone, Mail, In Person, and Electronic Access. The final section is an overview of the National Archives and Records Administration, who is responsible for the long term record keeping of the Federal Court System. Information on how to obtain records from the NARA's Federal Record Centers, as well as the same specifics about each center as is provided for the courts.<BR>

    Some city information is available from various state agencies because the state maintains or coordinates the information statewide. For some businesses, the state regulates them or requires registrations to operate within the state. In these cases, it is the state that often maintains the directory of such businesses. This is a state by state directory of those offices, what they maintain, who is allowed access to the information, and the address, telephone numbers, electronic access information (if available), and hours of operation for each office. The front of the book has a nice explanation of the types of records states usually maintain. <BR>

    A fairly comprehensive list of government sites in the U.S., this covers cities, counties, states, regional, tribal, and multi-state governments. The arrangement by state and then by multi-state agencies makes city sites easier to find. Some business information is kept at the county and state levels rather than by cities, so having these sites listed in one place is very handy. An additional feature is the links to the professional organizations and associations of government, and links to the state agencies of federal programs like the censuses.<BR>
