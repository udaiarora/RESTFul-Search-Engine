What's new with SAS software running under the Windows operating           environments?  Gilmore introduces and clearly explains the exciting NEW
functionality such as the SAS Explorer interface, Output Delivery System   (ODS), Help interface, results window, windowing features, and SAS data
library and file management features.  She also walks you through the      process of editing files, submitting code, printing, adjusting the
windowing environment (colors, fonts, and so on), editing startup files    (CONFIG.SAS and AUTOEXEC.SAS), using batch mode, using DDE and OLE, using
SAS/CONNECT software, plus a whole lot more!  This book is packed with     screen dumps, step-by-step instructions, and clear explanations to help
you find and accomplish each task. Written for every SAS programmer        starting out in the Windows environments!
