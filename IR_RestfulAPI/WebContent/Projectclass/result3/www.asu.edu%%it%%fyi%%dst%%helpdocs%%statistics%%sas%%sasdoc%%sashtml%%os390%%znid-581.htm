<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>batch mode</TD>
<TD align="left">a method of running jobs where jobs are submitted, but not processed immediately.
 You can use batch mode on mainframes and minicomputers as a method of running
SAS programs in which you prepare a file containing SAS statements and any
necessary operating environment control statements. You then submit the file
to the operating environment.  Unlike interactive mode, batch mode does not
require intervention by the user. Execution is completely separate from other
operations at your terminal. Batch mode is sometimes referred to as running
in the background.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">

physical characteristics of an physical file.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>data set</TD>
<TD align="left">under OS/390, a collection of information that the operating environment can
identify and manage as a unit. The term data set under OS/390 corresponds
to file under other operating environments.  In this book, the term physical
file is used to distinguish an OS/390 data set from a SAS data set.
<P>A SAS data library is an physical file whose internal
structure has been specially formatted by SAS. See also partitioned data set
(PDS), SAS data set, sequential data set, and VSAM data set.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>data set label</TD>
<TD align="left">(1) in a SAS data set, a user-defined field that can consist of up to 40 characters.
 It can be used for purposes of documenting the SAS data set. (2) under OS/390,

<TD>DATA step</TD>
<TD align="left">a group of statements in a SAS program that begin with a DATA statement and
end with a RUN statement, another DATA statement, a PROC statement, the end
of the job, or the line after instream input data that contains one or four
semicolon(s).  The DATA step enables you to read raw data or other SAS data
sets and use programming logic to create a SAS data set, write a report, or
write to an external file.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>DD statement</TD>
<TD align="left">a data definition statement that describes an physical file to the operating

<TD align="left">a name defined by a JCL DD statement or a TSO ALLOCATE command.  DDnames can
contain one to eight characters; the first character must be a letter or national
character.  If you allocate a SAS data library externally using a DD statement,
the first time you use the DDname as a libref, SAS assigns it to the library.
 Similarly, if you need to use an external file in a SAS program, you can
allocate the file using a DD statement. In this case, the DDname corresponds
to the fileref for the external file.  See also libref and fileref.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>dialog box</TD>
<TD align="left">a feature of the PMENU facility that appears in response to an action. The

the CANCEL command to exit the dialog box.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>direct access storage device (DASD)</TD>
<TD align="left">a type of I/O device that does not require sequential
access. With direct-access (or disk) storage, you can position anywhere in
a file and read or write without requiring sequential I/O to locate data.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>direct access bound library</TD>
<TD align="left">a random (as opposed to sequential) SAS data library
stored as a regular OS/390 data set. The term "bound" emphasizes
the fact that the library is physically implemented as a single physical file
that contains all of the members of that library. This distinguises direct
access bound libraries from HFS libraries and hiperspace libraries.</TD></TR>

CMS, OS/390, and VSE.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>engine</TD>
<TD align="left">a part of SAS that reads from or writes to a file. Each engine allows SAS
to access files with a particular format.
<P>There are several types of engines. Library engines
control access at the SAS data library level and can be specified on the LIBNAME
statement or LIBNAME function. Native library engines access SAS files created
and maintained by SAS Institute Inc., while interface library engines support
access to other vendors' files, for example, BMDP files.
<P>View engines enable SAS to read SAS data views described
by the SQL procedure (native view) or SAS/ACCESS software (interface view).
You cannot specify a view engine in a LIBNAME statement or LIBNAME function.
See also native engine.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>engine/host option</TD>
<TD align="left">an option that is specified in a LIBNAME statement or LIBNAME function. Engine/host

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>entry type</TD>
<TD align="left">a part of the name for an entry in a SAS catalog that is assigned by SAS to
identify what type of information is stored in the entry. For example, HELP
is the entry type for an entry containing help information for applications
developed with the BUILD procedure in SAS/AF software.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>external file</TD>
<TD align="left">an physical file created and maintained by OS/390 from which you can read
data or stored SAS programming statements or to which you can write procedure
output or output created by PUT statements in a DATA step.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>fileref</TD>
<TD align="left">the name used to identify an external file to SAS.  You assign a fileref with
a FILENAME statement, FILENAME function, or with operating environment control
language.  For example, under OS/390 one way to assign a fileref is through
a DD statement.
<P>Normally, a DDname and a fileref are the same.  The
DDname is how the operating environment references the file; the fileref is
how SAS references the file.  However, under some circumstances, the DDname
used to assign a file is not the same as the name used within SAS.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>format</TD>
<TD align="left">the instructions SAS uses to write each value of a variable. There are two
types of formats: formats supplied by SAS Software and user-written formats

<TD>hiperspace library</TD>
<TD align="left">A SAS hiperspace library is a collection of member files that are loaded into
an OS/390 hiperspace, which consists of virtual storage backed by available
expanded storage. The fact that a hiperspace library consists of a collection
of member files distinguishes the hiperspace library from the single-file
format of direct access bound libraries.</TD></TR>

<TD align="left">the name used to identify a SAS data library to SAS.  You assign a libref
with a LIBNAME statement or LIBNAME function. Also, you can use a TSO ALLOCATE
statement or a JCL DD statement to allocate a data library externally. If
you allocate a data library externally, when you reference the data library
SAS normally assigns a libref that is the same as the DDname. The libref is
the first-level name of a two-level name.  For example, PERM is the libref

the execution of your program.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>SAS procedure output file</TD>
<TD align="left">a file that contains the result of the analysis or the
report produced. Most procedures write output to the procedure output file
by default. DATA step reports that contain the FILE statement with the PRINT
destination also go to this file.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>SAS system option</TD>
<TD align="left">an option that affects the appearance of SAS output, the handling of some
of the files used by SAS, the use of system variables, the processing of observations
in SAS data sets, the features of SAS System initialization, SAS's interface
with your computer hardware, and SAS's interface with the operating environment.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>SASHELP library</TD>
<TD align="left">a SAS data library supplied by SAS software that stores the text for HELP
windows, default function key and window definitions, and menus.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>SASUSER library</TD>
<TD align="left">the SAS data library that contains a profile catalog that stores the tailoring
features you specify for SAS.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>sequential access</TD>
<TD align="left">a method of file access in which the records are read or written one after
the other.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>sequential data set</TD>
<TD align="left">a form of data set organization. A sequential data set consists of blocks
of data only. The data set does not contain any internal information about
how the operating environment is to process the data. Sequential data sets
can exist on disk or tape. Under OS/390, sequential-format SAS data libraries
are sequential data sets. See also data set, partitioned data set (PDS), and
VSAM data set.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>Session Manager</TD>
<TD align="left">an IBM product that enhances TSO on IBM 3270-series and compatible terminals.
Session Manager works by dividing the communication between the terminal and
the host computer into streams. All communications of a particular type belong
to the same stream. For example, all TSO commands, SAS statements, and so
on that you direct toward the computer by pressing ENTER form the TSOIN stream.
All communications from the computer to you including TSO messages, the display
of TSO commands after you enter them, and so on, form the TSOOUT stream. The
division between TSOIN and TSOOUT streams affects the appearance of interactive
SAS sessions under Session Manager.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>site number</TD>
<TD align="left">the number used by SAS Institute to identify the site to which SAS is licensed.
The site number appears near the top of the log in every SAS session.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>SPSS</TD>
<TD align="left">the engine for read-only access to SPSS files.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>statement option</TD>
<TD align="left">an option specified in a given SAS statement that affects only that statement.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>System Management Facility
(SMF)</TD>
<TD align="left">an OS/390 facility that gives information on the resources
the operating environment utilizes when it runs a job.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>task</TD>
<TD align="left">a logical process within SAS. A task can be a procedure or a DATA step, a
window, or a supervisor process.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>temporary SAS data library</TD>
<TD align="left">a library that exists only for the current SAS session
or job. The most common temporary library is the WORK library. See also WORK
data library.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>temporary SAS file</TD>
<TD align="left">a SAS file in a SAS data library (usually the WORK data library) that is deleted
at the end of the SAS session or job.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>terabyte</TD>
<TD align="left">2<SUP>40</SUP> or 1,099,511,627,776 (approximately 1.1 trillion)
bytes.  See also gigabyte, kilobyte, and megabyte.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>transport file</TD>
<TD align="left">a sequential file containing a SAS data library, a SAS catalog, or a SAS data
set in transport format as produced by the CPORT procedure or as written by
the XPORT engine. The format of the transport file produced by the CPORT procedure
is different from the format of the transport file written by the XPORT engine.
You can use transport files to move SAS data libraries, SAS catalogs, and
SAS data sets from one operating environment or host to another.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>UNIX System Services</TD>
<TD align="left">An IBM term used to describe the directory-based hierarchical
file system available under OS/390.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>USER data library</TD>
<TD align="left">a SAS data library associated with the libref USER. When the libref USER is
defined, SAS uses it as the default libref for one-level names.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>view engine</TD>
<TD align="left">See engine.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>VSAM data set</TD>
<TD align="left">a classification that indicates the way the records in a data set are organized.
 VSAM stands for Virtual Storage Access Method and is an IBM data access method
that provides three ways to organize records in a disk file: Entry-Sequenced
Data Set (ESDS), Key-Sequenced Data Set (KSDS), and Relative Record Data Set
(RRDS).  VSAM allows three types of access to records in VSAM files: sequential,
direct, and skip sequential.  See also the entries for data set, partitioned
data set (PDS), and sequential data set.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>VTOC</TD>
<TD align="left">the volume table of contents for a disk. The VTOC contains the name and location
of physical files and, if the VTOC is not indexed, it contains unused space
on the disk.  The VTOC also contains other information about the data sets,
such as date of creation and size.</TD></TR>

<TD>windowing environment</TD>
<TD align="left">See SAS Explorer.</TD></TR>

<TR align=left valign="top">
<TD>WORK data library</TD>
<TD align="left">the temporary SAS data library automatically defined by SAS at the beginning
of each SAS session or job to store temporary SAS files.  When the libref
USER is not defined, SAS uses WORK as the default library for one-level names.</TD></TR>
