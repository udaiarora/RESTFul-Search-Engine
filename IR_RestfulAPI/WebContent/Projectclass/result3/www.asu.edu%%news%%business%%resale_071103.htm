      <h2>Greater Phoenix home sales soar amid war, struggling recovery</h2>
      <p>As the economy was just beginning to show signs of recovery, the Greater
        Phoenix resale housing market rebounded to a frenetic pace during the
        second quarter of 2003. The 7,890 homes recorded sold in June set a monthly
        record, exceeding the previous record of 6,790 homes in April 2002. This
        activity brought the second quarter resale market to a quarterly record
        of 19,845 sales - well ahead of the previous 17,555 sales record set
        in 2001. By the end of the second quarter, the year-to-date sales total
        stood at 34,880, compared to 29,980 for YTD 2002 and 30,825 for YTD 2001.</p>
      <p>"This
        recording activity represents the end point of a decision-making process
        that probably began in late 2002 or early 2003," said Jay Q.
        Butler, director of the Arizona Real Estate Center. "Even with the weak
        economy and concerns about the war in Iraq, low mortgage rates spurred
        the continued strength of the housing market, demonstrating that people
        retained confidence in their live-in investment."</p>
      <p>The median home price
        was $155,000, compared to $158,750 for the previous quarter and $144,000
        in second quarter 2002. "Since the Greater Phoenix
        area is so large, the median price can range significantly from $365,000
        in North Scottsdale to $89,750 in the central western areas of the city
        of Phoenix," Butler noted.</p>
      <p>Following a pattern comparable to the single-family
        market, the resale townhouse/condominium housing sector set a quarterly
        record of 4,165
        sales; the previous record of 3,685 units was set in second quarter 2002.
        For YTD 2003 the activity stands at 7,380 units, up from 6,660 homes
        for YTD 2002. As a source of affordable housing and investment opportunities,
        the median price strongly increased from last year's $95,700 to the current
        $103,375. This market can also have significant range in median prices,
        from $166,450 in North Scottsdale to $88,700 in North Mesa. </p>
      <p>The median
        square footage for a single-family home recorded sold in second quarter
        2003 was 1,670, larger than the 1,640 square feet reported a
        year ago. In the townhouse/condominium sector, the median square footage
        was 1,175, up from 1,170 square feet reported a year ago.</p>
      <p>&middot; 
        Since second quarter 2002, recorded sales in the city of Phoenix increased
        from 5,080 to 5,410 sales, while the median sales price increased to
        $127,930 from $118,000. Since Phoenix is a geographically large city,
        the median prices can range significantly such as $83,950 in the Sky
        Harbor area to $194,000 in the Union Hills area. The townhouse/condominium
        sector increased from 965 to 1,045 sales, while the median price increased
