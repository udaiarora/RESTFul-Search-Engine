<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><B>Generate the vertical bar chart of production
for each country.</B>GROUP= groups the bars by country. PATTERNID= assigns
patterns by group value. SHAPE= assigns the bar shape. OUTSIDE= displays the
SUM statistic above the bars. RAXIS= assigns the AXIS statement that removes
all exis elements. GAXIS= assigns the AXIS statement that removes the label.
HTML= specifies TYPEDRILL as the variable that contains the targets for the
bars. NAME= specifies the name of the catalog entry. The graphics catalog
entry name increments so the GIF files are named sequentially from COUNTRY
to COUNTRY4. The DES= option specifies a general description that appears
in the table of contents for all five graphs.
