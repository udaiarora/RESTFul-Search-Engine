<P><A name="z0781384">&#13;Cutting planes provide slices of your data...slicing the data
as if with a knife.  With cutting planes, you can investigate response values
visually slice by slice, as you increment, decrement, or randomly select a
position. The face of each slice is colored according to the response values.
 SAS/SPECTRAVIEW provides: </A>
<P>
<UL>

<LI>three axis cutting planes that cut perpendicular
to the X, Y, or Z axis, which display in the Volume
window. In addition, you can display two- and three-dimensional surface views
of the data (such as surfaces, charts, and plots), showing the values at each
location along the specified axis, which display in the surface windows.<P>

<LI>one NOR cutting plane (non-orthogonal), meaning
that the plane is not perpendicular to any axis, which displays in the Volume window.<P>

<P>The three axis cutting planes cut perpendicular to the
X, Y, or Z axis. For example, the Y cutting plane lies parallel to the XZ
plane and perpendicular to the Y axis. An axis cutting plane can be displayed
in either block contour format (solid-block) or line contour format (continuous
lines). To display an axis cutting plane in the Volume
window: 
<OL START="1" type="1">
<LI>Select [<SMALL><B>Tools</B></SMALL>], then [<SMALL><B>Planes</B></SMALL>].
<P>The three axis cutting planes are labeled with
the variable
names you specified for the X, Y, and Z axes.  For example, using the MORTGAGE
data set and specifying RATE as the X variable, AMOUNT as the Y variable,
and YEARS as the Z variable, results in the axis cutting planes: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>[<SMALL><B>AMOUNT
Plane =></B></SMALL>]<P>

<LI>[<SMALL><B>RATE Plane =></B></SMALL>]<P>

<P>The labels for the axis cutting planes also contain
a 


<CODE><B>=></B></CODE> symbol indicating that the button is a <B>pull-down button</B>,
which means that pressing the button will display a menu of choices.<P>

<LI>Position the cursor on the pull-down button representing
the axis cutting plane you want to display, then press and hold down the left
mouse button to display a menu of choices.  <B>The additional buttons are

<DL>
<DT>[<SMALL><B>Block contour w/</B></SMALL>]</DT>

blocks, because each block represents one data point in the current plane.<P></DD>

<DT>[<SMALL><B>Line contour w/</B></SMALL>]</DT>

grid intersection to be displayed, which may not exist for sparse data.<P></DD>

 You can display more than one cutting plane at a time in
the Volume window, up to the four types. <B>If there is no data
for the cutting plane's current location, the cutting plane will not display,
unless you have assigned color to missing values.</B>
<P>In the following example, which uses the MORTGAGE data
set, the response values (for PAYMENT) are displayed against the Z cutting
plane by selecting [<SMALL><B>YEARS Plane=></B></SMALL>] then [<SMALL><B>Block contour
w/</B></SMALL>]. The cutting plane shows the impact of varying interest rate and
loan amounts for a given year.  That is, the year is held constant and the
impact of the other two variables on the payment amount is shown. You can
move the cutting plane over the range of years to examine other combinations
based on a given year value.
