	    <p><strong>Professor Miki Caul Kittilson</strong> published Challenging Parties, <em>Changing Parliaments: Women and Elected Office in Contemporary Western Europe</em> with Ohio State University Press in 2006 within their Parliaments and Legislatures series.  The book provides systematic cross-national evidence to show that political parties are the key mechanism for increasing women&rsquo;s parliamentary representation. Drawing on new theory and new data, Kittilson uncovers party-level mechanisms that explain the growth in women&rsquo;s parliamentary participation since the 1970s in 10 European democracies.</p>
		 <p><strong>Professor Valerie Hoekstra</strong> is examining the role of political uncertainty and larger reform efforts on legislative reforms to the selection, retention and tenure of Supreme Court judges (1850-2000). The project is supported by a grant from The National Science Foundation (SES 0550434). Professor Hoekstra analyzes state legislative decisions to alter the selection, retention and tenure of high court judges from 1850 to 2000. This encompasses changes from appointive systems to elective systems, partisan to nonpartisan elections, and elective to merit selection systems. While there are numerous historical descriptions of these changes and normative arguments as to the ideal way to select judges, there are few systematic, theoretically motivated, longitudinal studies these reforms. The main puzzle this research seeks to address is why legislators have been willing to limit their own control over judicial institutions and grant judges greater autonomy. After all, judges who have greater independence from the legislature are more likely to overturn the legislature&rsquo;s policies. The research design employs pooled cross-sectional time series and event history models of reforms to judicial selection, retention and tenure from 1850 to 2000. In addition, the research also incorporates historical media accounts, legislative histories, and roll call votes to provide rich detail and complement and supplement the statistical analyses.</p>
		 <p><strong>Professor Carolyn Warner</strong> has just published a book with Cornell University Press titled <em>The Best System Money Can Buy: Corruption in the European Union</em>. This provocative work exposes and analyses the unexpected connections between increased competition and corruption. The book includes studies of how and why free trade, decentralization, privatization, export promotion and campaign finance regulations can lead to corruption, even in the advanced, post-industrial democracies of Western Europe.</p>
		 <p>Professors <strong>Kim Fridkin</strong> and <strong>Patrick Kenney</strong>, via funding from ASU&rsquo;s ISSR, have joined a 30 university research team exploring the 2006 midterm elections. The study involves 30 different research designs and samples as many as 30,000 voters. This is the most comprehensive data collection effort ever attempted of midterm voters. Professors Fridkin and Kenney are examining how candidates&rsquo; personal traits and citizens&rsquo; perceived affective feelings toward candidates alter voting behavior. In addition, the ASU component of the study is attempting to measure citizens&rsquo; propensity to absorb, accept, and react to negative campaign messages.</p>
		 <p><strong>Professor Sheldon Simon</strong> and Professor Linell Cady, from Religions Studies, have co-edited a book titled <em>Religion and Conflict in South and Southeast Asia: Disrupting Violence</em> with Routledge press. The book assesses the nature of religiously inflected violence in these two regions with both American and Asian scholars as authors. The chapters also suggest strategies that have been used and might be employed in the future to reduce violence in the countries studied.</p>
