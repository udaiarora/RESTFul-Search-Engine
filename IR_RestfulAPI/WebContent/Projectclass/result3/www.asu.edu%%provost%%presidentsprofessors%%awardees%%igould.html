He gets rave reviews from  students for his ability to help them understand organic chemistry, yet  he has a worldwide reputation for his research into the interaction of  light and matter. He has 10 patents and more than 100 publications in  peer-reviewed journals, yet is known for the generous amounts of time  he spends helping students outside class. </p>	    <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Gould clearly has a natural gift for lecturing, but his talents go much  beyond this aspect of teaching,&rdquo; says Robert Blankenship, chemistry  department chair. &ldquo;He truly cares that the students learn and is  willing to put in enormous amounts of time with them, both in larger  groups and one-on-one. He has an amazing ability to synthesize  disparate information and present it in a clear and uncluttered way,  while not sacrificing rigor.&rdquo; </p>	    <p><a href="../index.html"><em>Return to home page</em></a></p>      <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->    <div class="footer"> <p><a href="http://www.asu.edu/provost">Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University</a><br>      Location: ASU Fulton Center, Suite 420, 300 E.
