						<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="5" color="black">Absence Attendance reporting</font></p>
						</b></font><i>
						<p>PURPOSE</i>: to report time used for absences against employee's time balances. (HRMS Inquiry - Screen 025).<br>
						Absence reports are generated every payroll processing period. An employee must be benefits eligible to earn sick time and vacation time.</p>
						<b>
						<p>SICK</b> time is accrued at 4.00 hours per pay period for a 100% FTE benefits eligible employee. <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/index.html">See SPP 700 - Leaves</a>.</p>
						<b>
						<p>VACATION</b> time is accrued based on the employee type and the length of time the employee has been benefits eligible. . <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/index.html">See SPP 700 - Leaves</a></p>
						<b>
						<p>COMPENSATORY </b>time is time earned in lieu of overtime paid. See <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/index.html">SPP 400 - Overtime</a> General Policy. This policy applies to all non-exempt employees. An Hours Adjustment form is used to create/populate the employee's compensatory time balance for later use. You can find an <a href="/hr/forms/index.html">Hours Adjustment form</a> on the Human Resources web site</p>
						<b>
						<p>How do I complete an Absence Report?</p>
						</b>
						<p>We'll tell you...a person who works full time and is benefits eligible accrues vacation and sick time hours to be used as needed or requested. There are policies and procedures that apply to Leave time and you can find them on the Human Resources web site <a href="http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/spp/index.html">See SPP 700 - Leaves</a>.</p>
						<p>These policies and procedures are important to follow when administering leave time for benefits eligible employees. Think of the Absence Report as a time card. Leave time is input as an exception to regular time, therefore it overrides the regular time hours and posts to the employee's payroll file.</p>
						<p>Sick or Vacation Time is reported in the pay period following the absence. This is because the University pays their employees to date. (This applies to salaried employees only, hourly employees are paid on a lagging biweekly payroll schedule and do not accrue leave time)</p>
						<p>Absence Reports are generated with an accrual report during each Semi Monthly payroll cycle. This report shows the employee's accrual rate, activity against the employee's balances and the accrued time earned during the last pay period. The far right column shows the time balances available. If you have access to HRMS you can INQUIRE on screen 025 - Time Balances. This screen shows current time balances as of the last pay period and <b>does not</b> <b>include time that was <u>used </u>during the last pay period.</p>
						</b><i>
						<p>* <font color="#ff0000">Special attention needs to be paid to the number of work days/work hours in the current pay period vs. the number of hours that need to be reported and the percentage FTE that an employee works.</p>
						</font><b><font color="#800080">
						<p>Frequently Asked Questions<br>
						</b></i></font>What if the employee doesn't have enough time to cover the absence?</p>
						<i>
						<p>Issue a </i><a href="/hr/forms/index.html">Reduction in Pay form</a><i>.</p>
						</i>
						<p>What if I didn't turn in my absence reports from the last pay period?</p>
						<i>
						<p>Submit those hours on an Hours Adjustment form. Combining hours could result in an overpayment. Submit the current Absence Report and check </i>your<font size="2"> </font><a href="/hr/calendars/index.html">payroll calendar</a><i> regularly.</p>
						</i>
						<p>I have an employee who wants to have their pay reduced instead of charging time against their vacation balance, what do I do?</p>
						<i>
						<p>Refer to policy on that one, some departments have their own policy when it comes to reduction in pay versus using time accrued.</p>
						</i>
						<p>How can I tell how many hours there are in a current pay period?</p>
						<i>
						<p>In order to know the number of working days in a current pay period, look at the payroll calendar (or any calendar) and count the number of working days in the current pay period. Multiply by 8 (for 100% FTE) and you will get the number of work hours that will be paid in the current pay period. Anything over the current hours must be processed on an Hours Adjustment Form to avoid overpayment.</i></p>
						<p>If you have an employee who works less than 100 % FTE, multiply the 100% total work hours by the percentage FTE the employee works. You should get the number of regular hours that will be paid to that employee in the current pay period</td>
