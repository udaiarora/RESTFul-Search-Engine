<p><b>1</b>. <b>Call to Order.</b>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting was called to order by Senate President


David Burstein, at 3:20 p.m.


<p><b>2. Approval of Previous Minutes. (November 8, 1999).</b>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minutes of November 8, 1999 were approved as


distributed (by email, campus mail and on the Academic Senate web page).


<p><b>3. Announcements and Communications.</b>


<p><b>3.A. Senate President's Report </b>(David Burstein)<b>.</b>


<p>Several things of note are happening on campus:


<p>1) How toadjudicate Arizona Supreme Court ruling on how we conduct administrative


hearings. I have read over a copy of that ruling provided to me by Paul


Ward, our General Counsel. I have also read over the Arizona Revised Statue


that applies in this situation. The bad side is that it may be that the


right of counsel and the right of subpoena applies to all hearings within


the university that are heard by any administrator. As we become a more


democratic university, many of the hearings that would normally be decided


by an administrator alone are being heard by committee--that includes parking


citations, grade challenges by students--in all there are somewhere between


50-70 hearing bodies in the University. Your faculty leadership has been


discussing this situation (Past Presidents meeting last week, in our last


Executive Committee meeting, today in this Senate meeting, and on Wednesday,


December 8 by the three Universities' General Counsels.) Where we go from


here is not clear. One possibility is to draft a piece of legislation,


which the legislature must then pass saying that they didn't mean the statute


to go as deep into the university as it might--that we can limit this decision


by the Supreme court to those hearings that affect faculty directly in


terms of salaries and or job, and similarly for staff. If this happens


we will probably have the best we can do out of this situation.


<p>2) As I report in the December <i>Newsletter</i>, one of the items still


before the Board of Regents is learner-centered education. In the December


<i>Newsletter,


</i>I add the definition of learner-center education that the Arizona Faculties


Council and the three provosts of the three universities developed together.


As the Regents have accepted this definition, we could go in several directions


from here. One direction is defining those current regulations and practices


from the University, the Regents and the Legislature, that a learner-centered


education might come into conflict with. Another way to go is to define


those parts of the University right now that are really working under the


definition of learner-centered education. I have long had a suspicion that


in the fine arts, in architecture, and in other areas, by definition you


have a learner-centered environment. Third and last would be that if we


want to change the rest of the University into a learner-centered environment,


how much would that really cost? For example, if I wanted to teach in this


classroom (JWSCB 210) in collaborative groups, this classroom is not set


up for that type of activity. Coupled with this is that under learner-centered


education is a definition that we would normally call "flexible scheduling."


In the December <i>Newsletter</i>, I have asked for a call from the faculty


on the experiences that they have had in terms of teaching either a summer


session 5-week, a summer session 8-week, or a winter session 3-week course


that is the same as what they would normally teach in a 16-week session.


Each of those courses is normally taught for 45 hours. Do you as faculty,


who have done that, think students are getting the same quality education


that you can give them in 16 weeks, in 3 weeks, 5 weeks, or 8 weeks given


the same amount of time? We could probably have a reasonable debate over


what can be done about that and in which disciplines it can be done.


<p>As a bit of bookkeeping--it is probably a change in the way that many


of us have operated in our careers--Senate minutes and agendas will no


longer be sent in paper copies. They will be posted on the Academic Senate


Web Page. This is one of many different ways we are becoming more of an


electronic university than a paper university. If there are senators who


cannot easily access a browser on the web, please let Darby Shaw know (965-9245;


darby.shaw@asu.edu) and we will supply you with a written copy.


<p><b>Senator:</b> Will the agenda be distributed the day of the meeting


in paper format?


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> The agenda and the minutes will be


posted a week before the meeting.


<p><b>Senator:</b> Then we should print them out and bring them to the


meeting?


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> That would be desirable. They will


also be sent by email note as well as being posted on the Senate's web


page.


<p>We in the faculty leadership and Jim Grone in the staff leadership--and


I feel that I can speak for our sister campuses at West and East--have


come to realize that the only way we in the university system are going


to be treated by the Legislature in a way that we feel we have the right


to be treated is to have a Legislature that is reasonably knowledgeable


about the university. Many legislators are not, and they have illustrated


that in a number of ways in their public statements.


<p><b>3.C University President's Report</b> (Lattie Coor).


<p>I have come to report on several items that I raised with you at the


beginning of the semester. First, the Governor's Task Force on Education


is now in place and underway. There are five members of the higher education


community serving on that task force; the three university presidents and


two Regents (Don Ulrich and Chris Herstam). The Community College sector


is similarly represented, three presidents and two directors of the Community


College Board. The representatives of the privates and not-for-profit sector


(a representative of the Governor's Office, Jaime Malero, as well as four


representatives from the business community sector). Valuably, I think


the representatives of that last sector also have been serving on a committee


that the greater Phoenix leadership put together a few months ago, looking


at the place universities should play and positioning Arizona for the new


economy of the future. The agenda for this Governor's task force (that


has now had two meetings and will meet on a monthly basis through July)


has a goal of a preliminary report in July and a final report in October.


This committee will also shape the Governor's agenda for the next Biennial


session, which begins January, 2001. These are two major foci to date,


and I think they will endure. One is the question of enrollment demand--growth


in the future--and how well Arizona's universities are positioned to meet


that goal (AZ universities, community colleges and the private sector).


The second is the role that should be played by Arizona's higher education


sector in the economy of the future. We have had preliminary discussions


on enrollment growth and we will have a full display of those data at our


meeting on December 15. From all we know now, those data will suggest an


increasing, fairly strong, growth in student demand for the three universities,


the community colleges as well as continuing growth in the profit and not-for-profit


sector.


<p>In January and February, we will return to the question of positioning


these universities in terms of their research, their technology transfer,


in terms of Arizona's work force development for the knowledge-based economy


of the future. I think there are a number of very promising things which


are coming together. It is a place where the universities can be particularly


forceful in showing the essential nature of investing in these institutions


of the future, moving it from the kind of incremental approach to a more


fundamental investment approach that needs to take place. I hope this will


build a case that will be strongly endorsed by all the sectors, including


corporate and state leadership as we move to the final report in October,


2000. As always, there are unpredictable natures to these endeavors. As


I said at the beginning of the semester, the community college and university


people will be at the table together, rather than constitute a totally


independent body to report to us what they thought the future should be.


There will be a Town Hall focusing on Arizona higher education in May,


and the work of this task force will be the major source for that Town


Hall. The Town Hall is drawn on a statewide basis and the Governor usually


makes the keynote address. The keynote address we hope will draw from the


work of this task force.


<p>Secondly, I will turn again to the capital campaign that we have underway.


I can report that we hope to show the world in a fairly sort of animated


way that we not only have crossed the 300 million dollar mark, we actually


(as we reported in October we were at 314 million dollars) are about to


cross the 325 million dollar mark on our way to the goal of 400 million


dollars, in the remaining one and one-half years.


<p>We will have further announcements on this, but in the Spring semester


we will undertake a campus-based campaign. It will be done in a way that


is totally at the discretion of the individual. There has been a great


deal of work done on this in the Fall semester.


<p>I want to thank your leadership, David Burstein and Doug Johnson, on


several items that David has mentioned today. I think the learner-centered


education issue is a perfect case in point. You will recall the level of


concern all of us had three or four years ago, when the Regents first started


talking about tenure--in fact some of them recommended eliminating tenure.


We began a conversation that enabled us to get everyone, led by the faculty,


into the center of that discussion. I think that the product of that discussion,


the post-tenure review guidelines, was a valuable outcome for all parties.


That was put together with substantial faculty leadership. Similarly, there


was a sense when the discussion of learner-centered education began, that


universities had not discovered it and something ought to be done to move


forward. As David reported to you that at the last Regent's meeting, with


the faculty leadership playing the lead role in defining what should be


done (and that was based on a superb presentation to the Regents in September


and in the month before that) about the nature of what was being done on


the campuses already. Chuck Bantz and a series of colleagues really displayed


the amount of work we are already doing, and how one goes about or how


one should go about putting that into context in a very large and complex


instructional world. In the end, we have the issue where it should be with


faculty and administrative leadership playing a major role with the Regents


in shaping that endeavor and positioning it in such a way that all students,


faculty, staff and others can play a role in it. My thanks for your continuing


work there.


<p>We have a major task to do now in figuring out what to do with this


important ruling from the AZ Supreme Court on compelling counsel in hearings.


As Dr. Burstein described to you, if it were uniformly applied to absolutely


everything it would be almost unmanageable. I think we are sorting through


it in a useful way now. I thank you for your continuing participation and


I thank the leadership of the Senate for all that it has done. I wish all


of you the best for the holidays as we move through the white-knuckle period


into the finals and the end of the semester. I look forward to rejoining


you again with the opening of the Academic Assembly Breakfast in January.


<p><b>3.D ASASU President's Report</b> (Jenny Holsman).


<p>The Student Regent position is going to be from ASU next year and we


are responsible for selecting the nominees who will be confirmed by the


state Arizona Students Association and appointed by our Governor. Applications


are out and due back by February 8. We will begin the first part of the


selection process through the ASU selection committee, and the process


will continue on to the statewide association committee before being nominated


to the Governor for appointment.


<p>Last week we participated in a Student Safety Walk and just a few weeks


ago there was a Campus Safety Walk. This time we targeted the unlit parts


of campus and areas that needed more telephones. We will be suggesting


some of the ideas that the students have to make sure that the campus is


safe for students, faculty and staff in the night hours.


<p>Tomorrow we will make a proposal that ASASU will be a student (primary)


sponsor of a new Childcare Services Program which will provide by the year


2003, 1,000-1,200 new childcare spots. This childcare and home care provider


service will be utilized by all ASU employees and students. It will be


for infant and toddler childcare and will focus on non-traditional childcare


(before 6:00 a.m. and after 6:00 p.m.). It will be good for those who have


night classes and have to leave early in the morning. It will begin shortly


after January and will be a great opportunity for those that have children.


<p>I sent out an email to the faculty and staff about the Who's Who Among


American College and Universities Students. I thank those who chose to


nominate their students. We selected about 35 students to represent ASU


this year in that national publication. I appreciate your support in this


award program.


<p>Teacher Evaluation Program surveys were sent out to instructors of 300


classes (General Studies 100 and 200 level courses are involved). This


is our pilot number this fall. We will do 700 classes in spring. We will


be collecting the surveys next week on Wednesday and Thursday from the


departments and then giving the survey forms to IT in order to have the


data back as soon as possible to make sure the program is being adequately


used.


<p><b>Senator Thieme:</b> A couple of inquiries in my department were sent


last year to evaluate teaching assistants. We have found that evaluating


teaching assistants may not be a good idea. Do you plan to do something


about this for spring?


<p><b>Jenny Holsman:</b> We did try to make sure and worked with IT to


make sure these teaching assistants (as a category) were not listed in


the database that we receive from IT, and we will continue to talk with


them to make sure that this does not happen. We have retrieved those survey


forms distributed to teaching assistants and they will not be evaluated


in the pilot program.


<p>I wish you all the best and Happy Holidays.


<p><b>3.E Senate President-Elect's Report</b> (Doug Johnson).


<p>I am glad to be here today as I have been working with the Governor's


Task Force on Higher Education workgroup downtown now for several Monday


afternoons during our Senate meetings. Many people are on this workgroup


from the universities, the community colleges and the private sector, and


as President Coor explained, the forecast is for continuing growth. The


question is, how fast will it happen? We are enjoying a very robust economy


and growth in the state, which at least in the near term seems likely to


stay strong.


<p>The process of attending Board of Regents meetings has also been a very


interesting experience for me. I think I want to say that I am pleased


that the conversation at those meetings because they begin with "What are


<u>we</u>


going to do now?"


<p>The inclusion of faculty in that process is very real, and we now have


the responsibility of fulfilling our side of that bargain and being a contributor


to providing an educational system that meets the needs of the state in


the near future.


<p>On the political area, Dr. Burstein said there is business for us to


attend to and as we reflect on what has happened over the last few years,


the legislative coffees have been a great success. Over 400 faculty who


volunteered to be involved in that process. Unfortunately, not all of those


400 people actually attended coffees or were as active as they indicated


they might want to be. What we envisioned was a more systematic way to


provide faculty input into the legislative process. It is not as simple


as having every faculty member call his or her legislator, but that may


not be a bad place to start.


<p><b>3.F ASU West Senate Report</b> (Jane Carey).


<p>I want to thank Al Poskanzer and Nancy Gutierrez who came to our Executive


Committee meeting on Wednesday to answer our questions about the Intellectual


Property Policy that is currently being considered. We are still thinking


about this policy but will wait until the main Senate considers it and


try to bring it to the West Senate at the same time. We have not tabled


it, but we will wait.


<p>We held a debate at our last Senate meeting, and it was lively and interactive.


The topic of debate was the integration of scholarship, teaching and service.


Some interesting questions came out of that debate and as a result, in


the January Executive Committee meeting, we will bring in a past chair


of the campus level promotion and tenure committee, the academic senior


officer under the provost who has personnel duties and our Personnel Committee.


We will try to frame looking at campus level promotion and tenure criteria


and even process perhaps. We are currently reviewing what the <i>ACD Manual</i>


says about promotion and tenure, which just seems to say, "excellence,


excellence, excellence." It takes a minimalist approach and we as a faculty


want to take some of the hallmarks that ASU West sees for itself and incorporate


them into the criteria for West's promotion and tenure process. At least


we can begin to acknowledge and recognize the work that is being done that


is a little bit different from the traditional three categories.


<p>The third thing is (from the AFC as well)--Vince Waldron, our President-elect


and I are developing a model for learner-centered education (Don Ulrich


at the last Board of Regents meeting asked for a model. He said "I can


get the definition but I really can't get my mind around this thing; what


I would like to see are some models of how this works.") Vince and I volunteered.


We want to first and foremost keep rigor in our model and like cooking,


it takes some time and assimilation. Although we might accelerate the process,


it still will take--as it does with students--time to assimilate the knowledge.


<p><b>3.G East Senate Report</b> (Andy Jackson).


<p>As an update, our current Assembly President announced his retirement


before December 31. I will be taking over at that time. Our last meeting


of the Academic Assembly for this term is set for this Thursday, December


9, at 10:30 a.m. in the Technology Center. Faculty from main campus are


invited to attend our meetings and Dr. Burstein plans to be there. We have


two issues of primary concern to deal with at that meeting 1) the constitution


and bylaws amendments are to be considered for a second reading and 2)


policies and procedures governance course approval procedure for our East


CAPC committee process comes for a first reading. The other item I will


mention is that I am on a campus committee to look at work life task force


issues for the campus. This is unrelated to the administration; however,


it will effect most of us in this room in one form or another. The committee


is preparing a survey that will be distributed through the internal system


on a randomly selected process. We will solicit input from students, faculty


and staff in that survey. It will be in your mailbox by early January and


we hope to get the data compiled by the end of January.


<p><b>3.H Faculty Athletic Representative's Report</b> (Jerry Kingston).


<p>My first report relates to the NCAA certification process, which has


been initiated again on our campus. Milton Sommerfeld chairs that committee


and is present to answer questions today. The NCAA voted in the certification


process in 1990. ASU was the first school to be certified by that program


across all of Division I Athletics in 1994. At the time the program was


enacted, it was envisioned that the certification cycle would be once every


ten years. What really happened is that during the first four years a number


of Division I institutions had to develop corrective action plans in the


area of gender and minority equity and they were quite worried about waiting


ten more years to follow up on these areas. The association voted to put


in another round at the end of five years. Therefore, we are again involved


in a NCAA certification effort. A steering committee was appointed by President


Coor last summer and they began working this fall. The same four subcommittees


were used (academic integrity, fiscal integrity, commitment to rules compliance


and the subcommittee dealing with gender, minority and student welfare


issues) and are all working on the campus again. There are about 46 people


working on the steering committee, reaching across faculty, staff and students.


Those subcommittee reports are nearly completed, and we will have the word


out within the next ten days to two weeks about where those reports may


be accessed on the world wide web. That information will then be sent off


to the NCAA committee on athletics certification. They will review that


information but also plan to send a peer review team on our campus during


the third week of April. We will have a NCAA committee on campus talking


to a number of individuals, and they will have reviewed our institutional


self-study, including any plans we formulate for corrective action. Then


following that visit, the peer review team will make a report to the Athletic


Certification Committee in the fall. We would hope that again that ASU


would be certified by the NCAA Committee on Athletic Certification sometime


late in the fall of 2000.


<p>The Athletics Board and the Subcommittee on Academic Integrity have


been working on a review on the academic services within the Athletics


Department. This is timely because it is required within the NCAA; it is


an issue that came up during the work of the Academic Integrity Subcommittee.


A number of faculty have mentioned to me and to members of the athletics


board, their concerns about reports that have come out at the University


of Minnesota, the University of Tennessee and other areas about academic


problems that have occurred in the athletics program there. I want to take


this opportunity to indicate to you that we (ASU) do not assign any academic


sports staff to individual sports teams. That was the problem at Minnesota.


Secondly, we tend to turn over the academic tutors about every three years


and at the institutions that have been reporting serious problems, there


seemed to be an entrenched academic support staff assigned to individual


sports programs and that is when those problems seem to have occurred.


We simply have not structured our program in that way. We are also looking


at ways to find better academic support. This last fall, I emphasized to


the Athletics Department and in my communications to the faculty that the


first line of support for student athletes that are having academic problems


should be the faculty or a teaching assistant, and not necessarily the


tutors that are hired by the Athletics Department. I am trying to find


additional ways to bridge that gap between the faculty and the athletics


support group within athletics. We will continue to work on that during


the course of the year.


<p>The annual report of the Athletics Representative was shared with the


Senate and reviewed at this meeting. If a copy is needed by those who were


not present, please contact the Academic Senate Office (Darby Shaw 965-9245vm)


or Dr. Jerry Kingston (965-7457). His office is in the Agriculture Building


on campus.


<p><b>Senator Mayer: </b>Are students who transfer in to ASU included in


the preparation data?


<p><b>Dr. Kingston:</b> No. Those are only for freshman and similarly the


graduation rate is reported only for recruited student athletes who enter


as freshman.


<p><b>Senator:</b> Do you have any idea as to the number of recruited student


athletes involved?


<p><b>Dr. Kingston</b>: The number of recruited student athletes upon which


the total numbers are based each year varies between 60 and 75, sometimes


as many as 80. Some years in the earlier part of the four-year average


are smaller, because we are under restrictions from the PAC-10 as to the


number of scholarships we could offer in the sport of track and because


you can offer partial scholarships--that can significantly impact the numbers


of students--and they would even be included in these numbers.


<p><b>4. Open Forum.</b>


<p>Senate President Burstein responded to a letter from one of the senators


regarding the question of retirees who retired before 1998 not being included


in the accrual of sick leave policy. The legislature did not grandfather


in anyone who retired before that time.


<p><b>Senator Solis:</b> May we also hear about progress on the Health


Issues Committee?


<p><b>Senator Rose:</b> There has been some progress but not as much as


we would have liked. The questionnaire that went out last year had a number


of problems because of the way in which it was done by a research staff


person who has since left the university, and we are going to have to re-survey


the faculty, academic professionals and service professionals because of


the response rate and inability to follow up. We will not have to do that


with the classified staff. I think that the way we are doing it this time,


the Human Resources staff is getting a lot of expert help within the university


from University Evaluation, we will hopefully get a lot better information.


We can then come to some conclusions that are not necessarily derived from


the data but are reinforced by the data.


<p><b>Senator O'Grady: </b>Have any <i>Newsletters </i>been published this


semester?


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> Yes, in September, October, and December.


<p><b>Senator O'Grady: </b>Has my department gotten any of those?


<p><b>Darby Shaw:</b> I will forward your question to Kathie Freiday who


mails them out to the departments (Ans: The Department of Computer Science


currently receives 29 copies.)


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> The <i>Newsletters</i> are all posted


on the Academic Senate Web Page at this time: <u><font color="#0000FF">http://www.asu.edu/provost/asenate</font></u>


<p><b>5. Unfinished Business</b> (Motions for Second Readings).


<p><b>5.A Executive Committee</b> (David Burstein).


<p><b>5.A.1 Senate Motion #4</b> (1999-2000) was tabled by the Executive


Committee on November 29, 1999. It was a motion dealing with the ASU Intellectual


Property Implementation Policy. Most of that policy concerns what you do


if an inventor disagrees with a university decision in which the Intellectual


Property Committee acts as a hearing committee. We model the hearing process


after the current Senate hearing processes. Rather than have you vote and


debate on the new policy and then have to bring it to you again in 3-4


months to vote on it again, we felt the best option was to table it and


bring it to you for a second reading once it is revised to conform to the


new Arizona Supreme Court ruling.


<p><b>5.B Curriculum and Academic Programs Committee</b> (Jack Fouquette).


<p>All items considered at this meeting have been posted along with the


agenda on the Academic Senate Web Page: <u><font color="#0000FF">http://www.asu.edu/provost/asenate/agen120699.htm</font></u>


(copies may also be obtained from the Academic Senate Office by calling


965-9245.)


<p><b>5.B.1 Senate Motion #1</b> <b>(1999-2000),</b> <b>a request from


College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to disestablish the Bachelor of Science


in History</b>, which was tabled until December 6 at the last Senate meeting.


<p>I would ask that those senators with questions please address them to


the members of the History Department that are present today.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> The senator who asked that question


is not here today.


<p><b>Senator Landers:</b> The question was, why are they eliminating this


degree?


<p><b>Senator Fouquette: </b>The question raised by Senator Jacob was,


Is the History Department doing this because of the elimination of the


more social science based aspects--did this mean that the History Department


was moving toward more of a humanities rather than a social science base?


<p><b>Noel Stowe</b> (History Department): The short answer to that question


is, no. It was not a momentary thing. All we are doing is returning to


the previous situation of having the BA degree only within the Liberal


Arts and Sciences.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein</b>: Did you find there were not many students


in the program?


<p><b>Noel Stowe:</b> There were almost no students in the program. In


the Fall no new students signed up, so we decided to drop it.


<p><b>Len Gordon:</b> There is a historical note to that. When the program


was instituted, we did not have a poly-sci second language requirement,


because that was the major difference between the BS and BA degree.


<p><b>Senator Mayer:</b> You did say the question has to do with--he quoted


the minutes of the last meeting from Senator Jacob's comment--"this might


be indicative that these requirements will be moved from social science


to humanities to fulfill the General Studies requirements."


<p><b>Senate President Burstein</b>: I think Noel answered that. Hearing


no further discussion, we will move to vote. Senate Motion #1 was unanimously


approved by voice vote.


<p><b>5.B.2 Senate Motion #2</b> <b>(1999-2000) is a request from the interdisciplinary


program in sciences and engineering to establish a MS in Materials Science</b>.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein</b>: Is there discussion? Hearing no further


debate, we will move to a vote. Senate Motion #2 was unanimously approved


by voice vote.


<p><b>5.B.3 Senate Motion #3 (1999-2000) is a request from the College


of Engineering and Applied Sciences to establish a MS in Materials Engineering

<p><b>Senate President Burstein</b>: Is there discussion? Hearing no further


debate, we will move to a vote. Senate Motion #3 was unanimously approved


by voice vote.


<p><b>5.B.4 Senate Motion #5</b> <b>(1999-2000) is a request from the College


of Engineering and Applied Sciences to establish a new department of Bioengineering.


Is there discussion?</b>


<p><b>Senator Saenz:</b> I am just curious, what are the numbers in terms


of enrollment for each of the three degree majors (for bioengineering bachelors,


masters, doctorate programs)?


<p><b>Department Chair: </b>The current enrollment in the bachelors program


is about 225 students, in the masters degree program about 25 and in the


Ph.D program about 30. The projections are that during the next three years


the undergraduate program enrollment will increase to about 300 if the


current growth rate continues.


<p><b>Senator Saenz: </b>This answers my question but I was curious about


the three divisions, if this was the largest one or if, they are split


across the three.


<p><b>Department chair:</b> Chemical Engineering would be the largest.


Bioengineering would be the second largest. Material Science would be the


third one.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> Is there further discussion? Hearing


no further debate, we will move to a vote. Senate Motion #5 was unanimously


approved by voice vote.


<p><b>5.B.5 Senate Motion #6</b> <b>(1999-2000) is a request from the College


of Engineering and Applied Sciences to change the name of the Department


of Chemical, Bio and Materials Engineering to the Department of Chemical


and Materials Engineering.</b>


<p><b>Senate President David Burstein:</b> This action is logical following


the previous motion. Is there discussion? Hearing no further debate, we


will move to a vote. Senate Motion #6 was unanimously approved by voice


vote.


<p><b>5.B.6 Senate Motion #7</b> <b>(1999-2000) is a request from the College


of Liberal Arts and Sciences to establish a Certificate in History and


Philosophy of Science.</b>


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> Is there discussion?


<p><b>Senator:</b> Can you tell us what a "certificate program" is?


<p>Senate President Burstein asked Associate Dean Leonard Gordon to answer


the question.


<p><b>Dr. Gordon: </b>There has been overlap between minors, emphases and


certificates and we have tried to sort that out through the Vice Provosts'


Academic Affairs Council. Ordinarily, a certificate, which is recognized


on the student's transcript, will have somewhat more hours than a minor.


You will find a number of programs which are exceptions--the degree program


in Latin American Studies has a minor which I believe is 18 hours, and


a certificate would be somewhat more than that. The overlap is considerable,


because some minors actually match a certificate. To some extent, it is


what the faculty determine they would like to call it. Certificates often


bring in some aspects of a subject area--a major could be interdisciplinary


that you would not find in a minor, which is really a subset of a major.


There has never been a clear definition.


<p><b>Dr. Bantz:</b> The key advantage is to the student in that we can


create certificates in order to try out a program on campus. Where if there


is significant demand for that certificate, they may chose to make it a


minor instead (which has to be approved by the Board of Regents). We may


even want to create a major if there is enough student interest generated.


Students like certificates very much because it distinguishes their expertise


on their transcript.


<p><b>Senator McNeill:</b> Why are we voting now--I have looked at what


is coming down the road and it seems like there are eight more certificates--why


are we voting on this--why must we say whether they have a certificate


program or not? We are judging them.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> The faculty controls the curriculum.


This is a part of the curriculum. Would you prefer we do it by fiat?


<p><b>Senator McNeill:</b> No. I am just wondering why the History and


Philosophy Departments just don't work this out, as opposed to the entire


college.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> They do. The departments work it out,


the college approves it and then the Senate approves it. It is a process


by which you get wide distribution of what is going on in terms of the


academic curricula of the university. I agree that many of these are pro


forma--but as we saw at the last meeting, some things are not as pro forma


as we think.


<p><b>Senator Escobar:</b> Certificates appear on students' transcripts,


so the university and the faculty sanction them. If it shows on the student's


transcript, we should approve its academic legitimacy.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> Either you agree that these items


come up for a motion and then we vote, or as an information item instead.


How else do we control the curriculum? Controlling the curriculum does


not mean that every item will receive significant debate. On the other


hand, if we do not take care of the details we are not controlling anything.


<p><b>Senator O'Grady:</b> Can someone explain how this fits in with the


streamlining process? I thought it was to reduce different kinds of concentrations,


etc.


<p><b>Dr. Bantz: </b>The streamlining program is very specific from the


beginning on requirements, what every program within the institution is


required to do, to streamline General Studies. If the student feels in


the beginning that adding a certificate in the History and Philosophy of


Science to their degree program in Biology is part of their intellectual


or professional goals, obviously we should make that option available to


them. The student must plan in more detail but it gives the opportunity


to reward those students for their effort.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> Making it clear that the certificate


is an option, not a requirement.


<p><b>Dean Bernstein:</b> I would add just one point. I am glad Dr. Bantz


clarified that was for the case of the undergraduate certificate. One important


distinction between minors and certificates is that minors have to be controlled


by the faculty who are working under a degree program. A certificate provided


us the opportunity to offer interdisciplinary efforts for students, and


there might be faculty from various colleges and departments involved in


the handling of a certificate program. It provides a way to have interdisciplinary


instruction programs.


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> Is there further discussion? Hearing


no further debate, we will move to a vote. Senate Motion # 7 was unanimously


approved by a voice vote.


<p><b>5.B.7 Senate Motion #8 (1999-2000) is a request from the College


of Liberal Arts and Sciences to change the name of the degrees: Bachelor


of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies to the same


degrees in Integrated Studies.</b>


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> Is there discussion? Hearing no debate,


we will move to a vote. Senate Motion #8 was unanimously approved by voice


vote.


<p><b>5.B.8 Senate Motion #9</b> <b>(1999-2000) is a request from the College


of Liberal Arts and Sciences to establish an undergraduate certificate


program "Enriched Liberal Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Certificate Program."</b>


<p><b>Senate President Burstein:</b> Is there discussion? Hearing no debate,


we will move to a vote. Senate Motion #9 was approved with one nay vote


duly recorded.
