<P><CENTER><STRONG>Review of Robert Bickel & Peter Lake's <br>
<em>The Rights and Responsibilities of the Modern University</em><a href="#FNa1">+</A></P>
<p>Kevin A. Cranman<a href="#FNa2">*</a> and Paul J. Ward<a href="#FNa3">**</a></center></STRONG></p>


<P>	Professors Robert D. Bickel and Peter F. Lake, in their book<EM> The Rights and
Responsibilities of the Modern University</EM>,<A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> provide a valuable treatise on the history, evolution,
and future vision of the application of law and policy to assuring a safe environment in higher
education.  It is not a book geared solely for lawyers. The authors include balanced legal
references with the text and provide a book that serves a broad audience of university
administrators, faculty and policy makers, as well as legal practitioners and scholars.  It is a book
for those who serve the higher education community, who want to understand where higher
education law has been, where it is now, where it is heading, and where it needs to go to
encourage safe, and thus, successful education.  Providing background, analysis, and personal
dedication to the field, the authors present decision and policy makers with necessary
information to understand the landscape, address evolving and complex issues, and plan for the
future.  University attorneys and administrators alike should read, discuss, and refer to this work
in managing and improving upon everyday matters and long-range goals.</P>

<P>	Though other solid works have addressed higher education law and policy<A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> and the
incessant growth of tort litigation involving higher education,<A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> this book takes a broad, long view
-  from past to prologue -  of what <EM>may seem </EM>to be a narrow issue:  who is responsible for
assuring a safe higher educational experience?  Presenting the premise that an "unreasonably
unsafe learning environment" compromises and undermines the educational experience itself,
the authors lead us to consider how broadly this issue affects students and institutions alike.  In
other words, if you're not safe or don't feel safe, you may not learn as well.  Addressing safety
issues will provide improvements for the students (better learning experience and environment)
and for the institutions (better reputation; less liability; clearer conscience having done "the right
thing").  Indeed, university attorneys and other university administrators<A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> evaluate and handle
many issues;<A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> however, Bickel and Lake bring us back to focus on a seemingly simple, yet
apparently oft overlooked, aspect of campus life:  safety.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Much like any other type of policy change or implementation, we must consider the
issues, cost allocation, and other factors in determining whether to encourage a change.  Further,
changes made today may not yield results for some time into the future.<A HREF="#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A>  Instead of viewing
campus safety as a peripheral aspect of higher education, Bickel and Lake focus on it as
fundamental to the educational process.  Years ago, our nation recognized that children who
were not properly fed often under-performed academically in grade school.  The nation
responded with national policies implemented locally.  Today, feeding children so they can focus
on learning and not on hunger is a regular part of the educational process.  Similarly, Bickel and
Lake's historical and philosophical perspective guides us to consider the correlation between
improved safety and an improved educational experience.  With that perspective, we can assess
campus safety as an issue core to the educational process on a general level and apply
improvements on a specific level at each of our institutions.  Their Facilitator University legal
paradigm, described in Chapter VI, fairly balances university and student responsibilities for
student conduct and safety.  The authors clearly believe it may turn around the alarming trend in
student injury cases.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	In addition to being scholarly and useful, the book is also important because it contains
an ingredient not always included in a scholarly work: true dedication to and care for the subject
matter, higher education and the law's impact on this vital element of society.  On his law school
home page, Professor Bickel opines that law is too often viewed, taught, and applied too
narrowly; that we need to balance doctrine with practice; that we need to "examine how the law
affects people."<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><A HREF="#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A>  He and Professor Lake present the intellectual elements of law with the lofty
goal of improving higher education in a readable, helpful guide.  Because they care about the law
and about higher education, they have provided us with a guide so that we can use the law as a
tool to improve higher education and the collegiate experience.  Also noteworthy is that the
authors are not without good senses of humor, as they provide meaningful references to "Animal
House,"<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><A HREF="#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A></U></FONT> the "quintessential" comedy about college life, allowing readers to recall a not-so-interactive administration-student model with aberrant behavior adversely affecting the student
population, the administration, the institution, and the townspeople (double secret probation
notwithstanding).<A HREF="#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If we accept the premise equating unreasonably unsafe learning environments with
insufficient learning environments posited on the first page of the Bickel &amp; Lake book (and the
writers of this review do as well), we can use the work to understand the history, current status,
and future plan of the rights and responsibilities of the modern university.  Working as "two
people who teach torts,"<A HREF="#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A> the authors, both with extensive experience in higher education law,
introduce the issue of campus safety and attendant responsibility for managing these issues.</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><U><A HREF="#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A></U></FONT></P>

<P>In Chapter I, an overview, the authors introduce the basic causes of campus danger; the
complex and convoluted history of university law; and the pre-1960s application of the <EM>in loco
parentis</EM> doctrine and its development as legal insularity for universities, providing few, if any,
rights for students.  They continue with the replacement of <EM>in loco parentis</EM> with (some)
constitutional rights for students in the 1960s and 1970s and, consequently, some accountability
for universities.  They then focus on the divergence of the university and students under the
"students' rights" model, called the "bystander" era by the authors, during which some courts
rejected university liability in favor of placing a stronger duty on students to exercise care for
themselves with their new found freedoms.  The "duty - no duty" approach led to uncertainty in
the law, and hence, in policy making and implementation.  In other words, without clear
direction from the legislature or the judiciary, those on the front line are not sure what to do.
The authors explain that the use of "duty," which once seemed to favor universities in liability
cases, has more recently favored plaintiffs.  Still, the authors explain that the court cases yield
more confusion than helpful direction.  Chapters II through V address <EM>In Loco Parentis</EM>, the
1960s Civil Rights Movement and Death of <EM>In Loco Parentis</EM> (rise of constitutional rights for
students), the "Bystander" university and "duty - no duty" period, and the current duty era.  In
Chapter VI, they offer their view of a balanced learning environment with a focus on shared
responsibility:  The Facilitator University.  </U></P>

<P>Chapters II through V provide interesting and important history to the current status and
good background for their Facilitator University.  Chapter II discusses how <EM>in loco parentis</EM>
protection (which was often synonymous with insularity from liability for universities) began as
a delegation (often absolute under English law) of power over the child from the father to the
educators.  Early <EM>in loco parentis</EM> gave universities wide latitude to take action concerning the
physical and moral welfare of students, unless such action was unlawful or against public policy.
The authors point out that<EM> in loco parentis</EM> addressed a university's powers over students, not
duties towards them<A HREF="#N_12_"><SUP>(12)</SUP></A>; it was used to control, not to protector assist.<A HREF="#N_13_"><SUP>(13)</SUP></A> </U></FONT>  The authors describe how
this concept for control was used in conjunction with an immunity from suit, so the university
enjoyed rights to impose, but few obligations to uphold.<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><A HREF="#N_14_"><SUP>(14)</SUP></A></U></FONT> During this era, most universities
were immune from suit:  either under governmental immunity for public universities or under a
charitable immunity for others, including private universities (often not even serving charitable
functions).  In other words, during this period, students had few, if any, rights; universities had the right to control; and society, via the courts, imposed little, if any, liability upon universities for harm suffered by others.</U></P>

<P>Chapter III addresses the transition from <EM>in loco parentis</EM> (and attendant insularity from liability) when the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s and related social initiatives took hold in America.  Starting with <EM>Dixon v. Alabama State Board of Education,</EM><A HREF="#N_15_"><SUP>(15)</SUP></A> in which the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals overturned the lower court's decision not to undertake judicial review of a
university's decision to expel a number of black students, ostensibly for participating in
desegregation activities, without a hearing, courts began to look differently at higher education
legal issues:  "fundamental due process.  Notice and some opportunity"<A HREF="#N_16_"><SUP>(16)</SUP></A> to be heard at public
universities became required, and contractual impositions of universities were "subject to an
irreducible minimum of <EM>constitutional</EM> rights inhering to the <EM>student</EM>."<A HREF="#N_17_"><SUP>(17)</SUP></A>  Thereafter, public universities no longer wielded unfettered control and discipline rights.  The connection of higher education to public interest; the new consumer model in which student-consumers no longer
accepted "take it or leave it" control and discipline models; and the argument against private
school students accepting fewer rights, especially in light of the cost differential, all led to
greater rights for private school students as well.<A HREF="#N_18_"><SUP>(18)</SUP></A>  Though, the authors write, by the early
1970s, <EM>in loco parentis</EM> was "constitutionally and contractually, publicly and privately" dead,
"the questions of apportioning risks and responsibilities regarding student physical safety"
remained.<A HREF="#N_19_"><SUP>(19)</SUP></A>  In other words, progress was being made, but clear answers were not at hand.</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The "Bystander" university, termed by the authors referring to the tort law concept that
generally one is not obligated to act to assist another, followed, as courts used "duty - no duty"
analyses to, for the most part, conclude that universities were not liable to students for harms
they suffered.  Much of this approach was grounded in the revolutionary rights earned in the
1960s and 1970s, as universities argued (and courts agreed) that if these young people,
previously controlled (and "protected") by universities under <EM>in loco parentis</EM>, wanted rights and
freedoms, then they would need to be responsible for their own safety and could not blame the
university for bad things that happened to them. Universities seemed, for the most part, to enjoy
some of the previous insularity, although some cases imposed liability upon universities for harm
to students; however, the "bystander" era allowed universities to behave as if they had little or no
duty to protect their students.</U></FONT></P>

<P>Chapter V addresses the current state of affairs of the student / university relationship.
The authors explain that duty issues still remain with courts parceling duty analysis into four
main categories:  premises / landlord relationships; the control of dangerous people from causing
harm to students; responsibility regarding student activities (laboratory safety, field trips, sport
activities), and student alcohol use.</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><U><A HREF="#N_20_"><SUP>(20)</SUP></A></U></FONT>  The authors analyze each of these categories, showingsome of the decisions within each one.  This chapter is interesting and valuable because the
authors provide case references, old-fashioned professorial analysis, and common-sense
commentary.</U></P>

<P>In Chapter VI, the authors turn to their proposed model: The Facilitator University.
Using helpful tables and text, the authors analyze the preceding eras as they look for the
strengths in each model.  Coalescing the strengths from historical practices and cases, they offer
a flexible model in which the student / university relationship will, within reasonable parameters,
bend to meet individual needs.  The university and the student accept obligations to act
reasonably, and both retain rights and expectations of the other.  This Facilitator model seems to
provide an educational model itself in that students (and, presumably, university administrators)
can learn from the interaction and from working with each other to address problems and goals.
The concept provides ongoing opportunities as people, especially students who are at college
presumably to learn how to problem-solve, interact with others and work within the flexible
model to seek a mutually agreeable pareto-optimal solution to issues.  Inherent in this approach
is that the actors work together, recognizing their responsibilities to the community, to the
model, and to each other.  Universities no longer have expansive control over students, must
provide reasonably safe environments, and must address other related obligations.  Students must
behave reasonably for their own well being, and, doing so should advance their learning
experience.  The various types of campus relationships (<EM>e.g.</EM>, landlord / tenant, dangerous people,
activities, and alcohol use) will each offer situations that need to be addressed, but hopefully will
also provide opportunities for student and administrators alike to identify new and different ways
to solve the problems facing their specific institution and higher education as a whole.</U></P>

<P>	The authors close their book by providing some examples for thought and discussion,
based on cases and experiences, allowing readers to begin implementing their newly-acquired
Facilitator University skills.  <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The illustrations which are examples of how the facilitator model
functions include the following:  student drowns during an extra-curricular outing with a student
environmental club; participant in a sports camp operated for elementary and secondary school
aged-children separates from group and is injured by falling into a campus construction
excavation project; and student residing in a residence hall is assaulted by a criminal intruder
who gains access because a building repair was delayed for an unreasonably long period of time.</U></FONT>
The ten illustrations in the Appendix will also serve as excellent case studies in the classroom. </U></P>

<P>	This book lives up to its title.  It is a significant contribution to the law of student safety.
In sum, it reconciles the best advice of a university lawyer with the best instincts of an
experienced university administrator.</U></P>
