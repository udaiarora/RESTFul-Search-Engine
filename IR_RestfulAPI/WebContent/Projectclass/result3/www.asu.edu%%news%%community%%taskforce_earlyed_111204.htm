      <h2>National Task Force targets early childhood education for Hispanics</h2>
      <p> Eugene Garcia, vice president for university-school partnerships and dean of ASU&rsquo;s College of Education, has appointed a national task force to address major educational challenges facing Hispanic children throughout the United States from birth through the primary grades and to make recommendations for actions. </p>
      <p> The National Task Force on Early Childhood Education for Hispanics was initiated by Garcia in May and funded by a grant from the Foundation for Child Development, a national private philanthropy. Additional funding to support task force goals and initiatives was provided by the A.L. Mailman Family Foundation, a national private foundation. </p>
      <p> The 20-member task force, led by Garcia, combines the expertise, collaboration, and innovative thinking of regional and national leaders from the corporate, education, mass media, and public service arenas. </p>
      <p> A technical advisory committee also has been established to offer scientific advice and support to the task force. The advisory committee is composed of education scholars and public policy experts from across the country. </p>
      <p> In naming the task force and technical advisory committee members, Garcia stressed the importance of assembling diverse and dynamic public and private sector leaders and a first-rate scientific team. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;The individuals appointed to the task force and advisory committee bring a wealth of experience, expertise, and passion that will serve this very important cause well,&rdquo; Garcia says. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;Early education is critical for all children,&rdquo; says task force member Gov. Janet Napolitano. &ldquo;I consider it one of the keys to future success for this country and as such we need to be diligent in providing quality options for all parents regardless of income. However, we do need to make a special effort to reach out to those living in poverty or who speak limited English. These parents have the most difficult time locating resources for their children. This task force is one avenue for building the kind of momentum we need to make quality education for all a reality. I am honored to have been invited to participate.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> The task force, housed at ASU, recently released its policy agenda with the launch of its new Web site, (www.ecehispanic.org). The task force will address three major issues as part of the Para Nuestros Ninos Initiative. They are to: </p>
      <p> &bull; Identify the most effective existing strategies for improving educational outcomes in the early childhood education years among Hispanic students, including determining the most effective approaches for promoting the development of infants and toddlers, and best practices for educating preschoolers, and kindergarten through third-grade pupils. </p>
      <p> &bull; Determine an agenda for developing a larger set of proven early education strategies for Hispanic youngsters, because the existing body of proven strategies educating Hispanic youngsters is relatively small. </p>
      <p> &bull; Develop recommendations for policy makers, practitioners, national Hispanic organizations, and other key parties that can help ensure that effective strategies are disseminated among key local, state, and national mainstream and Hispanic groups. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;The Para Nuestros Ninos Initiative represents a commitment to include all newcomer and long-time resident Latino children in America &rsquo;s promise of equal educational opportunity and a chance for a good life,&rdquo; says Ruby Takanishi, president of the Foundation for Child Development. &ldquo;By starting early to assure their success in school, Latino children will become valued and productive members of our communities.&rdquo; </p>
      <p> The task force will be convened for an initial period of two years that will culminate with the release of a comprehensive report on its findings and recommendations for action. </p>
      <p> The task force is scheduled to conclude its initial two years of service in June 2006. </p>
