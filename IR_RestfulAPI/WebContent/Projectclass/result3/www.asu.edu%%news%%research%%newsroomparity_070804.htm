      <h2>Doig studies newsroom, community parity </h2>
      <p>What began as a newspaper story two years ago has now developed into a full-fledged research project. </p>
      <p>Bill Dedman, a reporter with <em>The Boston Globe</em>, set out in 2002 to report on whether a goal established 25 years ago by the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE) had been reached. ASNE's goal was to have newspaper newsroom staffs around the country representative of, or in "parity" with, the communities they served. </p>
      <p>To ensure his reporting was based on sound data, Dedman enlisted the help of a long-time colleague, ASU Professor and Interim Director of the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism Stephen Doig. </p>
      <p>"Bill came up with the idea of writing a story about this and enlisted me to do the number crunching," says Doig. </p>
      <p>The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation became so interested in the article and research, that they approached the pair to repeat the study the following year. The duo just released results of the second Knight-sponsored study in May. </p>
      <p>"We use the census-type data collected by ASNE, which identifies the percentage of minority staff at a particular newspaper," explains Doig. "Based on the newspapers' circulation by zip codes, we then identify the make up of the community using federal census data. Then we crunch numbers." </p>
      <p>According to their report, only 13 percent of the newspapers responding to the survey have reached ASNE's goal of parity between newsroom and the community served. That's up slightly from last year's 11 percent. </p>
      <p>"Some newspaper companies are doing better than others at hiring and retaining minority employees," says Doig. For example, Gannett Co., owner of <em>The Arizona Republic</em>, was a leader in this area, as measured by a Newsroom Diversity Index, which is a ANSE measurement. </p>
      <p>Their findings also show that smaller, independent daily newspapers are doing a poor job at mirroring the communities they represent. </p>
      <p>Doig attributes the disparity to the demographics of the nation changing so quickly, consolidation in the newspaper industry, shrinking newsrooms and a lack of active recruiting of students of color into journalism. </p>
      <p>"With the profit pressure experienced by newspapers, it has kept the newsroom from growing proportionately with the population and in fact squeezing it down over the last few years," says Doig. "It makes it difficult for newsrooms to make dramatic change under these circumstances." </p>
      <p>Another issue that smaller independents face is that journalists of color oftentimes are hired by a larger paper, according to Doig. </p>
      <p>One new outlet for their results has been to make the findings about each newspaper available to the public, particularly to community groups that might have concerns of the newspaper not representing their communities, says Doig. "Bill and I are strong believers in public information." </p>
      <p>"It's important to have parity if you believe that it's important for a newspaper to cover all of its community," says Doig. "This requires having a newsroom that is able to go into all parts of the community to understand the different cultures, languages and people that make up the community." </p>
      <p>The three years of research have helped create a database, from which comparative analysis can be done in the future. For more details about the study, visit (www.asu.edu/cronkite/asne). </p>
