<p>ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

<br>COMPUTER, INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC

<br>COMMUNICATIONS POLICY

<br>&nbsp;

<p>I. INTRODUCTION

<p>A. This policy defines the boundaries of acceptable use of Arizona State

University (ASU) computing and communication resources, including computers,

networks, electronic mail services, electronic information sources, voice

mail, telephone services and other communication resources.

<p>B. In addition, this policy reflects the goal of ASU to foster academic

freedom while respecting the principles of freedom of speech and the privacy

rights of students, faculty, and ASU employees and guests.

<p>C. ASU's computing and communication resources are the property of ASU.

They are to be used for the advancement of ASU's educational, research,

service, community outreach, administrative and business purposes. Computing

and communication resources are provided for the use of faculty, staff,

currently admitted or enrolled ASU students, and other properly authorized

users.

to computing and communications resources and accounts. ASU may, at its

discretion, permit the user to have the access to accounts and e-mail forwarded

or redirected for a limited period of time.

<p>E. Users of ASU's computing and communications resources are required

to comply with this policy, other applicable ASU and Arizona Board of Regents

(ABOR) policies and state and federal laws.

<p>E. When necessary, enforcement will be consistent with other applicable

ABOR and ASU administrative policies and procedures.

<p>III. INFORMATION POSTED TO ASU COMPUTERS OR WEB PAGES

<p>A. ASU Web Pages may be used only for ASU business and only authorized

individuals may modify or post materials to these pages. No other pages

may suggest that they are university web pages. If confusion is possible,

pages should contain a disclaimer and links to ASU sites.

<p>B. By posting materials and using ASU computing facilities, the user

represents that he or she has created the materials or that he or she has

the right to post or use the materials. The storage, posting or transmission

of materials must not violate the rights of any third person in the materials,

including copyright, trademark, patent, trade secrets, and any rights of

publicity or privacy of any person.

<p>C. The materials posted must not be defamatory, libelous, slanderous

or obscene.

<p>D. The site may not be used for unauthorized commercial purposes.

<p>E. The use of the site is at the sole discretion of ASU. ASU does not

guarantee that the user will have continued or uninterrupted access to

the site. The site may be removed or discontinued at any time in the discretion

of ASU in accordance with ASU policy, or as needed to maintain the continued

operation or integrity of ASU facilities.

<p>F. ASU makes reasonable efforts to protect the integrity of the network

and related services, but ASU cannot guarantee back-up, disaster recovery,

or user access to information posted on personal computers or web pages.

<p>G. Access to services and file storage may be approved for emeriti,

retired staff, alumni, and guests.

<p>IV. ELECTRONIC MAIL AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS

<p>A. Access to ASU e-mail is a privilege that may be wholly or partially

restricted without prior notice and without consent of the user:

<p>1. if required by applicable law or policy,

<p>2. if there is a reasonable suspicion that there has been or may be

a violation

<br>of law, regulation or policy, or

<p>3. if required to protect the integrity or operation of the e-mail system

or computing resources or when the resources are required for more critical

tasks as determined by appropriate management authority.

<p>B. Access to the e-mail system may require approval of the appropriate

ASU supervisory or management authority (e.g., department heads, system

administrators, etc.)

<p>C. ASU may permit the inspection, monitoring or disclosure of e-mail,

computer files, and network transmissions when:

<p>1. required or permitted by law, including public records law, or by

subpoena or court order,

<p>2. ASU or its designated agent reasonably believes that a violation

of law or policy has occurred, or,

<p>3. necessary to monitor and preserve the functioning and integrity of

the e-mail system or related computer systems or facilities.

<p>D. All computer users agree to cooperate and comply with ASU requests

for access to and copies of e-mail messages or data when access or disclosure

is authorized by this policy or required or allowed by law or other applicable

policies.

<p>E. If ASU believes unauthorized access to or disclosure of information

has occurred or will occur, ASU will make reasonable efforts to inform

the affected computer account holder, except when notification is impractical

or when notification would be detrimental to an investigation of a violation

of law or policy.

<p>F. Activities that may strain the e-mail or network facilities more

than can be reasonably expected are in violation of this policy. These

activities include, but are not limited to: sending chain letters, "Spam"

or the widespread dissemination of unsolicited e-mail, and "letter bombs"

to resend the same e-mail repeatedly to one or more recipients.

<p>G. Confidentiality of e-mail and other network transmissions cannot

be assured. Therefore all users should exercise caution when sending personal,

financial, confidential or sensitive information by e-mail or over the

network.

<p>H. Most electronic information produced in the course of university

business is considered an Arizona public record, and must be stored or

deleted in accordance with Arizona Public Records laws. Consult with the

University Archivist for guidance on procedures for external storage or

deletion of public records.

<p>V. PRIVACY AND SECURITY

<p>A. Certain central service and network activities from workstations

connected to the network are routinely logged and monitored. These activities

include:

<p>1. use of passwords and accounts accessed;

<p>2. time and duration of network activity;

<p>3. access to web pages;

<p>4. access to network software;

<p>5. volume of data storage and transfers; and

<p>6. server space used for e-mail.

<p>B. In cases of suspected violations of ASU policies, especially unauthorized

access to computing systems, the system administrator concerned may authorize

detailed session logging. This may involve a complete keystroke log of

an entire session. In addition, the system administrator of the facility

concerned may authorize limited searching of user files to gather evidence

on a suspected violation.

<p>C. Software and physical limitations, computer viruses and third party

intrusions can compromise security of data storage and communications.

ASU takes reasonable precautions to minimize risk. ASU Information Technology

is not obligated to maintain back-ups of any file for any particular length

of time. Users must protect and backup critical data. Individual users

and departments should develop policies and practices to ensure regular

backups of data and implement steps to ensure that all critical data is

compatible with all current generations of computing equipment and storage

media and media readers.

<p>D. All ASU departments should implement policies to ensure that access

to sensitive data is restricted to those employees who have a need to access

the information. Passwords restricting access to information should be

changed on a regular basis and systems should be developed and implemented

to assure password records are regularly updated by appropriate supervisors.

<p>E. University owned computers and equipment may be examined to detect

illegal software and to evaluate the security of the network.

<br>&nbsp;

<p>VI. VIOLATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT

<p>A. Any actual or suspected violation of the rules listed above should

be brought to the system administrator of the equipment or facility most

directly involved. In the case of a serious violation, a report may be

made to Information Technology or the Office of General Counsel.

<p>B. Upon receiving notice of a violation, ASU may temporarily suspend

a user's privileges or move or delete the allegedly offending material

pending further proceedings.

<p>C. A person accused of a violation will be notified of the charge and

have an opportunity to respond before ASU imposes a permanent sanction.

Appropriate cases will be referred to the ASU disciplinary authority appropriate

to the violator's status (e.g., Office of Student Life, or employee's supervisor)

or to appropriate law enforcement authorities.

<p>D. In addition to sanctions available under applicable law and ASU and

Board policies, ASU may impose a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination

of access privileges to computing and communication accounts, networks,

ASU administered computing rooms, and other services or facilities.

<p>E. If ASU believes it necessary to preserve the integrity of facilities,

user services, or data, it may temporarily suspend any account, whether

or not the account user is suspected of any violation. ASU will provide

appropriate notice to the account user. Servers and computers that threaten

the security of university systems will be removed from the network and

allowed to reconnect only with the approval of network administration.
