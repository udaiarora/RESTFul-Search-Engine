This updated edition shows how to use the SAS System to perform basic      statistical analysis. General topics include creating a data set with
the SAS System; summarizing data with descriptive statistics, frequency    tables, and bar charts; comparing groups (t-tests, one-way ANOVA, and
nonparametric analogues); performing basic linear regression (lines,       curves, and two-variable models); performing simple regression
diagnostics (residuals plots, studentized residuals); and creating and     analyzing tables of data. Using real-life examples, this beginner's
guide bridges the gap between statistics texts and SAS documentation.
