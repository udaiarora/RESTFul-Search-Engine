        <p>Let's talk a little bit about the rationale behind the project. We started out with some basic observations about the problems associated with managing electronic records in higher education institutions:</p>
        <p>[click] The University environment: Universities tend to be loosely tied federations of schools and departments that each cherish their own autonomy and vision. Faculty generally see themselves as independent contractors, working for the university (unfortunately, they may take the same approach with documents.)</p>
        <p>[click] The lack of recordkeeping systems: While institution-wide electronic records management systems (ERMS) can improve desktop management, few universities employ one. We need to know more about users to understand their needs.</p>
        <p>[click] Public institutions: The retention and disposition of email (as well as other print &amp; electronic records) at the 16 campuses that make up the UNC system is governed by the NC Public Records Law, NC General Statutes, Chapter 132. [explain briefly] Until recently, the only acceptable means of "archiving" electronic records, and especially email in NC, has been printing out all records or microfilming them. It just isn't happening! About 1/3 of employees are printing out email and other electronic files frequently. Up to 80% of email creators state that they do not "have a clue" when email messages constitute official records. In the project's pilot survey, only 2 out of 55 respondents said they had a good deal of knowledge of the NC Public Records Law (21 said they had no knowledge, 23 said they were not sure they had heard of the law, 8 claimed some knowledge of the NC Public Records Law.)</p>
        <p>[click] Private institutions: As a private university, Duke University does not function under the NC Public Records Law, but it is open to lawsuits and discovery. There are different attitudes at a private institution regarding ownership of information, privacy, and security.</p>
