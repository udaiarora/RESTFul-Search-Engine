How to Setup PPP with Linux
</center></h2>
<p><b>		
Question:</b><br>
I set up my ppp connection at home in linux and it worked fine using the
old 965-0500 number, but it doesn't work with the new number and now the
old number isn't working either...did you change the net mask or something?
<p><b>
Response:</b><br>
Enclosed are the files you will need to create for using PPP with Linux.
<p><pre> 
/etc/ppp/options
----------------
 
defaultroute
noipdefault
debug
/dev/modem
 

/etc/ppp/pap-secrets
--------------------
 
* * yourpassword_goes_here

 
/usr/local/bin/ppp-asu  (make this script executable via chmod 755)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#!/bin/sh
#
# Script to initiate a ppp connection. This is the first part of the
# pair of scripts. This is not a secure pair of scripts as the codes
# are visible with the 'ps' command.  However, it is simple.
#
# These are the parameters. Change as needed.
TELEPHONE=727-0030      # The telephone number for the connection
ACCOUNT=                # Your ASURITE user-id goes here
PASSWORD=               # Your password goes here
LOCAL_IP=0.0.0.0        # Local IP address if known. Dynamic = 0.0.0.0
REMOTE_IP=0.0.0.0       # Remote IP address if desired. Normally 0.0.0.0
NETMASK=255.255.255.192 # The proper netmask if needed
#
# Export them so that they will be available at 'ppp-on-dialer' time.
export TELEPHONE ACCOUNT PASSWORD
#
# This is the location of the script which dials the phone and logs
# in.  Please use the absolute file name as the $PATH variable is not
# used on the connect option.  (To do so on a 'root' account would be
# a security hole so don't ask.)
#
DIALER_SCRIPT=/usr/local/bin/ppp-asu-dial
#
# Initiate the connection
#
# I put most of the common options on this command. Please, don't
# forget the 'lock' option or some programs such as mgetty will not
# work. The asyncmap and escape will permit the PPP link to work with
# a telnet or rlogin connection. You are welcome to make any changes
# as desired. Don't use the 'defaultroute' option if you currently
# have a default route to an ethernet gateway.
#
exec /usr/sbin/pppd debug lock modem /dev/modem 38400 \
        asyncmap 0xa0000 name $ACCOUNT \
        $LOCAL_IP:$REMOTE_IP \
        noipdefault netmask $NETMASK defaultroute connect $DIALER_SCRIPT

 
/usr/local/bin/ppp-asu-dial
---------------------------
 
#!/bin/sh
#
# This is part 2 of the ppp-on script. It will perform the connection
# protocol for the desired connection.

        ABORT           '\nRINGING\r\n\r\nRINGING\r'    \
        ''              \rAT                            \

        '>'             'ppp /compress negotiate'
 

/usr/local/bin/ppp-off   (make this script executable via chmod 755)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#!/bin/sh

        kill -INT `cat /var/run/$DEVICE.pid`
#
# If the kill did not work then there is no process running for this
# pid. It may also mean that the lock file will be left. You may wish
# to delete the lock file at the same time.
        if [ ! "$?" = "0" ]; then
                rm -f /var/run/$DEVICE.pid
                echo "ERROR: Removed stale pid file"
                exit 1

        echo "PPP link to $DEVICE terminated."
        exit 0

echo "ERROR: PPP link is not active on $DEVICE"
exit 1
