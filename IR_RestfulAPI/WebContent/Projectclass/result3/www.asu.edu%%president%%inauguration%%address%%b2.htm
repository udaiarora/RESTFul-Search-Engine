This is the West&#8212;the Southwest&#8212;a         vast canvas of startling natural beauty, a broad landscape that has always         drawn individuals with an independent streak, and it remains so today.       </p>      <p>When the Thirteenth Territorial Legislature established a normal school         in Tempe in 1885, Arizona Territory epitomized the frontier in our national         consciousness. More than a quarter century would pass before Arizona Territory         became the last of the 48 continental states to join the union. Because         the state is young and its cities and institutions are not bound by the         weight of tradition, because in many respects it is like an unfinished         canvas, Arizona still epitomizes the frontier&#8212;the social, cultural,         and political frontier. Its cities and institutions are not bound by the         weight of tradition because they are still in the process of being created.       </p>      <p>In the nineteenth century Arizona Territory epitomized the frontier to         Americans crossing the continent, but for countless centuries it had been         the land of indigenous peoples, and it remains so today. The Native American         population in Arizona is among the most diverse and vibrant in the nation.         In the sixteenth century the Spanish became the first Europeans to impact         this land of ancient and highly successful cultures&#8212;the land that         would become Mexico&#8212;and with the Hispanic population of our state         increasing more rapidly than any other segment of society, it is clear         that Arizona retains its ties to the great new cultures of Latin America.       </p>      <p>The conviction that the United States is a melting pot has been an article         of faith for generations of Americans. But the gradual process of assimilation         that has brought both indigenous peoples and generations of immigrants         into the American mainstream has been questioned. We are becoming a nation         in which no dominant cultural paradigm prevails, one still in the process         of developing its own uniquely American culture. It is perhaps a process         that will never be completed. It has been said that America is a mosaic,         and not a melting pot. It is far, far richer for that cultural complexity,         a complexity that the university must embrace, a complexity that the university         must understand, teach, and use to bring forth new perspectives and new         ideas. </p></td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td align="left" valign="bottom"><a href="b1.htm" class="nodecor"><img src="images/back.gif" alt="Back" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"><font color="#CC9900" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Back</strong></font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong></strong></font></td>    <td align="right" valign="bottom"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="b3.htm" class="nodecor"><font color="#CC9900">Next</font></a></strong></font>       <a href="b3.htm"><img src="images/forward.gif" alt="Next" width="25" height="24" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>    </p></body></html>
