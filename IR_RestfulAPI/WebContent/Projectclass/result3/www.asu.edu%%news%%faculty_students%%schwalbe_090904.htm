      <h2 align="left">Schwalbe wins national teaching award </h2>
      <p>Carol Schwalbe, assistant professor of journalism at ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, has been named a 2004 Great Ideas for Teachers (GIFT) Grand Prize Winner for her presentation, "The Language of the Senses: How to use your five senses to add color and detail to feature stories," at the AEJMC convention in Toronto, Ontario. </p>
      <p>Schwalbe, a former editor for <em>National Geographic </em> magazine, has taught at the Cronkite School since 2002 and is currently involved in photojournalism projects, including a study of the early images of the war in Iraq, how civil rights photos affected the world view of the United States and a convergence project focused on the presidential campaign and debate. </p>
      <p>This national award is sponsored by the Community College Journalism Association and the Small Programs Interest Group for the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication to recognize excellence in journalism and mass communication course curriculum, and to provide colleagues with fresh ideas for updating their teaching methods. Schwalbe's submission was judged best of the 25 GIFT presentations that had been selected from 57 entries to the competition. </p>
      <p>The winning entry suggested teaching exercises that could be integrated into multiple classes to help students become better observers and writers. Schwalbe's work suggests helping students look at scenes through all the senses to paint more realistic pictures with words.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Her implementation plan provided examples of how to help students delve deeper into their perceptions of touch, hearing, taste, sight and smell, writing about their observations and putting all the senses together in one final capstone exercise that is written after 45 minutes of observation. For a hearing exercise, she sends students out to eavesdrop on as many conversations as possible and then describe the scenes, the speech patterns and rhythms of everyday conversations, as well as the actual dialogue. </p>
      <p>The "language of scent" is tested with a teaching technique that includes having students smell fragrances such as lemon, clove and bleach out of small paper bags and then write about them and the associations affiliated with those scents. </p>
      <p>From her experience with these award-winning techniques, Schwalbe notes, "I am often astonished by the color and details in the descriptive passages written while these ideas are fresh, which helps students appreciate the power of immediacy in writing." </p>
      <p>Students often report that these exercises are one of the most valuable parts of Schwalbe's class. One student wrote, "I felt I'd lost my voice from writing so many news stories. Now I can sing again - or at least chirp." </p>
      <p>Only the Cronkite School had two professors among those selected for the GIFT poster session this year. The Cronkite School's other finalist was Leslie-Jean Thornton, who will start as a lecturer at ASU this fall. </p>
