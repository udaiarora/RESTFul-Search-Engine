When a faculty member or academic professional is treated by a private physician or at a hospital, the attending physician must sign a release statement.  The faculty member or academic professional must present a release statement to his or her department before returning to work.<p>Workers&#146; compensation is paid while the faculty member or academic professional is <a href="acd002.html#disabled" target="New">disabled</a>, beginning on the eighth <a href="acd002.html#day" target="New">day</a> of <a href="acd002.html#disability" target="New">disability</a>.  If disability extends beyond 14 days, workers&#146; compensation is paid from the date of disability.  Lost time of seven 	days or less may be charged against accrued sick or vacation leave.<p>Workers&#146; compensation will equal 66 2/3 percent of a faculty member&#146;s or academic professional&#146;s full salary or wages.  A faculty member or academic professional who is awarded workers&#146; compensation must use accrued sick leave and may use accrued vacation leave to supplement workers&#146; compensation up to, but not to exceed, the full salary or wages.  Sick leave and, if desired, vacation leave will be charged on a prorated basis for the difference (33 1/3 percent) between the workers&#146; compensation award and the faculty member&#146;s or academic professional&#146;s full salary or wages, as listed in the chart below.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Workers&#146; Compensation Payment and Sick Leave and/or Vacation Supplements</b><a href="acd601-06table1.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">D</font></a></font><p><table border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1><tr><th rowspan=2 valign=BOTTOM align=CENTER>Days Disabled</th><th colspan=2 align=CENTER>Days Paid By</th></tr><tr><th valign=BOTTOM align=CENTER>Workers&#146; Compensation</th><th valign=BOTTOM align=CENTER>Accrued Sick and/or<br>Vacation Leave</th></tr><tr><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>1&#150;7 days</td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>0 percent</td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>100 percent</td></tr><tr><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>8&#150;13 days</td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>66 2/3 percent</td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>33 1/3 percent</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2 valign=TOP align=CENTER>14 daysor longer</td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>66 2/3 percent</td><td valign=TOP align=CENTER>33 1/3 percent</td></tr><tr><td valign=TOP colspan=2>If the absence extends beyond 14 days:  Workers&#146; compensation will pay for 66 2/3 percent of individual&#146;s full salary or wages.</td></tr></table><font color="#FFFFFF"><a name="endtable1">endtable1</a></font><p>A faculty member or academic professional on a fiscal contract will continue to accrue sick and vacation leave at the regular rate while receiving partial salary through the university.<p>After accrued sick leave and, if desired, vacation leave have been exhausted, the faculty member or academic professional will receive payment only from workers&#146; compensation (i.e., 66 2/3 percent of the employee&#146;s full salary or wages) and will be placed on a leave of absence without pay for a maximum of six months.  The faculty member or academic professional will continue to receive the benefit of the employer contribution on all applicable benefit programs during this period.  A faculty member or academic professional who cannot return to work and assume all work responsibilities after six months of leave may be terminated.<p>If the disability is expected to continue for a period of more than six months, the faculty member or academic professional should contact Human Resources (HR) to apply for long-term disability benefits three months after the last day of work  (see <a href="acd601-04.html">ACD 601&#150;04</a>, &#147;Long-Term Disability Insurance&#148;).<p>Upon release by a physician to return to work, a faculty member or academic professional will return to the former position held or to a comparable position within the department without loss of benefits or rate of compensation.<p>Workers&#146; compensation provides survivor benefits to dependents of a faculty member or academic professional whose death is caused by injuries during the performance of duties.  If death occurs as a result of an accident during the course of employment, the employee&#146;s department should contact HR.<p><table><tr><td valign=TOP>Note:</td><td>Family leave (<a href="acd702-03.html">ACD 702&#150;03</a>, &#147;Family Leave&#148;) is not an additional leave; rather, it is to be used concurrently with this policy.</td></tr></table><p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Procedure</b></font><a href="acd601-06table2.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">D</font></a></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p><hr noshade><table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1><tr><th>Responsibility<hr></th><th>Action<hr></th></tr><tr valign=TOP><td>Faculty member<br>or<br>academic professional</td><td><ol><li>Notify the supervisor of the injury immediately, if possible.</li><p><li>Report to the Campus Health Service for treatment, if possible.</li><p><li>Complete and sign the appropriate portion of the Workman&#146;s and Physician&#146;s Report of Injury form at the Campus Health Service or at the attending physician&#146;s office.</li></ol></td></tr><tr valign=TOP><td>Campus Health Service</td><td><ol start="4"><li>Complete and forward the form to Human Resources (HR).</li></ol></td></tr><tr valign=TOP><td>Supervisor</td><td><ol start="5"><li>Complete sections 1&#150;32 of the Employer&#146;s Report of Industrial Injury form.
