      <h2>Researchers find &quot;luxury effect&quot; helps determine plant diversity in
        urban areas</h2>
      <p>Income level appears to have a major positive effect
        on plant diversity in urban and suburban areas of Central Arizona, according
        to a team of researchers that includes several Arizona State University
        scientists.</p>
      <p>The higher the income level the more plant diversity, the researchers
        found. This "luxury effect" is so pronounced that plant diversity at
        sites in neighborhoods with incomes above $50,750 per year were on average
        twice that found in landscapes of less wealthy areas. The researchers
        present their findings in the current on-line issue of the Proceedings
        of the National Academy of Sciences. </p>
      <p>"In human-constructed systems, it's as if money is just as important
        to plants as nutrients and water supply" said Diane Hope, a researcher
        in Arizona State's Center for Environmental Studies and lead scientist
        for the survey. </p>
      <p>"It's not the money per se, because you don't go and pour money on the
        ground and plants grow," Hope said. "But rather it's the things that
        money enables people to do and the way that they live that affects the
        plant diversity in urban areas."</p>
      <p>The findings are the result of a large field survey and analysis of
        data gathered in the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research
        site, a major on-going study to investigate the ecological characteristics
        of the Central Arizona-Phoenix region and how urbanization is affecting
        that character. The survey also will provide a baseline of data for future
        monitoring of the same sites, as well as give an overview of plant diversity,
        soil chemistry and animal distributions. </p>
      <p>The results provide a comprehensive "snapshot" of the ecological characteristics
        of the Phoenix metro area and surrounding agricultural and desert lands.
        The survey will be repeated in five-year intervals to monitor long-term
        changes.</p>
      <p>Three general factors -- income level, age of a housing development
        and whether the plot of land had ever been farmed -- influence plant
        diversity, the researchers report. </p>
      <p>Newer housing developments had greater plant diversity than older, well-established
        neighborhoods. This may owe itself to the fact that landscaping for houses
        built in the 1960s had a different purpose (mainly to provide shade)
        than landscaping for houses that rely on air conditioning for cooling,
        Hope said. </p>
      <p>A third factor was if the land had ever been farmed. </p>
      <p>"When a piece of land is farmed, the land is cleared and plowed," Hope
        said. "When people develop a housing site in that area, they re-introduce
        plants, but they never really seem to get plant diversity up to levels
        of land that was never farmed." </p>
      <p>Reasons for this may be in the nature of the land itself. Farmland tends
        to be in low laying, alluvial areas that didn't have a lot of plant diversity
        to begin with compared to land higher up in the foothills that has never
        been farmed. </p>
      <p>Yet among the three factors, income level stood out. </p>
      <p>"The relationship between wealth and plant diversity would also appear
        to be similar to the link between socioeconomic status, species composition,
        and physical structure of vegetation in residential yards in several
        other cities, leading us to suggest that the relationship between wealth
        and plant diversity maybe characteristic of urban landscapes generally,"
        the researchers reported.</p>
      <p>In addition to Hope, authors of the paper include Corrina Gries, Charles
        Redman, Nancy Grimm, Chris Martin and Ann Kinzig of Arizona State University;
        Welxing Zhu of State University of New York, Binghampton; William Fagan
        of University of Maryland, College Park; and Amy Nelson of Alliance Data
        Systems, Gahanna, Ohio. </p>
      <p>The research is funded by the National Science Foundation and Arizona
        State University. </p>
