      <h2>ASU faculty continue Guggenheim success</h2>
      <p>        ASU has won three of the 184 Guggenheim Fellowships awarded this year,
          a number that generally only the elite, private universities surpassed
          - Princeton, University of Chicago, Yale (each winning five) and Columbia
        and Harvard (each winning four). </p>
      <p>In the last three years, eight ASU
            faculty members have won John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation
            Fellowships. The Guggenheim is a prestigious
          academic award that ranks as one of the highest honors in the humanities,
          social sciences and natural sciences. </p>
      <p>The university's strong track record
          in winning the award is evidence of a strong senior research faculty,
          since the Guggenheim Fellowship
          is generally given to established scholars and researchers "who have
          achieved prominence in their fields."</p>
      <p>"Our recent record in winning these
        important awards is a testament to our past track record in recruiting
        strong researchers to the faculty,"
        said David Young, dean of ASU's College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences.
        "As the university's research enterprise continues to move forward, I
        expect that we will see more and more of this kind of national recognition."</p>
      <p>Winning
          2003 Guggenheim Fellowships are History Professor Monica Green; English,
          German and Theater Professor Gitta Honegger; and Microbiology
          Professor Kenneth Mossman.</p>
      <p>The Guggenheim Fellowship is awarded to scholars,
          artists and scientists and typically supports release time for work
        on a major project of importance
      in the field involved.</p>
      <p>Green, a medieval historian who specializes in
          the history of medicine, won the fellowship to study "Medicine and
        Culture fellowship to study
          "Medicine and Culture in 12th Century Salerno." Green's project will
          focus on the School of Salerno, the European starting point of medical
          science, inspired by the area's past Arab culture and imported Arab
        learning. </p>
      <p>Though Salerno was crucial for the development of Western medicine and
        learning, very little historical study has been devoted to it. </p>
      <p>Honegger
          is a theater professor and a literary scholar and has interests in
        theater, performance, German and comparative literature, critical
          theory and women's studies. Her fellowship project is titled "A Biography
        of Helene Weigel."</p>
      <p>Honegger's project will take her to Berlin to research
          and write the life story of Weigel, a prominent German actress and
        theater director
          whose history has been somewhat eclipsed by the fact that she was the
        wife of the famous playwright Bertolt Brecht. </p>
      <p>Mossman is a health physics
          professor in ASU's microbiology department and also director of ASU's
          office of radiation safety. He is a specialist
          in the area of radiological health and safety, with interests as well
        in risk management. </p>
      <p>Mossman's fellowship is to study "Risk Dimensions
          and Precaution." His proposed project is to study the substantial uncertainty
          that exists
          concerning the applicability and requirements of the precautionary
        principle to the management of technological risks.</p>
      <p>His research has implications
          for a broad range of risk issues, including such diverse activities
        as biomedical research, use of cellular telephones
        and genetically modified foods.</p>

        Arts &amp; Sciences, can be reached
