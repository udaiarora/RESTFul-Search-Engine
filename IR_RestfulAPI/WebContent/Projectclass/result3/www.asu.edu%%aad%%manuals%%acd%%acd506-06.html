Policies and procedures for evaluation must strive to be clear, unambiguous, comprehensive, and applied consistently and uniformly.<p>The tenure and promotion review is a process conducted by the personnel committee in the academic unit, the head of the academic unit, the college personnel committee, the supervising dean, the campus personnel committee, the campus provost, the executive vice president and provost of the university, and the president of the university. Each of these units or individuals makes decisions that are independent but informed by previous decisions.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Responsibilities of the Academic Units and Colleges</b></font><p>The assignment of faculty tenure lines and associated budgets to a campus department, school, college, or division is the responsibility of the campus provost. Written criteria for personnel decisions will be established by each college and academic unit in terms of its special needs and expectations. These criteria shall be approved by the campus provost and shall be consistent with university affirmative action and equal opportunity policies. Written policy documents in each unit must define the categories of faculty work to be included in the evaluation and must specify the types of evidence faculty are expected to submit.  Unit guidelines must be consistent with Board of Regents&#146; and university policy.<p>The unit&#146;s written criteria concerning evaluation for tenure and promotion must address evaluation issues pertaining to faculty who participate as affiliated faculty or as &#147;core faculty&#148; in another program, such as a department, center, institute, or interdisciplinary program. The purpose of the policy is to explain how the work in these units is taken into account in the tenure and promotion process. Normally, faculty should: <br><p><ol><li>have the option of including their &#147;outside&#148; contributions within their official &#147;distribution of effort&#148; in their home unit</li><p><li>be allowed to include on their list of external reviewers persons who are qualified to provide meaningful input on the particular work done outside of their home unit<p>and</li><p><li>are allowed to request that the chair consult with the center or institute director in selecting external reviewers, although the final decision on such reviewers is determined by the unit&#146;s policy.  </li></ol><p>Academic units housing faculty who engage in interdisciplinary scholarship need criteria with which interdisciplinary scholarship is evaluated and weighted. <p>All college, campus, and university committees meeting to consider matters of promotion and tenure must inform the head of the academic unit if there are major faults or omissions in the material or if significant questions or possible misunderstandings arise. The head of the academic unit may send additional letters to the committee as the case progresses if there is a need, either to clarify some matter that may cause confusion or to give additional information. However, all parties should remember that ASU policy provides for independent reviews by faculty committees and administrators.<p>Suggestions for improvement in areas subject to evaluation ordinarily are given to candidates no later than the probationary review held in the third year.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Promotion and Tenure Evaluation Criteria</b></font><p>A person is promoted, granted tenure, or retained on the basis of excellent performance and the promise of continued excellence. All performance evaluations involve assessment of faculty professional responsibilities, particularly as it pertains to the quality of teaching and instruction; the quality of research and publication or other creative endeavors; and the quality of service to the profession, university, and community (local, state, and national or international). <p><b>Supportive Materials</b><p>The collection of supportive materials pertinent to all promotion and tenure decisions is the responsibility of the faculty member, except that the head of the academic unit and the personnel committee in the unit will collect supplementary confidential evaluation letters where required. Unit policy must specify what materials the faculty are expected to submit for review of teaching and instruction, research and creative activity, and service. <p><b>Quality of Teaching and Instruction </b><p>Evidence of the quality of teaching and instruction must be assessed through multiple indicators, including at least the following: a summary of student evaluations collected and reported in accord with university and unit procedures, and a peer or supervisory review of instructional materials (such as syllabi, assignments, and Web-based courses). The evaluation of instructional materials must take into account relevant factors such as student learning, the currency of the course, and the contribution of the course to the unit&#146;s curriculum, pedagogy, and the scholarship of instruction. It may involve peer observation of teaching.  <p>Review materials that must be submitted from the unit to the higher levels of review include:<br><p><ol><li>a summary table of courses taught, the number of students in each, and a summary of student evaluations</li><p><li>instructional materials as specified by the unit</li><p><li>a statement of teaching philosophy and any professional development activities undertaken in relation to teaching and instruction<p>and</li><p><li>two products that reflect the quality of teaching and instruction, as specified in the unit policies. </li></ol><p><b>Quality of Research and Publication or Other Creative Endeavors </b><p>Evidence of the quality of research and creative activities can be measured by indicators such as the scholarly standards reflected in the work; its impact on intended audiences; the importance, innovativeness, and relevance of the work as suggested by external peer reviewers or other appropriate authorities; the quality of the journals, publishers, conferences, or other communicative outlets; citations of the work; its longevity of influence; and other similar indicators appropriate to the discipline and unit. <p>The scholarly aspects of all professional responsibilities undertaken on behalf of the unit, including instructional activities and service, may be assessed within this category if provided for in unit policy.<p>Unit policies must specify materials that faculty are expected to submit.  For probationary, tenure, and promotion reviews, copies of at least two but not more than four products must be provided by the faculty member for review and must be forwarded with the materials to the campus provost&#146;s office.<p><b>Quality of Service to the Profession, to the University, and to the Community (Local, State, and National or International) </b><p>Evaluation of service requires the assessment of quality as well as quantity.  Each component of service must be evaluated in appropriate terms. Service to the university should be assessed in terms of impact on the well being of the unit and university; service to the academic profession must be assessed in terms of its overall value for the national distinction of the unit. Contributions to affirmative action/diversity, recruitment and retention, faculty governance, collegial working environments, and professional behavior are assessed by peers and department chairs/directors. The evaluation of public/community service must be based on the quality of the service rendered as well as the value of that service from the perspective of the community organization or partner.  <p>Unit policy must specify the types of information about service that are needed for each type of review, and must specify processes for obtaining such information. For probationary, tenure, and promotion reviews, units for whom public and community service is an important part of their mission may require faculty to provide at least two but not more than four products reflecting the quality of their public service. These are forwarded to the campus provost as part of the overall dossier.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Promotion to Associate Professor</b></font><p>Promotion to associate professor and awarding of tenure require an overall record of excellence and the promise of continued excellence.  The candidate must have achieved excellence (taking into account the rank) in both teaching and instructional activities as well as in research and creative activities.   Service must at least be &#147;satisfactory&#148; or &#147;effective.&#148; Units in which public service is a central aspect of their mission also may require excellence in public service.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Promotion to Full Professor</b></font><p>Promotion to full professor must be based on an overall record of excellence in the performance of professional responsibilities (taking into account the distribution of effort as part of any negotiated flexible performance agreements) and the promise of continued effectiveness in professional development. Exceptional quality of service should be assessed primarily in relation to service to the profession or the public. <p>Normally, an overall record of excellence requires national or international recognition for scholarly achievement in one or more areas of faculty endeavor.  <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Promotion for Faculty in Administrative Positions </b></font><p>For faculty members serving in administrative positions, their performance in the administrative post is usually evaluated as a component of service to the university. Faculty members serving in administrative positions need to provide evidence of teaching and instruction, research publication or other creative activities, and service to the profession and/or public for consideration in decisions regarding promotion and tenure. <p>Service to the university includes the individual&#146;s expected contribution to internal committee work, faculty governance activities, and the preservation of a collegial atmosphere at all levels of interaction within the university. <p>For promotion and tenure, exceptional quality of service should be assessed primarily in relation to service to the public or profession and basically should be an extension of the <a href="acd002.html#facultymember" target="New">faculty member</a>&#146;s research and teaching activity to the larger community outside the university.  For performance pay considerations, outstanding service to the department, college, university, and profession, as well as public service, must be encouraged and rewarded.  Evaluation of service requires the assessment of quality as well as quantity.<p><hr><font size=+1><b>Denial of Promotion or Tenure</b></font><p>The denial of promotion, tenure, or retention need not be construed as due to failure or poor performance on the candidate's part. Considerations such as the need for a different area of specialization or for a new emphasis within the unit, the lack of a continuing position, the need to shift a position or resources to another department, or the opportunity for a more vigorous program in teaching, research, or service may dictate that the individual not be retained or granted tenure. <p><hr><font size=+1><b>Final Decision</b></font><p>The final decision on promotion, tenure, or retention is made by the president or designee. Notification of the decision is provided by May 12 of the review year.</p><p><hr><font size=+1><b>External Letters for Promotion and Tenure</b></font><p>External evaluation of the faculty member&#146;s record is solicited for use in personnel decisions. This shall be done in a timely manner, normally by July 1 for a fall review, and should specify which areas of performance (i.e., teaching and instruction, research and creative activities, service) are included.  Materials appropriate to the review should be provided to the reviewer. <p><ol><li>The head of the academic unit or supervising dean proposes reviewers and the candidate proposes reviewers. Reviewers ultimately solicited will represent both lists equally. All reviews received are included in the candidate&#146;s file. </li><p><li>Evaluations are solicited by the unit head from persons of high reputation in the candidate&#146;s field. </li><p><li>The reviewer is asked for a curriculum vita and a statement regarding his or her acquaintance with the applicant. </li><p><li>Guidelines with specific questions are furnished to each reviewer so that the evaluations have a consistent format and can be used objectively. </li><p><li>To give the reviewer an opportunity to develop a quality response, the reviewer has at least 30 days to respond. </li><p><li>Tenure and promotion decisions include consideration of external letters. </li><p><li>Letters written by ASU students, staff members, or colleagues cannot substitute for external evaluations of faculty members.<p>and</li><p><li>The campus promotion and tenure committee will not accept letters, either positive or negative, that have not come through a unit&#146;s established review procedures. </li></ol><p>External letters of evaluation are solicited on a confidential basis. Neither the names of the reviewers nor the contents of the letters are to be shared with the applicant for tenure or promotion. Only officially appointed or elected review committees or other faculty groups specified by unit bylaws and administrators in the review hierarchy examine the letters. Letters should be kept in a central location and viewed only there. Solicitation letters to external reviewers should include a statement that describes who will have access to the letter of review and the extent to which confidentiality can be assured.<p><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><center><font size=+2><b>Cross-References</b></font></center><img src="acdhr.gif" alt="[horizontal rule]" width="100%" height="2"><p>For more information on evaluation for tenure and promotion, see:<p><ol><li><a href="acd506-03.html">ACD 506&#150;03</a>, &#147;Probationary Appointments&#148;</li><p><li><a href="acd506-05.html">ACD 506&#150;05</a>, &#147;Promotion&#148;<p>and</li><p><li><a href="acd506-10.html">ACD 506&#150;10</a>, &#147;Annual Evaluation of Faculty.&#148;</li></ol><p><hr><font color="#FFFFFF">skip navigation bar</font><p><center><font size="-1" color="#666666"><a href="index.html" target="_top">ACD</a>&#160;manual | ASU&#160;policies&#160;and&#160;procedures&#160;<a href="../index.html" target="_top">manuals</a> | <a href="../search.html" target="_top">Search</a>&#160;manuals | ACD&#160;manual&#160;<a href="acd001.html">contact</a> | Provost&#146;s&#160;Office&#160;Web&#160;<a href="provost.html">site</a><p>&#160;<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></font></center><p>&#160;</body></html>
