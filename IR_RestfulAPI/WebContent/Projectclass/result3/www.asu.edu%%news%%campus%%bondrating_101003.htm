      <h2>ASU's bond rating improves, on right track for financial health</h2>
      <p>        The two major national debt rating agencies, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's
        (S &amp; P), have determined ASU is on the right track for financial
        health.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 7, Moody's issued a report raising the university's revenue
          bond rating from A1 to Aa3 for new bond issues. The agency also raised
          the
          ratings on already issued bond series.</p>
      <p>Another major bond rating firm
        S&amp;P, is expected to issue a similar
        report improving ASU's Certificates of Participation Lease-Purchase financing
        rating from A+ to AA-.<br>
        Gerald Snyder, associate vice president for finance and university treasurer,
        says the improved ratings are more than symbolic.</p>
      <p>"It's a positive, independent
          assessment of our credit worthiness and our institutional direction,"
          he says. "An increase in ratings like this
          is a strong endorsement of the path the university is on. Bottom line,
          it reduces the rate we pay for bond-financed construction projects
        at our various campuses. Even more importantly, it makes debt issued
        by
          ASU more attractive to a wider variety of investors, making sales of
          new bond issues more effective."</p>
      <p>Snyder says in most cases, it will reduce
          the interest rates paid on bonds by seven basis points or 7/100 of
        a percent.</p>
      <p>"On the face of it,
          that may not seem like much on an annual basis, but over the course
        of the 30-year lifespan of most bond issues, it can mean
          savings of up to $1.5 million dollars for the university on $100 million
        in debt," he explains.</p>
      <p>Snyder says several factors played into the new
          rating:</p>
      <p>. The very positive
          campus visitations the rating agencies had last spring;<br>
        . The recent sizable fund-raising contributions;<br>
        . A noticeable enrollment increase this fall, despite a tuition increase;<br>
        . The state appropriations for research infrastructure facilities that
          begin in fiscal 2008; and<br>
        . The good efforts of ASU's bond financial adviser to present the many
          positive attributes of ASU.</p>
      <p>In the report issued to investors around the
          world, Moody's cited several factors that contributed to the improved
          credit ratings.</p>
      <p>"We believe that
          ASU is well-positioned to maintain continued growth in enrollment,
        ultimately translating into increased student revenues
          to offset the university's rising debt burden," the report said. "ASU
          is developing into a multi-campus system serving the dynamic Phoenix
          metropolitan area, including the Main campus in Tempe, ASU East, ASU
          West, ASU Downtown, and extended (virtual) education. Very healthy
        projected demographic growth among traditional age students in Arizona
        should contribute
          to continued student demand, even as ASU further enhances its research
          capabilities. </p>
      <p>"Total enrollment across the university's four campuses
          is in excess of 52,000 full-time equivalent students for fall 2003,
        reflecting a nearly
          5 percent increase from last year's enrollment and a nearly 20 percent
          growth rate over the past five years. Most notably, this year's increase
          comes on the heels of a $1,000, or 40 percent increase, in tuition.
        Despite this significant one-year jump, tuition remains highly affordable
        compared
          to other states, with the university targeting tuition to remain within
          the lower one-third of all other states. To maintain affordability,
        the university has set aside a portion of the tuition increase for financial
          aid.</p>
      <p>"In addition to growing enrollment, the university's research activity
          has continued to increase, with research expenditures up over 20 percent
          in FY2003 from FY2002 levels," the report continued. "A significant
        portion of this increase reflected the second year of receipt of Proposition
          301 funds. Proposition 301 is a relatively new sales tax with a portion
          of proceeds dedicated for higher education. The current issue will
        continue
          the university's investment in its research enterprise, as will the
        legislature's recent approval of $185 million of research infrastructure
        funding for
          the university. The university will be issuing debt in its own name
        for this research investment, although the legislature has agreed to
        appropriate
          $14 million annually for 24 years beginning in FY2008 for debt service." </p>
