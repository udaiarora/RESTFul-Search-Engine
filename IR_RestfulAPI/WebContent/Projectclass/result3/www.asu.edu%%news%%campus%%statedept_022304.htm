      <h2>State Department recruiter reaches out to Hispanics </h2>
      <p>Harby Issa, Jr., Hispanic recruitment coordinator for the U.S. Department of State, will visit Arizona Feb. 23 - 24, to inform the Hispanic community about careers in the department, and to identify ways to increase the number of Hispanic Americans in the foreign service, civil service and internship programs. </p>
      <p>In the Department of State, of the 10,276 in the foreign service workforce, 5 percent are Hispanic; of the 4,509 working as foreign service specialists, 6.1 percent are Hispanic; and of the 7,362 working in civil service in Washington D.C., 4 percent are Hispanic. </p>
      <p>"It's been an ongoing effort of ours to recruit more Hispanics," says Issa, who was born in Nicaragua and raised in Miami, Fla. "It's very important for us, because we are trying to diversify our area, which represents our country in the national and international arena." </p>
      <p>While in Arizona, Issa also will seek to establish long-term and mutually beneficial relationships with professional members of the Hispanic community. </p>
      <p>Ambassador Sharon P. Wilkinson, a career foreign service officer, is the diplomat in residence at ASU for the 2003 - 04 academic year. She says Issa's visit is complementary to ASU's vision of global engagement. </p>
      <p>"Students who are seeking an international career would benefit from such a rewarding experience," Wilkinson says. "This would also benefit ASU because it would raise the consciousness about international issues in the community and it would be a point of pride for the university to be able to point to a larger number of graduates who are going into this career and ultimately having them become ambassadors." </p>
      <p>Department of State applicants must pass the Foreign Service Written Examination, which is offered only once a year. This year the exam is being offered nationwide April 24. Deadline to register is March 24. Applicants must be at least 20 years old, a U.S. citizen and as Issa says, "the more languages you know, the better." </p>
      <p>The four to five hour exam covers basic principles of management, geography, history, economics and English. For more information, visit the Web at (www.careers.state.gov). </p>
      <p>From 1996 through 1998, Issa served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Western Honduras. He worked in a remote village as a health educator, training local high school teachers and students in HIV prevention and awareness. He served as interpreter and liaison officer between U.S. Army National Guard personnel and local political leaders during several goodwill missions. </p>
      <p>From 1999 through 2002, Issa worked as a regional recruiter for the Peace Corps regional office in Atlanta. He was responsible for recruiting and hiring Hispanic Peace Corps volunteers from Puerto Rico, South Florida and the southeastern region. </p>
      <p>In October 2003, Issa stepped into his current role and is now covering the recruitment efforts for the United States. </p>
      <p>"Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to show the world that we are a diverse nation," says Issa, who has a B.S. in international studies and geography from Florida State University. "The benefit also comes from helping other Americans who are in need abroad. It's very rewarding." </p>
      <p>Issa will be available to speak with students Feb. 23 - 24, at Coor Hall, room 2240. To set up an appointment, call Wilkinson at (480) 965-8089. </p>
