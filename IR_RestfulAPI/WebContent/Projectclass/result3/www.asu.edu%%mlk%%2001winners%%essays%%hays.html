To Wham It May Concern:<br>
<br>
Do you have someone in your life that makes you want to smile every time you see him or her? I do. Her name is Mrs. Urlaub and she was my fourth grade teacher at Sandpiper Elementary. Mrs. Urlaub is the most awesome teacher I have ever had!  She has inspired many students throughout her career and I for one, can say, she certainly inspired me!<br>
<br>
Mrs. Urlaub is always there for her students.  During my fourth grade year, there were many times when I doubted myself.  It was during those times that she would be there to talk to me about why I was so sad.  She would help think through my problems and find solutions.   I'm not the only one she helps this way.  I have seen her spend time talking privately with lots of student to help them with their problems as well<br>
<br>
One time, I was having problems with my organizational skills.  I had lost some homework papers and I was almost in tears. Mrs. Urlaub looked through my notebook and found the missing work. She talked to me about the importance of being organized and then she gave me a big hug.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Urlaub also helps with school activities that reach many different grades such as Homework Club. Here she teaches grades four through six.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Urlaub was and is an awesome teacher and person in my school.   She demonstrates leadership through service by being there for her students.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,

</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
