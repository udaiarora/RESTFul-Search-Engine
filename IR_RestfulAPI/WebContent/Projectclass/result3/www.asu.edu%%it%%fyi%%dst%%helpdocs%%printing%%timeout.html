Timeout - Print Jobs Purged After Two Hours
</center></h2>
<p>
Print jobs sent to IT-provided printers in the public computing
sites can only remain in the print queue for <B>two hours</B>
before being <B>automatically purged</B>. This timeout does not
apply to other printers.
<p>
Print jobs are kept on hold in the print queue and not actually
printed until you pay for the print job with your Sun Card. Once
payment is made, the print job is released and printed. If you
wait longer than two hours to make payment, the print job is 
automatically purged from the print queue.
<p>
A purged print job cannot be recovered. If you need the printed
output from a purged job, you have to print the file again.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION:<br>
<blockquote>
Do not delete a disk file that you're trying to
print until after you have obtained the printed output. If the
print job is created by a program spooling directly to the
printer, you should consider modifying the program to write to 
a disk file instead of the printer.
