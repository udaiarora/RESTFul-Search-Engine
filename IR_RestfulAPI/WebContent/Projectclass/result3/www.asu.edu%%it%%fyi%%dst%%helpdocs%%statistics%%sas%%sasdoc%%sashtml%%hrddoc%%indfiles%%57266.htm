Moving and Accessing SAS Files across Operating Environments, Version 8
</H1><P>
Follow easy instructions for moving SAS files between operating            environments that run SAS versions 6.07 through 8.  The move process
involves the creation of a transport file on the local host and its        transfer to the target host where the transport file is imported in
native format. The type of move operation performed depends on the host    type, the SAS release that runs at each host, and the SAS member to be
moved. As an alternative, SAS/CONNECT is presented as a strategy for       moving files.  In addition, SAS/SHARE and features of CEDA (Cross
Environment Data Access) are described as methods for accessing data       in a cross-release environment. This book is intended for operating
system administrators, network administrators, applications                developers, and experienced SAS users.
