      <h2>Glass pushes for open access of social science research</h2>
      <p>        <img src="facstudents_images/Gene-Glass.jpg" alt="Gene Glass" width="180" height="262" align="right">A common thread throughout Gene Glass&rsquo; professional life has been computers. For the last decade, this professor of educational leadership and policy studies and recently inducted Regents Professor has created an environment of open access for social science research, especially in the education and education policy field, with his online journals.</p>
      <p>For more than 40 years, Glass has been writing, editing and publishing journals online as will as in print, in addition to teaching and conducting research in education policy analysis and statistics. He has published more than 200 books, chapters, reviews and articles and has been one of the most often cited educational researchers in the world in the past 15 years.</p>
      <p>His interest in computers was piqued while a German and mathematics undergraduate student at the University of Nebraska in the late 1950s. He was introduced to computers as a research assistant, working as a computer programmer in the psychology department.</p>
      <p>Glass admits, &ldquo;I thought it was worth a shot, better than scrubbing &#64258;oors, which is what I was doing then. Working with computers made me realize that I did not want to be a German or math teacher or scrub &#64258;oors for a living.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>After graduating at the young age of 24 with a Ph.D. in educational psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he worked as a professor at the University of Illinois for two years and then the University of Colorado, Boulder for 20 years before coming to ASU.</p>
      <p>During his time at the University of Colorado, he and colleague Mary Lee Smith, also recently named ASU Regents Professor, developed &ldquo;meta-analysis,&rdquo; an innovative statistical tool for evaluating research results across disciplines/studies, which is used today as the standard tool for the integration of empirical research in social sciences and medicine.</p>
      <p>In 1990 he realized the power of the Internet. Becoming frustrated with the print publishers&rsquo; reluctance to move journals online, in 1993, Glass established the Education Policy Analysis Archives, the oldest and only peer reviewed electronic journal in the education policy &#64257;eld.</p>
      <p>According to Glass, his online journal is not much different than the refereed journals that he had worked on for so many years. It has a peer review board made up of academics from all over the world.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I believe this knowledge should be shared and open to all,&rdquo; says Glass. &ldquo;Hard science research has been shared online for years. It&rsquo;s about time scholars in the social sciences use and accept this outlet.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Last year, the review board received for review more than 300 articles for the online journal. Even after more than 10 years of publishing online, still today, there are critics of what he does.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to break the stigma that some faculty and others have about online journals when it comes to the social sciences,&rdquo; says Glass. &ldquo;I also hope they realize that their work is being used by more than education-related professionals &mdash; that shows the power open access provides.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>One third of the visitors to his site are non-EDU users, according to Glass, who is proud about the number of actual &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; he gets to a site each weekday &mdash; more than 2,500. Hosts, he explains, are actual people in Internet lingo.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Parents, as well as K-12 teachers, reference the site because we have articles about education policy subjects from commercialism in schools and children&rsquo;s diets and exercise routines to the impact federal government policies have on state education systems and ethnic segregation in charter schools.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>He has put his self-taught computer savvy to use by creating other online journals &mdash; the Education Review, which is a journal of reviews of education related books, and, with the help of a MacArthur Foundation grant, the Journal of American Indian Education, which includes 40 years of journal articles written on American Indian education.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s his work with meta-analysis and push for open access of scholarly research during the last decade of which he is most proud.</p>
      <p>Computer technology has helped Glass revolutionize the way education and other social science scholars publish, moving from paper to online journals. Unfortunately, computers have been a mixed blessing for his family.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ironic that computer technology put the company my father worked for out of business in the &lsquo;60s/&rsquo;70s, and it&rsquo;s computer technology that helps me do what I do today,&rdquo; says Glass.</p>
      <p>Glass is one of eight new Regents Professors, the university&rsquo;s highest honor for faculty members. The others include Charles Arntzen, molecular biologist and the Florence Ely Nelson Presidential Endowed Chair; Ronald Carlson, English professor and author; Philip Christensen, Korrick Professor of Geological Sciences and Mars explorer; Luis Gomez-Mejia, Horace Steel Arizona Heritage Chair in management; Stephen Pyne, life sciences professor and authority on &#64257;re; Irwin Sandler, psychology professor, and Mary Lee Smith, educational leadership and policy studies professor.</p>
