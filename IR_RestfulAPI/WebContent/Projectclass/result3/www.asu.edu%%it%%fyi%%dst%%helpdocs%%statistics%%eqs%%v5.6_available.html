When will version 5.6 become available?
</center></h2>
<p> 
The current production version available on Research/Stats UNIX cluster 
is 5.1.  We have had to switch to 5.1 because of bugs in 5.6.  Recently 
we received information from the vendor they are working on a patch and 
will let us know when it becomes available.  No information is 
currently available on its delivery date.  In the meantime, if you do 
need to use 5.6, you can do so by doing a Telnet to "stats1.asu.edu".  
The stats1.asu.edu server is available only temporarily for a few 
months.  This server is an HP HP-UX machine whereas, the Research/Stats 
cluster are IBM AIX machines.
