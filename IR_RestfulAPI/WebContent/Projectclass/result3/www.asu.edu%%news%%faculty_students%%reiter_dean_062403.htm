      <h2>ASU taps Reiter to lead College of Architecture</h2>
      <p>        Wellington Reiter, AIA, an MIT professor, artist and architect from Boston,
          Mass., has been named as new dean of the College of Architecture &amp; Environmental
        Design (CAED) at ASU.</p>
      <p>Reiter currently is an associate professor of
            the practice of architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
            and principal of Urban
          Instruments Inc. He also is commissioner of design for the Boston Society
          of Architects.</p>
      <p>His professional work and interests span the range of disciplines
          from urban design to public art. Reiter is well known for his work
        on urban
          monuments and civic infrastructure, such as the project commemorating
          the 100th anniversary of the Wright Brothers' historic flight, which
          will open Dec. 17 at the Raleigh-Durham Airport.</p>
      <p>"'Duke' Reiter brings
          a vision for the 'new city,' - a concept of how to blend art, science,
          design and quality of life enhancement," said
          ASU President Michael Crow. "He is the intellectual fusion leader that
          the university needs to move ASU through this critical first decade
        of the 21st century." </p>
      <p>Reiter said his goal as dean of the college will be
          to "knit the diversity of scholarship, science and artistic activity
          at ASU into a dynamic situation
          for students and faculty alike.</p>
      <p>"I would not have considered coming to
          ASU without the desire for change and effectiveness that the new administration
          is advancing," said Reiter,
          who will begin work Aug. 1. "If ASU is to truly 'embrace its cultural,
          socio-economic, and physical setting,' as the president has suggested
          that it must do, then the college is necessarily at the forefront of
          such a campaign. Given this kind of upper level support, I see it as
          my mission to provide as many opportunities as possible for the faculty
          and students within our school to capitalize on this directive."</p>
      <p>"We were
          most fortunate to have an extraordinarily rich pool of applicants for
          this deanship, which reflects well on the college and the university,"
          said ASU Executive Vice President and Provost Milton Glick. "We believe
          Duke Reiter is the right leader at the right time who will build on
        a strong foundation and increase the impact of the college in the metropolitan
          community and among national and international scholars and practitioners." </p>
      <p>Reiter replaces John Meunier, who was dean of the college for 15 years
          and has joined the School of Architecture faculty after spending a
        year working on a PBS series on desert cities of the world. Ronald McCoy
        served
          as interim dean during the 2002 - 03 academic year and will return
        to his position of director of the School of Architecture.</p>
      <p>Reiter earned
          a graduate degree at the Harvard University School of Design, and his
          bachelor's degree from Tulane University. He also has studied
          at the North London Polytechnic and the Architectural Association in
          London. His firm, Urban Instruments, has been the recipient of several
          awards from the American Institute of Architecture, the Boston Society
          of Architects and the Architectural League of New York for buildings,
        interiors and large-scale urban design projects.</p>
      <p>In 2002 he was a Fellow
          at the MacDowell Colony, an artists' colony founded in Peterborough,
          N.H., in 1907. The Colony provides an environment in
          which creative artists are free to pursue their work without distraction.
          In 1991 - 92, Reiter was a visiting artist at the American Academy
        in Rome. Reiter has exhibited his sculpture and drawings in galleries
        throughout
          the United States and in London, and has written several books and
        numerous essays and articles, including "Vessels and Fields," published
        by Princeton
        Architectural Press.</p>
      <p>Reiter is married and has two children. His wife,
            Patricia, has a degree in business and also is an architect. Their
          sons are Emerson, 15, and
        Adrian, 11.</p>
