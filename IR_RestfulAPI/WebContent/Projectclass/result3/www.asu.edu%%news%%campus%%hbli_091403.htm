      <h2>HBLI hosts forum on education issues</h2>
      <p>        ASU's Hispanic Border Leadership Institute (HBLI) is challenging
        people's way of thinking about the educational system and its affect
        on the
        Latino community. </p>
      <p>HBLI is hosting "Latino Education in the Southwest
          All One System," on Sept. 19, in the ASU Memorial Union. The one-day
          event will focus on
          solutions to educational problems faced by the Latino communities in
          the Southwest.</p>
      <p>HBLI Executive Director Leonard Valverde says the forum,
          free and open to the public, is an expansion of the "Platica Speakers,"
          series that
          HBLI introduced seven years ago. He says a large group of education
        experts will share their viewpoints and provide plenty of beneficial
        information
          to students, faculty members and administrators.</p>
      <p>"As history shows, the
        education of students of color in the United States has been inequitable
        and therefore inferior," says Valverde, who is also
        a professor of Educational Leadership &amp; Policy Studies at ASU. "Since
        the passage of Congressional legislation under the Great Society banner
        of President Lyndon B. Johnson, education of students of color has improved
        unevenly, and over these 40 years, some regression has taken place. The
        all-day forum will focus on lessons learned about what works, successful
        programs, not the usual 'let's discuss the problems.'"</p>
      <p>Presenters will
          include Jorge Chapa, director of the Hispanic Research Institute at
        Indiana University. Chapa will be speaking on "The Future
          of Latinos and the Implications for Education Systems as Revealed in
          the Latest Demographics," from 8 to 9:30 a.m.</p>
      <p>"The top three challenges
          the U.S. educational system faces are educating children who are not
          fluent in English, educating Latinos whether or
          not they are fluent in English and finding the money to pay for their
          vital services," Chapa says. "I hope audience members will become aware
          of how Latino demographic and educational trends present a challenge
          that we all must address in order to ensure the social, political and
          economic future of the United States."</p>
      <p>Other featured speakers throughout
          the one-day event include: Shernaz Garcia, associate professor and
        graduate adviser with the University
          of Texas at Austin; Baltazar Acevedo, professor with the University
        of Texas at Brownsville; Augustine Gallego, chancellor of the San Diego
          Community College District; Roberto Haro, professor with San Francisco
          State University; and Eugene Garcia, dean of the College of Education
          at ASU.</p>
      <p>Frank Lopez, executive director of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of
          Commerce (USHCC) Foundation will be the keynote speaker during a special
          reception
          and dinner at 6 p.m., Sept. 19. This event, by invitation only, will
          feature Lopez's presentation, "How We Can Support and Improve the Public
          Education of Latino Youth." The USHCC Foundation is committed to giving
          Latino youth alternatives for life preparation and life-long learning
          by developing and implementing initiatives to awaken and nurture the
          entrepreneurship spirit of Latino youth.</p>
      <p>Valverde says the event will
          serve as an eye-opening experience to people who attend.</p>
      <p>"We want to inform people that Latinos have many assets that
          the educational system is not taking advantage of," Valverde says.
        "That Latinos are
          as capable and talented as any other student group, that they are just
          as eager to learn when they start school as any other student."</p>
