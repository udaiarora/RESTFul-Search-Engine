                        <p>All members of the academic professional staff in the University Libraries hold one of three ranks. Librarians are designated as Assistant Librarian, Associate Librarian, and Librarian (also called Full Librarian). Archivists are designated as Assistant Archivist, Associate Archivist and Archivist (also called Full Archivist). Learning Resources Specialists are designated as Assistant Learning Resources Specialist, Associate Learning Resources Specialist and Learning Resources Specialist (also called Full Learning Resources Specialist). The rank system is intended to indicate professional standing and to provide a qualitative rationale for promotion.</p>
                  <br>
                  
                    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
                    <DD>
                        <p>The Review Committee makes a recommendation to the Dean of University Libraries of appropriate rank to offer a prospective appointee. The recommendation is based on academic training, comparable library and/or related professional experience, and demonstrated professional achievement at a level consistent with the ranks as defined.</p>
                    <br>
                
                    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
                    <DD>
                    <p>Promotion in rank serves the double purpose of acknowledging accomplishments and of encouraging further progress at the next level. Academic professionals apply for promotion when they think they have met the obligations imposed by the rank held and believe they are capable of the level of achievement that the next rank demands. Granting of a promotion signifies that the peers and administrators involved in evaluating the promotion request concur with that assessment.</p>

                              <p>Assistant is a broad rank, encompassing academic professionals with a great variety of skills and experience.</p>
                            <br>

                          <dt>&nbsp;</dt>

                              <p>All academic professionals appointed to this rank meet the minimum criteria for appointment, but some may have had little or no professional experience in the field. Initially, inexperienced academic professionals spend a large portion of their time learning to do their jobs effectively and efficiently. Their professional development activities are often related to improving both job performance and general understanding of their field. Service opportunities may be circumscribed by time constraints and by lack of knowledge about the Libraries, the University, or the community at large.</p>

                              <p>As Assistants gain experience, they are expected to improve their job performance; take progressively more responsibility for their own day-to-day assignments; experiment with various kinds of professional development activities to discover where their interests and abilities lie; take advantage of increasing opportunities for service.</p>
                         <br>
                     
                          <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
                          <DD>
                              <p>Academic professionals appointed to or functioning at the Assistant rank who have had some professional experience, either at ASU or at another institution, spend time refining their job performance skills. Their professional development and service activities become more substantial and often more structured as they prepare to move toward continuing appointment and promotion.</p>

                          <p>Academic professionals at this level are expected to provide successful job performance; to take full responsibility for their day-to-day assignments; to engage in professional development and service activities that are both intrinsically useful and appropriate to their career plans.</p>

                              <p>Academic Professionals appointed to or functioning at this rank meet or exceed the criteria for initial appointment and have usually had some years of professional experience in the field. Academic professionals at this level have attained considerable expertise in the areas of competence required by their positions and are able to function autonomously. The professional development activities of Associates are often related to refining or extending special skills or to broadening the scope of their professional or academic interests. Opportunities for service are more numerous and the experience necessary for most service activities increases.</p>

Academic professionals at this level have demonstrated a very high level of competence in job performance and are considered experts in their chosen fields. Both the professional development activities and the service activities of academic professionals at this rank involve sharing knowledge and experience with others in some way or providing substantial guidance and leadership in areas of professional or academic interest.</p>
