          <h2>President&rsquo;s Recognition Reception honors award recipients </a></h2>
          <p>Eighty recipients of the President&rsquo;s Medal for Social Embeddedness, the President&rsquo;s Award for Innovation and the top multiple SUN Award winners were honored by ASU President Michael Crow at the President&rsquo;s Recognition Reception April 19 in the Alumni Lounge. The following is a list of the award winners. </p>
          <p align="center"><strong> SUN Awards </strong></p>
          <p> The SUN Award for Individual Excellence is a peer recognition award that provides specific and immediate recognition to fellow employees for demonstrations of individual excellence in such areas as creative activity, continuous improvement, fostering cooperation, providing exemplary service, valuing diversity and promoting ASU. </p>
          <p> In 2004, more than 1,500 SUN Award certificates were presented to ASU employees. </p>
          <p> Four individuals were selected as ASU&rsquo;s 2004 Top Multiple SUN Award Recipients: Lindy Baker, Student Affairs, West campus; Shona Bodai, Human Resources, Tempe campus; Clinton Everhart, Student Affairs, East campus; and Christy Robinette, Office of Research and Sponsored Projects Administration. </p>
          <p align="center"><strong> President&rsquo;s Award for Innovation </strong></p>
          <p> Two teams received the President&rsquo;s Award for Innovation.

The innovation is an original program, project, initiative or technique that has been implemented and has generated results. </p>
          <p align="center"><strong> Library Evolution 3: Microsoft to Linux Migration </strong></p>
          <p> Fletcher Library has migrated 71 public workstations and 14 support servers from a Microsoft operating system and architecture to a Linux operating system and open source/open systems architecture.
