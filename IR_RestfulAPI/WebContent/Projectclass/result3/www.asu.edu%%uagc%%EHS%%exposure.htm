The rule, commonly referred to as the bloodborne pathogens standard, was promulgated under the authority of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and was designed to eliminate or minimize occupational exposure to Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and other bloodborne pathogens.</span></font></p>

In an effort to eliminate or minimize exposure to bloodborne pathogens, the standard requires employers to institute a program of engineering and work practice controls, personal protective clothing and equipment, informational training, Hepatitis B vaccination, post exposure evaluation and follow-up, sign and label programs, and other provisions for employees who may be reasonably anticipated to come into contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials during the performance of their duties.</span><b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><br>

The file will be accessible for viewing and copying by employees, employee representatives, and regulatory authorities during normal business hours, i.e., Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM until 5:00 PM (excluding university approved holidays).&nbsp;<a name="METHODS OF COMPLIANCE">METHODS OF COMPLIANCE</a><a name="Universal Precautions">Universal Precautions</a>Universal precautions will be observed by all university employees to prevent contact with blood and other potentially infectious materials. Under circumstances in which differentiation between body fluid types is difficult or impossible, all body fluids will be considered potentially infectious.Universal precautions are methods of preventing disease by preventing transfer of blood and contain body fluids, e.g., semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, and saliva in dental procedures. The underlying concept of universal precautions is that all blood and certain body fluids are considered to be infectious for bloodborne pathogens. In most situations, an employee will treat all blood and certain body fluids as though they contained bloodborne pathogens and would accomplish this through a variety of measures including, but not necessarily limited to:  </span></font></p>

In those situations where leeway must be accorded the provider of health care or public safety services, the employees must not ignore the underlying concept of universal precautions nor should he or she decline to use any personal protective equipment simply because it is not practical to use all the equipment appropriate to the task. Only under unexpected extraordinary circumstances will employees have the option of deciding not to use personal protective equipment if they feel such equipment will prevent the proper delivery of health care or public safety services or will create a greater hazard to their personal safety if they used such equipment.The universal precaution exemption provided in the standard applies not to the general concept of universal precautions, but only to the use of personal protective equipment under rare and relatively limited circumstances.<a name="Engineering and Work Practice Controls">Engineering and Work Practice Controls</a>Engineering and work practice controls serve to reduce employees exposure in the workplace by either removing the hazard or isolating the worker from exposure. In fact, these control measures are viewed as the primary means of eliminating or minimizing employee exposure. These controls may include process or equipment redesign, e.g., self-sheathing needles, process or equipment enclosure, e.g., biosafety cabinets, and employee isolation. In general, engineering controls act on the source of the hazard and eliminate or reduce employee exposure without reliance on the employee to take self-protective action. Once implemented, engineering controls protect the employee permanently, subject only, in some cases, to periodic replacement or preventative maintenance. By comparison, work practice controls reduce the likelihood of exposure through alteration of the manner in which a task is performed. While work practice controls also act on the source of the hazard, the protection they provide is based upon the behavior of the employer and employee behavior rather than installation of a physical device such as a protective shield.The two control methodologies frequently work in tandem because it is often necessary to employ work practice controls to assure effective operation of engineering controls. Where occupational exposure remains after institution of these controls, departments must provide and assure employees use personal protective equipment as supplemental protection. Primary reliance on engineering controls and work practices for controlling exposure is consistent with good industrial hygiene practice and with the OSHA traditional adherence to a hierarchy of controls. The hierarchy specifies that engineering controls and work practices are to be used in preference to personal protective equipment.Engineering and work practice controls will be used by university facilities and employees to eliminate or minimize employee exposure. Where occupational exposure remains after institution of these controls, personal protective equipment will also be used. Engineering controls will be examined and maintained or replaced on a regular schedule to ensure their effectiveness. The following engineering and work practice controls have been designed and are in place at all university facilities that present potential bloodborne pathogens exposure issues.Hand washing facilities are readily accessible in the workplace to employees that are reasonably anticipated to contact blood or other potentially infectious materials during the performance of their duties. In the event that handwashing facilities are not feasible, provisions will be provided for the placement of either an appropriate antiseptic hand cleanser in conjunction with clean cloth/paper towels or antiseptic towelettes. When antiseptic hand cleansers or towelettes are used, employees have been instructed to wash their hands with soap and running water as soon as feasible.Employees are required to wash their hands immediately or as soon as feasible after removal of gloves or other personal protective equipment. And, most importantly, employees are required to wash their hands and any other skin with soap and water, or flush mucous membranes with water immediately or as soon as feasible following contact of such body areas with blood or other potentially infectious materials.Contaminated needles and other contaminated sharps will not be recapped or removed unless it can be demonstrated by the department that no alternative is feasible or that such action is required by a specific medical procedure. Under these circumstances, recapping or needle removal shall be accomplished through the use of a mechanical device or a one-handed technique.Immediately or as soon as possible after use, contaminated reusable sharps shall be placed in appropriate containers until properly reprocessed.

The container for storage, transport, or shipping shall be labeled or appropriately color-coded and closed prior to being stored, transported, or shipped. When universal precautions are utilized in the handling of specimens, the labeling/color-coding of specimens is not necessary provided containers are recognizable as containing specimens. This exception only applies while such specimens/containers remain within the facility. Appropriate labeling/color-coding is required when such specimens/containers leave the facility.In the event that outside contamination of the container occurs, the primary container will be placed within a second container which prevents leakage during handling, processing, storage, transport, or shipping and will be appropriately labeled or color-coded. If the specimen could puncture the primary container, in addition to the aforementioned required container characteristics, the primary container will be placed within a secondary container which is puncture-resistant.Equipment which may become contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious materials will be examined prior to servicing or shipping and will be decontaminated as deemed necessary, unless it can be demonstrated that decontamination of such equipment or portions of such equipment is not feasible. An appropriate readily observable label will be attached to the equipment stating which portions remain contaminated. The department is responsible to ensure that this information is conveyed to all affected employees, the servicing representative, and/or the manufacturer as appropriate, prior to handling, servicing, or shipping so that appropriate precautions will be taken.<u>Needlestick Safety and Prevention</u>Needlesticks and other percutaneous injuries resulting in exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials are of concern due to the high frequency of their occurence and the severity of the health effects associated with exposure. When these injuries involve exposure to infectious agents, the affected workers are at risk of contracting disease. Workers may also suffer from adverse side effects of drugs used for post-exposure prophylaxis and from psychological stress due to the threat of infection following an exposure incident.The definition of &quot;Engineering Controls&quot; has been modified to include examples of safer medical devices, such as sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems. This change clarifies that safer medical devices are considered to be engineering controls under the standard. The term &quot;Engineering Controls&quot; includes all control measures that isolate or remove a hazard from the workplace, encompassing not only sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems but also other medical devices designed to reduce the risk of percutaneous exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Examples include blunt suture needles and plastic or mylar-wrapped glass capillary tubes, as well as controls that are not medical devices, such as sharps disposal containers and biosafety cabinets. A wide variety of medical devices have been developed to reduce the risk of needlestick and other sharps injuries. These &quot;safer medical devices&quot; replace sharps with non-needle devices or incorporate safety features designed to reduce the likelihood of injury.<O:P> </O:P> </span></font></p>

No one medical device is appropriate in all circumstances of use. For compliance purposes, an &quot;appropriate&quot; safer medical device includes only devices whose use, based on reasonable judgment in individual cases, will not jeopardize patient or employee safety or be medically contraindicated. Although new devices are being continually introduced, OSHA recognizes that a safer device may not be available for every situation. If a safer device is not available in the marketplace, ASU is not required to develop any such device. Furthermore, an &quot;effective&quot; safer medical device is a device that, based on reasonable judgment, will make an exposure incident involving a contaminated sharp less likely to occur in the application in which it is used.<O:P> </O:P> <a name="Personal Protective Equipment">Personal Protective Equipment</a>When there is occupational exposure, the department will provide at no cost to the employee, appropriate personal protective equipment such as, but not limited to, gloves, gowns, laboratory coats, face shields or masks and eye protection, and mouthpieces, resuscitation bags, pocket masks, or other ventilation devices. Personal protective equipment will be considered &quot;appropriate&quot; only if it does not permit blood or other potentially infectious materials to pass through to or reach the employee's work clothes, street clothes, undergarments, skin, eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes under normal conditions of use and for the duration of time which the protective equipment will be used.The department will ensure that the employee uses appropriate personal protective equipment unless it can be demonstrated that the employee temporarily and briefly declined to use personal protective equipment when, under rare and extraordinary circumstances, it was the employee's professional judgment that in the specific instance its use would have prevented the delivery of health care or public safety services or would have posed an increased hazard to the safety of the worker or co-worker. When the employee makes this judgment, the circumstances shall be investigated and documented in order to determine whether changes can be instituted to prevent such occurrences in the future.The department will ensure that appropriate personal protective equipment in the appropriate sizes is readily accessible at the worksite or is issued to employees. Hypoallergenic gloves, glove liners, powderless gloves, or other similar alternatives will be readily accessible to those employees who are allergic to the gloves normally provided.The department will clean, launder, and dispose of personal protective equipment at no cost to the employee. The department will repair or replace personal protective equipment as needed to maintain its effectiveness, at no cost to the employee.If a garment is penetrated by blood or other potentially infectious materials, the garment will be removed immediately or as soon as feasible. All personal protective equipment will be removed prior to leaving the work area. When personal protective equipment is removed it will be placed in an appropriately designated area or container for storage, washing, decontamination or disposal.Gloves shall be worn when it can be reasonably anticipated that the employee may have hand contact with blood, other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin; when performing vascular access procedures; and when handling or touching contaminated items or surfaces.Disposable, single use, gloves such as surgical or examination gloves, will be replaced as soon as practical when contaminated or as soon as feasible if they are torn, punctured, or when their ability to function as a barrier is compromised. Disposable, single use, gloves will not be washed or decontaminated for reuse. Utility gloves may be decontaminated for reuse if the integrity of the glove is not compromised. However, they must be discarded if they are cracked, peeling, torn, punctured, or exhibit other signs of deterioration or when their ability to function as a barrier is compromised.Masks in combination with eye protection devices, such as goggles or glasses with solid side shields, or chin-length face shields, will be worn whenever splashes, spray, spatter, or droplets of blood or other potentially infectious materials may be generated and eye, nose, or mouth contamination can be reasonably anticipated.Appropriate protective clothing such as, but not limited to, gowns, aprons, lab coats, clinic jackets, or similar outer garments will be worn in occupational exposure situations. The type and characteristics will depend upon the task and degree of exposure anticipated. Surgical caps or hoods and/or shoe covers or boots will be worn in instances when gross contamination can reasonably be anticipated, e.g., autopsies, orthopaedic surgery.<a name="Housekeeping">Housekeeping</a>Departments will maintain worksites in a clean and sanitary condition. The department will determine and implement an appropriate written schedule for cleaning and method of decontamination based upon the location within the facility, type of surface to be cleaned, type of soil present, and tasks or procedures being performed in the area.All equipment and environmental and working surfaces will be cleaned and decontaminated after contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials. Contaminated work surfaces will be decontaminated with an appropriate disinfectant after completion of procedures; immediately or as soon as feasible when surfaces are overtly contaminated or after any spill of blood or other potentially infectious materials; and at the end of the work shift if the surface may have become contaminated following the last cleaning.Protective coverings, e.g., plastic wrap, aluminum foil, or imperviously-backed absorbent paper, used to cover equipment and environmental surfaces, will be removed and replaced as soon as feasible when they become overtly contaminated or at the end of the work shift if they may have become contaminated during the shift.All bins, pails, cans, and similar receptacles intended for reuse which have a reasonable likelihood for becoming contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious materials will be inspected and decontaminated on a regular scheduled basis and cleaned and decontaminated immediately or as soon as feasible upon visible contamination.Broken glassware which may be contaminated will not be picked up directly with the hands. The spill and/or debris will be cleaned up using mechanical means such as a brush and dust pan, tongs, or forceps.Reusable sharps that are contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious materials will not be stored or processed in a manner that requires employees to reach by hand into the containers where these sharps have been placed.Contaminated sharps will be discarded immediately or as soon as feasible in containers that are: </span></font></p>

These pathogens include, but are not limited to, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Clinical Laboratory: a workplace where diagnostic or other screening procedures are performed on blood or other potentially infectious materials.Contaminated: the presence or the reasonably anticipated presence of blood or other potentially infectious materials on an item or surface.Contaminated Laundry: laundry which has been soiled with blood or other potentially infectious materials or may contain sharps.Contaminated Sharps: any contaminated object that can penetrate the skin including, but not limited to, needles, scalpels, broken glass, broken capillary tubes, and exposed ends of dental wires.Decontamination: the use of physical or chemical means to remove, inactivate, or destroy bloodborne pathogens on a surface or item to the point where they are no longer capable of transmitting infectious particles and the surface or item is rendered safe for handling, use, or disposal.Director: the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or designated representative.Engineering Controls: controls, (e.g., sharps disposal containers, self-sheathing needles, or safer medical devices, such as sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems) that isolate or remove the bloodborne pathogens hazard from the workplace.Exposure Incident: a specific eye, mouth, other mucous membrane, non-intact skin, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that results from the performance of an employee's duties.Hand washing Facilities: a facility providing an adequate supply of running potable water, soap, and single use towels or hot air drying machines.Licensed Healthcare Professional: a person whose legally permitted scope of practice allows him or her to independently perform the activities required by paragraph (f) Hepatitis B Vaccination and Post-exposure Evaluation and Follow-up.HBV: Hepatitis B virus.HCV: Hepatitis C virus.HIV: Human Immunodeficiency Virus.Needleless Systems: a device that does not use needles for (A) the collection of bodily fluids or withdrawal of body fluids after initial venous or arterial access is established, (B) the administration of medication or fluids, or (C) any other procedure involving the potential for occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens due to percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps.&nbsp;Occupational Exposure: reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that may result from the performance of an employee's duties.Other Potentially Infectious Materials: 1) The following human body fluids: semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva in dental procedures, any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids; 2) Any unfixed tissue or organ (other than intact skin) from a human (living or dead); and 3) HIV-containing cell or tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV- or HBV-containing culture medium or other solutions; and blood, organs, or other tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV or HBV.Parenteral: piercing mucous membranes or the skin barrier through such events such as needle sticks, human bites, cuts, and abrasions.Percutaneous: penetration of the skin.Personal Protective Equipment: specialized clothing or equipment worn by an employee for protection against a hazard. General work clothes, e.g., uniforms, pants, shirts, or blouses, not intended to function as protection against a hazard are not considered to be personal protective equipment.Production Facility: a facility engaged in industrial-scale, large-volume, or high concentration production or HIV or HBV.Regulated Waste: liquid or semi-liquid blood or other potentially infectious materials ; contaminated items that would release blood or other potentially infectious materials in a liquid or semi-liquid state if compressed; items that are caked with dried blood or other potentially infectious materials and are capable of releasing these materials during handling; contaminated sharps; and pathological and microbiological wastes containing blood or other potentially infectious materials.Research Laboratory: a laboratory producing or using research-laboratory-scale amounts of HIV or HBV. Research laboratories may produce high concentrations of HIV or HBV but not in the volume found in production facilities.Sharps with Engineered Sharps Injury Protections: a non-needle sharp or a needle device used for withdrawing body fluids, accessing a vein or artery, or administering medications or other fluids, with a built-in safety feature or mechanism that effectively reduces the risk of an exposure incident.Source Individual: any individual, living or dead, whose blood or other potentially infectious materials may be a source of occupational exposure to the employees. Examples include, but are not limited to, hospital and clinic patients; clients in institutions for the developmentally disabled; trauma victims; clients of drug and alcohol treatment facilities; residents of hospices and nursing homes; human remains; and individuals who donate or sell blood or blood components.Sterilize: the use of a physical or chemical procedure to destroy all microbial life including highly resistant bacterial endospores.Universal Precautions: an approach to infection control. According to the concept of Universal Precautions, all human blood and certain human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens.</span></font></p>
