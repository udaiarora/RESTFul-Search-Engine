      <h2>Initiative coordinates, promotes sustainability at ASU</h2>
      <p>As the Valley
          grows into a thriving metropolis in the harsh desert, its relationship
          with the natural environment is becoming increasingly
            important. With sustainability - the concept of creating economic
        and human vitality while being environmentally sensitive - such a vital
            issue for ASU and the state's long-term well-being, the university
        is launching a series of efforts in the area.</p>
      <p>"We live today with the
            realization that human impact on natural systems has long-term outcomes
            - both positive and negative - for our social,
          economic and cultural futures," says ASU President Michael Crow. "The
          dynamics of understanding sustainability and the development of knowledge
          and tools to advance economic and environmental well-being will be
        a critical area of interest to academic communities, as well as to the
        broader public and private sectors."</p>
      <p>Crow says the region must begin "a
          transition toward a sustainable future." With that in mind, ASU is
        approaching the concept through academic teaching
          and research, administrative actions and educational efforts for the
        university community.</p>
      <p>One of the key efforts is the new University Sustainability
          Committee. The committee, led by Chairwoman Lee Overmyer, associate
        vice president
          for Administration and Finance, will focus on promoting sustainability
        at ASU through community awareness. </p>
      <p>A major role of the committee will
          be to coordinate education efforts and serve as a bridge between many
          current groups and programs on campus,
          such as ASU Clean and Beautiful, the Campus Arboretum, the Travel Reduction
          Program, the Energy Conservation Committee and the ASU Recycling Program.
          All of the individual efforts focus on a single area, but all relate
        to the overarching concept of sustainability. </p>
      <p>"These programs and committees
          all have charges related to important sustainability concepts," says
          Overmyer. "ASU has started down the path
        toward sustainability but there is considerable distance to go."</p>
      <p>Each
          of the groups will have representation on the committee. Geography
        Professor Michael Pasqualetti and Architecture Professor Harvey Bryan
        also will add expertise to the committee.</p>
      <p>To open the educational effort,
          the committee sponsored a live telecast Oct. 9 of "Got Sustainability?
          Plan For It!," a national production of
          the Society for College and University Planning. The telecast, to recognize
        the first national Campus</p>
      <p>Sustainability Day, featured a panel of recognized
          sustainability experts discussing the role of higher education in the
          process. ASU had the largest attendance of the 150 universities participating
        in the event, with more than 150 students, faculty and staff attending.</p>
      <p>On
          the academic side, the university launched the Consortium for the Study
          of Rapidly Urbanizing Regions this summer in the Center for Environmental
          Studies, in part to look at the role of urban environments in the environment
          as a whole. Within the umbrella of the consortium is Greater Phoenix
          2100, which looks at the long-term consequences of policy and development
          decisions. Additional research efforts are being developed and will
        be launched in the near future.</p>
      <p>Overmyer says everyone on the ASU campuses
          can participate in the efforts through their daily actions. For information,
          call Overmyer at (480)
        965-3201 or (lee.overmyer@asu.edu).</p>
