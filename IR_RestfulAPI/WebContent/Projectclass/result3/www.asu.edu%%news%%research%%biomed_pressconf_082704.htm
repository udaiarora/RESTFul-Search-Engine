      <h2> ASU, UA join forces on biomedical campus plan </h2>
      <p align="left">Two of Arizona's leading universities have agreed to combine forces in efforts to improve medical education and research. On Aug. 20, the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) approved a memorandum of understanding between ASU and the University of Arizona (UA) to create the Phoenix Biomedical Campus of the Arizona University System. </p>
      <p align="left">The memorandum of understanding, signed by ABOR President Gary Stuart, ASU President Michael Crow and UA President Peter Likins on Aug. 9, expresses the commitment of the parties to work together to expand medical education and research in Phoenix. It outlines several first principles critical to the planned expansion of the UA's College of Medicine on the Phoenix Biomedical Campus of the Arizona University System. </p>
      <p align="left">"This partnership maximizes the collective assets of ASU and UA and most efficiently builds upon existing capabilities throughout the state of Arizona," Crow said during an Aug. 9 press conference. "This significant partnership will allow ASU to obtain a medical school program and UA to expand its existing medical school into metro Phoenix. The entire state university system will benefit." </p>
      <p align="left">Gov. Janet Napolitano, one of the leaders who launched this collaborative plan, said Aug. 4 was a significant day for higher education and the state. </p>
      <p>"This is a historic agreement made between two universities who often rivaled each other," she said. "Now the rivalries are left to the athletic arena. There are no winners and losers - just winners." </p>
      <p>The expansion of the medical school in Phoenix will allow both universities to strengthen existing programs to meet health care and cultural needs for all state residents. In addition to biomedical informatics, ASU will begin offering undergraduate medical school education and will embark upon educational and research efforts in Native American health care, nursing and nutrition. </p>
      <p>Crow said the new campus will provide ASU with increased opportunities for research funding, joint appointments and other academic linkages. ASU academic units that will be enhanced through the Phoenix Biomedical Campus of the Arizona University System will include biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, immunology, microbiology, pharmacology, neurobiology, genetics, economics/public health, bioengineering, molecular and cellular biology, nutrition, kinesiology, law, science and technology, human dimensions/bioethics, nursing, medical technology, anthropology, family studies and biostatistics. </p>
      <p>The regents also approved: </p>
      <p>. Replacement of the Computer-Aided Dispatch and Records Management System (CAD/RMS) for ASU's Department of Public Safety. The goal of this project is to implement an integrated Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD), Records Management (RMS), and mobile data computing system. This system will provide real-time information gathering and sharing capability to ASU DPS as it serves the three campuses. This information project will allow ASU DPS to replace its existing CAD/RMS system, which is approaching a decade of use and is technologically outdated. The new system is anticipated to cost $1.3 million over the next five years and should be fully operational by April of next year. ASU DPS will be able to rapidly access required state and federal law enforcement databases and communicate with other law enforcement agencies. </p>
      <p>. Implementation of the bachelor of science in engineering degree (ASU's East campus) and to establish the Department of Engineering in the College of Technology and Applied Science (ASU's East campus). </p>
      <p>. Approval of the fiscal year 2005 Initial All Funds Operating Budget, which combines the state operating budgets and the universities' local fund budgets into a comprehensive summary that includes projected revenues, expenditures and year-end balances. </p>
      <p>. Implementation for instructional/research laboratory renovations Phase II at an estimated cost of $20 million. This project will renovate various physical and life sciences labs located in 10 buildings. The project received capital development plan approval at the June board meeting. It will be funded with system revenue bonds, with debt service provided from tuition, indirect cost recovery and other local funds. This project includes the renovation of about 66,000 square feet of various science and engineering labs in the Life Sciences Center A, C and E wings; Physical Science C wing, Engineering Research Center, Engineering Center G wing, Goldwater Center, Schwada Classroom Office Building, Applied Biological Sciences Greenhouses (ASU's East campus) and Health Sciences Center Annex (ASU's East campus). </p>
