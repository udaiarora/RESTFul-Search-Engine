Department, school, division, college, and university requirements may change and are upgraded often. In determining graduation requirements, an undergraduate student may use only one edition of the <i class="Italic">General Catalog</i> but may elect to follow any subsequent catalog. Students maintaining continuous enrollment at any public Arizona community college or university may graduate according to the requirements of the catalog in effect at the time of initial enrollment or according to the requirements of any single catalog in effect during subsequent terms of continuous enrollment. Students may maintain continuous enrollment whether attending a single public community college or university in Arizona or transferring among public institutions in Arizona while pursuing their degrees. Students transferring among Arizona public higher education institutions must meet the admission, residency, and all curricular and academic requirements of the degree-granting institution.</p><p class="List-Num-1-lead"><a name="pgfId-1057766"></a>1. A semester in which a student earns course credit is counted toward <i class="Italic">continuous</i> enrollment. Noncredit courses, audited courses, failed courses, or courses from which the student withdraws do not count toward the determination of <i class="Italic">continuous</i> enrollment for catalog purposes. See examples A and B in the <a href="graduation-reqs.html#49915" class="XRef">Continuous Enrollment</a> table, below.</p><p class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-1087917"></a>2. Students who do not meet the minimum enrollment standard stipulated in number 1 during three consecutive semesters (fall/spring/fall or spring/fall/spring) and the intervening summer term at any public Arizona community college or university are no longer considered continuously enrolled. (Note that students are not obligated to enroll and earn course credit during summer terms, but summer enrollment may be used to maintain continuous enrollment status.) These students must meet requirements of the public Arizona community college or university catalog in effect at the time they are readmitted or of any single catalog in effect during subsequent terms of <i class="Italic">continuous</i> enrollment after readmission. See examples C and D in the <a href="graduation-reqs.html#49915" class="XRef">Continuous Enrollment</a> table, below.</p><p class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-1057768"></a>3. Students admitted or readmitted to a public Arizona community college or university during a summer term must follow the requirements of the catalog in effect the following fall semester or of any single catalog in effect during subsequent terms of <i class="Italic">continuous</i> enrollment. See example E in the <a href="graduation-reqs.html#49915" class="XRef">Continuous Enrollment</a> table, below.</p><p class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-1057769"></a>4. In areas of study in which the subject matter changes rapidly, material in courses taken long before graduation may become obsolete or irrelevant. </p><p class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-1391487"></a>5. Course work that is more than eight years old is applicable to completion of degree requirements at the discretion of the student&#8217;s major department. Departments may accept such course work, reject it, or request that the student revalidate its substance. The eight-year limit on course work applies except when program accreditation agencies limit the life of course work to fewer than eight years. Departments may also require students to satisfy current major requirements rather than major requirements in earlier catalogs when completing earlier requirements is no longer possible or educationally sound.</p><p class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-1076212"></a>6. Enrollment by Arizona community college students in nontransferable courses still constitutes enrollment for purposes of determining whether the student has been continuously enrolled. For example, if a student takes two semesters of cooperative education classes, which are not transferable to the university but constitute <i class="Italic">continuous</i> enrollment at the community college, the university should consider it <i class="Italic">continuous</i> enrollment.</p><p class="List-Num-2"><a name="pgfId-1391302"></a>7. Exceptions made by an institution apply only to the institution that made the exception. For example, if the community college departments accepted credit that was more than eight years old, the university department to which the student transfers has the right and the obligation to reevaluate any credit more than eight years old.</p><p class="Body-4-above"><a name="pgfId-1391303"></a>Inquiries about these guidelines may be directed to the student&#8217;s academic advisor.

(DOG) using the <a name="marker-1388181"></a>Degree Audit Reporting System (DARS). DARS is an automated process that matches courses a student has completed with the requirements of a particular academic degree program, resulting in a report that shows the student which requirements are satisfied and which remain to be fulfilled, thus providing a guide for efficient selection of courses toward graduation. For example, a student majoring in Biology would request a Degree Audit Report that would show how his or her completed ASU and transfer course work would apply to the Biology degree program.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1223826"></a>Each student must submit a DOG form no later than the semester in which he or she earns the 87th semester hour. The DOG process confirms the degree requirements under which the student is enrolled, as indicated on the degree audit report for that academic program and catalog year. The student should review his or her degree audit with an academic advisor to assure an accurate interpretation. Some departments may require the DOG earlier than the 87th hour. Students failing to submit the DOG are prevented from further registration.</p><p class="FM-C-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1057783"></a><a name="marker-1140511"></a>Application for Graduation Requirements</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1057784"></a>The following steps are required to complete the graduation process:</p><p class="List-Num-1-lead"><a name="pgfId-1057785"></a>1.

Some majors, however, require more than 120 semester hours.</p><p class="Body"><a name="pgfId-1057800"></a>Although the three shaded circles are equal in size and the white circle is larger than all three, the total number of semester hours for each type of requirement may vary.</p></div><div><h6 class="FM-D-Heading"><a name="pgfId-1057801"></a>University Requirements</h6><p class="Body-NO-indent"><a name="pgfId-1131129"></a>The light gray circle represents university requirements.
