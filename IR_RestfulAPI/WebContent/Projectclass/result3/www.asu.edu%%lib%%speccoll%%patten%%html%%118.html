<p>This main work in this volume, the Discourse on Forest-Trees, was written
as a protest against the destruction of trees in England by glass factories
and iron furnaces. It succeeded in inducing land-owners to start reforestation&nbsp;
programs.&nbsp; Also included in this work are Evelyn's treatise on earth,
"relating to the Culture and Improvement of it for Vegetation, and the
Propagation of Plants, &amp;c.;" an appendix concerning Fruit-trees, "in
relation to Dider, the Making, and several ways of Ordering it;" a discourse
on Sallets, which "in general consist of certain Esculent Plants and Herbs,
Improv'd by Culture, Industry, and Art, of the Gard'ner;" and a Gard'ner's
Almanac, "directing what he is to do Monthly throughout the Year; and what
Fruits and Flowers Are in Prime."&nbsp; John Evelyn is most famous for
his Diary.
