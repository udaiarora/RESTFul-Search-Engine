                  <a name="top"></a>Technical Services Priorities</H2><br>
                <h3>The following is Section I of the Technical Services Review Team Report.</h3>
               <br>

                  <p ALIGN="left">The priorities working document was developed by the Technical Services Review Team. The Team was guided in part by information provided through its 1998 customer survey and through a series of customer meetings held in the spring of 2000. Taking into consideration the needs and preferences of TS customers, the Team examined the requirements of a large and multi-faceted operation, the constraints of a generally rule-based and routine-driven workflow, and the various professional responsibilities of TS staff to all their customers, internal and external.</p><br>
                  <p ALIGN="left">Working initially from the sound but negative principle that &quot;everything can't be first,&quot; the Team moved to the more positive assertion that &quot;essential things will be first&quot; and then grappled with isolating and defining those essentials. The result is not, of course, a tidy sequence of the 1, 2, 3 sort. Rather, the priorities policy focuses on the broad types of service TS provides, with reasons for the importance of each and further reasons why some must take precedence over others. The Team has also provided general groupings of types of materials with remarks on the relative place of each in the TS workflow. By taking this approach, the Team was able to produce guidelines for internal operations that are neither so vague as to be meaningless nor so rigid as to hamper service or preclude experimentation.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3 ALIGN="left">Allocation of time and personnel resources</h3> 
                  <br>
                  <p ALIGN="left">Three essential attributes of an effective TS organization are responsiveness, productivity, and flexibility. <strong><em>Responsiveness</em></strong> is the capacity to deal with immediate needs for specific items or services. Rush order requests, flagged materials, pre-circ requests, reports of Online Catalog errors that impede access, telephone queries, and intra-unit workflow cooperation represent a sampling of the situations that require TS staff to respond at once. It is difficult to predict demand or plan for these kinds of services in other than a general way. Good communication, cross-training, and careful organization of materials help; so does some restraint and a sense of relative importance on the part of requestors. TS prides itself on this kind of service and will continue to consider responsiveness to immediate needs a high priority.</p><br>
                  <p ALIGN="left"><strong><em>Productivity</em></strong> refers to the day-to-day accomplishment of TS work. Enormous amounts of material pass through TS and enormous numbers of individual tasks are completed entirely unremarked except in the aggregate, when statistics are compiled, accounts closed for the year, or surveys taken for one purpose or another. High rates of general productivity enable TS to discharge its responsibility to all users, especially those without vocal representatives in the system. Productivity prevents excessive backlogs, raises the Libraries' standing in the library community at large, minimizes the necessity for special search requests, and above all supports the teaching and research mission of the University by providing students and scholars with the materials they need. By far the largest share of TS time and resources, spread as equitably as possible among all subjects and formats, is concentrated on general productivity. This will continue to be the case even if, regrettably, it must sometimes be at the expense of improved responsiveness or important special interests.</p><br>
                  <p ALIGN="left"><em><strong>Flexibility</strong></em>, in general terms, means that the organization is alive to its surroundings, able to react effectively as conditions or circumstances change and prepared to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise. The early and relatively trouble-free introduction of automation to ASU Technical Services, the recent and continuing involvement of TS personnel in ventures such as the Library of Congress Program for Cooperative Cataloging, and the progress of the Technical Services Review provide examples of the value that Technical Services places on this kind of general flexibility.</p><br>
                  <p ALIGN="left">More specifically, flexibility can refer to the organization's capacity to redirect all or part of its resources to exceptional situations or needs. (TS defines &quot;exceptional&quot; as requiring an uncommon investment of time to accomplish, requiring special skills, arriving in large batches all at once, having non-negotiable deadlines attached, or deviating markedly from standard procedures for similar materials). Such redirection may be temporary, as for a special project, or permanent, as for accommodating a new, on-going program. TS has responded repeatedly to the challenge of the exceptional but the cost in terms of productivity and morale can be high. Lack of advance notice or planning, shortage of requisite skills among existing staff, and the time-consuming nature of many exceptional materials or projects have resulted occasionally in less than satisfactory situations for all concerned. </p><br>
                  <p ALIGN="left">In order to meet the obligations of responsiveness and productivity, and to retain the capacity for general flexibility, TS must exercise careful control over the number and kind of exceptional services it undertakes and the timing of such services. Uncontrolled &quot;flexibility&quot; is actually chaos. The TS Management Team is responsible for monitoring the work of TS as a whole and for allocating the time and skills available in TS for exceptional activities.</p><br>
                  <h3 ALIGN="left">Languages, formats and programs</h3>
                  <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p ALIGN="left">The following groupings are assembled from a TS perspective. The priorities among them are general, relative, and developed solely from pragmatic considerations. TS does not make workflow decisions based on the intrinsic intellectual value, or lack thereof, of any program or field of study and does not entertain ad hoc arguments for or against any discipline on that basis. </p><br>
                  <p ALIGN="left"><i><b>Electronic resources</b></i></p>  
                  <p ALIGN="left">Customer comments confirmed the Team's supposition that the single area of most interest and concern is electronic resources. It seems likely that electronic resources will be a top priority and will consume a large part of TS time and energy from now on. Customer demand for these materials is high; timeliness is often a factor; many standard scholarly tools are shifting to electronic availability only. The obstacles to smooth integration of these materials into the existing TS workflow include communication problems with other areas in the Libraries, lack of trained staff, delay in developing agreed-upon national standards for cataloging ER, the tendency of ER materials to arrive in &quot;packages&quot; comprised of many individual titles, and the fact that the level of library acquisitions in traditional formats has not declined appreciably. </p><br>
                  <p><i><b>Particular requests (any language or format)</b></i></p>  
                  <p ALIGN="left">These include rushes, other flagged materials, material for any reference location, material required for course reserve or class use, and pre-circ requests. These are now and will remain a top priority. Material that is particularly time sensitive should be flagged or brought to TS attention in some way for inclusion in this group.</p><br>
                  <p><i><b>English language new receipts</b></i></p>  
                  <p ALIGN="left">The presumption, born out in part by pre-circ requests, flagged materials, and responses from customers, is that these materials will be in demand and should be processed quickly. TS makes no distinction among subjects or formats.</p><br>
                  <p><i><b>Foreign language materials (roman alphabet)</b></i></p>  
                  <p ALIGN="left">Most of the time these materials are processed at the same priority level as English. There is, for example, no longer a separate foreign language holding area for cataloging. But if choices must be made, English will take precedence on the grounds of customer demand and TS productivity. Languages for which TS has no in-house expertise cause particular problems and may move slowly, especially if original cataloging is required.</p><br>
                  <p><i><b>Non-roman language material</b></i></p>  
                  <p ALIGN="left">The TS Non-Roman unit processes Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Russian language materials. Recent and on-going reorganization consolidates ordering, receiving and cataloging in the same place. Thai cataloging is out-sourced; Burmese is cataloged if an LC card number and a catalog record are available. This is an area where TS finds it difficult to meet the needs of the polyglot ASU community effectively; more work is needed to find or create acceptable approaches to non-roman materials processing.</p><br>
                  <p ALIGN="left"><i><b>Serials</b></i></p>  
                  <p ALIGN="left">Seriality, whether in periodicals or journals or monographic series, is a high-maintenance, labor-intensive concept to sustain. The timeliness of serial publications and their popularity and usefulness among researchers in all disciplines require that they be considered a high priority, but some of the activities and routines associated with serials as a group can be deferred if necessary. In general, new titles take precedence over backfiles, new cataloging over maintenance, and receiving over claiming. If choices must be made among subjects, science serials will take precedence over other disciplines in which currency is a less pressing issue.</p><br>
                  <p><i><b>ASU theses and dissertations</b></i></p>  
                  <p ALIGN="left">TS has been repeatedly assured by public service staff, and can corroborate from experience, that the time spent to put brief records for ASU theses in the Online Catalog is well spent. Most of the staff in Original Cataloging contribute to thesis cataloging and the flow of complete records is steady.</p><br>
                  <p ALIGN="left"><i><b>Gifts</b></i></p>  
                  <p ALIGN="left">Gift materials can be flagged as particular requests on the same basis as other receipts. Unflagged gifts for the general collection may have a lower priority than new receipts in some areas of TS but are usually part of the regular workflow.</p><br>
                  <p ALIGN="left"><i><b>Non-print formats other than ER</b></i></p>  
                  <p ALIGN="left">Most non-print formats require some degree of special training for staff and may be, in some areas, entirely the responsibility of one or two people. For staff with responsibility for both print and non-print materials, print may take precedence.</p><br>
                  <p><i><b>Collection purchases</b></i></p>  
                  <p ALIGN="left">Large collection purchases in any format are difficult to insert into the regular workflow without upsetting other priorities. Planning and negotiation are essential. No large (more than 500 titles) collection automatically takes precedence over regular receipts; if such displacement is to occur, everyone affected must be aware of the fact. Gradually working the collection into the regular routine is usually a better solution.</p><br>
                  <p ALIGN="left"><i><b>Special collections, circulating and non-circulating</b></i></p>  
                  <p ALIGN="left">These collections each have a selector or collection head with whom TS staff can discuss specific priorities for the collection. Some collections are best served by the same general priorities that TS uses for the general stacks; others benefit from a more customized approach. TS regards the needs of the special collections as a group as neither more nor less compelling than the needs of the general collection and strives to maintain a balance of time and resources spent on each. </p><br>
                  <h3>Selectors&#146; control over priorities</h3>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p ALIGN="left">Priority flags are available in the review room and may also be requested from the Administrative Assistant in TS. <strong><em>Yellow rush flags</em></strong> put material at the head of any line; <em><strong>green notification flags and reference flags</strong></em> (any reference location) are next. Plain, <em><strong>dark green strips</strong></em> assure that the material will be processed ahead of unflagged material. Material from any source or in any format, including gifts and serials, can be flagged. </p><br>
                  <p ALIGN="left">Flags work well for individual titles. Groups of materials that need to have a priority - high or low - assigned should be discussed with the TS Management Team. Selectors or collection heads who personally control the flow of materials into cataloging units can of course send what they choose and usually work closely with the catalogers.</p><br>
                  <p ALIGN="left">Selectors must remember that TS is responsible for meeting everyone&#146;s needs. TS may need to limit the amount of time and resources spent on a particular subject or collection in order to provide a reasonable level of service to other areas.</p><br>
                  <h3 ALIGN="left">Periodic priorities review</h3>
                  <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Although the basic priority values of responsiveness, productivity and flexibility are likely to remain stable, Technical Services realizes that emphasis on specific formats, languages or disciplines will change as the University's and the Libraries' programs evolve. Therefore, an annual review of TS priorities will take place at the time when the yearly budget allocations take place. This review, in combination with selectors' opportunities to control priorities with flags and consultations, will enable Technical Services to adapt the workflow to customer needs and expectations in an orderly and systematic way.</p> <br> <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p align="left"><i><b><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></b></i></p>
