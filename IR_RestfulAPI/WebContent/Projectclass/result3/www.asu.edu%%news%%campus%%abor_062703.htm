      <h2>ASU earns green light for renovations, housing project</h2>
      <p>        The Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) held a somber, but productive
        meeting on June 19. ABOR members, who reported from the three university
        locations
          via video conference, began their meeting with a moment of silence
          for Blake Anderson, director of state relations at ASU, who had passed
          away that morning of complications from lupus, following a brief hospitalization.        </p>
      <p>ABOR President Jack Jewett said, "Blake was very instrumental in keeping
          us informed about legislative matters and he will be greatly missed."</p>
      <p>As
          agenda items for the final meeting of the 2002 - 03 fiscal year were
          presented, ABOR members approved ASU's purchase of approximately 1.3
          acres of property along Sunset Drive for the South Campus Housing Project.
          This project will be managed by the same company that manages Adelphi
          Commons, ASU's current public-private group housing. Construction for
          is expected to begin in August and completed by June 2004.</p>
      <p>ABOR also approved
          ASU's request to increase its budget for the Brickyard Tenant Improvement
          Project by $1.9 million. ASU received project approval
          at the April meeting with a proposed budget of $7 million. Utilizing
          the Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) process, ASU received a guaranteed
          maximum price of $8.9 million.</p>
      <p>The approved project includes the remodeling
        and reconfiguration of up to 130,000 square feet in multiple buildings
        and floors of the Brickyard
        in Tempe. The complex will house the Institute for Computer and Information
        Sciences &amp; Engineering (ICISE), which is being created to centralize
        the university's key academic and research programs in computer science.
        These improvements will support offices, mediated classrooms and laboratories
        (teaching and research) for various computer science and engineering
        programs. The $1.9 million increase is due to the need for a higher level
        of building security and connectivity; an increased number of instructional/research
        laboratories and a need for higher caliber instructional/research laboratories.
        Completion of this project is set for August.</p>
      <p>Other items that were approved
          included:</p>
      <p>. ASU's request to enter into
          a Technology Transfer management agreement with Arizona Science and
        Technology Enterprises LLC (AZTE). AZTE was
          organized May 29 as an Arizona limited liability company with the ASU
          Foundation as its sole member. AZTE's purpose, under the leadership
        of Peter Slate, chief executive officer, is to perform technology transfer
          management services for all ASU technology. Under this agreement, ASU
          will pay AZTE an annual fee for the services. The annual fee will cover
          almost all of AZTE's annual operating expenses. The AZTE preliminary
          draft budget for fiscal year 2004 is approximately $3.3 million.</p>
      <p>. Renovations
          for the Packard Stadium clubhouse and playing field. The project consists
          of construction of a new players clubhouse and locker
          facilities, a renovated entry including a new ticket booth, novelty
        sales area and a "walk of champions" to celebrate ASU's baseball crowning
        achievements. </p>
      <p>In addition, the renovation of existing coaching facilities and extensive
          upgrading of the playing field were also approved as part of the project.
          Renovations will include an upgrade to the electrical supply system,
          an ADA compliant plaza over the new clubhouse (with elevator), additional
          plaza renovation and a bermed grass seating area for spectators. The
          clubhouse, ADA plaza and coaching facilities renovations will be advertised
          for bid at a later date.</p>
      <p>Based upon the increased scope of work, the total
          project cost needs to be increased from the approved $2.0 million to
          $2.85 million and is
          to be funded by Certificates of Participation (COPS) and repaid by
        the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics Capital Fund Raising Campaign.
          Packard Stadium was built in 1974. A clubhouse and locker room area
        were
          added in the mid-1980s.</p>
      <p>. Academic program and organizational unit changes.
          ASU received approval for the creation of a doctor of audiology degree
          (Au.D), the establishment
          of the department of Information Systems and the establishment of the
          Russian and East European Studies Center. </p>
      <p>The next meeting of the Arizona
          Board of Regents is scheduled Aug. 14 - 15 at Northern Arizona University.</p>
