<h3>uni-XEDIT syntax</h3>

<p>To start a uni-XEDIT session from the Unix command line, enter the 
following command:

<blockquote><code>
xe files [-Prof profname] [-NOKeybind] [-NOMsg] [-NOProf] [-help]
</code></blockquote>

where "xe" is the command to invoke uni-XEDIT, "files" is the name of 
one or more existing or new files to be edited, and "profname" in the 
name of a macro to be executed when the editor is started. (A macro is a 
disk file which contains editor line commands or a uni-REXX 
program.)</p>

<p>In the absence of -PROF or -NOPROF, the profile macro 
".profile.xedit" in your home directory is executed automatically. A 
profile macro allows you to customize your editing session, including 
the keyboard mapping.</p>

<p>-PROF causes uni-XEDIT to execute the macro "profname". The macro's 
filename may be any valid Unix filename with a simple or complex 
extension; a filename with no extension is not permitted as a macro. For 
example, "aa" has no extension and is invalid; "aa.bb" has a simple 
extension; and, "aa.bb.cc" has a complex extension. If the extension is 
".xedit" (a simple extension), the extension may be omitted from the 
command line. If the filename has a simple extension other than ".xedit" 
or has a complex extension, the complete name must be used. NOTE: If the 
macro is not in the current directory, an appropriate path must be 
included as part of the filename.</p>

<p>If the macro filename is ".profile.xedit", any of the following is 
correct; however, the latter two examples are equivalent to the first 
three examples only if the current directory is the home directory. If 
the current directory is not the home directory, the latter two examples 
refer to a macro in the current directory.</p>

<blockquote><code>
xe textfile<br>
xe textfile -prof $HOME/.profile<br>
xe textfile -prof $HOME/.profile.xedit<br>
xe textfile -prof .profile<br>
xe textfile -prof .profile.xedit
</code></blockquote>

<p>If the macro filename is "mymacro.xedit" then either of the following 
is correct:</p>

<blockquote><code>
xe textfile -prof mymacro<br>
xe textfile -prof mymacro.xedit
</code></blockquote>

<p>If the macro filename is "sample.startup" or "my.setup.xedit" then 
the following is correct:</p>

<blockquote><code>
xe textfile -prof sample.startup<br>
xe textfile -prof my.setup.xedit
</code></blockquote>

<p>If -NOPROF is specified, no profile macro is executed at startup 
time.</p>

<p>-NOKEYBIND suppresses the default keyboard mappings (i.e., the escape 
key and control key equivalents of 3270 keys). Only definitions supplied 
by SET KEYBIND commands are used. This includes the ENTER key. If 
-NOKEYBIND is omitted, both the default keyboard mappings and the SET 
KEYBIND commands are used.</p>

<p>-NOMSG suppresses all diagnostic messages, including those generated 
by EMSG, MSG, or QUERY commands.</p>

<p>-HELP provides help on the syntax for starting uni-XEDIT.</p>

<p><em>NOTE:</em> If you regularly use both the stats cluster and the 
research cluster, a different profile macro is needed for each system 
(because differences in vendor implementations preclude using the same 
keyboard mapping). In this situation, you should (for example) create a 
profile macro named "stats.xedit" (with the keyboard mapping for the 
stats system) and a profile macro named "research.xedit" (with the 
keyboard mapping for the research system). (The 
<a href="key.html">key</a> utility is used to create the keyboard 
mapping.) Assuming these macros are in your home directory, the 
following commands would be typical for editing a file:</p>

<blockquote><code>
xe textfile -prof $HOME/stats<br>
xe textfile -prof $HOME/research
</code></blockquote>

<p>If you regularly use only one system and only occasionaly use 
another, you could use ".profile.xedit" in your home directory for the 
most commonly used system and a different name for least commonly used 
system. If the most commonly used system is stats and the less commonly 
used system is research, ".profile.xedit" and "research.xedit" could be 
used, respectively, for the stats and research systems. In this 
situation, the first example below would be typical for the stats system 
and the second for the research system:</p>

<blockquote><code>
xe textfile<br>
xe textfile -prof $HOME/research
</code></blockquote>
