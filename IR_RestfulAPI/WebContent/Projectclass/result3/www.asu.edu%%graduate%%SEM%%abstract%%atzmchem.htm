<i>Abstract: </i> Thin heteroepitaxial films of Si<sub>1-x-y</sub>Ge<sub>x</sub>C<sub>y</sub> have been grown on (100)Si substrates using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition at 625°C.  The crystallinity, composition, and microstructure of the SiGeC films were characterized using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, secondary-ion-mass spectrometry, and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. The crystallinity of the films was very sensitive to the flow rate of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> which served as the C source.  films with up to 2% C were epitaxial with good crystallinity and very few interfacial defects.  Between 800 and 900 seem of 10% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> in He, the C content increased dramatically from 2% to 10% and the as-growth films changed from crystalline to amorphous.  In order to establish deposition conditions for the crystalline-amorphous phase transformation, one SiGeC film was deposited as the 10% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> flow was increased linearly from 500 to 1500 sccm during growth.  When the C content reached ~4%, the film developed considerable stacking defects and disorder, and at around 11% C, the film became amorphous.<p>
