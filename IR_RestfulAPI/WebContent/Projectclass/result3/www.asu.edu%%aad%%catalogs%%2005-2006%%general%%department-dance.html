The Department of Dance is committed to providing a stimulating and diverse environment where students develop as scholars, educators, and artists through participation in innovative programs, residencies, performances, and partnerships. All students registering in a degree program enroll through the Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts. Admission policies and procedures and the specific requirements of each Bachelor of Fine Arts degree concentration are available from the Department of Dance Advisement Office.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
<a id="a45785"></a>Audition/Admission.</b> 
Students applying to the university as freshmen or transfer students who are interested in becoming dance majors are granted preprofessional status. Individuals intending to enroll in the undergraduate dance degree program and participate in dance major classes are required to pass an entrance audition before being admitted to the department&#8217;s dance major classes. These auditions take place in the spring of each academic year. Auditions, conducted by the Dance faculty, determine technical proficiency, placement, and scholarship awards. Criteria for placement in dance technique classes are published in the department&#8217;s student handbook. The handbook is available through the Dance Advisement Office and on the department&#8217;s Web site. Students who do not successfully complete the audition are allowed to remain in preprofessional status for two semesters. At the end of that term they are allowed to re-audition.</p>
<p>
By the second semester of their sophomore year all dance preprofessional students who have passed the audition must petition for admission into one of the four concentrations: choreography, dance education, dance studies, or performance. Depending upon the concentration selected, the petition process may include a technique audition, and the submission of video tapes of choreographed works, an artistic portfolio, a writing sample, and a written statement of intent and/or research interests. All students are interviewed and must have a 3.00 GPA before being accepted into an area of concentration.</p>
<p>
Specific criteria and policies related to petition procedures for each of the concentrations are available through the Dance Advisement Office and on the Web site. Admission is highly selective. Students who fail to meet the criteria for the concentrations are not dismissed from the Bachelor of Fine Arts program and may re-petition once during the following semester. If a student still fails to meet the criteria of one of the four concentrations, he or she will not be dismissed from the university altogether; the student may transfer to another program. Students should work closely with the department advisor during the decision-making process.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Scholarship Auditions.</b> 
Highly competitive scholarship auditions are conducted for incoming and transfer students during the Spring Admission Audition. For more information, contact the Dance Advisement Office.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext">
<p class="noindent"><b>
Transfer Students, Dance Minors, and Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies Students.</b> 
Transfer, minor, and BIS students must successfully complete the admittance audition before enrolling in Dance major courses. Additionally, transfer students who have completed music theory for dance, dance production, or choreography courses at other institutions must also take placement examinations in these areas. These examinations are offered during the August and January orientation periods.</p></div>

Dance&#8212;BFA</b>
<a id="a61333"></a></h2>
<div class="bodytext">
<p>
The faculty in the Department of Dance offer a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree at the undergraduate level with four areas of concentration: choreography, dance education, dance studies, and performance. All new students are admitted into the preprofessional program and petition for admission into one of the concentrations during the sophomore year of study. Transfers, who have successfully completed the admission audition, may petition into one of the four concentrations after one semester in residence. Further details may be obtained from the Department of Dance.</p></div>
