What do the NASA Voyager Spacecraft, silent films, the Yaqui Indians, the US Senate Special Committee on Aging, and the Marine Corps all have in common?  Music, of course!<br><br>
The government of the United States is the most prolific publisher in the world, producing information covering any and all topics which the government has a hand in ? scientific research, the arts, statistics, legislation, history, current events, foreign affairs, anthropology ? if you can think of it, there is probably a related government report or statistic that has been produced.<br><br>
As an important component of our society and culture, music has its share of representation in government information.  From Frances Densmore?s pioneering ethnomusicology work with Native Americans for the Bureau of American Ethnology to streaming audio of military field bands ? there is music.  In addition, certain agencies such as the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress focus on the study, maintenance, and sharing of cultural information, and include histories, bibliographies, and exhibits that may surprise you.<br><br>
ASU is one of over 1,200 Federal Depository Libraries in the United States, responsible for making U. S. government information available to ?We the People?.  Government Documents Service in Hayden Library currently collects 92% of the information made available through the Federal Depository Library Program, and since becoming a Federal Depository Library in 1944, Government Documents Service has acquired publications going back to the earliest days of the nation.<br><br>
It is safe to say the Government Documents collection runs deep and wide.  We hope that you enjoy this exhibit, which highlights some of our music-related materials.  We invite you to visit Government Documents Service on Level 3 of Hayden Library!

<h1 align="center">Publishing on the Borders:<br>
					30 Years of Latina/o Publishing by the Bilingual Review Press
</h1>
<h2 align="center">January 17 ? March 9, 2007</h2>
<table width="100%"><tr><td><blockquote>
<p>
<img src="borders.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" class="fourth">
The ASU Libraries are pleased to showcase a broad selection of books published by and artwork commissioned by the internationally renowned Bilingual Review Press (BRP). The exhibit coincides with ASU Libraries? hosting of the 2007 Transborder Library Forum/FORO Transfronterizo de Bibliotecas from February 20-24, 2007 on the Tempe campus.<br><br>
Founded in 1973 and housed at the ASU Hispanic Research Center since 1986, the BRP publishes literature and scholarship primarily by or about U.S. Latinos and Latinas. In the last 33 years, the BRP has garnered international recognition through numerous important prizes and awards (eight American Book Awards, two Western States Book Awards, a PEN Oakland Josephine Miles Award, and a Carl Sandberg Literary Award).<br><br>
Language use worldwide?in English, Spanish, Apache, Chinese, French, Italian, and Portuguese, among others?has been a major focus of the Press since its inception. The BRP has produced award-winning translations and bilingual editions of many literary works, usually with facing-page translations. The BRP?s journal, Bilingual Review/Revista Bilingüe, now in its 34th year, continues to bring forth quality articles in the areas of bilingualism, bilingual education, and ethnic scholarship, as well as the best creative literature by established and emerging Hispanic writers.<br><br>
The independent press has given voice to important Latina writers, such as Ana Castillo, Alma Luz Villanueva, Marjorie Agosín, Alicia Gaspar de Alba, Demetria Martínez, Elva Treviño Hart, and local novelist Stella Pope Duarte from South Phoenix, who have been overlooked by mainstream publishers. The Chicano Classics/Clásicos Chicanos series is intended to ensure the long-term accessibility of deserving works of Chicano literature and culture and includes works by celebrated authors such as  Ron Arias, Aristeo Brito, Rolando Hinojosa, Miguel Méndez, Alejandro Morales, Estela Portillo Trambley, and Tino Villanueva.<br><br>
Since 1998, the BRP has embarked on major new projects that include commissioning and selling lithographs and serigraphs by Chicana/o and other Latina/o artists as well as compiling and producing an ambitious series of art books and electronic publications. The first component was an award-winning book, Contemporary Chicana and Chicano Art: Artists, Works, Culture, and Education (2002). A second book, Chicano Art for Our Millennium (2004), was developed in connection with an exhibition of the same title at the Mesa Southwest Museum in spring 2004. Triumph of Our Communities: Four Decades of Mexican American Art followed in 2005.<br><br>

<h1 align="center">ASU Libraries Reorganization</h1>
<table width="100%"><tr><td><blockquote>
<p>
Dr. Capaldi announced in the reorganization of the ASU academic model, the actualization of the New American University, that the libraries will be administered centrally.  The immediate changes occasioned by this announcement are several.  The University Librarian and Dean title used on the Tempe campus is changed to University Librarian.  The Associate Dean titles used on the Tempe campus are changed to Associate University Librarian.  Consistency is brought to the titles of the librarians administering the libraries on the Polytechnic, West, and Downtown campuses; each incumbent having the title Director.  The reporting relationship of these Directors changes to the University Librarian.  Each campus Library Director will have a dotted line relationship to the campus executive vice president and executive vice provost.<br><br>
The libraries and librarians on each ASU campus have actively supported instruction and research in the past.  This will not change.  We will continue to work together on all campuses to realize the goal of one university library in many places to support one university in many places.  What will change is our opportunity to effectively utilize our resources to conceptualize and deliver systems, collections, and services to the entire ASU community.<br><br>
I am confident that this concept of the ASU Libraries will reflect that the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts.

Want to find out the latest news from the ASU Libraries on all campuses?  Check out the latest podcast on the <a href="https://thelibrarychannel.blog.asu.edu"></a>Library Channel:  Fall 2006 Wrap-Up</a>.  As students donned their graduation caps and boarded trains, planes and automobiles to join their families for the winter break, four representatives of the ASU Libraries, one from each of ASU campus, joined Fred McIlvain to celebrate and reflect on the close of the Fall 2006 Semester. Topics discussed included the opening on the Downtown campus library, the challenges and rewards of sharing space with other university services at both Polytechnic and Downtown libraries, the opening of the new Starbucks at the Fletcher Library on the West campus, as well as the development of specific study spaces in the Tempe campus libraries.  Stephen Pelphrey, Ellen Welty, Tammy Allgood and Jennie Duvernay joined host Fred McIlvain for this informative session.
