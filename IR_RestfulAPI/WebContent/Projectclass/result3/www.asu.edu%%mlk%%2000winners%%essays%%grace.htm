        Dad, My Hero</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ken F. Grace was 
        my dad. He was my hero because he helped everyone in the church and community. 
        He made friends wherever he went. He went around parks and freeways picking 
        up trash. I loved going with him picking up trash. One time he was driving 
        my brother and his friend home. My brother's friend dropped a paper bag 
        out of the car. My dad stopped the car and made him walk back and pick 
        it up.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He really liked a 
        kid named Spencer who didn't have a good family life. He let Spencer come 
        to our house all the time and we took him a lot of places we went. Spencer 
        became like a 6th son to him and a 6th brother to us.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My dad worked as 
        a crane inspector. He was a respected employee to his company. He is still 
        respected everywhere in my family and to his friends. When he died from 
        falling off a 100ft crane, everyone was shocked when they heard the news! 
        Nothing is the same anymore.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He always helped 
        others and cared about the environment. I'm trying to be as good as him 
        but I'm not doing very good. I'm really trying hard to follow in his footsteps.</font></p>
