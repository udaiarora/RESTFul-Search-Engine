          Johnson is most widely known for being a world-class athlete,
          having played in the NBA for 12 seasons with the Phoenix Suns
          before retiring in May of 2000. During his storied career, he
          was named to the All-Star team three times and received a gold
          medal in the 1994 World Championship games.
        <p class="textsmall"> Not so well known is the fact that he is a world-class philanthropist
            and community activist, giving back especially to the Oak Park
            neighborhood of Sacramento, California, in which he was raised.
            Early on in his career, Johnson made a commitment to helping
            children in the disadvantaged area.
        <p class="textsmall"> In the summer of 1989, he founded St. HOPE Academy, an after-school
              educational program in Oak Park that trains young people
          to become leaders and provides them with opportunities for educational,
              social and spiritual growth. He later spearheaded a fundraising
              drive that culminated in the construction of a $1 million
          facility
              for local students and their parents. In 1996, he also started
              a branch of the Academy in Phoenix to serve junior high and
              high
              school students.
        <p class="textsmall"> Kevin also started a foundation to provide educational grants
              to students, and in 2002 he founded St. HOPE Public Schools,
              a charter school district, which includes a 1,700-student
          high school and a 200-student K-4 elementary school.        
        <p class="textsmall">In addition to having contributed well over a million dollars
                to organizations nationwide, Johnson served on the board
                of directors for the Phoenix Suns Charities, Christian
          Athlete Ministries, Phoenix Symphony and the School House Foundation. He also
                speaks regularly to groups of school children and addresses universities
                and community groups on economic development and public policy issues.

		<p class="textsmall"><img src="images/atavizon.jpg" alt="Arlene Tavizon" width="180" height="248" hspace="8" border="0" align="right">As
          a student activist and a senior in life sciences at ASU West,
          Arlene Tavizon is known for her many contributions to the campus
          and the community at large. Her activities range from student
          organizations and student advocacy committees to serving at food
          banks and organizing conferences on human rights and youth issues.        
        <p class="textsmall"> She has long volunteered at Tonatierra Community Development
            Institute, helping with English classes and a food bank. Each
            week Arlene loads food boxes at St. Mary&#8217;s Food Bank
            and takes them to Tonatierra to distribute to the hungry, the
            elderly
            and the frail. She helped plan the Tonatierra human rights
            conference and works with residents to give them a voice.        
        <p class="textsmall"> Arlene is active in student government as a senator and also
              in Native American and Latino organizations on campus, focusing
              on motivating students to vote and promoting cultural events,
              all the while maintaining a high grade-point average. As
          a student representative at Arizona Town Hall, she promoted cultural
              diversity
              and minority access in higher education. She participated
          in
              a Native American book drive and fund raiser, helped run
          voter registration drives and was active in children&#8217;s
          activities for Dia de los Muertos and Cinco de Mayo celebrations.
          She is
              known for rallying others to participate in the causes in
          which she believes.        
        <p class="textsmall"> The descendant of Mexican farmers and ranchers, Arlene learned
              from them about nature&#8217;s relationship with the elements,
              plants and animals, and she is carrying that into a career as
              a biomedical researcher. She plans to pursue graduate studies
              in public health and epidemiology, hoping to be a catalyst in
              developing natural medicines that may prevent and treat diabetes
          and cancer, two diseases that have affected her family.
