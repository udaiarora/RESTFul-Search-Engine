<P>---. <I>The Pre-Raphaelites</I>. London: Studio Vista, 1970. This work
provides a general introduction to both the art and the philosophy of the
Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, attempting to focus on the uniqueness of the
group while still placing it within the context of the historical period.
The paintings of Rossetti, Hunt and Millais are examined in detail, and
the contributions of other less well-known members and associates of the
Brotherhood are also considered. The last chapter of the work examines
the successors to the Pre-Raphaelites, relating them to the Aesthetic Movement
and Art Nouveau. This work has numerous illustrations, including some in
color. PRB-44</P>
