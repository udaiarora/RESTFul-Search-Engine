			<h4 class="headerleft">
				Overview
			</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				Now that the Disaster Management Team members and the various Departments have been 
				established, the actual Business Continuation Plan development can begin.  Each Department 
				develops a Departmental Plan and addresses the following major issues:
			</p>
			
			<ul>

				<li>Objectives</li> 
				<li>Plan Organization </li>
				<li>Staffing Requirements</li>
				<li>Necessary Supplies</li>
				<li>Critical Equipment</li>
				<li>Telephone Lists</li>

			</ul>
			
			<p class="body">
				Once each Department completes their Plan, the Plan is submitted to the Disaster 
				Management Team for review and completion.
			</p>
			
			<h4 class="headerleft">
				Objectives
			</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				The primary objectives of the Plan are restoration of academic operations, mitigation 
				of damage, and the safety of students, faculty and staff.  Everyone needs to keep these 
				objectives in mind throughout the drafting of the Business Continuation Plan.
			</p>

			
			<h4 class="headerleft">
				Plan Organization 
			</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				Each Department will need to organize its Plan to identify the activities to be performed 
				during each of the following time frames:
			</p>
			
			<ol type="A">
				<li>Continual Readiness</li>
				<li>Pre-Disaster
					<ul class="sublist">

						<li>Watch Period</li>
						<li>Warning Period</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Disaster Impact</li>
				<li>Post-Disaster Recovery
					<ul class="sublist">
						<li>Immediate</li>

						<li>Intermediate</li>
						<li>Long Term</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p class="body">
				It is important to consider the different risks to which the college is exposed and 
				to make appropriate continual modifications to the Plan.  For example, for hurricane 
				planning, some Departments may require more time to prepare than the 24 - 36 hours 
				watch period issued by the National Weather Service for hurricanes.  On the other hand, 
				many disasters (accidents, earthquakes, etc.) strike without warning.  For these disaster, 
				the pre-disaster watch and warning periods do not exist.
			</p>

			
			<p class="body">
				During the actual Disaster Impact period, many normal activities will be suspended.  
				Possibly some effort can be made to minimize damages, such as extinguishing or retarding 
				a fire, shutting down equipment, providing basic security, etc.  However, most efforts 
				will center around safety and appropriate relocation &amp; evacuation procedures.
			</p>
			
			<h4 class="headerleft">
				Staffing Requirements
			</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				Minimum staff levels need to be identified for each critical business function.  Once each 
				Department identifies its primary Post-Disaster activities, it is possible to determine 
				which normal job functions can be deferred for a short period of time.  This will allow 
				more staff to be able to address the most immediate needs in other areas of the college.
			</p>

			
			<h4 class="headerleft">
				Necessary Supplies
			</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				Each Department needs to identify all of its critical business functions and the supplies 
				needed to sustain operation.  Supplies to protect departmental assets also need to be 
				identified and purchased or acquired in advance.  For example, it will be very difficult 
				(probably impossible) to acquire materials to protect computers, buildings, etc. 48 hours 
				before a hurricane strikes.  After the disaster strikes, supplies that are of any value 
				will rapidly vanish.
			</p>
			
			<h4 class="headerleft">
				Critical Equipment
			</h4>
			
			<p class="body">

				Each Department needs to identify all of its critical equipment for use not only within 
				their department, but for reallocation and use by other departments to facilitate the 
				protection and recovery of the college.  Procedures to protect these assets also need 
				to be documented.
			</p>
			
			<h4 class="headerleft">
				Telephone Lists
			</h4>
			
			<p class="body">
				Detailed telephone lists are a crucial part of the departmental plan to be transmitted to 
				the Disaster Management Team.  We identified a number of instances after the Northridge 
				Earthquake and Hurricane Andrew where important telephone numbers were not available when 
				a Department was unavailable to report.
