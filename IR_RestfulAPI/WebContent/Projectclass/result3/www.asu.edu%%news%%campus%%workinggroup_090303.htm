      <p>September 3, 2003</p>
      <h2>Working Group continues to evolve</h2>
      <p>Last year ASU, already one of the nation's largest universities, experienced
        an enrollment increase of some 5,000 students. As ASU increasingly becomes
        the school of choice for Arizona students, enrollment figures are climbing
        again for the coming year, with significant increases expected on the
      Main, West and East campuses.</p>
      <p>To manage this extraordinary enrollment
          growth, the university intends to build out the West, East and Downtown
          campuses, which will give ASU
        a true multi-campus single university complexity.</p>
      <p>In the last year, the university launched one of the largest building
        campaigns in its recent history with construction under way or shortly
        to begin on the first buildings of the Arizona Biodesign Complex, the
      new School of Life Sciences building and residence halls.</p>
      <p>ASU has also
        increased its commitments to improved student services, assisting regional
        economic development and providing greater social
      outreach, particularly in the area of pre-K-12 education.</p>
      <p>Consequently,
        as the university's new administration moves into its second year, President
        Michael Crow has made several modifications to the President's
      Working Group, the senior academic and administrative officers.</p>
      <p>Following
        a successful national search, Juan Gonzalez was named to the vacant vice
        president for Student Affairs post. Gonzalez, who had been
        vice president for Student Affairs at Georgetown University, will focus
        on campus life, residential life, student wellbeing and health and other
      areas that impact student success and overall experience.</p>
      <p>The position
        of associate vice president for Student Affairs was eliminated, and James
        Rund, who had held that post, will now lead the new Office
        of University Undergraduate Initiatives as vice president for University
        Undergraduate Initiatives.<br>
        Rund will have crosscutting responsibilities, working closely with all
        administrative areas to manage enrollment growth, selective admissions,
      diversity and achievement at the school level on all ASU campuses.</p>
      <p>To
        focus university resources on bolstering Arizona's public schools, Eugene
        Garcia, dean of the College of Education on Main Campus, was given
        the additional responsibilities of vice president for university-school
        partnerships, a new part-time position that also is part of the President's
        Working Group. In this university-wide role, Garcia will ensure that
      all segments of ASU are engaged in these vital pre-K-12 efforts.</p>
      <p>President
        Crow has also made an addition to his office staff, appointing James
        O'Brien senior advisor to the president. O'Brien will be responsible
        for implementing complicated strategic and tactical objectives of the
        Office of the President and will serve as a bridge between the president's
      office and the rest of the university.</p>
      <p>O'Brien was most recently senior
        attorney at Electronic Data Systems Corporation in Ames, Iowa. He also
        served as corporate counsel to Unigraphics
        Solutions, Inc., and Engineering Animation, Inc., and was in private
        legal practice with the firm of Dickinson, Mackaman, Tyler &amp; Hagen
        P.C., all in Iowa. He was a policy analyst in the Office of Science &amp; Technology
        Policy at Iowa State University and a research analyst in the Iowa State
        House of Representatives. He has also worked for the U.S. House of Representatives.
        He received his B.A. with distinction from Iowa State and his juris doctorate
        from the Drake University School of Law.<br>
