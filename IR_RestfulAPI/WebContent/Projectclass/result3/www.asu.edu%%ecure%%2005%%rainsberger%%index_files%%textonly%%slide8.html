        <p>These are the categories of information that are not subject to FERPA.  "Sole possession notes" will be covered shortly.  Law enforcement unit records are those records created by a law enforcement unit, for a law enforcement purpose, and maintained by the law enforcement unit.  Any of these records that are shared with another school official become subject to FERPA. </p>
        <p>Employee records: If a student is also an employee of the institution, those employment records of that person are not subject to FERPA.  However, those records created for an employment purpose by  the fact that the person is a student is an education record.  The most common examples of these kinds of records are graduate assistant/work-study records.  Doctor-patient privilege records: Those records made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in their professional capacity or assisting in a paraprofessional capacity in the treatment of a student. These records are only to be disclosed to those providing treatment to the student.  "Treatment" does not include any remedial educational activities or activities that are part of the educational program of the institution.  Alumni records are those records created by an institution after the student has left the institution.</p>
