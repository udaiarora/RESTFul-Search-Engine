      <div align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I can't remember 
          when I last had my prescription," she said. That is not such an unusual 
          statement in a busy pharmacy. But, imagine that the year is 2007, and 
          watch what happens next. After obtaining the patient's name, the pharmacist 
          replies, "I'm showing last October, let's take a look." The attractive 
          lady patient steps closer and opens her blouse slightly, revealing a 
          faded tattoo just above the swell of her right breast. He sees a smiling 
          cupid, just about the size of a quarter, barely visible. "Sure enough," 
          says the pharmacist, "those little guys just don't last much more than 
          eight months. Have a seat and the artist will be with you in a minute." 
          </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a matter of minutes 
          a tattoo artist applies a new tattoo using a template containing a precise 
          amount of micro-encapsulated hormones bound to the inks. She knows that 
          she will not get pregnant in the next eight to ten months. If she forgets 
          the date, she can look in the mirror and see if the bio-degradable inks 
          have faded to obscurity, signaling expiration of her protection. The 
          tattoo is effective almost anywhere on the body, so a cupid on a buttock 
          or inner thigh could be selected as a more discrete location. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A little far-fetched 
          perhaps, but contraceptive tattoos are only one of the conceivable new 
          methods of reproductive health products that we may see in the future. 
          As medical technologies advance, so too will the sophistication and 
          effectiveness of both contraceptives and disease-preventing methodologies. 
          Many of the new products will simply be refinements of currently available 
          products, others will couple current therapies with new drug delivery 
          vehicles, and, of course, there will be brand new ideas and discoveries 
          that will make sex safer and more fun. Contraceptive methods will improve 
          and the prevention of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) will be a 
          major target of research and development. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One currently available 
          contraceptive method that is not widely used is the post-coital contraceptive 
          (PCC) or "morning after" pill. This is simply two double doses of a 
          particular strength of birth control pill, usually Ovral(TM), taken 
          12 hours apart, within 72 hours of intercourse. Although not recommended 
          for routine use because of side-effects, this is effective contraception. 
          Currently, no pharmaceutical company lists this use in the prescribing 
          literature for any product. Most women's health practitioners are well 
          aware of PCC and there is hope that some manufacturer will be brave 
          enough to pursue a more specific drug product for this purpose. It would 
          not be difficult to develop a single tablet that would deliver the correct 
          amount of medication while avoiding the stomach upset that usually occurs 
          with this regimen. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is plenty 
          of room for improvement in the area of implanted or injected contraceptives. 
          It's a safe bet that other pharmaceutical companies are trying to find 
          better alternatives to Wyeth's Norplant(TM) and Upjohn's Depo-Provera(TM). 
          We'll most likely see an implant the size of a match head rather than 
          Norplant's match sticks. Five years is probably the longest time suitable 
          for a contraceptive implant, so that probably won't change. As doses 
          and devices get smaller we'll see fewer and fewer side-effects. The 
          same should be true for "depot" medications, such as Depo-Provera. There 
          have been some new progestational drugs developed recently, and either 
          these or similar agents might be adapted to an injectable "depot" form. 
          It is possible that we will see an injectable contraceptive that would 
          last a full year. Potential patients would be first tested or "challenged" 
          with a shorter acting dose of the medication to detect and minimize 
          adverse reactions. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now let's suppose 
          that our tattooed lady is concerned about HIV exposure. That's certainly 
          something that could take the fun out of a sexual encounter. She simply 
          goes over to the feminine hygiene counter and purchases Lidakol(TM-LIDAK 
          Pharmaceuticals) vaginal gel. Lidakol(n-Docosanol) is a real product, 
          though not yet on the market, currently doing very well in studies on 
          vaginal transmission of the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). SIV 
          is very similar to HIV and studies on humans are planned. Lidakol is 
          also doing well in trials on herpes, and a cream for treatment of herpes 
          will likely reach the market first. This exciting new anti-viral, in 
          a good delivery vehicle, perhaps a bio-adhesive gel, will certainly 
          result in well tolerated, easy to use products for personal use. Even 
          the currently available spermicide, nonoxynol-9, has shown some anti-viral 
          effectiveness. It is only a matter of time before a safe and effective 
          product is brought to the marketplace. You can easily see that a product 
          like this, when used with a condom, would provide excellent protection 
          from both conception and disease. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is, in fact, 
          a bio-adhesive gel containing nonoxynol-9, now on the market. Lake Pharmaceutical's 
          Advantage-24(TM) comes in boxes of 3 or 6 pre-filled vaginal applicators. 
          The gel, developed by Columbia Labs, offers an exciting new vehicle 
          for the application of medications to mucus membranes. The gel seems 
          to form an effective barrier, which, when containing the proper active 
          ingredients may inactive sperm, virii, and even bacteria. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New antibacterials 
          and antivirals may be discovered as a result of research on biologically 
          active agents found in saliva. These substances, present in minute amounts 
          in saliva, seem to protect people from transmission of disease. This 
          mechanism helps to explain why several infecticious diseases are not 
          easily transmitted by kissing. If these substances can be isolated and 
          then synthesized, we will have some new weapons in the fight against 
          disease. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While all of these 
          innovations are happening, the Pill will continue to be widely used 
          as a preferred method of contraception. Here again, technology is aiding 
          in the development of agents that are more specific and more potent. 
          The newer synthetic hormones require doses measured in micrograms, rather 
          than milligrams, and are therefore better tolerated. We'll continue 
          to see the one-a-day dosing but the new oral contraceptives will be 
          superior in safety and effectiveness. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Diaphragms and cervical 
          caps are near the pinnacle of their design now. Simple and effective, 
          they would be hard to improve upon. It is recommended that diaphragms 
          be used with a spermicidal gel and there may be some changes in the 
          type of spermicide used. This barrier method would be greatly enhanced 
          by some mechanism that would prevent the transmission of STDs, such 
          as a bio-adhesive containing bactericides and viricides. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With only minor 
          modification of existing estrogen patches necessary, the contraceptive 
          patch is probably only a few years away. The estrogen patch now in use 
          delivers a therapeutic amount of estrogen in a controlled manner. It 
          is only a short pharmaceutical leap to design a patch to deliver both 
          an estrogen and/or a progesterone in proper amounts to provide effective 
          contraception. Initially, patch technology required applying an estrogen 
          patch twice a week, but with science improving the design, a once weekly 
          patch recently became available. This would be a convenient method of 
          birth control for many women, particularly those who do not like shots, 
          implants, diaphragms, IUDs, or are not good at remembering their daily 
          pill. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is also possible 
          that a contraceptive "vaccine" can be developed that when given to women 
          would cause the production of sperm antibodies. These antibodies would 
          prevent the sperm from fertilizing the egg. One hurdle to overcome in 
          this scenario is how to limit the length of time that this "immunity" 
          would last. Of course, this would again put the burden of contraception 
          on the woman. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whoa! Wait a minute! 
          What about MEN? When are men going to have to remember to take a pill, 
          or put on a patch, or do anything besides carry a condom in their wallet? 
          The answer is soon, at least by the next millennium, which, thankfully, 
          is not too far away. The search for a male contraceptive pill has not 
          been going very well but there is renewed hope. Gossypol, the cottonseed 
          pigment that some thought might be the answer, has proven to be too 
          toxic, causing long lasting sterility and loss of libido in some patients. 
          Scientists are now looking for compounds that will either affect the 
          maturation of sperm cells or somehow hamper their ability to fertilize 
          the egg. These methods are being approached in a variety of ways. One 
          hurdle to overcome is designing agents that will target only the testes 
          or epididymis so that unwanted effects can be minimized. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here's an interesting 
          fact: Sperm need cholesterol to function! Yes, that clogger of arteries 
          is essential to sperm function. In fact, a fairly specific amount of 
          cholesterol must be present for sperm to function effectively. There 
          are other physiological factors such as enzymes and membrane receptors 
          that are also necessary for sperm function. All of these are being studied 
          as possible of sites of action for male contraceptives. Considering 
          that many of these biological processes have counterparts in other organs 
          it is most likely that a localized application of the contraceptive 
          would work best. So, the most likely male contraceptive to be first 
          on the market will be something like SpermBan Scrotal Ointment, or PregNO 

          Scrotal Gel. One application, as little as ten minutes before intercourse, 
          will render sperm, dare I say, impotent. This will most likely be more 
          fun than putting on a condom. This method is also desirable since it 
          would not demand that the female partner trust that the male had remembered 
          to take his pill. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One new drug delivery 
          system recently disclosed by Vivus Inc., a Menlo Park company is MUSE, 
          Medicated Urethral System for Erection. In a study on 234 impotent men, 
          drugs that relax smooth muscle and dilate blood vessels were delivered 
          into the penis via the urethral opening. A tiny plunger device is used 
          to deliver a minuscule pellet of medication which is then absorbed through 
          the mucus lining of the urethra. Over 70% of the men in the study succeeded 
          in having intercourse as a result of this treatment. Perhaps this delivery 
          system could be adapted to deliver spermicidal agents that act only 
          locally. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When a good agent 
          is found that effectively and reversibly blocks sperm function it is 
          also possible that this drug could be incorporated into other drug delivery 
          systems. Alza Corp. already has a scrotal testosterone patch on the 
          market. Testoderm(TM) is indicated for testosterone deficiencies and 
          is applied to dry-shaved scrotal skin and changed every 24 hours. It 
          sounds uncomfortable, but is a valid vehicle for delivery of hormonal 
          agents. If the new "sperm-inactivators" can be made to be site-specific, 
          then men would also be able to wear a contraceptive patch or even a 
          tattoo on a more comfortable area. Of course, if site-specific drugs 
          can be developed, then a birth control pill for men would become a reality. 
          </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Condoms will continue 
          to be the most effective barrier to conception and disease, and continuing 
          research will result in improved efficacy. Recently, the non-profit 
          Mariposa Foundation, in conjunction with UCLA and USC, studied over 
          30 specific condom brands for HIV leakage. The brands that scored well 
          include Schmid's Ramses Non-Lube(TM), Ramses Sensitol(TM), Sheik Elite 
          (now renamed Sheik Classic(TM)), and Circle's Gold Circle Coin(TM), 
          Gold Circle(TM), and Pleaser(TM). More recently, Ramses and Sheik brands 
          scored well in air-burst tests conducted by Consumer's Reports. These 
          tests are an indication of the condom's potential for breakage. It's 
          obvious that we have the technology to manufacture HIV-proof condoms 
          now that are sturdy yet comfortable. We can be sure that production 
          techniques will improve. Schmid recently introduced a polyurethane condom 
          under the name Avanti(TM). Clinical studies are lacking but this new 
          product provides an alternative for people that are allergic to latex, 
          the most common condom material. The future will certainly see the introduction 
          of other synthetic films that can be fashioned into condoms. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is also a 
          female condom now available which is made from polyurethane. This device 
          fits inside the vagina rather than over the penis. The Reality(TM) female 
          condom appears ungainly and peculiar. But, in an informal survey taken 
          at the Student Health Pharmacy at Arizona State University, 7 out of 
          10 women who tried it at least once had favorable comments and would 
          use one again. This is a market niche that will likely see other companies 
          develop their version of this innovative product. Negative comments 
          mostly referred to the condom moving or sliding excessively, while some 
          felt discomfort from the flexible rings built into the product. Healthy 
          competition will lead to new ideas and better, more desirable, products. 
          </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are a variety 
          of other drug delivery systems that might be used for contraceptives, 
          but these seem the most likely to be a part of safe sexual practices 
          in the future. There are already plenty of methods to prevent pregnancy 
          and the future will see a fine-tuning of those presently available. 
          An insulin nasal spray is currently being studied and although it might 
          be possible to deliver contraceptive hormones by this method, it is 
          unlikely that this would be a popular method of birth control. Contraception 
          does not require require daily injections so a nasal spray would be 
          a tremendous advance for diabetics but only a curiosity for family planning. 
          </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Better barriers 
          to prevent transmission of STDs will result from today's research. New, 
          user friendly, bactericides and viricides will find their way to the 
          market-place eliminating, or at least reducing, the worry of contracting 
          an STD, including HIV. Millions and millions of dollars are being invested 
          in the search for these new agents. It's a big market, with about 12 
          million Americans contracting some type of STD each year. There have 
          been and will be disappointments along the way, but eventually science 
          and technology will prevail and safe sex will not be an oxymoron. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One key issue in 
          all of this will be educating the patients/customers in the proper use 
          of all of these new and wonderful tools. The same thing holds true today. 
          This is an excellent practical care opportunity for pharmacists. As 
          patient educators we must be well aware of all of the choices available, 
          their proper use, and, importantly, be available to discuss these products 
          in a professional manner. When not properly used, the pregnancy rates 
          for contraceptives rises in proportion to the level of misuse. That 
          will be one area of importance when marketing these new agents, as well. 
          They must be as easy to use as possible (with clear, easy to understand 
          instructions), have minimal side-effects, and be readily available. 
          Pharmacists can be key players in increasing the level of patient compliance 
          and enhancing the health of their patients. With a high degree of customer 
          awareness future pharmaceutical technology will make sex more enjoyable 
          and eliminate some of the fear and guilt that has become associated 
          with what was once simply an act of love. </font>

professional magazine published by Romaine-Pierson.

        <i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sex is, of course, 
        a touchy subject. I expected to get some letters written and I was right! 
        In later issues of Pharmacy Times, these letters were published:</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>From pharmacist 
          Scott Snively of Beverly, New Jersey:</em> </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In October's issue, 
          the article entitled "A Pharmacist Looks at Safe Sex in the Future" 
          once again shows that the profession of pharmacy is not immune from 
          the ignorance of pop-culture buzz phrases. For us to use the phrase 
          safe sex implies we accept the media's idea that the wearing of a condom 
          and/or other similar methods make the act of sex safe. Nothing is farther 
          from the truth. We know the only safe methods are a monogamous, heterosexual 
          relationship or abstinence. For us to believe otherwise is to put our 
          patients in unhealthy and life-threatening situations. This article 
          boldly promote the advances of medical tehnology while ignoring the 
          moral implications of the need for such drugs and devices. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I absolutely agree 
          we must be compassionate and that we must help to heal and comfort those 
          in need. We are committed to healing the sick regardless of the acquisition 
          of their illness. A cure, however, is no excuse for lack of moral guidance. 
          We must treat the entire person: body, mind, and soul. The author ends 
          by stating, "With a high degree of customer awareness, future pharmaceutical 
          technology will make sex more enjoyable and eliminate<i> the sense </i>(mis-quote) 
          of the fear and guilt that has become associated with what was once 
          simply an act of love." How can sex be any more enjoyable than being 
          in a married monogamous relationship with the one you love - a relationship 
          in which there is no fear or guilt. Guilt and fear are a result of ignoring 
          God's moral laws. Let our profession not promote immorality, but help 
          our patients to understand that an immoral lifestyle leads to emptiness 
          and disease." </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Then, pharmacist 
          Bonnie Brown of Springfield, IL wrote...</em> </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is in regard 
          to the article in the October 1995 issue "A Pharmacist Looks at Safe 
          Sex in the Future." The morning-after pill referred to in the article 
          is an abortion mechanism. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those of us who 
          are Christian do not accept abortion, just as we do not accept the taking 
          of any innocent life. Mr. Labbe makes the comment that there is hope 
          that some manufacturer will be "brave enough" to pursue this pill. In 
          my opinion, the bravery lies in protecting the innocent. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People need to take 
          responsibility for their actions, and if they participate in sex, killing 
          an inncent person (the fetus, which is a living person at the time of 
          conception) is not the answer. Why is it so few people think of abstinence 
          as a method of birth control? </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is important 
          to remember that the mother of each and every person reading this article 
          chose life. Our profession calls us to preserve life, not to end it." 
          </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>My response to 
          pharmacist Snively was printed in a later issue. It read: </i></font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Regarding Pharmacist 
          Scott Snively's letter in the January issue commenting on "A Pharmacist 
          Looks at Safe Sex in the Future;" I think, perhaps, that you are wearing 
          the wrong jacket. You should trade in your white jacket for a black 
          one with a high white collar beneath. Although I appreciate your concern 
          for your patients' souls, I do not believe that as pharmacists we can 
          consider the patient's immorality when seeking preventive and curative 
          measures. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People do have sex 
          outside of marriage. Even people within a happy marriage may wish to 
          avail themselves of some of the protective and contraceptive methods 
          mentioned in the article, for a variety of personal reasons. Do not 
          be so hasty to judge others. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Your letter made 
          me wonder what kind of pharmacy you practiced. I can almost envision 
          a short "morality questionnaire" for patients seeking contraceptives, 
          certain antibiotics, and treatments for AIDS. Treat the patient, care 
          for his soul, but please don't deny good health to him based on your 
          personal moral standards. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The article intended 
          to inform pharmacists and stimulate imaginations, it did not "promote 
          immorality" as you asserted. In fact, it presented hopeful ways to maintain 
          and regain one's health. I encouraged pharmacists to communicate openly 
          with their patients, certainly there are times when a word about the 
          dangers of promiscuity are appropriate, but these patients come to you 
          for your pharmaceutical expertise, not a morality sermon. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Keep your patients 
          healthy, care for their "body, mind, and soul," but let their souls 
          be saved by those committed and trained to do so. </font>
        </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>This response 
          was written before pharmacist Brown's letter appeared, but I believe 
          that my general attitude would remain the same and apply to her more 
          specific and somewhat stronger complaint. However, I should point out 
          that Post Coital Contraception, when initiated very soon after intercourse 
          may, in fact, preclude the very fact of conception. With that said, 
          I would like to return to exploring the science of contraception and 
          disease prevention and let the philosophers and theologians debate the 
          morality of sex.</em> </font>
