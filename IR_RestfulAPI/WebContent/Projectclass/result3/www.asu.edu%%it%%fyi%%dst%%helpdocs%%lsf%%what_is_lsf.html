What is LSF and what are its advantages?
</center></h2>
<p>
LSF or Load Sharing Facility, is a general purpose distributed computing 
system from Platform Computing Corporation.  It unites a group of UNIX 
and NT computers into a single system to make better use of the resources
on a network and in the process integrates hosts from various vendors 
into a seamless system.
<p>
LSF is designed to continue operating even if some of the hosts in the 
cluster are unavailable. One host in the cluster acts as the master, 
but if the master host becomes unavailable another host takes over. 
LSF services are available as long as any one of the host in the 
cluster is up.  When a host crashes, all the jobs running on that 
host are lost and no other pending or running jobs are affected.
<p>
At ASU, LSF is available on the research.asu.edu, stats.asu.edu and
medusa clusters for the purpose of batch processing of user jobs.  
Some of the advantages that users have with LSF are:
<ol>
<li>Submit jobs from one cluster to another.   
<li>Submit jobs and logoff. Then logon at a later time and check 
the status of their job or they can request for an email notification from 
LSF when the job completes.  
<li>Better processing times because of larger system resources in 
terms of CPU, memory and directory-space for application specific temporary 
files on the batch machines because these have LSF.
<li>Better tracking of jobs.
</ol>
<p>
For more information, please refer to the <em>LSF User's Guide</em>
available in the Customer Assistance Center (formerly COMPASS) and
on the main (previous) LSF web page.
